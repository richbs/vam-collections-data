Zain Khan's daughter married Akbar's son, Salim (later the emperor Jahangir, who ruled from 1605-1627). He had a distinguished career, leading the Mughal armies in campaigns against the Afghans, and becoming governor of Kabul in AH 1005 (1596-97) before dying in battle in AH 1010 (1601-02). He was an accomplished musician, and according to a contemporary chronicler was without equal in his talent for \"playing Hindu music\". He was also a calligrapher and poet. This portrait is one of many commissioned by Akbar of his immediate circle at court. It was bought by the museum in 1965 from the Trustees of the estate of Captain E. G. Spencer-Churchill.",
