He is carrying a circular shield of crimson and gold with a silver sun in its centre in his left hand and a gold handled sword in his right.\n\nThis play was adapted from 'Die Spanier in Peru' by the German dramatist August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue by Richard Brindsley Sheridan.\n\nTinsel prints were created from etched portraits of theatrical stars in popular roles they played on the London stage. They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go with each image.",
