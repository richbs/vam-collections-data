The Moscalia were an old, illustrious family in Vicenza and Verona, who obtained entry to the Nobile Consiglio in 1546. The context for which it has been made is unknown, but the appearance of personal arms perhaps suggests that it was used by the owner to call his servants.\nThis bell together with two others in the museum's collection (586-1865 & 470-1899) belong to a group related in shape and style to those produced in Verona by the Bonaventurini foundry.",
