Using Photoshop and digital print media he creates images which fuse fashion, popular culture, politics, and fantasy in a style which has some similarities with the street art aesthetic. This print (and its pair) was made for the V&A Late View event  'Two's A Pair', an outsize version of the Memory game played with picture cards (29th September 2010). Cherry's prints were received too late to be used in the game, so he agreed to donate both prints to the V&A collection.",
