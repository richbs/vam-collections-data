Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is a leading working-class male who would have been a stock character, used in any play requiring an honest workman. His hair and beard are carefully carved, and his face has been painted in a slightly brown colour, as if to indicate that he works out of doors. His right hand has been carved closed to hold props, the other shaped for gesture.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, an expert puppet carver, manipulator and puppet historian, whose widow sold them to the Museum after his death in 1998.\n\nThis marionette was used as Jack Junk in the production of <i>The Floating Beacon</i> which took place at the Theatre Museum in April 2004.",

            "production_note": "It is impossible to identify the precise maker of this marionette since the company made, altered and used figures throughout its career.  It is possible, however, to distinguish distinct types, and therefore groups, made by different makers, due to the type of carving.  The carver of this object has been distinguished as Maker B because of its standard-sized head.",
