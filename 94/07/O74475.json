S., p. 273) assigns to 1831; the catalogue of the Exhibition of British Art, Royal Academy, 1934, gives a dating of 1832-5. But the watermark which shows that it cannot have been drawn before 1833 has apparently not previously been observed. The composition bears a generic resemblance to that of 'The Cornfield' (N.G. 130) and the scene may be a Suffolk one. If this be so, it could only have been drawn from nature during the visits of 1833 or (more probably) 1835.\u201d",

He gave four lectures on 'The History of Landscape Painting' at the Royal Institution in May and June of this year and his last lecture, at Hampstead, on 25 July. Constable died on 31 March 1837. His almost completed painting 'Arundel Mill and Castle' (now in the Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio; see No. 379 [260-1888]) was exhibited posthumously at the Royal Academy.' \n                                 \t\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 233]",
