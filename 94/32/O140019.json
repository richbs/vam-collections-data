Glamorous numbers with exotic dancers were a popular aspect of the light-hearted wartime revues frequently produced at the time at London's Windmill Theatre, in West End theatres, and around the country. Ronald Cobb was something of a specialist in witty designs for show-girls' costumes, and in the early 1950s produced even more elaborate designs for costumes at the London nightclubs Eve's and Murray's Cabaret Club.  \n\nGlamour of the Veils starred Marqueez, the stage name of Marqueez Alkin, an exotic dancer who had previously appeared in several large West End revues including Strike a New Note1943, Strike It Again!,1944, The Night and the Music1945, and Fine Feathers, 1945. The show was produced by John C. Mather, who devised his first show to entertain the Kinross Home Guards in his home town of Kinross, near Perth, Scotland, in 1941.",
