Throughout the late 1940s and 1950s he designed a wide range of clothes that Princess Margaret wore for her official duties. This evening dress is made in a heavy black ribbed silk called grosgrain. It shows the Princess's taste for uncluttered simple lines with the minimum of decoration. Here just the shoulder straps are embroidered with silvered beads and diamant\u00e9s. The skirt is the most important feature. It is constructed in ten panels and finished with bold scallops at the hem. The heavy weight and density of the fabric holds the flared shape of the skirt and its wave-like folds.",

'Material Evidence' in Wilcox, C., ed. <u>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-1957</u> London: V&A Publications, 2007, p. 106 and pl. 4.16\nHartnell designed an elegant black evening dress for Princess Margaret in the early 1950s, made in ottoman silk with a fitted bodice and full skirt that has a scalloped hemline.  Apart from mourning dress, it was unusual for the royal family to wear black.  As Hartnell observed: 'As a rule, ladies of the Royal Family wear light coloured clothes because such colours are more discernible against a great crowd, most of which will be wearing dark everyday colours.'  Princess Margaret gave this dress to the V&A in 1986.\nMendes, Valerie. <u>Black In Fashion</u>. London: V&A Publications, 1999.",
