In 1838 he entered into partnership with Achille Collas (1795-1858) who, two years before, had invented a machine which applied the principles of a diagraph and the pantograph to the reproduction and reduction of sculpture in relief and in the round.  Barb\u00e9dienne started a new career as a bronze founder.  His new firm, under the name  Collas & Barb\u00e9dienne, specialised in antique reproductions and developed new processes for patinations and coloured bronzes.  Their exhibit at the London Exhibition of 1851, which included, reduced to half the size, a reproduction of Ghiberti\u2019s  principal door for the Baptistery in Florence, brought them universal acclaim, and thereafter, their success was assured.  In the latter part of the 19th century the firm of Barb\u00e9dienne became France\u2019s leading manufacturer of artistic bronzes.",
