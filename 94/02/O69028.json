These included two for use in his own home, Tower House in Kensington, London, as shown in contemporary photographs. Burges looked to the arts of China, Assyria, ancient Greece and Rome, and medieval Europe as inspiration for this design. This decanter was made to accompany a drinking cup which the merchant James Nicholson had ordered  in 1863. The cup is now on display in the Silver Galleries of the V&A.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe decanter was ordered by Nicholson through Richard A. Green, whose firm appears to have been largely concerned with the manufacture of jewellery. Green did not make the decanter, though he probably supplied the expensive and unusual decorative embellishments, such as the hardstones, ancient Greek and Roman coins, and the large, rare piece of mother-of-pearl which forms the lion's head on the handle. The maker was the silversmith Josiah Mendelson. A surviving bill indicates that Green was paid \u00a348 6s 8d for the decanter, and a further 8s 6d for a case.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThere can be no more handsome example of the work of William Burges, perhaps the most inventive and exuberant designer of the mid-Victorian period, than this richly ornamented and stylistically eclectic decanter. Burges looked to the arts of China, Assyria, ancient Greece and Rome, and medieval Europe as inspiration for the design. The most antiquarian of the exponents of the High Victorian Gothic, Burges used an exotic array of materials, from genuine antique coins and intaglios to coloured glass and gemstones to create his opulent and dramatic effect.\nThe piece was ordered by James Nicholson through Richard A. Green, whose firm appears to have been largely concerned with the manufacture of jewelry. As a retailer, Green would not have made the decanter, though he probably supplied the expensive and unusual decorative embellishments, such as the semiprecious stones, Greek and Roman coins, and the large, rare piece of mother-of-pearl which forms the lion's head on the handle. The maker was the silversmith Josiah Mendelson.\n\nLit. V&A, 1952, no. J6; Wardle, 1963, plate 158; Mordaunt Crook, 1982, no. C47\n\nANN EATWELL",
