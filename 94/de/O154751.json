This costume is basically a cardigan and skirt, but sophistication is hinted at in the bold spotted bow and wide collar.   The pared-down, slim line was suitable for both the 1970s, when the play was produced, and the 1930s, when it was set.   In designing period plays, designers rarely slavishly copy historical clothes, but subtly adapt them to suit the  eyes of a modern audience.  They also have to keep in mind the actress for whom they are designing, especially a star like Vanessa Redgrave, and this costume is eminently suitable for her tall, essentially English looks.",
