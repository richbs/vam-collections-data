            "public_access_description": "This engraved iron Ethiopian handcross formerly belonged to Captain Tristram Charles Sawyer Speedy (1836-1910). It was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by his goddaughter in 1936. Speedy was an army officer and colonial official. In 1860 he travelled to Ethiopia to assist the emperor Tewodros II (Theodore) with military training. Speedy returned in 1868, this time as civilian interpreter to a British military expedition aimed at releasing British subjects held hostage by Tewodros. The expedition ended with the capture of the emperor's fortress at Magdala, but not before Tewodros had committed suicide. The following death of his wife, Queen Woyzaro Terunesh, left an orphan son, Prince Dejatch Alamayou, to whom the Amharic-speaking Captain became guardian. \n\nIt is unclear how Speedy acquired the cross. In the Ethiopian Orthodox church, crosses have always played an important role as symbols of resurrection and life. This cross would have been carried by a priest. It carries images of the Crucifixion and Ecce Homo on one face and the risen Christ and the Virgin and Child on the other.",
