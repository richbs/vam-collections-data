The body, very shallow (7 cm maximum depth), is of nine ribs of sycamore, and carries a fancy 'lace' with inlaid feathered strings of ivory and ebony.

It is 6.7 cm wide at the edge of the body and it extends to the belly, where it is surrounded by a fruitwood fillet.

Important lute-makers, such as Matteo Sellas (fl. 1610-1661) and Wendelin Tieffenbrucker (fl. 1550 - 1611) are known to have made similar instruments, which probably sounded like a treble lute with stirings added in the bass. This example may have been made in England some time between about 1750 and 1780: the finial at the top of the peg box is similar to those found on English guitars made at about this time.",
