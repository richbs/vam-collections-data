Many of the religious objects were portable, as were the small portraits. They were often made near to the source of the material and then taken elsewhere. \nSt Veronica is shown with a cloth bearing the image of Christ. According to legend, she wiped his face as he passed by with the Cross and the cloth was then miraculously imprinted with his image.\nThe prime function of jets seems to have been to signify that pilgrims had completed their journeys, and reached the shrine of St James (the patron Saint of Spain) at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, which pilgrims did over the course of six hundred years, from the twelfth to the eighteenth century. Many seem to have formed beads of rosaries. In structure jet is a particularly dense type of coal, and can be carved and polished. Medicinal and indeed magical qualities were thought to be inherent in the substance from earliest times. Jet is found in different parts of Europe (as well as North America), but the two richest regions are the Asturias in northern Spain, and Whitby, Yorkshire, in North East England.",
