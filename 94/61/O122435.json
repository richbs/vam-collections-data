            "public_access_description": "Only the ribs of this lute are original, and they were made by Laux Maler, who worked between 1518 and 1552 in Bologna.  He was perhaps the greatest maker of lutes of his day. He worked in partnership with his son Sigismund, and like so many fellow luthiers based in Italy, he was of German origin. Owners of his lutes included the Fuggers of Augsburg (Germany), bankers to the Holy Roman Emperor, and later King Charles I of England, who paid as much as \u00a3100 for his. As late as 1727 Maller was haled by E.G.Baron of Nuremberg as 'without doubt one of the oldest and best masters'. Owing to its size, this instrument is thought to have been tuned three semitones below the standard tuning (i.e. E instead of G) and to have played in an ensemble rather than solo. The lute was made of maple, which is an excellent tone-wood and considerably cheaper and more functional than ivory.  Given this choice of material, it is likely that the lute was made for a professional rather than princely player.",

The neck, peg-box and soundboard were added in about 1967, before being put on display in the New Musical Instrument Gallery in 1968.\n\nHistorical significance: Laux Maler (d. 5 June 1552) was a highly succesful German lute maker, who worked with his son, Sigismund, in Bologna from about 1518 and is estimated to have produced up to 4,000 lutes. Owners of his instruments included the Fugger family, bankers to the Holy Roman Emperor, whose 1566 inventory refers to an \"old but good lute by Laux Maler\" (<i>Eine alter gute Lauten von Laux Maler</i>), and King Charles I of England, who acquired one for the large sum of \u00a3100. This instrument is made up of eleven ribs, a characteristic associated with his son, Sigismond. By the 17th century, the ribs had become narrower and their number had multiplied, giving the bodies a less polygonal and more rounded shape. Therefore Laux Maler's lutes appeared to E.C.Baron, writing in 1727, to be 'flat and broad-ribbed', a shape that was then being revived by J.C.Hoffman in Leipzig.",

(Although ladies did play lutes, there were those who considered keyboard instruments more suitable as they were thought less likely to give them round shoulders!) The size of this instrument indicates that it would have been played about three semitones below the standard tuning and most likely used in <i>continuo</i>  - i.e. in an ensemble of musicians - rather than solo playing. Maple is an excellent tone wood for stringed instruments, and the plain but well-assembled quality of the ribs indicates that this instrument was originally made for a professional musician rather than a prince, who would as likely have used ivory.\n\nBefore about 1550, the finest Lute Music was composed in Italy, and perhaps the most famous amongst them was Francesco da Milano (1497 - 1543), known as 'Il Divino'. At that time, Bologna was reputed to make the finest lutes, and the greatest makers from that city, Laux and Sigismund Maler and Hans Frei, were of German origin.",
