Webster individualizes each character and contrasts each member of the group 'before and after' the excursion; for example, the youngest child is first out of the door riding its 'hobby-horse', but, tired out, is last home, while the eldest daughter has brought home a young man.",

Chorister in Chapel Royal, entered RA Schools 1821, winning gold medal 1824. In a long and successful career, exhibited 83 works at the RA between 1823 and 1879, 39 at the BI 1824-44, and eight at the SBA 1825-34. Early pictures were portraits and historical subjects, but following success of 'Rebels Shooting a Prisoner' (showing children at play) 1827, specialised in similar scenes, and of school and village life, comparable to those of Wilkie and Mulready. Influential and much admired, they became popular through engravings. Elected  ARA 1840, RA 1846, and Honorary Retired RA 1876. \nContributed illustrations to the Etching Club's 'Deserted Village', 'Songs of Shakespeare' and 'Etch'd Thoughts' (1841-4). Moved to Cranbrook, Kent, 1856; senior member of the Cranbrook Colony of painters. Died Cranbrook 23 September 1886; his studio sale was at Christie's 21 May 1887. \nLIT: Art Journal 1855, pp293-6, 1862, p138, 1866, pp40, 330, 1886 \npp351-2 (obit); Athenaeum 2 October 1886, p439 (obit); The Times 24 September 1886 (obit); DNB\n\n\nGoing to the Fair\n FA220 Neg 62894 \nPanel, 55.9 X 76.1 cm (22 X 30 ins) \nSigned and dated 'T Webster/1837.' on stool br Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nWith its companion 'Returning from the Fair' (see FA221 , below) painted for a Mr Flood, and exhibited at the BI in 1838, its size including frame given as 35 by 43 inches in the catalogue. The critic of the Examiner thought 'Mr Webster never painted anything better ... it is a sketch true to nature, firmly painted and full of character'.
