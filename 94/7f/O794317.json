As a contemporary and associate of Inigo Jones, he worked particularly on interior decoration. This series of frieze designs reflect Pearce\u2019s taste. Originally published in 1640, this edition is a posthumous reproduction from 1668, ten years after the artist\u2019s death. Like Jones, Pearce believed that buildings should be constructed with strong, masculine exteriors and rich, elaborate interiors. This mix of architectural and florid design is evident throughout the frieze series. Putti drape themselves across bundles of fruit alongside solid architectural frames. During Pearce\u2019s career, Richard Symonds praised him for having the best grasp on perspective of any British artist of the day. This too is evident in the series, and through attentive shading and positioning of various decorative elements, Pearce creates a sense of depth, even in a limited space.",

In fact, work by Dr. Gordon Higgott of English Heritage suggests that many of the drawings for the House originally attributed to Jones were actually Pearce\u2019s work (2012). These drawings and images of the room give an idea how the design elements in Pearce\u2019s frieze were implemented as three-dimensional decoration. E3622-1907 in the V&A collection is another state of the engraving.",
