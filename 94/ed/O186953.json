It is embroidered in diagonal stripes running from lower right to upper left. The pattern is slightly disrupted by the seams, but there are three stripes:\n[1] narrowest: blue ground with a fine meandering line with pointed buds in blues or pinks;\n[2] wider: silver ground with a solid coiling stem in a chevron pattern in shades of blue and 'Tudor' roses in dark red or pink;\n[3] widest: pink and silver ground with curving pink leaves and a blue chevron stem linking an elongated stylized iris with a blue rosette. \nMetal Thread: in band [3] it is silver strip open S-wound on a pink silk core couched with pink silk; in band [2] it is silver strip open S-wound on a white silk core couched with white silk.\nThe couching has been worked through a backing of plain weave cotton.\nEmbroidery Thread: Silk, 2S: white, dark green, blue, light blue, light pink, dark red, black and very, very light green.\nBorder: pieced; bias-cut. There are two predominantly yellow, densely patterned fabrics: [1] irises, bird, pink blossoms, 2 blue blossoms; [2] two small pieces, pink flower and a small pale quadruped.",
