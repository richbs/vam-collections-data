Apart from his numerous political and military activities he made the city of Rimini into an important Renaissance centre for art, science and learning.\nHe was one of the first to realise the propaganda potential of medal-art and commissioned Pisanello to make some 15 medals.\nHe has been represented as one of the most disreputable but highly cultured rulers of the Renaissance. Burkhardt wrote: 'Unscrupulousness, impiety, military skill and high culture have been seldom so combined in one individual as in Sigismondo Malatesta'.\n\nThe medallist Matteo de\u2019 Pasti of Verona is first heard of in Venice, where he was working for Piero di Cosimo de\u2019 Medici on illustrations of the Triumphs of Petrarch.\nHe settled at Rimini in 1446 and married Lisa Baldegara and rose to honour in the court of Sigismondo Malatesta and aqcuired lands in Rimini in 1451. He made numerous medals of Sigismondo Malatesta.\nHe was the most accomplished among the immediate followers of Pisanello, although how far he was actually associated with him is a matter of conjecture. His versatility was considerable and his reputation ranged from architect, sculptor, painter and illuminator to medallist.",
