Christ's hands bear the distintive marks of the nails used to support his body on the cross.  He has a cruciform halo, and wears a plaited crown of thorns. The angel on the right is shown in profile and moving forwards, his right hand on Christ's shoulder, his left on Christ's chest. The angel on the left supports Christ's head with his right hand, and presses his left hand in a gesture of grief against his face. Both wear loosely flowing robes. In very low relief in the background are three lamenting angels. The scene is recessed into an integrally-carved foliated border.",

However, the absence of the side wound, made all the more telling by the distinctive wounds in the hands that refer to Christ being nailed to the cross, and the languid treatment of the torso suggest that the relief dates to a later period.  There was a particular interest in the sculpture of the quattrocento around the 1530s and the relief was possibly created as an homage to the great master in around 1520-50.",
