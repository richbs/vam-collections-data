            "public_access_description": "This bronze representing Geometry and Astrology was acquired as a known forgery by Joubert (possibly Felix Andre\u00e9 Joubert), dating from the 19th or early 20th century (ca. 1896-1934), after a terracotta by Giambologna or one of his followers, which had been acquired by the Museum in 1937 (inv.no. A.110-1937).\nIn addition to producing fresh ideas, artists often looked at existing works, both contemporary and antique. Sometimes they adapted them in other materials and on a different scale. Giambologna worked out his designs in wax and clay models which his assistants then used to create the finished work in bronze or marble. His style influenced many European sculptors and this model was reproduced in bronze by workshops other than Giambologna\u2019s own. Giambologna  was a Flemish sculptor, active in Italy. Born and trained in Flanders, he travelled to Italy in 1550 to study the masterpieces of Classical and Renaissance sculpture. On his way home, he visited Florence (c. 1552) and was persuaded to settle there under the patronage of the Medici dukes, eventually becoming their court sculptor.",
