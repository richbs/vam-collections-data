He travelled through India during the 1950s and 60s and  took  a series of photographs which document temples and the busy life in and around the temple sites. In his images Monaco manages to capture people worshipping and performing ritual ceremonies within the temple complex and beyond without being intrusive.",

In a letter written to the museum after Frank Monaco\u2019s death in 2007, his nephew, Oliver Morse wrote:\n\n\u2018We believe that Frank visited India 16 times during the last 25 years of his life. His papers show that he went there for two weeks in February 2004, and we think that this was his final visit. From the 1950s up until about the year 2000 his camera of choice was the Leica. This remained his favourite camera, but in about 2000 he also started using a digital camera. At this time he also took with him on his trips a second separate digital camera loaded with colour film. This enabled him to photograph the same scene in colour within the same 5 minute period\u2026.\u2019\nLetter dated January 15th 2008 is in the Registered file: 1999/709\n\nIn a further letter dated 19th January 2008, his other nephew, Jonathan Morse, found a list of dates in his diary which he believes were the dates that Frank travelled to India.\n\nThe 19 dates are noted in the Registered file: 1999/709",
