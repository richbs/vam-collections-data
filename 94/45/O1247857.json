            "public_access_description": "Denis Brihat was born in Paris in 1926. After a brief period of study he began working as a commercial photographer, eventually joining the RAPHO agency around 1955. Brihat spent a year in India soon after this and won the Prix Niepice of 1957 for the work he made there. On his return he moved to the remote Plateau des Clapar\u00e8des in the Luberon region of the South of France and began to make work that focussed on an intense engagement with nature \u2013 a theme that has remained central to his practice throughout his subsequent career. During the following decade Brihat\u2019s work was exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts Decoratifs in Paris (1966) and notably at MOMA New York with Pierre Cordier and Jean-Pierre Sudre (1967). After a period of seclusion, Brihat settled in the Provencal village of Bonnieux where he still lives. He was instrumental in the foundation of a number of important academic and experimental photography courses in the area and taught extensively until 1998 when he gave up teaching to focus entirely upon his own work. He has had numerous exhibitions and a number of publications and was awarded the Grand Prix Photographie de la Ville de Paris in 1987.\n\nBrihat began experimenting with photographic processes around 1968, focussing on metal toning and etching techniques. One of these is Mordan\u00e7age which was re-created by Pierre Sudre, having first been used in the late nineteenth-century. The process works by chemically bleaching the print so that it can be redeveloped. The black areas of emulsion are lifted away from the paper, giving the subject a veiled appearance. The emulsion once lifted, can be removed or manipulated depending on the desired outcome. Areas where the emulsion was lifted appear to be in relief as is the case with the images in Le Nez Dans L\u2019Herbe. \n\nLe Nez Dans L\u2019Herbe was made in 1988 and is a set of twelve black and white prints presented as a boxed set with a letter-press printed title page and text at the start. Each image is an intense \u2018birds-eye\u2019 view of a small part of the ground, focussing on a single mass of flowers or plants and leaves. On the title page, Brihat explains the scrutiny with which he has examined his subject as being partly a result of his long-sightedness. He describes how he has applied a gentle chemical etching to the gelatine of the prints to give the images a warmth and richness for the viewer\u2019s enjoyment.",
