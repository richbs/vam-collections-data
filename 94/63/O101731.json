The success of his painting 'Manuelito' in 1909 established him as a sought-after portrait painter, although he craved acceptance for his more imaginative paintings.  This set the pattern for his life: a successful painting would lead to a string of portrait commissions, and his ensuing dissatisfaction with his work.  In 1931, he abandoned painting for sculpture in a desire to develop something more significant, but he later returned to painting, working towards a simplification of form and line to express his vision.   The result was that commissions virtually ceased, although the reception of his 1937 exhibition at the Redfern Gallery, just before his death, encouraged  him to feel that he had found a successful and communicable means of expression.\n\nThis painting is an examples of Philpot's natural inclination towards imaginative and fantastic decorative art.  \u201cCaprice, the Moon Dance\u201d may relate to a charity or fancy dress ball rather than a specific theatrical production.  However, the very theatricality of the presentation and subject makes it a significant example of a particular style of theatrical painting.",
