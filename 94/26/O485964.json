The damask ground is self patterned with geometric designs and some of the Buddhist Eight Auspicious symbols. The jacket is embroidered with white floss silks in satin and pekin knot stitch and gold thread in couched work. The embroidery on the main body shows eight large (8.5 inch, 21.6 cm diameter) roundels containing many different flowers (such as bamboo, orchid, peony and prunus); around them are scattered floral designs.\n\nThe jacket fastens at the side with two gilt buttons and a gilt flower shaped hook and eye. There are slits at the sides. The garment has long and wide sleeves with straight cuffs and a small standing collar. The neck, opening flap, hem and slits are trimmed with decorative borders made of a narrow black satin bias cut band, a blue satin ground band embroidered with medallions and lattice work in white, green floss silk in satin stitches, gold thread in couched work and three narrow warp-patterned ribbons. This border is 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick.\n\nThe jacket is lined with light blue satin.",

The cuff end is decorated with an applied band of embroidery. The style of these sleevebands varies, but they always provide a contrast to the garment either in colour, technique or motifs. Here, although the disparity is evident, white floss silk is used for some of the embroidery adorning the cuffs and for the flowers on the main body of the robe, which gives a visual unity to the garment. This sleeveband , in mid-blue satin, is also embroidered with multi coloured vignettes of animals and birds in seed stitch, a type of knot stitch that adds some depth. The embroidered bands attached to the right and left cuffs do not match each other, the coloured creatures being different on each side. Sleeve bands were created in the domestic sphere as well as in professional workshops. We have no evidence to suggest whether bands were designed for particular robes or whether a ready-made band was chosen to suit the garment. On this robe, in addition to the embroidered band, there are three narrow warp-patterned ribbons and a black satin bias edging.",
