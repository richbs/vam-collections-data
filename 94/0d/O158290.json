There is part of a border along the bottom: indistinct pattern. Above it is a narrow pattern between 2 green lines.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left. These are of dark green and dark red.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground [either unembroidered or the threads have decayed] with a spray of small flowers alternating with an angled stem and red blossom facing the lower left.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs, both have a red ground but it is difficult to see the details of the design. [a] straight stem with 3 light blossoms forming a diamond alternating with a straight stem and a round blossom.\n[b] very indistinct design with lots of small flowers.\n\nThreads: Silk, 2S: dark red/purple, blue, yellow, white, dark green.\n\nBacking: same as the backing on 757-1888. Striped: white ground with a meandering red, blue and white leaves with red and white flowers; red ground with white and blue flowers; blue ground with line of red flowers; very faded yellow ground with line of red flowers.
