The main border is decorated with a series of large arches supported by columns, all worked in metal thread.  Within each arch are four small cypress trees between pairs of larger cypress trees; these are alternately dark or light green. Above the trees is a two-storey domed building, predominantly pink and silver, with silver palm-tree leaves around the roof.\nThe embroidery has been cut and hemmed along both sides.",

The colours of 18th and 19th century embroideries were originally very bright but many have faded to pleasing pastel shades; often great quantities of metal thread were used. Napkins were mainly used to clean fingers during meals, but were also used as decoration and as covers. Their designs were consistently inventive.",
