On the front is printed a typewriter keyboard in white and black on blue; and on the semi circular top front parts with the name in white on black and blue. At the top centre front is the mechanism for producing the type. It has a disc with red plastic band around its outside with the letters of the alphabet in capitals together with numbers and symbols. The top of the disc is metal printed with the\nletters etc. in black on white; in its centre is a circular dial with an arrow to the left side. \nTo select the letter wanted turn the dial so the letter is under the arrow.\nThe disc is support by a black metal block which is hinged to a lever with a dent along its front edge. When the lever is depressed the disc and its block move back against the patten to print the letter. Below the lever is a small lever, partly black but rusty which should operate the space bar. At the back top of the typewriter is the 'patten' made of metal but it does not rotate; the paper is turned by a metal rod which passes through it and has two rubber grips. (left hand knob of this rod is broken). At the front is a metal strip marked with lines and numbers to form the measure. At each side are the clamps for the ribbon to be held with a ribbon and also a bar to help align the paper. Instructions for use are printed on the back of the toy with the name of the machine on the front. At the very front edge is MADE IN GT BRITAIN. The body parts are held with tongues and crimping.",
