However, Cordier is self-taught, and this was the only formal photography course that he attended. Nevertheless, two years earlier, he had conceived of the 'chemigram' process Working like a painter, he replaces the canvas with photographic paper. Changes in shape and pattern are created by introducing what he describes as 'localising' products, including varnish, wax, oil, glue, syrup, egg and other materials. The physical reactions of these layers, often made after repeatedly dipping the paper in developer and fixer, are registered on the photosensitive emulsion. Over many years, Cordier has explored the random patterns and variations of deliberately authored marks produced in the chemigram in a manner suggesting the rigorous sustained enquiry of experimental scientific research. At the same time, his works are aesthetic objects that carry their own visual and technical vocabulary.  \n\nThis is one of many Cordier's works inspired by literature. It is an homage to Georges Perec (1936-1982) a French writer and filmmaker famous for experimental wordplay. His major work, La Vie mode d\u2019emploi [ Life: A User's Manual] (1978), tells the story of a Paris apartment building and its inhabitants. The building's rooms form a 10 x 10 grid, which serves as the underlying structure of the book's narrative. Each apartment is dealt with according to the moves made in the 'Knight's Tour', a chess-based  mathematical problem in which the knight must attempt to visit each square of the chessboard exactly once. While a normal chessboard has a grid of 8 x 8 squares, a 10 x 10 grid complicates the problem yet further. Perec's works, constructed within self-imposed writing constraints, find their counterpart in Cordier's chemigrams, in which random numbers create programmed chance, limiting subjective decisions.",
