This two-part novel details the mock chivalric adventures of the self-declared knight errant and his side-kick Sancho Panza. The novel was popular throughout the nineetnth century in Britain, and was reprinted in several editions. The artist John Gilbert specialised in Quixotic subjects and the collector Henry Spencer Ashbee assembled a large number of works inspired by the novel.  This painting shows the moment (in Part 1, Book 1, Chapter 7) when Don Quixote recruits Sancho Panza as his companion.",

Followed his father's career 1833-36, when he first exhibited at the SBA and became a professional artist. It seems he failed to enter the RA Schools, but took lessons in colouring from George Lance; otherwise he was self-taught. Exhibited 55 works at the RA between 1838 and 1897, 40 at the BI 1837-67, and 23 (including three watercolours) at the SBA. Most were historical or literary subjects. Elected ARA 1872, RA 1876. He was more active as a watercolourist, exhibiting 260 works at the OWS, elected Associate 1852, Member 1854, and President 1871. He was knighted in 1872. In 1884 he refused to sell any more work, and in 1893 gave pictures to the municipal galleries of London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester, for which gift he became the first artist to receive the Freedom of the City of London. He was equally well-known as an illustrator and was extremely prolific; it is estimated he illustrated 150 books (most notably the Howard Staunton edition of Shakespeare (1860) for which he designed 829 illustrations) and magazines, particularly the <i>Illustrated London News</i> for which he is supposed to have produced 30,000 plates. He died at Blackheath 5 October 1897. \n\n\tLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 9 October 1897, pp494-5 (obit); R Davies 'Sir John Gilbert', <i>OWS X</i> (1933) pp 20-43 \n\n<b>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza</b> \n1825-1900 Negs CT8006, HJ592 \nCanvas, 76.1 x 63.5 cm (30 x 25 ins) \nSigned and dated 'J. Gilbert 1840' bl \n\nThe work does not seem to have been exhibited. The subject is taken from Cervantes's novel <i>Don Quixote</i>; for Gilbert's special interest in the book, see 1856-1900, below. The relevant passage is from part 1 book 1 chapter 7: \n\nAbout this time, Don Quixote tampered with a labourer, a neighbour of his, and an honest man, but very shallow-brained. He said so much, used so many arguments, and promised him such great matters, that the poor fellow resolved to serve him as squire. Among other things, Don Quixote told him he should dispose himself to go with him willingly, for some time or other such an adventure might offer, that an island be won in the turn of a hand, and he be left governor thereof. \n\nThis is the beginning of the famous association between the Don and Sancho Panza. \n\nEXH: <i>Victorian Narrative Paintings</i> V&A circulating exhibition 1961\"\nVictoria & Albert Museum.
