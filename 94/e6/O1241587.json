The mouse is meant to be a representation of Potter tucked up comfortably in bed, eluding to the fact that she enjoyed her stay. She would often travel with her entourage of animals and the children of the family would look forward to seeing which pets accompanied her each visit. \n\nMelford Hall, Suffolk, was the home of Beatrix Potter's cousin Ethel Hyde-Parker. Beatrix visited many times as a break from her London family home. \n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
