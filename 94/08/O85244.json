ISBN 1851773088.\nAlthough the Circulation Department acquired contemporary British tableware during the 1950s, what was collected tended to be quite conservative, following types popular in the interwar period. It was not until the mid-1980s that highly styled and thoroughly contemporary 1950s tableware - like Ridgway's \"Homemaker\" series - was actively collected by the Museum. This pattern, designed in 1957 by Enid Seeney and retailed exclusively through Woolworth's, is an amusingly self-referential 1950s design. Depicting a range of contemporaneous furniture and domestic objects, \"Homemaker\" provided an instant style guide for the period. Ironically, the \"Metro\" shapes used for \"Homemaker\" do not have nearly the vitality and fifties flamboyance of the items depicted on them. The success of the pattern had a great deal to do with the fact that it appeared stylish and contemporary but was very cheap to produce by virtue of its transfer-printed decoration. For the more complex shapes such as the coffee pot, the large transfer print that would be used whole for the plates was simply cut into pieces and applied around the pot.\n\nALUN GRAVES",
