            "public_access_description": "These toys were made early in David Jones\u2019 career, during the period he spent at the Guild of St. Joseph and St. Dominic, a group of Catholic craftsmen, in Ditchlin, Sussex.\nThe toys are probably the result of Jones\u2019 lessons in woodwork by fellow Guild member, George Maxwell, coach builder and carpenter.\nThe village follows the German toy tradition of sets of tiny buildings still popular at this time. However, it was perhaps also based on the village of Ditchling itself, (see below). The architecture of the building looks back to the Middle Ages, a period in history which we know interested Daveid Jones at this time.\nThe four puppets are particularly interesting because we know that they were probably based on Eric Gill\u2019s children, Elizabeth, Petra ( who was at one time engaged to Jones), Joanna, and his adopted son, Gordian, (see right). There were many other children living within the Guild who may have enjoyed these toys. \nDavid Jones was best known as a wood-engraver, painter and writer. He is also remembered for his skills in lettering, and an example of his work can be seen in the photograph of the artist (above).\n He met Eric Gill ( 1882- 1940), the engraver, in 1921 and was impressed by the work of the Guild which Gill had founded that year. The two artists became close friends and David Jones worked within the Guild for about four years. Eric Gill\u2019s engraving (right) shows the chapel where the craftsmen met four or five times a day for prayers whilst making their living by their various trades, from metal-work to wood-carving.",
