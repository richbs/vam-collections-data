            "history_note": "Jan de Bisschop (1628-1671), also known as Johannes Episcopius, was a Dutch painter and printmaker. He first studied to be become a lawyer but then abandoned the profession in order to study art with Bartholomeus Breenbergh (1598 c.-1657 c.), a Dutch painter specialising in Italianate landscapes. In 1656 de Bisschop took part in the foundation of the Confrerie Pictura, a club of artists, in The Hague. \nHe was particularly interested in the teaching of art and this resulted in his making two series of prints based on classical statues and on sixteenth and seventeenth century artists for students to draw from. The first of these suites is the Signorum Veterum Icones which was published by Nicolaes Visscher in two parts in 1668 and 1669 while the Paradigmata Graphices variorum artificum in 1671. The two volumes of the Icones were subsequently published in one single edition, together with the Paradigmata. The Icones comprises of a suite of 100 plates of reproductive prints of sculptures, including a large number of well known statues of the Greek and Roman period. The second suite, the Paradigmata, consists of 57 reproductive plates of paintings and sculptures by Italian and Dutch sixteenth and seventeenth century artists. \nThe object was acquired by the Museum along with eight other prints from the same book (Museum numbers 23908.1-23908.3).     \nThe Allegory of the Sculpture by Battista Lorenzi del Cavaliere was designed as part of Michelangelo\u2019s tomb in the Church of Santa Croce, Florence in 1560. Michelangelo was one of the most highly regarded artists and sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. It is appropriate that de Bisschop chose to reproduce this allegory of sculpture for the title page for the Signorum Veterum Icones, which intended to be a repertory of statues for young artists to study.",
