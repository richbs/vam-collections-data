Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography.\n\nThis photograph was taken during a trip to New York organised by the author Hendrik Willem Van Loon, who supported Bing and facilitated a solo show at the June Rhodes Gallery in 1936. Bing was well-received and met the photographer Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), who introduced \u2018a new world\u2019 to her. The starkness of this composition contrasts to her warm feelings about New York at this time. The off-centre composition and concentration on geometric shapes is typical in Bing\u2019s work of this period.",
