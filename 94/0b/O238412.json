During this time he shared lodgings with with the painter and etcher, Heywood Sumner, who introduced him to Burne-Jones who in turn introduced him to William Morris.  Benson became a close associate of Morris who encouraged him to establish a small workshop for the production of turned metalwork which he did in 1880.  However, unlike Morris, Benson fully accepted the implications of mechanical production and designed exclusively for it.  He prospered by manufacturing an extensive range of oil and electric light fittings and household utensils in copper, brass and electroplate.  Shortly after starting his business, he expanded by building a factory in Hammersmith and in 1887, he opened a shop in Bond Street with the facade designed by himself.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, the factory was made over to the production of aircraft parts for the newly formed Royal Flying Corps.  At the cessation of hostilities in 1918, Benson never really recovered interest in his original business and on his retirement in 1920, the firm went into voluntary liquidation.",
