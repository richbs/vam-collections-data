The table was made in Murshidabad, the nawabi capital of Bengal. It was a famous centre of ivory carving where ivory workers sometimes made furniture for European customers.  The carving on the legs is taken directly from plate two of The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing Book (1793) by Thomas Sheraton.",
