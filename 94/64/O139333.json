            "public_access_description": "This style of suit was initially known as a 'Zhongshan suit' after Sun Zhongshan (Sun Yat-sen), President of the Republic of China for a brief period in 1912. Sun Yat-sen first developed this suit as a form of national dress that would embody modern values as well as a notion of equality and uniformity in the newly established Chinese Republic.\n\nIn its original design the suit had six centre front buttons and upper and lower slit pockets and a waisted back section with a vent, the collar was a high stand up collar. The design later developed during the republican era to incorporate elements of military dress, including a turned down collar and four symmetrically placed pockets. When Mao Zedong became leader of the People's Republic of China in 1949, this type of suit was adopted as the national uniform of the people. It was widely worn by the Chinese population from 1949-1976 and as a result this style of suit is now most commonly known as a 'Mao Suit'. The suit came in a range of colours including grey, mustard yellow, brown and navy blue.",
