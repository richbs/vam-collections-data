            "public_access_description": "The LCM ('Lounge Chair Metal') chair is one of the earliest designs for furniture by Charles and Ray Eames and is one of their purest.  This is a lower, lounging version of a taller chair intended for sitting at a table (called the DCM chair, or 'Dining Chair Metal').  Using a descriptive acronym for the object's title was typical of the no-nonsense, rational approach to design of the Eameses, but this chair also shows how they incorporated ideas from contemporary abstract art too.  The  rhomboidal elements that make up the seat and back seem to float in air because the visual effect of the slender, chromed metal frame is so slight. The form of the chair recalls the mobiles and paintings of Jean Miro and Alexander Calder. The LCM chair was part of a range based on furniture first shown in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, called 'New Furniture Designed by Charles Eames' in 1946. The exhibition's title reflected the way Ray Eames's contribution to the designs was overlooked until relatively recently. The Herman Miller company picked up many of the designs from this exhibition, and the LCM chair entered production in 1947.",
