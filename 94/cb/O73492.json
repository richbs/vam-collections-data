The neck is separated from the body with a moulding shaped as a twisted cord. Additionally a much narrower rib is moulded on to the narrowest section of the neck, it has a chamfered edge making it unique compared to other specimens of this type. Hemispherical knobs are moulded on to the neck close to the opening, reminiscent of Sasanian-style silver ware from Tabarestan.\nBody decorated with lotus buds in high relief emphasised by narrow mouldings, arranged in three rows of eight.  This is a common motif in all media in the Samanid period.\nThe base was missing prior to acquisition by the Museum. \n Patina is dull green varying from emerald to greyish green.",
