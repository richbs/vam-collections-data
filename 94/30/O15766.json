It is part of the Lal Qila (Red Fort) in Delhi, completed in 1648. The hall was where the Mughal emperor met with the highest-ranking officials of his court. \n\nThe practice of painting on ivory in India has a long history. However, Indian artists only began to paint large numbers of portraits on ivory in the 18th century, as a result of British influence. At this time a number of professional British miniaturists visited India, and their work reintroduced the technique to Indian artists. Painting on ivory was especially popular in Delhi and reached its peak during 1840 to 1880. The enormous output of paintings on ivory during these years was clearly intended for the British market. They therefore fall into the category of Company Paintings, named after the East India Company.",
