The new setting was made by Phillips Brothers of Cockspur Street in about 1870. The firm held a royal warrant as jewellers to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VII (1841-1910).\n\nAncient heads and mythological scenes, such as the sacrifice on this intaglio, were copied or adapted from antique gems.
