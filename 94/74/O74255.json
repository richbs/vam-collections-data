The face is gold with red lips, white eyeballs and black pupils and eyebrows. The tightly-curled hair is dark blue.\n\nThe Buddha's legs are crossed in the lotus or diamond posture and he is seated on a double-petalled lotus throne (padmasana). His lowered right hand (bhumisparsha mudra) records the moment just prior to his enlightenment as he called the earth to witness his worthiness to achieve liberation. He is wearing a robe which appears transparent, being only indicated at the edges. He bears the other main marks of Buddhahood (laksanas) including the cranial bump or ushnisha, the mark between the eyes (urna) and the eight-spoked 'Wheel of the Law' (dharmachakra) on the palms of the hands and the soles of his feet.\n\nThe solid lotus base is separate from the figure and is inscribed round the bottom with a series of laudatory inscriptions in Tibetan characters.",
