            "public_access_description": "Christian Friedrich Zincke was born in Dresden where he was apprenticed to his goldsmith father. In 1706 the important enameller Charles Boit invited him to London to work in his studio. Thereafter, Zincke remained in London, becoming the most successful enamel painter of his time and employing apprentices who then went on to have success of their own.  \n\nIn the 17th century, new techniques of painting enamels allowed delicate portraits resembling tiny oil paintings to be created. This enamel portraiture in miniature was a truly international art. Many enamellers travelled in order to find new markets, while others migrated to escape religious persecution. Enamel miniatures were first fashionable in continental Europe, but were particularly in vogue in Britain from the 1720s to 1760s. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
