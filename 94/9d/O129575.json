The lid with two recent, reinforcing battens. The front and sides carved with geometrical scrolling stems, bordered on the front panel with narrow borders of geometrical inlay (sections missing), and the back plain. On the reverse of the front panel a fragment of printed paper, apparently 17th century. The bottom of the box apparently replaced using wide, thin pine boards with nailing suggesting the reuse of planed floorboards. An ovolo moulding with carved scrolling stem ornament around the front and sides may have been added when the box (assuming that it was originally an independent object) was fixed onto the stand, thus concealing more external ornament. \n\nThe stand of low table form with a single drawer, with pegged tenon and mortice joints; spiral turned stretchers between legs with square blocks below short sections of spiral turning, and pad feet. The compartment contains a single drawer suspended by a central groove (with visible wear) cut into the sides, on a replaced batten. On the front of the drawer applied mouldings and a central block give the effect of two small drawers. The front is missing two ring handles, with remains visible inside (?) The rear of the table compartment is not as deep as the ends, rendering the back of the drawer exposed, and thus may have been replaced. The oak drawer with a single large dovetail at the front of each side (22mm thick), and the back nailed into the sides. The pine bottoms nailed up.\n\nApplied mouldings above and below the drawer, the lower moulding split on both sides towards the rear.  The whole object has been coated in a dark varnish.",

By tradition it was one of a pair and came from Hatfield House, Hertfordshire. It is said to have been given in 1817 as a wedding gift to the wife of a huntsman and stud-groom working at Hatfield estate - then passed from youngest child to youngest child until it was sold in the 20th century.",

Oak; middle of 17th century'\nNo trace found of manuscript referred to (NH, 11/2006)\n\nFormerly the property of Mrs E.G.Barr (nee Dunham). This chest was in Hatfield House - its fellow is in the Elizabethan Gallery or Room there - this one was a wedding gift from the Countess [sic, actually she was Marchioness] of Salisbury to Mrs. Wilkinson of the Home Farm, Hatfield about 1812. At her demise it passed to her youngest child Harriet Rance Wilkinson afterwards Dunham. At her death her husband James Benjamin Dunham of Hillside, Hatfield held it in trust for their youngest child Edith Gertrude Dunham who became the legal possessor by his will in 1919. The theory of 'from the youngest to the youngest child' became nullified, there being no issue of her marriage. \nThe above is as clear a statement as can be remembered  from my parents' description  and the sale of it is with my consent and the approval of other members of the family.' (signed Edith G. Barr 5/2/1923)\n\nCorrespondence 12/2006 with Robin Harcourt Williams, Librarian and Archivist, Hatfield House, and Mr Henry W.Gray (see letter on green catalogue from which the following is drawn: No \"pair\" to either box or stand exists at Hatfield. John Wilkinson and Sarah Rance were married at Ipswich, 4 December 1817 and by 1819 (if not earlier) John was employed by the first Marquess as huntsman and stud-groom, when their son Henry Rance Wilkinson was baptised. The 1841 census shows the Wilkinsons living at Lawn Barn Farm, and the 1851 census at Home Farm. John died 1858, Sarah 1869. Their second daughter Harriet Rance was born at Hatfield in 1833, and married James Benjamin Dunham in London in 1858. An obituary of Harriet in Hatfield Parish Magazine, Feb. 1912 confirms the close association of the family with the estate: after the death the first Marquis the Dowager continued her activity as a horse-woman into extreme old age, and Mr Wilkinson became her constant personal attendant on these occasions. His widow was for years in charge of the Home Farm and Dairy.\n\nNotes from R.P. 6276\n\nListed on purchase form\nAs \"1 Bible box & stand, with (manuscript) & key/oak; middle of 17th century\".\n\nCorrespondence and memorandum\nRecord confusion regarding negotiations for the purchase of a Jacobean box that failed to reach the owners reserve at Sotheby's.  Allegations that the Museum offered a Mr Barr \u00a3100 for the box are dismissed as a fabrication and Captain Gregson is offered \u00a335 by H.C. Smith.\n\n5/9/23 Minute paper notes of Clifford Smith\ndescribe his observations of the box at Sotheby's\n\"It is a good example of a mid-17th century oak 'bible' box with carved front and sides, on an original stand with a drawer above with turned legs and stretchers\u2026.The box is unquestionably a good piece of oak furniture.  It is in original, untouched condition, and possesses the interesting tradition of having come originally from Hatfield.  I would place its value at about \u00a330.\"",
