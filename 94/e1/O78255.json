Meticulous drawings of plant forms and an understanding of their basic structure were an essential source of ideas for students of design and tested their drawing skills.\n\nPeople\nMackintosh has almost a cult status as a Scottish architect and designer, and his work prefigured many developments in art and design throughout Europe in the 20th century.  In his architectural work Mackintosh had used stylised patterns derived from a careful study of flowers and plants. He was a very skilled artist as well as an architect, and towards the end of his career concentrated only on painting. From 1901 he had made a collection of botanical studies of individual flowers and shrubs, usually sketched during holidays in England.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nAlthough often spare and linear, they have a powerful emotional appeal. Mackintosh took the traditional form of botanical drawing and modernised it.",
