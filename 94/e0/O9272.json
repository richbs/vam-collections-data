(See Helena Hayward, <font -u>Thomas Johnson and the English Rococo</font>, 1964, plate 36.) A chinoiserie figure appears on one of Johnson's designs for girandoles (Hayward, plate 122) and a figure of a peasant in ragged clothes appears in Johnson's design for an overmantel (plate 87). Fountains with a triple cascade of water (plate 94), obelisks (figure 17) and ladders (figure 124) are all characteristic of Johnson's work. Johnson's 1758 book of designs was dedicated to Lord Blakeney, Grand President of the Antigallican Association and sold by Johnson from his premises at 'The Golden Boy' in Grafton Street, St. Ann's Westminster. The book included designs for glass frames, ovals, stands for candles, picture frames, slab frames, an organ, ceilings, chimney peices, brackets for figures, clock cases, girandoles, lanthorns, stands for china, silversmiths, table brackets, stove grates and watch cases.",

            "production_note": "The pier glass was acquired as one of a pair; the other W.23-1949, although similar in style is not a pair as it is considerably wider. \nThis mirror and its companion were attributed to Thomas Johnson by Helena Hayward in 1964 (Thomas Johnson and the English Rococo, p.40). There is evidence that George Cole, upholsterer in Golden Square, Soho, supplied looking glasses and girandoles for Paul Methuen at Corsham Court and the Duke of Atholl at Blair Castle in the early 1760s. These were based on Johnson's designs and probably made in Johnson's workshops.  At this time Johnson found his workshop in Grafton Street too small and took on additional premises at 10 Tottenham Court Road. One of the mirrors made by Johnson for the Duke of Atholl  and supplied by George Cole was originally decorated in white and gold. It would be worth establishing whether George Cole's name occurs in the accounts of the Milbanke family of Halnaby.\nAlternatively, it has been suggested that this could be a revival piece made during the 19th century.",
