A pen plotter is a mechanical device that holds a pen or brush and is linked to a computer that controls its movements.  Pen plotter drawings can be very time consuming to produce.  The artist transferred this image from a plotter drawing into a screenprint which allowed him to produce multiple copies of the image, and was much quicker and more economical.\n\nThis print is from a set of works produced in 1978-1979 known as 'Dimensions I', all of which explore the four-dimensional hypercube.  A hypercube is a geometric form in which all the connecting paths between the points of the cube are charted.  The 4-D hypercube has 32 such possible paths, some of which are shown in this print.  From 1962 until 1999, Mohr worked almost exclusively in black and white, after which he introduced colour, owing to the increasing complexity of his work.",
