Miss Farnell began the company in Acton in London making plush and cloth animals. Farnell established itself as one of the leading manufacturers of teddy bears and registered the Alpha trademark in 1925. Although the factory survived a fire in 1934 and a bombing in 1940, it stopped trading in the 1960s.\n\nThis soft toy is based on the character 'Squawk-A-Boo' designed by Chloe Preston. She was born in 1887 to a British family and had her first book, The Peek-a-Boos, published in 1910. Chloe Preston was an admired artist of books as well as postcards, showing children in a bright decorative sense.",
