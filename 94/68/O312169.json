He signed certain pieces of his work with OPUS MODERNI (opus is the Latin term for 'work' - which then means 'work of the modern'). The modern here is referring to the Ancient World, in contrary to the Naturalism of the Gothic. His earliest works may date around 1485-1490, and his earliest dated work is 1490.\nModerno specialised in small bronze plaquettes exploring religious or antique themes, and catered for a clientele of learned humanists.\nThe Roman general Scipio Africanus, after the defeat of Carthage was offered a beautiful woman called Lucretia as his captive. But when he was told of her betrothal to the Carthaginian Allucius, Scipio nobly returned Lucretia to him and returned the gold sent as ransom by her parents.",
