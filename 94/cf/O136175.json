            "physical_description": "Cupboard door of frame panel construction. \n\nOak. The framework consists of two outside vertical stiles into which are tenoned three horizontal stiles; one at the top, one at the bottom and one in the middle. The horizontal divisions thus formed are each subdivided by two short vertical stiles tenoned into the horizontal stiles. These are arranged to enclose four exterior panels and two central doors. With the exception of the of the upper horizontal stile, all stiles have a wide central recessed moulding, which appears originally to have been ebonized. The inner edges of each stile, with the exception of the upper horizontal stile and those framing the doors, are decorated with a syma recta moulding in some cases extending their full length, in others only part ; showing where the moulding plane has entered. \n   \nThe upper horizontal stile and the corresponding upper ends of the side vertical stiles have at the bottom an applied syma recta moulding above which are applied four consoles (one missing ) positioned above the vertical stiles. Theses consoles are of scrolled outline elaborated by four vertical saw-cuts. Between the outer consoles are applied six dentils of quarter-round profile, and in the centre twelve similar dentils (some are missing ). \nThe two doors have square frames moulded similarly to the stiles previously described. They where originally hung on to concealed pin pivots which have only survived in the case of the upper door ; the lower door has latter \"H\"-hinges of iron. The present handles of both doors are Victorian round bun-handles of black-enamelled iron. The upper door is fitted with a simple lock (probably Victorian) but the original keyplate may survive beneath paint. The lower door is pierced with a hole where the original turned wooden handle fitted. The six panels (four outer in the framework and two in the doors) are pierced with a diaper pattern outlined in two rows of holes.\n   \nThe panels are flat on the front but are bevelled at the edges at the back. Three strengthening struts have been nailed onto the back in various positions. The outer vertical stiles are grooved at the back near the outside and have a syma moulding on their lateral surfaces. \n\nThe front of the cupboard is for the most part covered with \"mid-purple-brown\" paint which has been scraped off in various areas. It would appear that the original surfaces was oak with ebonized details and that the later layers include whitewash and various stone and ochre colours. The back has been whitewashed.",
