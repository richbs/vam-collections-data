The same sparse setting, with a single figure on a European chair on an empty terrace, is common to many of them. It is noteworthy that Fullarton's household should be shown sitting on chairs when he himself was evidently used to sitting on carpets in native fashion. The male subject, who is shown with a 'lota' and common 'huqqa' and clasping a sword, may be a 'chowkidar' or watchman. The imperious lady, squatting on her chair as she smokes a 'bidri'-ware 'huqqa', could conceivably be Fullarton's 'bibi' or mistress.",
