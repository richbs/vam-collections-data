They came in a wide range of styles, including those with elastic sides, cloth tops, front laces or side-button fastenings. Most were made of leather, as this was more hard-wearing. Contrasting colours and fancy embroidery stitches were also popular.\n\nOwnership & Use\nBoots were still more commonly worn than shoes by men throughout the 19th century, and were regarded as more formal for day wear. Half-boots were usually worn under the trousers.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe most popular styles were the button boot, front-laced boot and elastic-sided boot.  Side-buttoned boots were fashionable from the 1830s and were gradually adopted by women. Boots were often named after famous places or people. The front-laced boots called Balmorals, for example, were named after Queen Victoria's Scottish estate.",
