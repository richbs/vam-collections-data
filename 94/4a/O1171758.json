It was awarded for sales of more than \u00a375000 of the 1976 album Who Loves You, by the Four Seasons. The BPI first started awarding metallic discs in April 1973, on a revenue based system, but this was replaced in January 1978 with a unit system. They continue to this day, with the BPI having awarded over 9000.\n\nThe Four Seasons are an Italian-American pop and rock group, with a sound somewhat reminiscent of doo-wop. Recording and playing live from 1960 to this day (2010 - although their heyday was in the 1960s and 70s) they are one of the best-selling musical groups of all time, having sold 175 million records worldwide. The album they received this award for was the first that featured anyone other than Frankie Valli singing lead vocals, and as such was somewhat of a surprise hit. It featured the single December 1963 (Oh What a Night), which was in the UK Top 40 for over 6 months.",
