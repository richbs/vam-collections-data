It is more likely that these pieces were made as souvenirs.  \n\nInterest in traditional jewellery of all kinds, then usually called peasant jewellery, was very high at the time, and the bold designs and bright colours of these pieces would have seemed typically exotic.  However it is only the decoration that is Algerian, as the earrings and brooch are European in form and quite different from those worn by the local population.",
