In 1933 he fled  Germany for England and entered into partnership with  Serge Chermayeff.  In 1935 they began work on the White City Housing Scheme, described by Mendelsohn as \"... a  self-containing unit of 2000 lower middle-class flats  and 500 bachelor flats in the towers, within wide  stretches of gardens and with proper orientation\".   Using mass production, a new and instantly viable  community would be formed.  Although this scheme was  never executed, the ideas embodied in it only came to  fruition in the large system-built estates of the  1960s.  In Mendelsohn's work such first sketches as  this contained not only his feeling for the interior  spaces but were also the vision from which all further  drawing and model making proceeded.  It is executed in  Mendelsohn's favourite medium, the 6B pencil.",
