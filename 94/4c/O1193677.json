His wife designed textiles, but Ascher also employed fine artists and independent designers to provide ideas for patterns. He was keen to promote cotton as well as silk and man-made fabrics for use in high fashion in the years after the Second World War. Before this date, cotton and rayon had always been considered relatively humble textiles suitable for the masses or for leisure wear. \n\nDesigned by the artist Philippe Julian for Ascher Ltd, this textile (fourth from the left in the photograph) was available in at least two different colourways: with a dark or light ground, its pattern screen-printed in two colours.",
