The tail feathers consist of two rows of small panels. The clawed feet are ridiculously small in relation to the body. Four main groups of composite scrolls protrude from the shoulders and the lower part of the body of the bird. Four fans with finials decorate the outside between two painted circles. There is one unglazed mark inside the base ring. The dish is heavy and has no mark. \n\nThis bird and its pointed beak resembles the partridges painted on bottles from the mid 17th century, such as 448-1874; 1127-1876; 1128-1876; 2495-1876; C.1959-1910.",
