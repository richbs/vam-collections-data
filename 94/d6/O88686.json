It is a small push along toy with the third version of the Fisher-Price logo on its back. At this time most of the toys made by this firm were still being made from wood, with plastic accessories where appropriate. In the late 1950s Fisher- Price purchased two injection moulding plastic machines and eventually the bulk of toys were made from plastic. The Merry Mousewife is a good example of the type of toy that Fisher-Price were making during the period of transition.",
