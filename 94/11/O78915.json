They were made in a variety of fabrics, from checked and striped materials to delicate woven or embroidered patterns. The fabrics were often similar to those used for women's fashionable dresses.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTartans and checks with polychromatic effects were favoured in the late 1850s and early 1860s, but such bold patterns were not to everyone's taste. Photographs of the period show that many men preferred to wear a waistcoat made of similar materials to the coat or trousers.  Some people wore 'dittos', where the suit was made of one material throughout.\n\nOwnership & Use\nDifferent styles of waistcoat were worn, according to the time of day and occasion. In the 1850s day waistcoats were often double-breasted, whereas those worn during the evening were single-breasted. They also tended to be made of more delicate materials, including satin and rich silks. A variety of special day waistcoats for sporting wear also came into fashion, including the 'Golf Vest', the 'Newmarket Vest', and the 'Tattershall Vest.'",
