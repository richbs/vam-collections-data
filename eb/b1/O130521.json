The idea never progressed much further until after he had written <i>Tell Me On a Sunday</i>, but in early 1980 he began to think of <i>Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats</i> as a possible concert anthology that could also be performed on television. With this in mind, some of his settings were performed in the summer of 1980 at the Sydmonton Festival. Valerie Eliot came to the concert and brought various unpublished pieces of verse by her husband, including \u00b4Grizabella the Glamour Cat'. The musical and dramatic images that this created for him made him feel that there was very much more to the project and that he needed the support of another to re-work his settings and to see if a dramatic whole could be woven from the verse that he was now to be allowed to develop. \n\nIn the late summer he had his first meeting with Trevor Nunn about the project and soon after Valerie Eliot produced various other uncollected poems, three of which were incorporated into Cats in their entirety. She also gave them a fascinating rough draft of an opening poem for what appears to have been conceived as a longer book about cats and dogs. This poem was not appropriate for the stage but it inspired them to write a lyric with the same intention of celebrating the supremacy of Jellicle cats. They were able to include lines from the end of Eliot's draft poem which introduced The Naming of Cats. The most thrilling for them was to find a reference in one of Eliot's letters to which proposed that eventually the cats were to go \"Up up up past the Russell Hotel, up up up to the Heaviside Layer\".",
