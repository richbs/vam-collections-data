The table is covered with a table cloth and on it are a dish of meat (fowl?), knives, small round loaves of bread, cups, a jug, bowl and vase. On the bench to the right of the table, propped up against its feet, is the blank tablet representing Raimondi's signature. Below the table the feet of all the men are visible.",

Since Raphael made no fresco or painting of this subject, this drawing may have been specifically made as a model for Marcantonio\u2019s engraving.
