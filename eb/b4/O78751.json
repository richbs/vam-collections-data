It is likely that this blind was part of a scheme for secondary service rooms, such as lavatories or staff preparation rooms, in the House of Lords. It was discovered in a gentleman's lavatory in the basement of the building during redecoration in 1980.\n\nThere are three pencil and wash designs of this pattern by Pugin in the Museum collection, one of which is inscribed 'Patterns for Blinds'. The linen blind was block-printed by Thomas Clarkson of Bannister Hall, Lancashire, for the firm of Frederick Crace & Son, which was responsible for much of the work at Westminster. The firm of Thomas Clarkson was one of the most popular 19th-century manufacturers of high quality furnishings. At the time this blind was made the Crace shop was at 14 Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square, London. \n\nAlthough the pattern was originally drawn by Pugin for the Palace of Westminster project, Crace soon realised its commercial potential and registered the pattern with the Patent Office on 7 March 1849. The Museum owns a second, larger-scale version in blue on white linen, which may be a later version.",
