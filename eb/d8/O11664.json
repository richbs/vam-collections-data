The original centre, which was probably unpatterned, has been cut out and replaced and the edges of the joins have been masked by narrow white and blue braid. The four corner motifs (diagonal sprays) extend into the missing central section and an attempt has been made to complete the missing bits.  The embroidery consists of three borders: the inner border is a narrow wave pattern; the middle border has large tree-like motifs and the outer border is a floral diaper. \nA small area of one side border has been patched and an attempt has been made to complete the missing embroidery.  The thread used here is slightly green and is like the thread used to complete the missing tips of the corner motifs.  \nAs the damage is only in the centre of each piece (see also T.45-1931), were these covers used on very small rectangular tables or free-standing altars?",
