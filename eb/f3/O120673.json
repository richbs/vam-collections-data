A branch of Creed was established in Paris in 1850, and the company became known for impeccably crafted 'tailor-mades' for women. Charles Creed set up his own fashion house in London after the Second World War, and enjoyed success in America and London.\n\nCreed's work was characterised by a military precision that owed much to the techniques of traditional men's tailoring. Here Savile Row detailing forms the basis of a very feminine suit, perfect for the lunch and shopping excursions that were the focus of many upper- class women's lives.",
