A pale brown strip of paper has been added on the right hand sideof the page as a gutter for the album binding. The edges of the page have been gilded.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal paintings, drawings and flower studies on both sides. The album was rebound in the mid nineteenth century with a striped Indian brocade, patterned with rows of flower sprigs, possibly made in southern India.  The silk may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A",
