Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland Advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis pencil drawing shows a woman in late eighteenth century dress with a powdered wig. She is shown looking around a mask that she holds at a distance in her left hand in front of her face. She holds a handkerchief in her right hand. Figures in eighteenth century dress, alluding to the lost elegance of the French court and the continuing tradition of the Venetian Carnival, were a popular motif in the 1930s and 1940s.",
