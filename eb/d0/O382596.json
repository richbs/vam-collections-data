This was probably a misunderstanding, as this piece, and the others associated with it, are part of the traditional jewellery of women from Nubia, particularly the Bishariya.  The Bishariya are a nomadic tribe living in the eastern desert south of the Red Sea, in southern Egypt and northern Sudan.\n\nUnlike almost all other Muslim tribal women, the Bishariya preferred their traditional jewellery to be made of gold, although the designs are the same as those of silver jewellery from the same region.  Nubia has been renowned for its gold mines since Pharaonic times.  The women expected their jewellery to be made from pure gold as far as possible, although it is often beaten very thin.\n\nThis pendant would have been one of a pair.  They were worn attached to the hair either side of the face, and often had long pendants hanging down from the lower edge of the gold disc.",
