It is ornamented with Renaissance scroll-work and three open-work medallions, containing male and female busts.\nIvory combs, together with mirror cases and gravoirs for parting the hair, formed an essential part of the trousse de toilette or \u00e9tui (dressing case) of the typical wealthy lady or gentleman in the period. The two leading cities for ivory carving were Paris and Dieppe. Luxury items, such as combs were often made in Paris, especially during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During the seventeenth century Dieppe became increasingly significant for small-scale sculpture in ivory, perhaps because it was a port.",
