In Paris, he then entered the atelier of the history painter Paul Delaroche (1797-1856). He first specialised in portraiture and then moved towards the naturalistic style with peasant scenes for which he became best known. \n\nThis painting is a preparatory study for the allegory of Spring (The National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo), whose definitive version includes the figures of Daphnis and Chloe in the foreground. The present painting depicts a landscape with a seashore in the background, probably inspired by the Normandy coastline Millet particularly favoured. In the foreground is a statue of Pan adorned with wreaths of foliage, which alludes to the mythological subject matter of the definitive version. This is a rare thematic for the painter who is best known for his scenes of the contemporary rural life.",

He went to Paris in 1837, where he was a pupil of Paul Delaroche, and for the next ten years painted mainly portraits and <i>scenes galantes</i> in the manner of Diaz. At about the time of the Revolution of 1848, he turned increasingly to painting rural scenes; in 1849 he moved to Barbizon, where he became a close friend of Theodore Rousseau, and where he remained for the rest of his life. Although attacked for his concentration on peasant subjects, he won increasing public recognition in the 1860s, and was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1868. \n\nLit. E.

Herbert has identified this painting with no. 29 in the Millet sale, <i>\u00c9tude pour le Tableau du Printemps</i>. The 'Spring' referred to is one of the four seasons commissioned in 1864 for M. Thomas, Due de Bojano, for his city house in Paris. Installed in September 1865 the series was later dispersed; 'Spring' is now in the Matsukata Collection, National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo (oil on canvas, 231.5 X 131.5 cm.). The finished version contains the figures of Daphnis and Chloe, which do not appear in the V. & A. landscape. It represents the coast near Cherbourg, the subject of many of Millet's paintings, but, as he paid no visits to his old house between 1854 and 1870, it could not have been taken direct from nature. It is doubtful whether the terminal figure could actually have been found there; it was probably added because of the Daphnis and Chloe theme. This sketch may reasonably be dated 1864 or slightly earlier. \n\nProv. Seal <i>Vente J. F.

This date provides a limit post quem this sketch could not have been made. \nThe present study shows a landscape with a seashore in the background, probably inspired by the cliff of Gr\u00e9ville near his hometown in Normandy, with in the foreground a statue of Pan adorned with wreaths of flowers and foliage. Compare with the finished version, the main characters Daphnis and Chloe, are missing. Daphnis and Chloe were two young lovers, whose story, a pastoral romance with a happy end, was narrated by the late Greek author Longus (2nd cent. A.D.?). \nThis is a very rare example of Millet's mythological paintings. Millet is actually best known for his rural scenes which depict 19th-century peasants' daily activities in beautiful landscapes infused with the brilliant light of Normandy's sky. Millet was one of the most authoritative exponents of the Barbizon school, an artistic movement that anticipated the Impressionism and derived somehow from the new interest for realism.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
