Each hardstone has been selected for its natural variations of colour and pattern to represent mountains, castles and figures. The Castrucci family were inspired by paintings by Flemish immigrant artists based in Prague around 1600. Small cabinets such as this were portable and used to house valuable objects, potions and pills, and pieces from a toilet service.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde amassed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
