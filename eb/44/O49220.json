These run the full depth of the object.  \n\nThe two outer sections are 355 mm wide (inner edge to inner edge) and the central section is 600 mm wide (inner edge to inner edge).  The central section is backed with a metal plate, finished in baked grey paint.  Four screws, one at each corner of this central plate, affix the piece to the wall.\n\nThe entire piece is coated in clear varnish.",
