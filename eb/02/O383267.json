They were originally used to hide the signs of goitre, a disfiguring disease caused by lack of iodine, which was endemic in the high Alps. \n\nIn Switzerland these necklaces, called Halsb\u00e4tti, were usually made of loose chains of silver links, or beads imitating garnet or coral.  The designs varied from valley to valley, but most had a three-part clasp, like this one, of silver-gilt filigree set with garnets.  They were worn over a thin scarf of black silk.  The name Halsb\u00e4tti means a rosary worn on the neck, because the beads resembled rosary beads.  It never had any religious meaning.\n\nThis necklace was described as German when it was acquired in 1872, but it is much more likely to be Swiss.  The filigree clasps worn with German and Austrian necklaces were quite different in shape.  Although the clasp and the garnet-coloured beads are probably Swiss, the necklace itself may have been rethreaded.  The little gilt beads are not typical, and an original Swiss Halsb\u00e4tti would have had more filigree spacers or end plaques.",
