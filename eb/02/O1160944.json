Either available at concerts, or often through fan clubs and occasionally in shops, items such as this are made to appeal to fans of the band or singer, and the want for a souvenir of a special concert. Key-rings are a popular keepsake as, like concert and band t-shirts, they present the owner's allegiance to a specific musical culture. This one also doubles a bottle opener.\n\nThe British band Sky were an instrumental progressive rock band, most successsful between 1978 and 1987, although they carried on as a group until the mid 1990s. The band was formed of classical guitarist John Williams, with bass player Herbie Flowers (of T. Rex) and Tristan Fry on drums, with Francis Monkman playing harpsichord and synths, and Kevin Peek also on guitar. Their sound was a mix of classical, light pop, progressive rock and jazz. At their peak they during the summer of 1979, they sold out concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, and five nights at the Dominion Theatre in the West End.",
