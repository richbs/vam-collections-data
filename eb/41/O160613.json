Rackham attributed its manufacture to Umbria on the belief that the device in the centre was the arms of the town of Narni in Umbria. However, the arms of Narni are tinctured gules (red) and the griffin is partly surrounded by a laurel wreath. The griffin on this dish is tinctured with manganese which could very well represent red but there is no laurel wreath. This attribution to Narni and to Umbrian manufacture is tenuous.\nA dish in the British Museum (see References) also has a pair of linked dolphins around its wide rim. It has been reattributed to Pomerance based on the finds by Anna Moore-Valeri and dated to about 1537 to 1560.",
