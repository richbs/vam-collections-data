She wore it on the occasion of her first marriage which ended in a divorce.  The society wedding was covered by the press but was not on the front pages due to the Profumo Affair which broke out on the same day.  April did not want to carry a bouquet of flowers so she held her mother's prayer book from which satin ribbons flowed.  The stains on the dress are part of its history.  April said that the stains must have been caused by her godfather who accidentally spilled champagne on it during the celebrations.\n\nThis dress would have been made by R.L. Salmon Ltd, a London dress manufacturer who acquired exclusive rights to make and sell the couturier Jacques Heim's designs in London from 1957. In most instances, R.L. Salmon Ltd used the French fabrics that Heim recommended, and Heim always approved the end product.\n\nJacques Heim (1899-1967) was an original, inventive and creative designer. He designed elegant  evening dresses, coats and wedding gowns as well as sportswear and beachwear.  He was born in Paris and in 1923 took over the furrier business started by his parents in 1898.   In the 1930s he established his own company on the Avenue Matignon, with his wife as directrice.  His creations helped bring about a revolution in beach fashions. He also helped popularise the bikini featuring it in his 1946 collection under the name 'Atome'. Between 1946 and 1966 he opened his own chain of boutiques and from 1958 to 62 he was president of Chambre Syndicale de la Couture.",
