Carved in high relief, the composite figure stands in a relaxed manner, with a vertical division separating the two entities. Shiva\u2019s form is on the left ( his proper right side), distinguished by a taut muscular and masculine form and the aroused penis which projects upwards from his waist-band. Shiva\u2019s third eye is vertically divided and only half represented. He has a curling moustache and a long earlobe, and his matted locks are piled up in ribbed ridges on his head. The only jewellery he has is a beaded necklace round his neck.  His torso is otherwise bare but his sacred thread is delineated by two simple lines. Parvati\u2019s half is more rounded and feminine in its form, displaying a single rounded breast, adjacent to a decorative cord which morphs into Shiva's sacred thread on his side. Her hair is shown in the feminine Kushan style with a flat oval bun in front and the remainder of her hair pulled back in ribbed tresses. She is wearing a heavy tasselled earring and numerous wrist and arm bangles. Below her waist she wears a girdle  with scalloped decoration over a diaphanous lower garment. Parvati\u2019s hand appears to hold a flower; the missing arm of Shiva presumably was gesturing protection (<i>abhayamudra</i>), as seen on other surviving examples of this subject.\n     The figure stands against a phallic-like <i>linga</i>, Shiva\u2019s emblem. On the reverse the anatomical markings make the phallic-associations explicit. A demonic face is also carved in bas-relief, perhaps a depiction of Rudra the \u2018howler\u2019, the wild Vedic god from whom Shiva (\u2018\u2019the auspicious\u201d) claims his ancestry'.",

            "public_access_description": "This red sandstone carving shows a knee-length composite figure in high relief. It is a phallic symbol of Shiva in the Ardhanarishvara Murti. This is the name of the androgynous form in which Shiva is depicted as 'the Lord who is Half-woman'. \n\nHere the sculpture is divided vertically. The right half is male and has the third eye and an erect penis. The left half is female with a prominent breast, waist-girdle and hair plaits. The male arm is missing. The figure stands against a phallus, carved in low relief on the back with a demon face.\n\nAmong the earliest anthropomorphic sculptures of Siva to appear is that of Siva in his androgynous form, Ardhanarishvara, \u2018the Lord who is Half-Woman\u2019. In this manifestation, Siva reveals himself in a bi-sexual form, divided vertically, with Parvati occupying his left-half. This example, from the early Kushan period, is amongst the earliest known occurrence of this subject. In addition to these all to rare examples of Kushan  period Ardhanarishvara figures, this subject also appears as one of the Siva\u2019s faces on some of the earliest caturmukhalinga (\u2018four-faced linga\u2019). These depictions, important from the beginnings of anthropomorphic representation of the Brahmanical gods, give form to concepts already expressed in the most ancient compendium of Indian religious thought, the Rgveda. \n\nCarved in high relief, the composite figure stands in a relaxed manner, with a vertical division separating the two entities. Siva\u2019s form is on the right, distinguished by a taut muscular and \u2018masuline\u2019 form and the aroused penis which projects upwards from his waist-cloth. Siva\u2019s third eye is vertically divided and only half represented; similarly the hair styles differ, set apart by this vertical divide. Parvati\u2019s half is more rounded and \u2018feminine\u2019 in its form, and displays a single breast, long trestles of hair and a decorated girdle, clearly distinguished from Siva\u2019s simple waist cord. Parvati\u2019s hand appears to hold a flower; the missing arm of Siva presumably was gesturing protection (abhayamudra), as seen on other surviving examples of this subject.\n\nThe figure stands against a phallic-like linga, Siva\u2019s emblem. On the reverse the anatomical markings make the phallic-associations explicit. A demonic face is also carved in bas-relief, perhaps a depiction of Rudra the \u2018howler\u2019, the wild Vedic god from whom Siva (\u2018\u2019the auspicious\u201d) claims his ancestry.",

ISBN 9788476649466. p.98, cat.48. 'Among the earliest anthropomorphic sculptures of Siva to appear is that of Siva in his androgynous form, Ardhanarishvara, \u2018the Lord who is Half-Woman\u2019. In this manifestation, Siva reveals himself in a bi-sexual form, divided vertically, with Parvati occupying his left-half. This example, from the early Kushan period, is amongst the earliest known occurrence of this subject. In addition to these all to rare examples of Kushan period Ardhanarishvara figures, this subject also appears as one of the Siva\u2019s faces on some of the earliest caturmukhalinga (\u2018four-faced linga\u2019). These depictions, important from the beginnings of anthropomorphic representation of the Brahmanical gods, give form to concepts already expressed in the most ancient compendium of Indian religious thought, the Rgveda. Carved in high relief, the composite figure stands in a relaxed manner, with a vertical division separating the two entities. Siva\u2019s form is on the right, distinguished by a taut muscular and \u2018masuline\u2019 form and the aroused penis which projects upwards from his waist-cloth. Siva\u2019s third eye is vertically divided and only half represented; similarly the hair styles differ, set apart by this vertical divide. Parvati\u2019s half is more rounded and \u2018feminine\u2019 in its form, and displays a single breast, long trestles of hair and a decorated girdle, clearly distinguished from Siva\u2019s simple waist cord. Parvati\u2019s hand appears to hold a flower; the missing arm of Siva presumably was gesturing protection (abhayamudra), as seen on other surviving examples of this subject. The figure stands against a phallic-like linga, Siva\u2019s emblem. On the reverse the anatomical markings make the phallic-associations explicit. A demonic face is also carved in bas-relief, perhaps a depiction of Rudra the \u2018howler\u2019, the wild Vedic god from whom Siva (\u2018\u2019the auspicious\u201d) claims his ancestry'.
