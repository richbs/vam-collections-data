Blue cotton weft has been used at the lower end of the carpet, about 2\" from the end.\nPILE: wool; 9 colours: red, orange, yellow, green, light green, dark blue, blue, purple (faded), white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and predominantly tied around 2 warps. Jufti knots are scattered throughout the carpet but are predominantly and in narrow unpatterned stripes of red, dark blue and purple and in the dots in meanders. There is off-set knotting too. 280 knots per sq. inch (4320 per sq. dm). \nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn with red wool.\nEND FINISH: Lower: incomplete but with evidence of plain weave with white cotton weft. Upper: missing - loose warp threads.\nDESIGN: Field: red ground with 17\u00bd bands of 8 and one part botehs; the rest of the space is filled with small flowers.\nMain Border: white ground with pregnant boteh and child, as in the field but larger and with an infilling of flowers.\nNo inner border.\nOuter Border: dark blue ground with small flowers.\nNOTE: it was the clear aim of the designer to get a dense, fluid linear design - so the technique was dictated by the design, not the other way round, hence the use of sinuous weft only after 5 rows of knots and the variable number of warp threads around which knots are tied.\nCatalogue Date: 21 July 1999",
