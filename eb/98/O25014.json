Wicklow, Ireland.\n\nThe<i> gandharva</i> represents a class of semi-divine beings whose role was to serve as attendants to the principal deity. Over time they came to be conceived of principally as musicians and were represented playing a variety of instruments. They are regularly shown attending the main deity or can also appear autonomously in a larger sculptural programme. They are a regular feature of both Hindu and Jain temples; this sculpture could be accommodated by either faith. The Jain <i>gandharva</i> is one type of <i>vyantaradevata</i>, or inferior deity.\n\nApart from the separate temples dedicated to Surya, he is also included in the Pancayatana system whereby the five priniple Hindu deities, Visnu, siva, Durga, Ganse and Surya are installed in one central and four subsidiary shrines.  Although Surya was still a major deity in the 12th and 13th centuries his importance began to diminish after this period.  Hoysala representations of Surya break from conventional iconography in the frequent absence of his seven horses and charioteer Aruna, and of his characteristic tall boots.  Both features are visible on the Pala Surya on Display (929 (IS))",
