His parents were of medium height and the boy developed normally until the age of six months, but then stopped growing. For many years he was less than 70 centimetres tall, though he did grow a little in later life. When he was four years old Stratton was 'discovered', by the American showman P.T. Barnum, who trained him to sing and dance. Now called 'General Tom Thumb' after the tiny fairytale character, he was taken on tour in America. Tom was only five but was able to perform comic routines, the most popular being his impersonation of Napoleon Bonaparte. He acquired celebrity status and Barnum, who always took advantage of a marketing opportunity, toured him to Europe. Tom Thumb visited London in 1844 and returned on several occasions, appearing twice before Queen Victoria. By the time he died in 1883 he was a wealthy man and an international star.",
