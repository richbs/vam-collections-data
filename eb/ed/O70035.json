He leans his left shoulder against a column--here shown more like a post or stake--which his arms encircle. His hands are bound at the wrists with a rope, but the right hand is raised in blessing. His left leg is bent at the knee and raised, with the bare foot resting on a ledge in the ground. A bearded torturer, wearing a hat with a rolled brim, a low-belted doublet and a sheathed sword hanging from a belt, stands on the right of the panel, looking up at Christ, holding the rope in his left hand and a scourge in his raised right hand. A similar figure is shown on the left of the panel prodding Christ with the end of the handle of a scourge with the thongs hanging down, which he holds in both hands. The lower parts of two more torturers remain to the right and left of the top of the panel.\n\nThe whole of the top of the panel is missing. The end of the rope holding Christ's hands is broken away. Much green paint, which has a 'scrubbed' appearance, and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Gilding remains on Christ's beard and hair. The faces of the torturers are darkened in the customary way. The column is painted green and brown and is divided into sections and decorated with a tear-shaped motif in white. The upper background has traces of a reddish-pink colour.\n\nThe back of the panel is marked in an apparently random fashion, including marks which may be some Roman numerals. There are three lead plugs with some latten wires. The bottom has been cut away.",
