These sunflowers are made up of petals couched in white cotton thread surrounding a centre of tightly ruched taffeta. They are mainly concentrated around the hem, although a few flowers adorn the bodice and smaller versions bloom on the shoulders.\n\nPastel colours combined with textured decoration were particularly fashionable in the early 1900s. Lady Fairhaven wore this wrap in the summer, probably as an elegant addition to her evening dress.",

Broughton died before he could be elevated to a peerage, their eldest son Urban H.R. Broughton (1896-1966) became 1st Baron Fairhaven of Lode on 20 March 1929, while Cara became 1st Lady Fairhaven. This barony became extinct on Urban H.R.Broughton's death, but a later barony, Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey, co. Cambridge, was granted to him in 1961, with a remainder to his brother, Henry (1900-1973), to enable this title to continue after his death without male heirs.\n\nThis forms part of a large donation of late 19th and early 20th century garments and accessories (with a few historical textiles) donated to the Museum in 1972 by Cara's grandson and Henry's son, Major Ailwyn Broughton and his wife, a year before Ailwyn became Lord Fairhaven following his father's death.",
