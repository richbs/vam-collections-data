He called the main roof his quarterdeck and celebrated special occasions by firing cannons in salute.

Davies, p. 27, says that the house was known as 'The Grove' until about 1911; then the main part was renamed 'Admiral's House', and the smaller part, here seen to the right, was called 'Grove Lodge'. Admiral Mathew Barton called the main roof his quarterdeck, and celebrated naval victories by firing two cannons from it in salute. A more finished version of the same view as No. 402 [137-1888], without the rainbow and extended downwards to make a vertical composition, is in the National Galerie, Berlin (reproduced in L. ed. S., Pl. 126). No. 402 [137-1888] may have served as a sketch for the picture at Berlin. Since the publication of the first edition of this catalogue John Baskett has shown in <i>Constable Oil Sketches</i>, 1966, that the sketch was painted from an upper window of No. 2 Lower Terrace, and therefore dates from 1821-2, when Constable was living there.\"\n<u>Constable. 200 years in Hampstead<u> Exhibition catalogue for exhibition at Burgh House and Hampstead Museum, October 2012 - April 2013.",
