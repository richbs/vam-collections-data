Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder, were made as personal accessorie,s often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe- and boot-shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. This carved wooden snuff box is decorated with brass piqu\u00e9 work (small holes drilled into the wood to hold pieces of metal wire). The top of the shoe is hollowed out to form a container for the snuff and covered with a small sliding lid. The small size and light weight of this box made it easily transportable.",
