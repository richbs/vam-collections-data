From July to December 1866 he toured a part of the Himalayan region. He wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes of which he took photographs.\n\nThis is how he describes the history of this view: 'Our next march kept company with a stream along the valley, where, being closely shut in by mountains, the heat was intense and almost unbearable. I only took one picture, at a place called Munglaor, where I was fortunate in getting shade for the tent, without which I don't think it would have been possible to obtain a picture in such excessive heat\u2026.\u2019\n\nHe adds:'\u2026the sides of the mountain in this part of Kulu being steep, and there being no level land at the bottom of the valleys\u2026the cultivation is carried on by means of narrow terraces up the mountain sides and when these are green with the spring corn, or yellow and red in autumn when the corn is ripe, the effect, with the villages dotted among them, is very pretty.'",
