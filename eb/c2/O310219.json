He appears to have been trained in Florence in the Rossellino studio. With a few exceptions all his major works were executed for his native town of Lucca. In the last years of his life he made an important series of statues for the Chapel of the Baptist in the Duomo at Genoa, which was interrupted by his death in 1501.",
