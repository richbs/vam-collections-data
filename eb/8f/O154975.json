He was also one of the first people to exhibit his computer graphics, at the studio gallery of the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart in February 1965.\n\nNees studied mathematics and physics at the universities of Erlangen-Nuremberg and Stuttgart.   He subsequently worked for Siemens as a software engineer, and was instrumental in their purchasing a 'Zuse Graphomat', a drawing machine operated by computer-generated punched tape.  The machine was capable of creating geometric patterns and, although the programming language that Nees used (ALGOL) was designed specifically for scientific computers, he used it to create aesthetic images such as this one. \n\nIn 1969 he received his doctorate on the subject of Generative Computer Graphics under Max Bense, the German philosopher and writer. \n\nThis screenprint was created from the design for a sculpture that Nees produced using a machine that could mill, or cut, a 3D shape.  The machine followed the computer calculated image as a guide.  The artist used a random number generator to determine the height, width and depth of the rectangular forms.  The data for each of these three dimensions would be stored on magnetic tape and used to drive an automatic milling machine.  The sculpture from which this screenprint derives was cut from a block of wood and was displayed at the Venice Biennale in 1969.",
