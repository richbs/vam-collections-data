His interest is in manipulating fabric, distorting and pushing the boundaries of its structure.  Increasingly fascinated by stretch jersey, Mersh experimented with personal possessions, such as coins collected on his travels, bringing the coins up under the fabric and tying them in place.  Seeking to enlarge his experiments, he  moved onto an even more valuable personal collection - his compact discs and vinyl records.  Constructed in the same way as the smaller coin piece, here Mersh has carefully manipulated the stripes on the jersey, using the line as a starting point and stretching it around the cds and records.\n  \nMersh has constructed other sculptural pieces using the same techniques, winning the Nationwide Mercury Prize 'Art and Music' in 2005.",
