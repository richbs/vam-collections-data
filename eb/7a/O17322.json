He studied with local painters in Toulouse before entering the Paris studio of David (1748-1825) in 1797. He was soon consider as the champion of the French classical tradition of history painting, traditionally opposed to the art of Delacroix in the early 19th century. Ingres was awarded the prix de Rome in 1801 and alternated long sojourns in Italy and Paris from 1806 but spent the last 9 years of his life in Paris where he died aged 87. His oeuvre also includes portraits paintings which represent a good testimonial of the 19th-century French high society.\n\nThis painting was probably a preparatory study for one of Ingres' Odalisques, a prototype of female reclining nude which recurs in several compositions. The precise painting for which it was a study is still subject to debate as well as the dating. However it was probably made in Rome between 1810 and 1830.",

He won the Prix de Rome in 1801, but was unable to proceed to Rome until 1806. He then lived in Rome until 1820, and in Florence 1820-24. On his return to Paris he received the Cross of the Legion of Honour from Charles X and was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. In 1835-41 he was again in Rome, as director of the French school. He was made a senator in 1862. Ingres painted portraits and historical, mythological, allegorical and religious subjects; he excelled as a draughtsman. \n\n112 \nA SLEEPING ODALISQUE \nSigned lower left <i>J. Ingres</i>\n Canvas \n11 \u00be x 18 \u00be (29.8 x 47.6) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.57 \n \nDelaborde (1870) followed by Long (1925) considered this to be a study for the <i>Odalisque \u00e0 l'Esclave</i> of 1839 (Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass.; Wildenstein, no. 228, fig. 149), but Lapauze (1911),Wildenstein (1956) and Rosenblum (1967) argued that it was more probably related to the <i>Dormeuse de Naples,</i> painted for Murat, King of Naples, in 1808. This painting is lost, but there are various drawings of sleeping odalisques in the Mus\u00e9e Ingres at Montaubon (Lapauze, p. 102; <i>La Revue de l'Art fran\u00e7ais,</i> iv, 1921, p. 193, repr.), which are thought to be studies for it. Like these drawings, CAI.57 shows a naked, sleeping woman, whereas the odalisque in <i>L'Odalisque \u00e0 l'Esclave</i> has her legs draped and is clearly shown as looking at the slave playing the guitar. There are two very similar paintings, one in a private collection, Paris (Wildenstein, no. 56, fig. 37; 8 5/8 x 14 1/8 in.); the whereabouts of the other is unknown (Wildenstein, no. 57, fig. 36). These differ in the position of the woman's right arm and right leg but are otherwise closely related to CAI.57. There is an engraving by Auguste Fran\u00e7ois Al\u00e8s (1797-1878) after the Ionides painting which is reproduced in <i>L'Artiste,</i> 14 December 1856, p. 16. \n\nProv.

Baron Jules de Hauff, Brussels;  from whom purchased on 13 May 1881 as Ingres 'Femme couch\u00e9' by Goupil  &amp; Co., Paris (stock book no. 15388); from whom bought by Constantine  Alexander Ionides, probably on 21 November 1881; listed in his inventory (private collection) in November 1881 as 'Odalisque Dormant' by Ingres with a valuation of \u00a31000; bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides in 1900.\n\nHistorical significance: According to Ingres' biographer Henri Delaborde, this work belonged to the Baron of Hauff, in Brussels, and was painted in Rome as a study for the <i>Sleeper of Naples</i>, a painting commissioned by Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples, and probably destroyed around 1815.  Ingres added some accessories (such as the red sofa and draperies) around the female nude in order to convert the study into a finished painting. The composition was then engraved by M. Al\u00e8s and published in <i>L'Artiste</i> (1846) under the title: <i>L'Odalisque</i>.\n\nThe nature of this work is still subject to debate. It is alternatively identified as a preparatory study or a replica of the <i>Sleeper of Naples</i> (see Louvre, 2006 and Shelton, 2008), which formed a pendant to the <i>Grande Odalisque</i> executed in 1814 (Louvre, Paris - RF1158). Ingres executed a series of several female nudes in the same posture, except from the position of the right arm and leg (see one in the Mus\u00e9e Ingres (867.2030), and another formerly in Lady Aberconway Collection). \n\nThe representation of a reclining female nude recurs in several compositions in Ingres' oeuvre which includes the later <i>Odalisque with a Slave</i>, Fogg Art Museum Cambridge, Massachusetts, and <i>Jupiter and Antiope</i>, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, to which the present work may also be related. A pencil study (11.3 x 17.8 cm) after the former work by Alphonse Legros (1837-1911) also belonged to C.A. Ionides, and formed part of his bequest to the V&amp;A (CAI.1134).\n\nThe sinuous lines and elongated limbs of the figure are characteristics of Ingres, who tried to emulate the art of Raphael and Michelangelo in Rome. The posture of Ingres' <i>Odalisque</i> would have a great influence on other artists such as Alexandre Cabanel (1823-1889), whose <i>Birth of Venus</i> (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris) clearly derives from Ingres' prototype.",

            "historical_context_note": "History painting, i.e. depictions of non recurring events based on religious, classical, literary or allegorical sources, particularly developed in Italy during the Renaissance (15th-16th centuries). History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary.
