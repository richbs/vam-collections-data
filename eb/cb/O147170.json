The motif includes leaves, 2 irises, an blossom and a bud. The various colour combinations are:\n[1] red and dark brown flower heads with green leaves\n[2] red and light brown flower heads with green leaves, all edged with metal thread\nThe bottom row has base leaves in red or light grey and the motif is approximately 0.5 cm smaller than the other motifs in the textile.  The other base leaves are alternately dark or light brown with reverse highlights ie. dark brown with red highlights.\nThe bottom three rows are NOT offset and all flowering plants bend to the left.\nThe other seven rows ARE offset and each row points in the alternate direction.\nThe middle 5 rows have  the expected half motif missing at one or other side.\nAbove the lower three rows the dark brown motifs have dark brown roots while the alternate light brown motifs have light brown roots.\nThere are numerous weaving faults and it seems to have been woven on a loom with a Jacquard mechanism. \nThe facing is purple silk, bias cut plain weave.\nThe backing is plain weave cotton roller-printed, two pieces joined together. The white ground has a pattern of an ovoid shape containing a floral spray in two shades of red with green leaves and orange details. Two flowering branches in the same colouring emerge from the base of the ovals and are interrupted by a white circle enclosing a geometric form in red and orange on a dark brown ground.  The whole ground is covered with very small black and white triangles.",
