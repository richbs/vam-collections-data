The figure was intended - by the lender of the sculpture Baroness Burdett Coutts - as a fountain figure to be placed in Vincent Square (the Westminster Boys play-ground) in London. The figure was eventually never installed at Vincent Square and entered the Museum as a temporary loan, until officially registered in 2000.\n\nDoulton &amp; Watts was an English ceramic manufactory, established in 1815, when John Doulton (1793\u20131873) became a partner in the small Vauxhall Walk pottery in Lambeth, London, which produced stonewares such as ink bottles and spirit flasks. In 1820 the company became Doulton &amp; Watts. Doulton\u2019s son Henry Doulton (1820\u201397) joined the firm in 1835, and the business was expanded to include architectural terracotta and chemical stonewares.",
