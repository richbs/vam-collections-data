            "bibliography": "Vogue (French) October 1960\nCoverage by Robert Doisneau of the party to which this dress was worn.\nObituary for Francine Weisweiller by Ronald Bergan, Thursday December 18, 2003\nThe Testament Of Orpheus (1960), Jean Cocteau's valedictory film, featured many of the most important people in his life. Among them was his good friend and patron Francine Weisweiller.  As a modern woman in a belle \u00e9poque dress, designed by Balenciaga, the beautiful and elegant Weisweiller appeared in the film as la dame qui s'est tromp\u00e9e d'\u00e9poque (the woman who found herself in the wrong period). In a way, Weisweiller was a woman outside her own time, a throwback to the great days of personal patronage of the arts. Without her, we might have had far fewer of Cocteau's works over the last 13 years of his life, from 1950 to 1963.   He stayed at her villa in Cap-Ferrat for 12 years and a companion explained that Weisweiller \"formed part of the d\u00e9cor of his life\".\nShe was born Francine Worms into a wealthy family. Her husband was an industrialist, who settled in France, where he owned a stable of racehorses. She was more interested in the artistic life than horses, and being on intimate terms with Cocteau guaranteed that she mixed with some of the greatest artists of the day, including Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, Colette, Francis Poulenc, Jean Genet and Edith Piaf. In return, she enabled Cocteau to gain financial security. \nFrancine's daughter Carole, published two books about their relationship, Je l'appelais Monsieur Cocteau (1996) and Les Ann\u00e9es Francine (2003), the latter, a mixture between a family album and a work of art, which assembled photos, poems and letters, caught the warm friendship between her mother and Cocteau.",
