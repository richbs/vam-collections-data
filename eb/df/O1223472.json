He was the design director for the punk and New Wave label Stiff Records from shortly after its foundation in 1976 until his death. Bubbles was a key figure creating the close link between the music industry and innovative graphic design in Britain and his work was a catalyst for designers such as Peter Saville and Malcolm Garrett.\n\nThis programme is an excellent example of Bubbles\u2019 use of photomontage and collage techniques. It shows the members of Ian Dury\u2019s band, the Blockheads, with their faces replaced by razor heads. The reverse is printed with contact sheets from a photoshoot of the band.",
