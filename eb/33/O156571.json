He supposedly died from illness whilst on a journey to the south of Russia in 1825, but from the outset there were rumours that he had in fact renounced the throne and staged his own death.  He was godfather to Queen Victoria of England, who was christened Alexandrina Victoria after him.  \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
