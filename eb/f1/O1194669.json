His first troll was carved of wood and was given as a present for his daughter's birthday. Due to demand, trolls began to be manufactured from soft rubber and later, vinyl in around the 1960s, which is at the same time as the peak popularity for troll dolls. Due to their sudden increase in popularity, many troll imitations were made, but not to the quality of the Thomas Dam dolls. Trolls have been part of folklore forever, as bad and mischievous characters who live under bridges or in caves. They have also been known to be good luck charms. They come in many different sizes and are easily recognised by their tuft of brightly coloured hair, in this case, red.",
