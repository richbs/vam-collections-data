Smocks are made from squares and rectangles of fabric, which makes a paper pattern un-necessary in their construction and eliminates wasting fabric in cutting curved facings etc. As their use in the countryside was dying out towards the end of the nineteenth century, rural smocks were taken as the inspiration for girl's dresses by first the \u00e6sthetic movement and then by clothes reformers.",
