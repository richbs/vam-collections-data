He has been recognised as one of the most talented Indian artists of contemporary tribal art, that orginated from a rural, non urban background. In 1986 he received the 'Shikhar Samman' one of the highest artistic awards from the Indian government in recognition of his artistic contribution. This composition was produced by the artist in the latter stage of his career, possibly for an Indian gallery or for an exhibition at one of the folk art and craft museums in India, either the Arts and Crafts Museum in New Delhi, or the Bharat Bhavan Tribal Museum in Bhopal. Jangarh died in July 2001.\n\nThe artist has used a black pen to depict a peacock standing against a white background. In this case he has not used traditional materials but used a cheap pen to depict a very elaborate design.",

In 1986 he received the 'Shikhar Samman' one of the highest artistic awards from the Indian government in recognition of his artistic contribution. This composition was produced by the artist in the latter stage of his career, possibly for an Indian gallery or for an exhibition at one of the folk art and craft museums in India, either the Arts and Crafts Museum in New Delhi, or the Bharat Bhavan Tribal Museum in Bhopal. Jangarh died in July 2001.",
