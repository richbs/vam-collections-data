The original Leete image was featured on the cover of a weekly magazine, London Opinion, before being taken up by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee and used as a poster to help recruit soldiers to fight for Britain in World War I. Lord Kitchener had spent most of his life serving in the British armed forces in Palestine, Egypt, Sudan and South Africa. In 1914 he was appointed Secretary of State for War and, through Leete\u2019s image, his accusing finger, steely gaze and handlebar moustache became instantly recognisable.\n\nMuch reproduced by subsequent artists and designers, the image of this formidable historical figure is used here in a British Army recruitment campaign directed at Britain\u2019s black and Asian communities. Following accusations of racism within the British forces in the mid-1990s, in 1997 the new Labour government insisted on a proactive recruitment campaign and percentage quota targets. This led to a slow rise in the numbers of ethnic minority recruits; from less than one per cent (0.7) in 1996-7 to about two per cent in 1999-2000, and almost six per cent in 2002.",
