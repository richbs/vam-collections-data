This one is oblong with borders made up of a type of decoration called gadrooning. \n\nOther designs include trays with four feet, a vertical rim and decoration such as reeding, pierced work or relief masks. Later examples in both silver and Sheffield plate could be oval or boat shaped. Trays made after about 1770, like this one, are often difficult to distinguish from so-called \u2018pen trays\u2019.\n\nSnuffers were first invented to cut off and retain the burned wicks of candles when the wax around them had melted. They were not necessarily used to extinguish the candle's flame. The point at the end was for retrieving the tip of the wick if it fell into molten wax.\n\nSnuffers are first recorded in the period 1400-1500. There were numerous patents for them from about 1750, and new improved versions of snuffers reappeared until 1840. After this time snuffers became redundant following the development of candles that completely consumed their wicks. \n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
