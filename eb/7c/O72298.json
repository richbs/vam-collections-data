He had a fundamental dislike of printmaking, but when persuaded and assisted by master craftsmen he was able to exercise his talent for drawing through lithography and produce prints that had the same weird qualities of scale and distortion he brought to his sculptures. This is one of a suite of eight gigantic prints of 'soft' screws, each of which Oldenburg prepared for carefully, first making numerous studies and then taking a day over each drawing in the suite.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Claes Thure Oldenburg (born 1929)</b> \n\n<i>Soft Screw in Waterfall</i>, 1976 \n\nOldenburg is best known for making soft sculptures.  He has not always been keen on printmaking.  In 1972 he described is as 'an excruciatingly unpleasant activity, like going to hospital for an operation'.  This may have been due to the technical discipline that certain printmaking processes impose, which the artist found inhibited his spontaneity. \nCrayon lithography, however, is one of the printmaking techniques closest to drawing.  In addition, a necessary precondition for successful printmaking in the second half of the twentieth century, by artists who are primarily either painters of sculptors, is technical support from highly skilled and sympathetic individuals who create the right working environment for the artist.  This was provided by Gemini G.E.L., the publishing workshop that in 1968 editioned an Oldenburg sculpture, <i>Ice Bag</i>, produced in three different scales. \nThe set of eight lithographs, of which this print is one, was the first time Oldenburg had made either a drawing or a print on such a large scale.  The artist approached the task in a very particular way: \n<i>I prepared an image very carefully, doing it many, many times, and rehearsed as though it were a performance.  Then I had a good night's sleep, came in early the next morning where everything was set up with a high-quality transfer paper.  I did one drawing a day...I had to prepare, and the circumstances had to be just right.</i> \nIn the early 1960s Oldenburg's work was frequently exhibited alongside that of Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jim Dine, and their shared concerns for commonplace objects and mass popular culture led to American Pop Art.
