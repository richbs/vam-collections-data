The process allowed for a group of women to embroider the  individual panels at the same time. If required, the hanging could be dismantled at a later stage and the panels re-used.\n\nPeople\nSurviving embroideries owned or worked by royalty can rarely be identified. Some of the numerous embroideries  worked by the doomed Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587) during her imprisonment in England bear her initials or cipher. This activity must have both filled her time and occupied her mind, since many of the emblems or mottoes used have more significance than is immediately apparent.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe central part of this panel is based on the  woodcut  Echinops ( from the Greek Echino  for sea urchin) in Conrad Gesner's  Icones Animalium Aquatilium  ('Pictures of Aquatic Creatures') of  1560. Since there are no identifying initials or cipher for  Mary or her captor Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527- 1608),  it is likely that this piece was worked by one of the ladies of the household.",
