            "public_access_description": "This design is for a winter outfit. High brown knee boots are worn with a deep burgundy skirt and gauntlet gloves; and a burnt-orange jacket with gold buttons and tassels and contrasting diamond-shaped insertions of white fur, and the model wears a Tyrolean hat.\n\nThis fashion design was possibly designed by Netty Ferro or Jean-Denis Maillard for the House of Worth. During the late 1930s most of the designs at Worth appear to have been produced by Madame Ferro or Jean-Denis Maillard, who were both creating elaborate gowns and day outfits under the supervision of Roger Worth. They both worked in a very similar style, meaning that it can be tricky to tell which of them was the artist responsible for unsigned sketches such as this. Roger Worth, who from 1935-1952 oversaw fashion design at Worth, was the great-grandson of Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895), who founded Worth in 1858, and went on to become known as the first haute couture designer. Following his death, Charles was succeeded by his son Jean-Philippe Worth (1856-1925). The house then passed to Jean-Philippe's nephew, Jean-Charles Worth, who retired in 1935 and handed Worth to his nephews Roger and Maurice. The Paris house closed in 1954 following a buy-out by Paquin, who themselves closed two years later.",
