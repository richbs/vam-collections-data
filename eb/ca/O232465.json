In designing Bellamont about 1728, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce introduced into Ireland the first thoroughly designed four-square Palladian villa, just as, in England, Colen Campbell had done about 1718 with Baldersley Park (former Newby Park), Yorkshire.  Loosely inspired by Palladio's Villa Pisani at Montagnana, Pearce noted `This villa looks wonderfully well and much understood ye designe ought not to have been shaded there is no portico but half pillars.  Ye pillars in ye hall have same effect as crowding and did not please, but ye whole as not having been finished is going to ruin - of brick'.  See E.2124.74 for Pearce's original design for the ground floor plan.  The inscription on the back of this drawing is thought by Colvin and Craig to be in the hand of Pearce. For other designs related to Bellamont Forest see also E.2124.32, .67, .74, .157, .158, .166, .181.",
