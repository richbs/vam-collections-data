Shown on the catwalk with vertiginous, claw-like shoes, the look dominated fashion pages and commentary in the months after McQueen's fashion show. This catwalk presentation was also notable for being one of the first to be streamed live onto the internet, where people could watch it in real time, free of charge.",
