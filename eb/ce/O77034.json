The silk is cultivated and woven into textiles on a loom. Vegetable dyes were used to create color. Today, chemical dyes have gained popularity as they are cheaper, less time-consuming and produce a larger variety of colours.  Associated with ceremonial rites of ancient India, silk has been a highly revered fabric.  It continues to be a popular and widely used material.",
