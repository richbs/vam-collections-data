James Ferrier Pryde & Sir William Newzam Nicholson) created  their Yeoman of the Guard [Beefeater] design as a speculative poster, originally  thinking it would make a good advertisement for extract of beef, or for Gilbert &  Sullivan's opera 'The Yeoman of the Guard'. Rejected for both purposes, the  design was sold by The Artistic Supply Company to Harper's of New York (a  pioneer of the artistic poster) who used it to advertise the European edition of  their magazine. The Beggarstaffs insisted on designing the lettering as well as the  image of the poster, and when it was posted up (all over Britain) , it triggered  much favourable and critical comment for its bold, unconventional composition.",
