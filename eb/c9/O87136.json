It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nDante was the stage name of  the Danish-American Harry August Jansen.  One of the greatest 20th century magicians, he was considered the natural successor to the legendary magicians Alexander Herrmann, Harry Kellar and Howard Thurston. The American Magic Circle awarded him the honour of Grand Master of the Royal Dynasty of Magic when Thurston, the previous Grand Master, died in 1936. Sim Sala Bim, the title of his show which he performed on tour at Oxford and at the Saville Theatre in 1946, are words from a Norwegian folk song.  His show included 'livestock productions', 'the Spirit Cabinet' and the 'Girl without a Middle' illusion.",
