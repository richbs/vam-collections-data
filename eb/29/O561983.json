British poster dimensions were based on the double-crown sheet unit which measures 30 by 20 inches. Since this poster measures roughly 60 x 80 inches, its size equals 8 double-crown sheets.  Standardisation of sizes (4-sheet, 8-sheet, 16-sheet, etc.) meant that bill posters could paste posters on the hoardings in modular fashion.\n\n\n\nTrading\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, hoardings covered with brightly-coloured posters were a familiar sight. Many of these posters advertised convenience foodstuffs like dried (desiccated) soup, cocoa powder, tinned sardines and bottled sauces, reflecting new consumer demand and retail practice. Advertisers like Samuel Benson, whose firm S.H. Benson (established in 1893), produced this poster, developed techniques of branding and total campaign management to exploit new markets.\n\n\n\nDesign & Designing\n\nLettering plays a key role in the design of this bold hoarding poster, whose colour and boldness would have stood out from neighbouring posters. This boldness is matched by the trumpet blasting out the company's claim to be the best. A simple green border of foliage and coffee beans subtly alludes to the product.",
