She was born in Germany in 1967 and educated at the London College of Printing and the University of Westminster. \n\nLuxemburg's early work presented London as a city filled with raucous visual noise, typified by the dazzling after-images of car headlights streaking through deserted spaces. In 1999 she exhibited a series titled Liebeslied (Lovesong). This time her large-scale colour images captured a fin de si\u00e8cle city filled with reflection, memory traces, reverie and history. This nocturnal view can be seen as a symbol for the starting or finishing point of a journey. Luxemburg's view of London was informed by the night poems of the German Romantic poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin and with such contemporary writers on the city such as Peter Ackroyd and Iain Sinclair.",
