Bazaar catered for the new generation of young adults with money and time to enjoy shopping, and it inspired many imitations in 'Swinging London'.\n\nIn 1963 Mary Quant's clothes became more widely available with her cheaper 'Ginger Group' range, but she continued to use a label with her own name for more exclusive designs. This elegant, formal dress employs a sensitive use of quality fabrics with exquisite seam detailing. The donor, Cate Phillips, bought it from the Knightsbridge branch of Bazaar, together with a pendant and chain from Mary Quant's range of costume jewellery, and she wore the dress for many special occasions including trips to the opera at Glyndebourne.",
