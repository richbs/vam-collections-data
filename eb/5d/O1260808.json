My good friend and artist Ruth Marten created a lot of ceramic art and had a kiln in the basement of her mothers house in Queens NY. One day, in 1973, I drove out there and we worked together in her basement. It is made out of white stoneware - I was asking her questions as I was building my shoe with the clay and she was giving me advice as to getting all the air out of the clay and the preparing of the material before starting the making of the shoe. She was working on her own art that day and it was so much fun working side by side. After it was put in the Kiln and fired I went back and put the glaze on the white shoe - I had to approximate the color, utilizing low fire glazes, and was uncertain as to exactly what would be the outcome. After the firing Ruth transported the shoe to me at my studio. I had planned to go back and do some more but I was so busy I never returned.\n\nThe terracotta shoe was made in 1975 at a pottery workshop in Manhattan. I loved making the first shoe so much I wanted to continue and found this place in NYC. I think it was made at the New School, that is my recollection, which had a pottery workshop and kiln etc. and was close to my apartment which was also my studio  - I followed Ruth's directions and also learned new things from the instructor. Because it was a class, many pieces were put in the Kiln at the same time. One of the students pieces exploded in the kiln and my piece fell over and broke the heel. (I was disappointed it happened and I loved the shoe so I wanted to \"save\" it) I think the instructor suggested what I could use to \"glue\" it back together but I don't remember what I used - It probably was an epoxy of some sort. It would be fine if the conservators thought they could repair it so it would not have the white glue line. I'd love to know what they would do to conserve it if that is possible - if not they can work their magic and I can speak to them when I get to London - sorry I don't know what kind of glue or epoxy I used.\"\n\nQuoted in an email from Doug Dodds, 26/03/2013, RF/2013/103",
