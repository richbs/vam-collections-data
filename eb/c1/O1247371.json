During its first season, starting in 1847, it was performed both in its original Italian and also translated into English. The opera was set in the Swiss Tyrol whilst it was occupied by French troops. Lind played Marie, the daughter of the title, and it was one of her favourite roles. Many people considered Lind to be one of the greatest sopranos of her time. In 1850 the circus owner and impresario Phineas T. Barnum persuaded her to embark on an tour of the USA. Barnum promoted the tour heavily, and as Lind was born in Stockholm he dubbed her \"The Swedish Nightingale\". Barnum\"s efforts worked perfectly. When Lind arrived in New York harbour on the 1st September 1850, nearly 30,000 people had gathered to catch a glimpse of her. The tour was very successful, and Barnum grossed $712,000 in just over a year. Lind herself made more than $175,000. Today that would be roughly 68 million and 16.5 million respectively! Jenny Lind was now a superstar. Lind\"s fame had a deep effect on the nature of theatre-going in Britain. As people flocked to see her, opera gained in popularity. This was at the expense of other performing arts, especially ballet, which waned in the public\"s esteem.",
