German.  Dated 1674.  This medal has been hollowed out to form a box, in which were kept two watercolour drawings on paper and ten on talc overlays (NB. all parts are numbered 1058A-1864).  The two drawings are still contained in the medal, glued to each half of the inside of the medal.  One shows a man lounging under a tree with a scenic backdrop; the other shows a lady and gentleman dressed for the evening.\nPLEASE NOTE : This medal is not the silver thaler (coin) of Leopold II (museum number 1058-1864), transferred to the Science Museum (RP 1946/1118).; Anon., German, 17th cent.",
