From 1565 on he travelled to Italy and Paris. He worked on wall paintings in various churches. In Rome he became a protege by Giulio Clovio and Pope Pius V made him court painter. He was then asked to come to Austria (Vienna) by Maximilian Holy Roman Emperor, who died soon after his arrival. Then Maximilian's successor  Rudolf II made him court painter, the court having moved to Prague by that time.\n\nMuller was a Dutch engraver, draughtsman and painter, born into a family of book printers, engravers and publishers, the family business called De Vergulde Passer ('The gilded compasses'). This was situated in Warmoesstraat, and Jan Muller worked there for many years. Between 1594 and 1602 he might have gone to Italy to Rome and Naples. He married the Dutch sculptor Adriaen de Vries, a pupil of Giambologna. He was also acquainted with Bartholomeus Spranger and other artists in Prague, which became a flourishing centre of the arts under Emperor Rudolf II.",
