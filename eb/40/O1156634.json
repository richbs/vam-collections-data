His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nAs well as designing costumes and settings Messel also devised covers for programmes. Many of these were for operas at Glyndebourne, the opera house built onto John Christie's private house just outside Lewes, in Sussex.  This watercolour of oak leaves and acorns  may be a preliminary design for the programme for one of the Glyndebourne seasons.",
