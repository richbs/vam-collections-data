This silkscreen print is an illustration of the spaces (often models) which Iglesias creates \u2013 spaces in which there is a tension between depth and surface. It is quite detailed and delicate, in contrast to the heavy-duty aluminium on which it is printed, and the structures depicted. The aluminium also refers to the metals she uses in her installations. In fact this print is a smaller editioned variation of her large-scale screenprints on copper. \n\nThe imagery is an exploration of three-dimensional space, but because it is printed on metal the surface dominates as it reflects light. The structure illustrated in the print refers to southern Spanish Moorish architecture, but also makes oblique references to homelessness and displacement: the space shown here is a model Iglesias made using discarded materials such as cardboard boxes.",
