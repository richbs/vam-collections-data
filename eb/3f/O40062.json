In the Middle Ages and later they were believed to have miraculous powers and were greatly venerated. \n\nThe relics were kept in special containers, called reliquaries, whose costly materials and beautiful workmanship reflected the importance of their contents. The relics themselves are occasionally visible, set beneath crystal windows and wrapped in a parchment tag with the name of the saint. Cathedrals and major churches accumulated reliquaries and displayed them on or near the high altar on major holy days.\n\nHere, an elegant Gothic architectural structure in miniature supports the now empty relic-holder. This shape of reliquary, in which the relic is the focal point, became fashionable all over Europe from around 1400, but the fleshy embossed foliage is more typical of Spanish work of around 1500\u201350.",
