The text is as follows: LOMBARDY: late 16th century 374 Head of a bearded man in a turban Inscribed in ink \u2018Testa Fiammenca\u2019 and on the back in pencil (in Bernard Webb\u2019s hand) \u2018Benjamin West Collection\u2019 Brush drawing: dark brown wash heightened with white on brown paper 8 \u00bd x 7 7/8 (216 x 199) E.3986-1919 PROVENANCE Benjamin West; Bernard Webb Bequest 1919 The Webb Bequest contains four other drawings in a similar technique by the same hand (see nos. 472-75 below). They were all formerly attributed to Giovanni Lanfranco on the strength of the inscription on 471. This attribution is certainly incorrect, but it is difficult to substitute another. Ames, the author of the commentary on the Italian drawings in the first work cited in the bibliography, proposes Cavedone, but this is not convincing either, and Ames abandons it is the second book cited, where the drawing is catalogued as anonymous, 17th century. The free, impressionistic ise of white heightening suggests an artist in the circle of Gaudenzio Ferrari. But the drawings appear to be much later in date. They may be late examples of a tradition of drawing established by Gaudenzio and his followers; or they may be old forgeries or pastiches in imitation of such artists as Polidoro (in the case of no. 472) and Castilgione (in the case of no. 474).",
