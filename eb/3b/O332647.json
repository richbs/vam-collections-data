Above the tiara of each mask is a fringe of flowers (with stalks and leaves) which juts out from the edge of the dish. In the intervals between the fringe of flowers is a leaf motive, also jutting out from the edge. Variously coloured in blue, brown, green and yellow on a blue ground with details left white.
