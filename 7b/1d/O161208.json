Fine and blunt styluses were used to create the cabling on the border. Curved and straight carving tools were used to create the scrolling foliage patterns. \n\nArchaeologists have uncovered fragments with very similar decoration in the Tuscany region and the excavated evidence suggests that this style was popular from the end of the 15th century and well into the middle of the 16th century. Several dishes formerly in private collections in Italy and in Paris and others in the Museo Nazionale in Florence and the Mus\u00e9e National de Ceramique at Sevres, have the same scrolling foliage pattern on the wide border rim as in this dish.

It's finely executed incised decoration would suggest a high original purchase price. The fantastical bird in the centre may be the device of a noble family.\n\nA variety of incising tools were used to create the decoration through the slip. Fine and blunt styluses were used to create the cabling on the border. Curved and straight carving tools were used to create the scrolling foliage patterns. \n\nArchaeologists have uncovered fragments with very similar decoration in the Tuscany region and the excavated evidence suggests that this style was popular from the end of the 15th century and well into the middle of the 16th century. Several dishes formerly in private collections in Italy and in Paris and others in the Museo Nazionale in Florence and the Mus\u00e9e National de Ceramique at Sevres, have the same scrolling foliage pattern on the wide border rim as in this dish. It is likely that these dishes were all made in a Tuscan workshop.",
