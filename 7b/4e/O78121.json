The image is made by cutting lines into the surface of a flat piece of metal, inking the plate and then transferring the ink held in the lines onto a sheet of paper.\n\nSource\nThe print  is entitled The Conversion of Saint Paul. It is a copy of another engraving based on a painting by the Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens. The original oil painting dates from  around 1621, and the V&A print was made sometime between then and 1657, when the publisher, Pierre Mariette, died.\n\nThe painting was in Berlin but was destroyed during the Second World War. An oil sketch of the same subject but with some differences in the composition, is in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis print depicts a dramatic event  in the life of the apostle Paul described the Bible (Acts 9:1-9). Paul was Jewish by race but inherited Roman citizenship from his father. He was riding to Damascus to obtain authorisation from the synagogue to arrest Christians when he was blinded by a light from heaven, which also caused him to fall to the ground.  He and his companions heard the voice of God asking him why he was persecuting Christians. Paul was later baptised as a Christian, and together with Peter,  was seen as one of the joint founders of the Christian Church.",
