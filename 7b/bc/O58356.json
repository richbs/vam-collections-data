Drawers had been fitted into Catalan bridal chests, Spanish and German writing cabinets and European travelling chests since the early 16th century.  However, by the mid 17th century, chests of drawers gradually replaced ordinary chests, with no drawers, as their convenience for storing clothes, blankets and other textiles became more apparent. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe engraved ivory and mother of pearl decoration is found on gunstocks of this period. These materials had been used on Spanish, Neapolitan and Netherlandish furniture since about 1600.",
