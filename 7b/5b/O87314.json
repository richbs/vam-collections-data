The casket is of composite construction, with the sides and lid made up of a large main panel of bone (with the exception of that at the front, which is ivory), surrounded by thin boarder strips of coarser bone.",

It is of significance that the bottom of the casket (as an illustration of the reuse of earlier pieces) is made up of bone strips of ornament almost certainly of a German origin.\nBy the end of the 12th century the casket had been converted into a reliquary by the addition of gilt-copper mounts (three hinges replaced two) and lock, and had been embellished with small six-petalled rosettes. The rosettes are identical to those found on ivory caskets in the treasury of St Servatius in Maastricht, and the lock plate - with ball-headed nails - is also of very similar type to those found on the caskets there. The tiny gilt copper pinecone on the lock clasp enables the metalwork to be dated to around 1180-1200. It is therefore probable that the casket was modified in Maastricht or nearby in the Lower-Rhine area.",
