Cross bought the concern from Stefano Polito in 1814, but there had been a menagerie there from 1773, on the first floor above a parade of shops. Edward Cross renamed the collection the Royal Grand National Menagerie, and employed a doorkeeper dressed as a Yeoman of the Guard. The elephant advertised on this poster was Chuny who Polito had bought from Covent Garden Theatre, but who was put to death in 1826 after becoming violent. \n\nExeter Change was originally built as The Exeter Exchange in 1676 on the north side of the Strand in London, on the site of Exeter House. Before Polito owned the menagerie it belonged to Gilbert Pidcock who had a travelling menagerie and who had illustrated some  posters with engravings by Thomas Bewick. Bewick excelled at portraying animals and produced A General History of Quadrupeds in 1790, illustrated with his own engravings produced on boxwood. The style of this lion engraving is similar to a Bewick engraving of a Bengal tiger on a poster Pidcock issued for his travelling menagerie in 1795.",
