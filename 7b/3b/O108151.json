The design was inspired by a costume for Anne Boleyn in the film 'Anne of the Thousand Days' (1969).  Angela describes how the designer 'immediately understood my dream.  She and my mother talked me into softening the period style and using the idea of a crinoline to make it more bridal'.  There were gasps from the wedding guests when they caught sight of the bride walking down the aisle.",
