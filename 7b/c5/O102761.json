The bright colours and relative simplicity of the designs by Norman Wilkinson were in complete contrast to the detailed, often cumbersome productions that were the legacy of 19th century realism.  \nThe costume combines doublet and breeches in one, making it comfortable and easy to move in. It was also equally flattering to the male and female figure - necessary not only because Viola spends much of the play masquerading as a boy, but because her twin brother, Sebastian, also has to wear a costume of the same design.  \nThe costume was made of 8 yards of black silk costing \u00a31.11s.4d (about \u00a3111.15p at 2008 prices), 12 yards of green silk costuing 18s.00d (about \u00a363 at 2008 prices); to dye the 6 pieces braid cost 13s.6d (about \u00a348 at 2008 prices).  The total cost of Viola's costumes was \u00a335.10.7d (about \u00a32520 at 2008 prices).",
