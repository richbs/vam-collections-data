However, the Worcester porcelain factory sold small bowls like this according to their capacity, and did not call them slop bowls, which suggests that they could be used for a variety of other purposes.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Worcester factory was the first to solve the problem of printing in cobalt blue onto the porous unglazed surface of 'biscuit-fired' porcelain. Worcester introduced transfer-printing in blue around 1759-1760 and concentrated on making these relatively cheap wares by the time that this piece was made. The neat cut in the border pattern (near 6 o'clock) suggests that this piece was printed using paper transfers. The transfer was first printed with the design from an engraved copperplate. It was then pounced (dusted) with a cobalt compound, which adhered only to the printed lines. The design was transferred to the unglazed ware by rubbing the back of the sheet. Other printing techniques involved pouncing onto the ware, not the transfer. They were unsuitable for printing biscuit porcelain, as the pigments would have adhered to all the rough, unglazed surfaces of the ware.",
