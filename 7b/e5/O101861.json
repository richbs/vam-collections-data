It is divided into two panels by a column wreathed with ivy. \n\nOn the left is the November scene with a man and woman engaged in beating the flax stems which have already been steeped in water. The flax stems are arranged in semi-circles around them. Behind them is a tree which has lost most if its leaves and there are cottages and other trees in the background.\n\nOn the right is the December scene with a pig being killed. In the foreground a man is cutting a pig's throat and an old woman is catching the blood. In the background, a young man is scraping a dead pig and a woman is pouring liquid over it to help in the process. Behind them, a man and a boy are making a bonfire. Cottages, a tree and other peasants are in the background.\n\nTop border with two swags of fruit and flowers, and in the centre is a medallion with the names of the two months. The side borders have two tiers of ornamental vases with heavy swags of fruit and flowers hanging from them. The bottom vase on the left has on its base the sign from the zodiac for Sagittarius and the one on the right has Capricorn, the signs of the two months in question.",
