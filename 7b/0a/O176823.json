Both compositions lie behind a group of putti and two griffins among the 'various ornaments for the components of ceilings' in the Treatise. The cross and inscription probably refer to the selection for the Treatise. The spectacular spiral staircase is shown in a wide-angle perspective view, cat.rea, which characteristically changes the original (the last part of the balustrade is in fact solid). The verso of 5712.317 is a first sketch for this drawing, no doubt made on the spot. The sketch plan cat.res shows the fountains before the casino, designed by Jacopo Barozzi Vignola. As usual, Chambers has modified the original, adding many niches to the water ladder section (and giving no hint of the dolphin-shaped basins of the ladder) and altering the fountain on the top.
