The purple ground is embellished with velvet pile in a deeper tone, which is framed by black satin edgings and elongated loops with knot buttons.  The crossover section, closing the garment from left to right, is secured by pairing a set of loops and buttons vertically across the collarbone.  The other fastenings are arranged horizontally at the neck, at the side, and at the stepped hem respectively.  We should not presume that the large design of velvet peonies indicates that this garment was for a woman.  It was originally described in the museum records as the type of garment 'worn by Manchurian ladies'.  A tag sewn inside the jacket includes the term 'riding jacket', a name commonly used for a Chinese man's short jacket.  The Museum acquired this garment  from the Japan-British Exhibition held in London in 1910.  This event was a showcase for Japanese imperialism, a way of showing that the island nation was bent on widening its spheres of influence.  Manchuria, in noth-east China, was one of the areas Japan  wished to penetrate.",
