It's design was influenced by Hans Coray's pre-war pressed aluminium 'Landi' chair and enlivened with Pop Art's vibrant use of colour. The 'Omstak' is still in production, although its use has moved away from the home to commercial settings. With its foundations in industrial mass-production, the High-Tech aesthetic transcended national borders and stood in opposition to the Craft revival of the 1970s.",
