The faceted studs with which they were set were designed to sparkle and reflect light.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe most famous maker of cut-steel jewellery at the end of the 18th century was Matthew Boulton who was in partnership with John Fothergill from 1762 to 1781 and James Watt from 1775 to 1800.  Watts' 'rotative steam engine' was installed in the Soho Manufactory in Birmingham in 1788.  It was known as the 'Lap Engine' and drove the wheels used to grind and polish various steel wares including buttons, which were one of the principal products of Soho.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Boulton pattern books show many pages of designs for buttons and customers were supplied with cards of designs from which to make their choice.  In 1777 Boulton was charging 28 guineas for a full set of cut-steel buttons.  A caricature published in the same year entitled 'Steel buttons / Coup de Bouton' shows a fashionably dressed lady knocked backwards by the light reflected from the coat buttons of a gentleman.\n\n",
