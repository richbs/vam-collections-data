In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>Scene from Moli\u00e8re's 'Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme': Monsieur Jourdain Learning to Dance (attributed to W P Frith)</b> \nP6-1979 \nCanvas, 63.5 x 72.2 cm (25 x 30 ins) \nGiven by Michael Hall, in memory of the late William Mills, 1979 \n\nThe work is evidently unfinished, rather than an oil sketch. The subject is taken from Moli\u00e8re's most celebrated play <i>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>, act 2 scene 1, first performed in 1670; the quintessential <i>nouveau riche/arriviste</i>, Jourdain, is attempting to learn the manners and habits of the aristocracy. \n\nThe painting was given to the Museum as a work by C R Leslie; the donor William Mills bequeathed it, through his friend Michael Hall, in order - in his own words - 'to complete the set' of Moli\u00e8re subjects depicted by Leslie, including one of the first paintings given to the Museum, by John Sheepshanks in 1857, showing Monsieur Jourdain learning to fence (see FA116 below). It seems more likely that the painting is by W P Frith, and this opinion is shared by Robin Hamlyn of the Tate Gallery, who is preparing a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Leslie's works. The present painting certainly seems to relate visually to the Moli\u00e8re subjects painted by Frith and exhibited at the RA in 1846 and 1848, of which there are later versions in the V&A collection (see 537-1882 and 538-1882 above). It is possibly identifiable with the sketch for the <i>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i> in the Augustus Egg sale at Christie's 18 May 1863 (143, bt the dealer Cox \u00a352-10-0), but that is described in the <i>Art Journal</i> account of the sale (1863, p139) as 'the finished sketch'.\"",
