He passed a day in company with Mr. and Mrs. phillips and myself, among the beautiful ruins of Cowdry Castle, of which he made several very fine sketches; but he was most delighted with the borders of the Arun, and the picturesque old mills, barns, and farm-houses that abound in the west of Sussex\" (L. ed. S., p. 319) The drawing 'Ruins of Cowdray: Interior' in the British Museum (No. L.B. 24) is dated 14 September 1834, and Leslie's narrative implies that No. 369 [216-1888], and the other sketches of Cowdray at the British Museum, were made on the same day. \n\nNote on Nos. 369-372 [216-1888, 215-1888, 273-1888, 801-1888]\n\nThese four drawings are from the same sketch-book, measuring about 8 1/8 x  10 3/4 ins. (207 x 272 mm.). The dates on Nos. 370 [215-1888] and 371 [273-1888] show that Constable used it when he stayed with Lord Egremont at Petworth in September 1834, and No. 369 [216-1888] was made on the same visit. Other drawings from the same sketch-book are in the British Museum: \nL.B. 12a, 12b Ruins of Cowdray. (Each 203 x 265 mm.) Each watermarked: J \nWHATMAN 1828. \nL.B. 23b Tillington Church. Dated 17 September 1834. \nOn paper extended from that of the sketch-book page. \nL.B. 24 Ruins of Cowdray: Interior: Dated 14 September 1834. \nOn paper extended from that of the sketch-book page. \nLeslie (L. ed. S., p. 319) describes the sketch-book as follows: \"While at Petworth, where Constable spent a fortnight, he filled a large book with sketches in pencil and watercolours, some of which he finished very highly\".\u201d",
