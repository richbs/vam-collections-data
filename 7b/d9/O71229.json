            "public_access_description": "This jug was probably used for serving beer, cider or perry. It was made at Caughley in Shropshire, but it was decorated at Robert Chamberlain's enamelling workshop in Worcester. Chamberlain was originally a 'pot painting' apprentice at the Worcester porcelain factory. He left around 1786 and started his own business in the same city. At first he ran this as a decorating studio, working as a sub-contractor for Caughley. He also bought Caughley wares and decorated them for re-sale on his own account. \nJugs with cabbage-leaf moulded patterns were very popular in Britain between the 1750s, when the design was introduced, and about 1800. Cabbage-leaf jugs could have a pouring lip formed as a mask or a plain cylindrical neck. They were first made at the Worcester porcelain factory. A Worcester porcelain price list of about 1755-1756 describes them as 'Dutch Jugs'. They were then made at Lowestoft, Caughley and several of the Liverpool factories. The design was also copied in Chinese porcelain for export to Europe.",
