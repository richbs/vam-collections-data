That is why we profess spiritual kinship \nwith primitive and archaic art.'</i> \n \nDuring the 1940s and early 1950s Gottlieb's painting took the form of 'pictographs' whose themes were derived from classical myths. Symbols and images generated by the Surrealist technique of automatism - a kind of free associational drawing, Gottlieb organized within an informal grid. His notion of the validity of a theme or subject-matter depended upon that subject's ability to speak universally of man's condition. This he saw in 1943 as the spiritual degeneracy he believed had caused the Second World War. These concerns were precisely those of the psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. Jungian psychology is devoted to the understanding of the spiritual needs of Western civilization, and it was under Jung's influence that Gottlieb looked to primitive cultures for expressions of man's essential make-up before its suppression by 'Reason'. Like Jung, he identified myths as supranational expressions of archetypes - prototypic concepts shared by man regardless of culture or race. \n\nBy 1957 his interest in myth had shifted focus and in place of depicting mythic figures he began to examine the structures common to all myth. Contemporary theory accepted only one fundamental mythic structure, and this may have given impetus to his simplification of composition, beginning in this year the series generically known as <i>Bursts</i>, a theme that was to occupy him until his death. \n\nIn common with Rothko and other New York Colour Field painters, Gottlieb saw abstraction as a way of transcending everyday appearances and thus evading the finite associations with which he saw modern society enshrouding the environment. \n\n<i>Blast</i> then is intended to signify the fundamental conflicts present in myth - conflicts that as Jung suggests are also present in the individual personality. In <i>Blast</i> the polarities are not specifically identified. A quiescent sphere hovers over a more mercurial component, in terms of the individual perhaps alluding to the dominance of reason; the geometric, and therefore conscious, above the unconscious. Concerning universal myth, in the opposition of red and black the allusion, if we accept the conventional colour symbolism of the group, is that of life contrasted with death; here austerely formulated according to principles first stated in the 1943 <i>Times</i> letter: 'We favour the simple expression of the complex thought.' \n\nChristopher Titterington\"",
