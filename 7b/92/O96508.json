The leaf was stuck down on a  rectangular wooden panel, and the image was  extended to the corners. The scene represents the interior of a Chinese shop. The display of a fantastic profusion of luxury goods including lacquers furniture, Chinese porcelain and redwares, Indian chintzes and Persian paintings as well as small ivory devotional sculptures, suggests that this shop is probably imaginary. \n\nThe depiction of female shoppers in a mix of Turkish or Persian costume further supports such interpretation. In addition this range of objects in different media suggests that the shop must be a European fantasy as these objects would not have been sold together in China for example. The accuracy with which the wares themselves are represented however implies that the artist was familiar with this kinds of objects.  \n\nThe peculiar perspective which shows a distortion in the proportions in order to make visible a maximum of objects is reminiscent of Netherlandish paintings depicting collectors cabinets such as the ones developed by Frans Francken II (1581-1642) in the early 17th century. A thesis further supported by the fact that the painting seems to imitate other Dutch fans of the period. It has been therefore proposed that this painting may represent a loose depiction of an importer\u2019s shop in a European centre such as Amsterdam.",
