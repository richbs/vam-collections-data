Mexican rebozos, both old and new, use more finely spun yarms and have narrower stripes than do Guatemalan ones.   The Eisen Collection made in Guatemala in 1902 contains nothing similar although a shawl that might be similar to this was illustrated by Josephine Wood in 'Indian Costumes of Guatemala', Austria, 1966 p.42).",
