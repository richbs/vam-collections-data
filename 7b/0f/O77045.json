            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 198-99\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"MULREADY, William, RA (1786-1863) \n\nBorn Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, 1 April (not 30 as is sometimes recorded) 1786, son of a leather breeches maker and amateur draughtsman. Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \nSeven Ages of Man, or All the World's a Stage\nFA138 Neg 16916 \nCanvas, 89.5 \u00d7 113.4 cm (35 \u00bd \u00d7 45 ins) \nHeleniak (149) dates the work to 1836-8, and records an oil sketch (location unknown) pen and ink and chalk drawings in the V&A (6268, 6426) and a reverse drawing in pen and ink in the Jupp Royal Academy catalogues. The painting illustrates the soliloquy of melancholy Jacques in Shakespeare's As You Like It Act 2, Scene 7. Mulreadv's account book records the genesis of this work from its commencement to final payment: '1835 Feb 7; First thought of 'Seven Ages' ... July 11: Comd by Sheepshanks to paint ... 1839 May 17: Balance for Seven ages (Total payment \u00a3787.10s)'. The design was also drawn on wood as a frontispiece to The Illustrations of Shakespeare's Seven Ages published by J Van Voorst in 1840. \nAs Pointon observes, this painting was Mulready's one serious attempt at a large-scale allegorical presentation. It was also his sole venture at the popular genre of pictures with Shakespearean subjects so successfully exploited by C R Leslie and others. \nWhen first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1838 W M Thackeray, writing as 'Michaelangelo Titrnarsh' in Fraser's Magazine June, 1838, p759, waxed lyrical on Mulready's success: 'King Mulready, I repeat, in double capitals; for, if this man has not the crowning picture of the exhibition, I am no better than a Dutchman. His picture represents the 'Seven Ages', ... not one of those figures but has a grace and soul of its own: no conventional copies of the stony antique; no distorted caricatures, like those of your \"classiques\", David, Girodet and Co. but such expressions as a great poet would draw, who thinks profoundly and truly, and never forgets (he could not if he would) grace and beauty withall).' Thackeray, an accomplished caricaturist, accompanied this panegyric with an engraving of Titmarsh placing a laurel wreath on the brows of a bust of Mulready. \nLater critics were less enthusiastic. The Illustrated London News (25 July, 1863, vo143, p93) commented on the 'rather flimsy though elegant mannerism of The Seven Ages', and the Art Journal in 1864 (p13) complained that ... 'it is far below the standard of his pictures from \"the Vicar of Wakefield\".' The 1864 catalogue entry (78) contains a long and detailed description of each character in the painting. \n\nEXH: \tRA 1838 (122); Society of Arts 1848 (XXVI); William Mulready South Kensington Museum 1864 (78); Arts Council, Romantic Movement, 1959, (264); Bristol Cathedral, Victorian Narrative Painting, 1977; William Mulready, V&A 1986 (118) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
