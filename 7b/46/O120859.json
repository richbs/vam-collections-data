In some cases they were very close to the designs that inspired them, and intended to deceive.  Other pieces, like this casket, were simply in the style of the eighteenth century and may never have been meant as fakes. Porcelain-mounted furniture was all the rage in the second half of the nineteenth century.  John Jones bought many fine pieces dating from the reign of Louis XVI, nearly a century before, and left several of them to the V&A. We do not know whether he knew the age of this piece when he acquired it. The triangular and diamond-shaped plaques are very different from the shapes produced by the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory in the eighteenth century, but in the nineteenth century knowledge of such details was only in its infancy.",
