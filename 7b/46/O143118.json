Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived to the present time and one of its basic teachings is of non-violence. The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'. The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara. The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\n\nThis folio shows 'Diksha'. On his renunciation of the householder's life, Mahavira, the 24th and last Jain saviour, is plucking out his hair, which is collected by Shakra (or Indra), king of the gods. Jain monks on their initiation still pluck out a lock of hair today.",
