In the 1840s men began to wear darker coloured and more richly patterned waistcoats, such as this black velvet with red, blue and yellow check. The patterns of men's waistcoats in the 19th century offered an outlet for individual expression as coats and suits gradually became more uniformly dark in colour.",
