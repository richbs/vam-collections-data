            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nHeraldry became a common feature of 16th-century glazing programmes. The nobility used spectacular coats of arms to advertise their family and social alliances. Those elected as knights of the prestigious Order of the Garter commemorated the honour by depicting their arms surrounded by the garter device and motto. The Order had been founded in 1348 by Edward III and was the highest order of English knighthood. \n\nPlace\nThis shield with the garter device  was salvaged from Barham Hall in Suffolk, the home of the Southwell family in the 16th century. When the hall was demolished around 1840, this and three other panels were leaded into a window in a new property built on the site.\n\nPeople\nThe shield depicts the arms of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk (1473-1554) in the top right quarter, alongside those of England, Warren and Fitzalan. Howard was a powerful English nobleman who, like his father, served Henry VIII as a military commander. This is reflected in the family's coat of arms which feature a small shield bearing a lion within a border similar to the arms of Scotland - a device awarded to the 2rd Duke in recognition of his victory over the Scots at the battle of Flodden in 1513. It is not known why the arms of the Norfolk family should be found in a house belonging to the Southwells. \n\nAlteration\nStained-glass panels are vulnerable to damage and often require 'releading', in which the panes are reassembled in new leadwork. This process sometimes gives rise to mistakes. In this instance the Howard arms have been displaced from their correct position in the top left corner.",
