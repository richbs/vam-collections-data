Knife handles, spoons and forks, together with servers and other implements of the table made by silversmiths, are known as \u2018flatware\u2019. Flatware production was often a family business. Decoration of flatware was produced mainly by the die-stamping method, where silver \u2018blanks\u2019 are pressed between two steel dies or moulds previously carved with the imprint of the design. The dies were expensive to produce and intended for mass-production.\n\nThis spoon is marked on the handle, 'NW', for Nelson Walker, 'MONTREAL' and imitations of the English duty and sterling marks. From the late 18th century, Canadian silversmiths frequently imitated English hallmarks. The sterling and duty marks have been only partly struck to accommodate imperfections in the copy.",
