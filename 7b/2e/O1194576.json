John Tiller (1854-1925) made a significant contribution to British dance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, streamlining the presentation of dancers and making popular dance a commercial venture. Tiller was the director of the Comedy Theatre, Manchester in 1885 but established a dance school in Manchester and a parallel organisation in London famous for its rigorous standards and ability to provide dancers as required for any production. By the late 19th century his troupes were performing in ballets and pantomimes all over the world.",
