In 2006 on its return from loan, no trace of these was found and it is presumed that they were removed (as non-original) before the chest was sent on loan to the Commandery Worcester, January 1977- Jan 2006. The remains of the nails that held the pilasters are visible, and there is a groove cut on the underside of each end rail, possibly to secure the lower drawers. The height of the legs and lack of obvious structural support for the low drawers suggests that the chest was not originally designed with low drawers.",

V&A W.18-1958. The Offley chest (Southwark Cathedral) c.1585, made by German immigrants is one of the earliest English examples, while others c.1620 and mid-17th century are illustrated in the Dictionary of English Furniture (Chests, figs.25 and 30), but the type is found less frequently than conventional chests that survive, presumably because they required more work and skill to construct. V&A 657-1883, which is (in terms of construction) a chest on chest-of-drawers develops the type further. The type seems to have been particularly popular in late 17th century New England (see examples from the Connecticut River Valley, illustrated in Victor Chinnery, Oak Furniture. The British Tradtion (Woodbridge, 1979), figs. 4:203-211), where an English pattern of the preceding generation remained popular.\n(see also Victor Chinnery, Oak Furniture.
