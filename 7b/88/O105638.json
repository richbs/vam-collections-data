First performed in 1841, it told of the innocent girl, wooed by Duke Albrecht in disguise.  When his true identity is revealed and his engagement to an aristocrat, Giselle goes mad and kills herself.  In the second act, she becomes a Wili, the spirit of a girl who dies having been jilted by her lover but saves the repentant Albrecht from the vengeful spirits. The dancer's gesture is uncertain.  She may be using the traditional mime gesture for 'remember' or, less likely, it might be a reference to her madness.  The blue tint is a reference to the night, when the Wilis rise from their graves to take their revenge on any man who crosses their path.",

Of the twenty-four plates, eight recorded ballet dancers.  \nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
