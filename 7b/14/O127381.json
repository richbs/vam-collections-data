It was intended to illustrate one of the popular abolition ballads originally composed by Cowper in the spring of 1788. The ballad reflects a common belief that natural disasters which struck the land and seas around Britain\u2019s slave colonies were divine retribution for the human suffering caused by the slave trade. A stanza is printed below the image:\n\n\u2018Hark \u2013 He [God] answers. Wild tornadoes / Strewing yonder flood with wrecks, / Wasting Towns, Plantations, Meadows, / Are the voice in which he speaks.\u2019\n\nThe portentous tone of the ballad is reflected in Fuseli\u2019s image: dark clouds swirl above a stormy sea where a flash of lightening illuminates the hull of a wrecked slave ship. In the foreground a standing black male figure in a loincloth raises his fists in triumph. His dark-skinned female companion, in a white dress, curls one arm around his waist, the other stretches out in a gesture of warning. This image of defiance is remarkable amongst the majority of those produced by the abolitionist movement which more typically depict black Africans as passive victims.",
