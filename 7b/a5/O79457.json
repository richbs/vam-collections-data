This image on the printing plate was the reverse of the final image. The grooves were then filled  with ink and the image was transferred onto a blank sheet of paper.\n\nPlace\nHoughton Hall is a magnificent country house in Norfolk, built by Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister, in the 1720s and early 1730s. The ornate ceiling shown in this plate matched the grandeur and richness of the rest of the saloon.  In the 1760 edition of Isaac Ware's book it was described as 'forty feet long, forty high and thirty wide; the Hanging is Crimson flower'd Velvet; the Ceiling painted by Kent, who design'd all the Ornaments throughout the House. The chimney-piece is of Black and Gold Marble of which too are the Tables.'\n\nSubject Depicted\nThere is a large coving, or concave moulding, between the top of the wall and the highly decorated rectangular area in the centre of the ceiling.",
