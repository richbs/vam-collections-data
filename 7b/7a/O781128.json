A young couple walks in the countryside, while unseen by them, death in the form of a skeleton lurks behind a twisted and leafless tree.  The couple is a study in youth and beauty: the man stalwart and handsome, wearing a sword and dashing feathered cap; the woman demure, finely dressed and ornamented with an intricately-designed bodice, slashed sleeves and a tall patterned bonnet.  The man looks towards his paramour as he gestures towards their path with one hand.  To his left is a tall plant with a grassy seed head which may refer to the transience of nature and by analogy to human existence.  Behind them, death scowls in their direction, holding aloft another vanitas symbol in the form of an hourglass.",

ISBN 089835000X. No. 94, pp.209-211.\n'The young couple is closely akin to D\u00fcrer's earlier drawing \"Young Couple Walking\" (SD.1492/3), which, in turn, is closely related to a similar drawing by the Master WB (Wolfgang Peurer?) in Erlangen. Death, lurking in the background and holding an hourglass, is not meant as an immediate threat, but as a reminder of transience, i.e., the brevity of all worldly pleasures. D\u00fcrer returned to this theme many times during his career. The ostrich plume in the young man's hat indicates his batchelor status. His shoes are modern for the date of this engraving, whereas his companion's still have the traditional pointed toes. The initials on the border of her dress have defied interpretation. One would expect once more to see a sprig of sea holly, but instead, the artist has placed a large plant prominently in the foreground, immediately next to the inviting hand of the young man. This plant seems to be D\u00fcrer's invention. Its leaves are a cross between gentian and rumex, whereas the seeds are those of a tall genus of grass. It may refer to the scriptural passages that all flesh is like grass; grass dries up and flowers wilt.\n\nA very similar couple, in mirror image, appears in the drawing \"The Pleasures of the World\" (SD.XW.163) in Oxford.'\nHeller, Joseph. <u>Das Leben und die Werke Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>.
