The technique of using specially prepared white card  and a particularly dense black ink shows that it was  made for a line block print, then a relatively new  technique.  The patches of glue where an old mount has  been removed imply that the drawing was exhibited at  some stage, after it had come back from the blockmaker. The phrase 'Arts and Crafts' first appeared in the  name of the Society.  The motif of a divine child in a  reed boat, using his garment for a sail, in frequently  found in European mythology, and symbolizes the dawn of a new era.",
