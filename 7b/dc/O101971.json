Thus the fabrics, cut and style of a theatre costume are at once recognisable as historical period and yet bear the signs of the age in which the production is being staged.  If the play was produced twenty years before or twenty years later, the costumes would be treated quite differently.  \nAlix Stone's design for a Whore in Jules Massenet's opera Manon, was created for the English National Opera in 1974.  The silhouette recreates the 18th century style in terms of the 1970s, mixing corduroy, crystal organza and synthetic fabrics with velvet, lace and gold ribbon trims.  Corduroy was known in the 18th century, but it had a working or country connotation, and would never have been used in dressing following the fashionable style.  In using it, designer and maker are giving a subtle indication of the character's situation and station in life - aping society but standing outside it.",

Thus 18th century in style, the use of fabrics like corduroy, are characteristic of the 1970s when the production was created.",
