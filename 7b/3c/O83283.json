Ceramic table tops have a long Western tradition. They were generally made in the form of single plaques placed on wood supports either of four legs or on a central pedestal. They were particularly fashionable in France; some of the grandest were made at the S\u00e8vres porcelain manufactory and were often given as diplomatic gifts.\n\nThe top is formed of eight shaped panels around a central round medallion, Each illustrate scenes from  Firdowsi's epic the Shahnameh; or Book of Kings, along with historical personalities, in Sassanian and Safavid period costume, including Shah Abbas I (r.1587-1629).  The central panel features the duel of the hero Rustam with his enemy Ashkabus, identified by inscriptions in nastaliq, while those arranged around the outside feature other famous characters who are identified by name. The source of the narrative scenes was probably coloured lithograph illustrating mid-19th century editions of the &lt;i&gt;Shahnameh&lt;/i&gt;. The introduction of the lithographic process in Iran in the 1840s enabled the great Iranian classics to be printed relatively cheaply and easily circulated.",
