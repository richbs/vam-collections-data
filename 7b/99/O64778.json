The lower half of the crinoline consists of a closed spiral of watchspring steel encased in red cotton tape; the spiral is suspended on four lozenge-patterned red cotton tape straps which hang from a waistband of lined and topstitched red cotton tape.  The crinoline fastens at the waist with a prong fastening of mild pressed steel.\nThis is likely to have been worn by a teenage girl, especially if she was in a situation where she was being treated as a young adult, such as employment.  Its narrowness, as well as the wear visible in the tapes, indicates that it was for everyday wear.",
