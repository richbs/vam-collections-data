            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis writing desk is similar in form to a bureau, introduced in the17th century, in which a folding writing surface is combined with pigeon-holes and other storage space. However its designer, the architect C.F.A. Voysey (1857-1941), did not replicate the shape of conventional bureaux in this piece. Traditional bureaux often included details drawn from classical architecture, including columns, pediments and cornices, and the bases were enclosed cupboards. However, the lower section of this object is open, the writing surface does not fold up at an angle to cover the pigeon-holes and there is no architectural detailing at the top.\n\nPeople\nThis desk was made for the home of William and Haydee Ward-Higgs in Bayswater, London.  He was a successful solicitor, and the couple shared advanced artistic tastes. Voysey was the architect of many country houses, but on this occasion he only designed the interiors and furniture for an existing property.   The desk is a unique piece of furniture produced for a particular client.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe scene depicted on the pierced copper hinge plate shows a rural family group strolling through a pastoral English landscape, framed by an arrangement of heart motifs. This type of emblematic decoration demonstrates how central the ideas of home, family and England were to Voysey's architecture and domestic designs.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe original design for the desk shows it stained green, with blood red leather behind a brass hinge.  Neither of these coloured features was applied and the desk remained unvarnished, merely polished, as Voysey specified for much of his furniture, with hinges in copper rather than brass.",

Some Recent Designs by Mr Voysey. <u>The Studio</u>. 1896, vol. 7, pp.209-218, ill.\nThe illustration of the cabinet on page 217 differs from the cabinet as constructed.  In the drawing the upper and lower hinges are elongated across the width of the door (on the cabinet they are foreshortened).  The drawing does not show the drop-down writing surface as built.  There is a stretcher between the front legs on the drawing which is not present on the cabinet as constructed.  There are no stretchers indicated on the design drawing, in which the cabinet is also stained green. The drawing suggests a dark surface behind a brass panel, possibly to indicate the 'blood red' leather on the design drawing (E.274-1913).  This detail was not applied to the cabinet as built.\n\n'But one thing is sure, that Mr. Voysey's furniture does not take kindly to its commercially produced relatives.  To introduce objects - whether a dainty piece of colour like the painted clock, a simple and useful article like the writing-cabinet, the most refined and charming buffet, or a larger piece like the sideboard or the cottage piano (all illustrated here) - among modern cabinet work and upholstery is to introduce a discordant element.'\n'Designers and Their Work. 1. -Mr. C.F.A.

Although the maker of this desk has not been identified, an inscription on the design indicates that the metal fittings were undertaken by the architect and metal-worker William Bainbridge Reynolds.  Designs for other furniture for the Ward-Higgs's indicate they were intended to be made by the cabinet-makers F. Coote and F.C. Nielsen.'\nPage, Marian. Charles F. A.

London: Lund Humphries, 1979, pp.160, ill, ISBN 85331-426-8, p.59\nIf the small hand-painted clock-case is the best known small Voysey piece then another design of the same year - the design is dated Feb. 1895 - is surely the best known, though again not the most typical, large piece.  This is the oak bureau or 'Writing Table' (as it is described on the design) made for W. Ward Higgs.   For Ward Higgs Voysey carried out, at 23 Queensborough Terrace in London, the fully fitted interior from which much of the best surviving Voysey furniture comes.  The bureau (25) [fig. 25; the drawn illustration of the cabinet from <u>The Studio</u>, 1896] stands on slender legs of octagonal section - the device of chamfering the supports from the square to octagonal section, used here and on the bed described above, became a distinctive trademark - which continue to the height of the moulded cornice at the top of the bureau.  The carcase is slung between them, supported at desk-top and cornice level.  The elegant lines of the piece are enhanced by a decorative panel in incised brass originally laid, the design notes, on blood-red leather.  The panel depicts one of Voysey's beloved pastoral scenes of a strong medieval flavour.  It is stressed on the design that the brasswork is not to be lacquered.  Voysey does not, in this instance, specify the finish of the timber but we can take it that it was to be left clean, 'without stain or polish'.  In conjunction with the unlacquered brass which would quickly dull we get a clear picture of a piece finished in scrubbed oak and dull greyish brasswork.  This is how a piece of Voysey furniture was, without doubt, intended by its designer to look. [The bureau as made had copper rather than brass fittings.]\nKaren Livingstone and Linda Parry, eds., <em>International Arts & Crafts </em> (V&A: V&A Publications, 2005), p.65.\nMichael Barrington, 'The Arts & Crafts Movement, Origins & Ideals', in 'The Intelligent Layman's Book of British Furniture 1600-2000'.
