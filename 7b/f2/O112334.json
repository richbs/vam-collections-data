It was included in the Val\u00e9e system implemented in the 1820s. It was designed for breakdown into three mule loads, including ammunition chests, and weighed under 500 pounds. Because of its greater hitting power (weight for weight) compared with other small cannon and its light weight giving it greater mobility, the design saw service around the world well into the 1860's, notably in Mexico and the American Civil War. Examples of the design even found their way to the Panjab where Sikhs manufactured copies as early as 1843.\n\nThe howitzer was used to fire exploding shells at a high trajectory. It was capable both of indirect fire, or of being used to fire canister at close range directly at an enemy with devastating results. The 4.5 inch calibre brings this Japanese cannon much more in line with ordnance in use with European field armies of the period.",
