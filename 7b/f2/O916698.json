No date, but several water marks, one reading Evans and Sons, 1810.   In original binding, mottled boards and parchment back.  E.124-1896.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.--</b>Cast iron hollow-ware, saucepans, boilers, kettles, butts and other hinges, sash rollers, cowhorn knobs, axle pulleys, stubs and plates, latches, catches and keeps, Norfolk latches, box handles, castors, bolts, sailor's palms, door knockers, and cast iron nails.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--This would appear to be for a factors' list, as the sheet of MSS. pasted on the fly-leaf relates to wares not included in the printed portion.   The sheet is written upon both sides, and the prices are for locks and hinges.   The recipient is reminded, in red ink, that \"the prices fluctuate very much,\" while a note, also in red ink, at the foot of the second page runs thus:\n   The prices of wrought Iron hinges fluctuates so very much that a regular list cannot be sent at present, and the prices of Pewter plates and dishes fluctuates sometimes 4 times per annum and sometimes more frequently.\n   The hollow-ware is of a class still familiar, though less used than formerly, owing to the invasion of enamelled sheet steel pots and pans.   It is interesting to note that, with the Canadian latch, a pattern now freely sold in this country, makers have got back to the cast-iron thumb latch of 1810.   It has been suggested that the cow horn knobs, which are no longer used, were a relic of the days when oxen were regularly employed for ploughing two abreast.   The last page relates to cast nails, lath, wall, plain and headed bills and flooring brads being mentioned.   The brads named were sold by the \" penny \" count, 6<i>d</i>. measuring 2\u215c in., 8<i>d</i>. 2\u215d in., and 20 <i>d</i>. 3\u00bc in. long.   With a few exceptions in the case of weights below 16 oz. to the M. the price was 22<i>s</i>. per cwt.   Prices written in with ink.\"",
