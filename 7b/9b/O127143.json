This tradition derived from 17th-century riding coats, as it allowed the garment to drape comfortably while seated on a horse. Open seams also accommodated the sword worn by all gentlemen during this period. The fashion of the 1740s for extravagant full-skirted coats waned in the 1750s and 1760s. Side pleats were not as deep as the silhouette became more slender.\n\nThe coat forms part of a suit with breeches and waistcoat, all made of felted superfine russet wool. Silver-gilt buttons comprise the only adornment. Such an ensemble would have been worn as formal daywear in Britain.",
