Eve Disconsolate was also known as \u201cParadise Lost\u201d and \u201cEve after the Fall\u201d and depicts Eve in the moment after she succumbs to temptation.\n\nHiram Powers was an American sculptor, who grew up in Cincinnati, USA. His career began when he created animated wax figures for a tableau of Dante's Inferno at Dorfeuille's Western Museum in Cincinnati, where he was supervisor of the mechanical department. He was supervised to model clay and make plaster casts by Frederick Eckstein (c. 1775-1852).\nPowers departed for Italy, Florence with his family in 1837, leaving the USA permanently. His most celebrated work, 'The Greek Slave' was one of the pieces shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851.",
