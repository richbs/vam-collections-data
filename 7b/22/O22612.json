These were chosen by eminent Korean potter and professor Shin Sang-ho, whose own work the Museum has been collecting since 1991.\n\nThe sculpture is formed of a thick rectangular slab of clay.  Two semicircular overlapping pieces of clay \u2013 the smaller one paler in colour \u2013 form a flap on the top third of the piece. At the centre of the base, a triangle of clay has been removed and is linked to the central edge of the flap by a vertical straight-lined incision. In the centre of the flap is a small horizontal and deeper incision. Apart from these incisions, the only other decoration comes from the roughly pitted texture of the surface of the clay.",
