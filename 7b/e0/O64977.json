Floral sprigs sprout from alternating sides of each stripe. There are circular sprigs alternating with single flower heads in a vertical line down the centre of the design. This design is dated May 25th 1712. \n\nJames Leman was born in 1688 into a weaving family of Huguenot descent. In 1702 he was apprenticed to his father, Peter, and lived with his family in Stewart Street, Spitalfields in London. Leman's inscription on the design reveals that it was commissioned by Mr Hinchcliff. Two generations of mercers with this name bought silks from the Lemans between 1712 and 1747. \n\nThis design is from an album that contains 97 designs for fine silk cloth. A constant supply of fashionable new designs from which to create new lines was required, so patternmakers and master weavers like Leman supplied a wide range of designs for different weavers. The album contains some of his work from the period 1706-1716.",
