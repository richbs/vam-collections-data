They were a convenient way to carry writing implements around and remained in use until the late 18th century. Penners were made of ivory, horn, silver or as this one, engraved gilt copper. They were cleverly compartmentalised so  quills and other tools could be stored without damaging them. This example could be fastened to a belt by the loops on the sides.\n\nPenners were essential tools for notaries, merchants and scholars. Around 1490, an Oxford schoolmaster reproved his student for being poorly supplied: \u201cMethinkest thou lackest many things that it is need[ful] for a good scholar to have, first a penner and an inkhorn and then books\u201d. Another young scholar of the same date was better equipped: \"[At] the last fair, my uncle on my father's side gave me a penner and an inkhorn, and my uncle of my mother's side gave me a penknife. Now and I had a pair of tables, I lacked nothing\".",
