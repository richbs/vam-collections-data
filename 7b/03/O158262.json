He is probably more likely to have been the first owner of the set than the maker. If the date is correct, Samuel Fairhead must have been very much aware of new fashions in furniture design.  The square outline of the back was only just coming into fashion in the 1780s, replacing the ovals that had been popular a few years earlier.  The first published designs that show this shape are those engraved for . A. Hepplewhite & Co in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide in 1788.  The design of the centre of the back has no precedent in English published designs.  It is a sophisticated use of the motif of a classical perfume burner, between two columns.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
