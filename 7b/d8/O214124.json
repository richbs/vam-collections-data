Truncated elevation\nof decorative panels at the corners of the cabinet,\nwith cross sections of details of construction of the \ncarcase, showing joints in section, full scale.\nHorizontal section of the front corner and, on the\nright a vertical section, probably of the\nconstruction of the top.\nInscribed in pencil <u>Ebony inlay [deleted] omit</u> and\nwith notes and a scale.\nPencil and watercolour\n88.5 x 33.2 cm \n                                                                        E.109-1994\n...\n<u>Literature</u>: Roger Billcliffe <u>Charles Rennie\nMackintosh, The Complete Furniture, Furniture\nDrawings and Interior designs.</u> 1986, D1904.76.\n\n<u>Exhibition</u>: <u>The Architect as Designer</u>, Victoria &amp;\nAlbert Museum, London, March - September 1994\n\n\nHous'hill was re-decorated and furnished by  \nMackintosh for Major and Mrs John Cochrane (Miss  \nCranston) in 1904. The furniture, made by Francis  \nSmith, was dispersed at sale in 1933 and the house  \nlater demolished. The bedroom suite, including this  \nwardrobe, previously believed to be lost, was sold \nat Sotheby's 21 April 1994. The wardrobe was lot \n227. Comparison with the wardrobe as constructed \nshows that  ebony inlay was indeed not used, the \njoinery and  dimensions vary slightly from the \ndrawing. Some parts of the drawing were lost when\nit was cut down and  damaged, including, probably a \ndetail of the  construction of the foot.'",
