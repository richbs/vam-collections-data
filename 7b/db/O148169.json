Emperor Antoninus Pius, whose full title was: Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius. He was born Sept. 19, 86AD at Lanuvium, Latium and died on March 7 161AD at Lorium, Etruria. He was Roman emperor from  138\u2013161AD. Of Gallic origins, he served as consul (120) before being assigned judicial administrative duties in Italy. He later governed the province of Asia (c. 134). He became an adviser to Hadrian and in 138 was made Hadrian's heir. On accession he had the deceased emperor declared a god; for such dutiful acts he was named Pius (\u201cPious\u201d). He quelled rebellions in Britain and other provinces and built the Antonine Wall.\nMild-mannered and capable, he was the fourth of the \u201cfive good emperors\u201d who guided the empire through an 84-year period (96\u2013180) of internal peace and prosperity.",
