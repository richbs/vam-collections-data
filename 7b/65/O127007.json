It may have functioned as a customs seal, to indicate that tax had been paid on goods passing in and out of the country. One side of the seal represented the arms of the monarch (like this example), the other the location of the customs port.",

This seal depicts the arms of England (the three lions) and France (the Fleur de Lys), signifying the authority of Edward III as King of these countries. The arms upon this seal were also intended to legitimise the rule of Edward III through royal ancestry. The three lions of England, first used in the arms of Richard I (1157-1199), continued to be used in the arms of his decendants as a symbol of the House of Plantagenet and of royal authority. The fleur-de-lys had long been used by French Kings as a sign of their royal position. Edward III incorporated this ancestral device into his coat of arms to promote his legitimacy as King of France.",

            "historical_context_note": "This seal matrix or die is one half of a pair (the other now lost). A double-sided seal was often used to authenticate goods or documents, one side would show the arms of the monarch, the other a unique image indicating the function. It is possible that this matrix is part of a customs seal. Whilst this side bears the arms of Edward III, the other matrix would have depicted the seal for a certain port. Another possibility is that the seal was used for the delivery of wool and hides, however these seals usually indicated the locality on the obverse. The matrix is a late example of the use of the rounded lombardic lettering before the introduction of black letter.",
