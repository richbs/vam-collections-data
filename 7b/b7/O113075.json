The outside tells us that it is an 18th century house because it has two doors opening on each side of a centre panel. \nThe interior has not changed much since the 18th century. The details that you see such as the chimney-pieces and the woodwork show what a real house would have looked like inside more than two hundred years ago. The house would have been made by a carpenter either for a little girl or for an adult, but most interesting of all is that when Queen Mary saw it in the museum she took it upon herself to organise furniture for the house.",
