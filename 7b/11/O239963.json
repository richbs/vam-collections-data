The resulting printout was 12 feet wide and was hung in a colleague's office at Bell Labs as a prank.  The image found fame when it featured in a press conference in Robert Rauschenberg's loft and subsequently appeared in the New York Times on 11 October, 1967.\n\nAnother version was included in a major exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art New York in 1968, entitled The machine as seen at the end of the mechanical age. This is smaller and more recent version of the image, produced in 1997 as a limited edition print.",
