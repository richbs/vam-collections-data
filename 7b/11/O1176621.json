He was an excellent singer, dancer and pantomime performer, and was seen as the successor of Eugene Stratton. One of his best known songs was 'I Used to Sigh for the Silvery Moon'. This caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
