Borgognone' Black chalk heightened with white on grey paper Size of sheet 10 3/4 x 8 1/8 (273 x 206) E.4015-1919 Verso Rough sketch of a seated figure with one arm raised and a child Inscribed in pencil 'Edwards 1912' Black chalk PROVENANCE Bernard H. Webb Bequest 1919 Formerly attributed to Juan Giacchinetti-Gonzalez known as il Borgognone dalle Teste. But Guglielmo Cortese is obviously the artist to whom the inscription refers. The attribution is firmly supported by a comparison with some drawings of the Madonna and Child by Cortese in the Kunstmuseum, D\u00fcsse1dorf, to which Dr Dieter Graf has kindly drawn my attention: for example, FP 7901, 7699, 8162, 8183, 8190.
