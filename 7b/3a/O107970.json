The main motifs of his works are wildflowers, thorns and flowering tree branches - examples of which he always kept in his studio. The lyrical, romantic manner of the artist resulted from his unique working method, by which he created works not by looking at his preparatory sketches but by visualising the actual plants. \nHis motherland is the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Mordovkaya, one of the exhibition's organising bodies. \nThe poster probably was created for the 1973  touring exhibition of the artist's works that travelled to Leningrad, Saransk and finally to Yalta. The address in Yalta was added by hand in order to reduce the cost of printing a different set of posters for each venue. Yalta \u2013 the central city of Crimea \u2013 is the place where the artist spent his summers.",
