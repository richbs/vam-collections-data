            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe art of painting miniatures in watercolour was introduced to England in the 1520s by the Flemish artist Gerard Horenbout and his son Lucas and daughter Susanna. When Hans Holbein came to England from Switzerland  in 1532 to work for Henry VIII, he was an established painter in oil on panel.  But miniatures had become an established court art and Holbein clearly found it advisable to learn this new watercolour art.\n\nHistorical Associations\nIn 1539 it became politically necessary for Henry to form an alliance with Protestant Germany and it was suggested that Henry marry one of the daughters of the Duke of Cleves.  Henry needed to judge whether to proceed with the marriage treaty and Holbein was despatched to paint  Anne and her sister Amelia.  When Anne arrived in England, Henry thought her 'nothing so fair as had been reported', but  the marriage still took place, in 1540.  A few months later Henry decided the alliance was no longer necessary and the marriage was declared null.  He designated Anne 'King's sister' and she settled down to life in England.\n\nContainer\nThe ivory box is difficult to date, but is likely to post-date the miniature. It was turned on a lathe. Paint losses at the edge of the miniature, and the lack of a gold edge line on it, imply that it was trimmed to fit into the box. Such skilled turning of ivory was unknown in England at this date but was common in Germany. It could have been made by a German ivory turner, either in Britain or on the Continent. Collections of virtuoso turned ivories were being formed in Dresden and Munich at the time. However the box probably dates from the late sixteenth century, and as such is one of the earliest and most important post-medieval ivories in the collection.",

Sight size 4.35 cm. Diameter of box 6.1 cm. Diameter of lid \n5.95 cm \nP.153-1910. <i>Salting Bequest</i>. \n \nHolbein was born in Augsburg, the son and, eventually, the pupil of a painter of the same name. About 1514 he went to Basle where he was initially principally employed as a designer for printers. He remained in that city, apart from short visits to France and - possibly - Italy, until 1526, when he paid his first visit to England. He remained there until 1528 and painted a number of portraits of courtiers, including the famous group portrait of the More family. On his return to Basle he found that the fanaticism of Protestant extremism severely reduced the amount of work available to him. He returned to England in 1532, remaining there until his death and enjoying royal and court patronage from 1536. \n\nQueen Jane Seymour died in 1537 and in 1539 Thomas Cromwell, then Lord Treasurer and later Earl of Essex, opened negotiations for the King's marriage to Anne, daughter of the Protestant Duke of Cleves, such an alliance appearing politically advantageous. The English ambassador cautiously reported that 'I hear no great praise of her personage, nor of her beauty' and in the Spring of 1539 the King asked for a portrait, but none was forthcoming. In the Summer the King sent Holbein to Duren, near Cologne, to paint Anne's portrait. An oil-painting, now in the Louvre, and the present miniature resulted. \n\nThe marriage treaty was signed in September and Anne reached England in December, to be greeted with dismay by her wooer who thought her no better than 'a Flander's mare'. However, the marriage took place in January 1540, to be followed in July by an annulment on the grounds of non consummation. The political miscalculation cost Cromwell his life at the end of that July, but the ex-queen was well-treated and lived contentedly in England until her death. \n\nWhatever the relationship of the portrait to reality Horace Walpole's high praise of the miniature as 'the most exquisitely perfect of all Holbein's works, as well as in the highest preservation' remains apposite. The ivory box in which the miniature is housed probably dates from the 17th century. \n\nThe history of the portrait of \u2018Mrs Pemberton\u2019 is veiled in obscurity. The sitter is traditionally believed to be Elizabeth Throckmorton, wife of Robert Pemberton, although the identification cannot be proved. The arms, dated 1556, which appear on the reverse of the case are Pemberton above Longworth impaling More and appear to relate to a Pemberton-More marriage some fifteen or sixteen years later than the miniature itself, which must be dated to c.1540. \nThe nature of the connection between the portrait and the arms is as yet unexplained. Whatever the identity of the sitter this cool, dispassionate portrait exemplifies (along with the Anne of Cleves portrait) a recent critical comment that 'For Holbein himself scale seems to have been almost a matter of indifference; it was simply a question of what size of image was wanted' and that it 'is as dense and monumental in characterization as any bigger portrait'.\n\nHarold Barkley\"\nSusan Doran, ed. <u>Henry VIII.
