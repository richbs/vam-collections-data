In form it resembles a claret jug; although these are generally made of silver-mounted red or clear glass, examples in silver-gilt are not uncommon. The ivory insulators that have been let into the handle, however, suggest that this particular jug was intended for hot water or mulled wine (since the maker's mark is placed immediately above the lower ivory, it probably safe to assume that the insulators are original (Schroder, T., 1988, p.468).\n\nProvenance: Baron Wharton, sale Christie's,  lot 89, March 18, 1970.\n\nHistorical significance: Benjamin Smith III was an important figure in the development of the naturalistic style of the second quarter of the nineteenth century. The fluting around  the foot and neck of the jug retains allusions to classical decoration, but the fluidity with which it is handled on the upper part of the neck and the organic treatment of the handle point toward a new stylistic attitude (Schroder, T., 1988, p. 468).",
