The jacket is cut to fit tightly above the narrow (18-inch) waist, while below it has a deep basque (with pockets) which is stiffened, padded and weighted to create exaggerated 'teacup' curves over the hips.  It is lined throughout in cream poult.  The skirt is long (2'92) and very full (8 yards around the hem).  An elaborate, many-layered petticoat of black poult and net ensures that the knife-pleated skirt maintains its line.  The weighty skirt and petticoat are attached to a sturdy quilted waist yoke which fastens with hooks and eyes at the back.

It was christened on the spot by Carmel Snow, editor of American Harper's Bazaar, as the 'New Look'. \n\nThe amount of fabric required to create a New Look garment - typically 15 metres in a woollen day dress, 25 metres in a short taffeta evening gown - caused outrage, for rationing was still in place. The collection was shown in secret to Princess Margaret at the French Embassy in London. But despite attempts by the Board of Trade to suppress it, the New Look was unstoppable.",
