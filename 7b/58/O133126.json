The Hall has large windows, friezes, paintings and sculptures on the walls. On a balcony, several musicians are playing music. \nGoodchild and his wife are seated, a mace and a sword stand by their chairs. Above hangs a picture of William III; in a niche between the windows is a statue of 'Sir William Walworth Kt', the man who fatally stabbed Wat Tyler, a peasant  revolutionary.\nA very long table with several people seated eating, occupies all the space.\nGuests are served by a few servants carrying trays of food. To the left, a group of grotesque figures eat while being served by a young black servant who is holding a small tray with a glass goblet.\nTo the right several people are trying to get into the banquet hall but they are stopped by a officious beadle holding a card and a long staff. On the card is written: 'To the worship'd Fras Goodchild Es. Sher[iff] Londo[n].\n\nOutside the picture on the right side of the print, there hangs a hangman's rope, a scourge and manacles; on the left side are a sword of state, the mace of the City of London and an alderman's chain.",

The series was aimed at apprentices, an audience Hogarth knew well, having been an apprentice himself. It sought to emphasise the virtues of honesty and hard work through the contrasting stories of Francis Goodchild, a young man who works hard, marries his master's daughter, takes over the business and rises to be Lord Mayor of London, and Tom Idle, who ignores responsibilities, indulges his vices, commits murder and is executed.\n\nPrinted in cheap paper and sold at all the print shop, Industry and Idleness was purchased by masters and hung for the edification of their apprentices.",
