The volume consists of a series of mezzotint plates by the young engraver David Lucas, after designs by Constable. The series 'is regarded as one of the outstanding examples of collaboration between an artist and his engraver'\nHe published at his own expense 'Varous Subjects of Landscape, Characteristic of English Scenery, From Pictures Painted by John Constable', known as English Landscape Scenery, which consisted of 22 plates and came out in two editions, the first in five 'numbers' at irregular intervals from 1830 to 1832, and then in 1833 in volume form. In the introduction he explained that he took his inspiration directly from nature and not like other artists from nature mediated through paintings of the great masters, giving this as the reason why his work was not yet as appreciated as it deserved. The prints were the result of a passionate and sustained collaboration between Constable and the engraver, David Lucas, giving rise to much correspondence and many working proofs.\n\nThe date on the plate shows that it was begun in 1829 and a later, inscribed proof indicates that it was well advanced by March 1830. It appears, however never to have fulfilled Constable's expectations for it was not published during his lifetime. The oil sketch from which Lucas worked is held in the Word & Image Department of the Museum.",
