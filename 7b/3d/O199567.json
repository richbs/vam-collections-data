He holds a book and cross (now broken), and displays the stigmata (the five marks corresponding to Christ's wounds) on his hands, feet and side. The figure was made in two parts in order to fit into the kiln for firing and subsequently joined; a gap can still be seen by the sleeves. Traces of pigment survive on the robes. The figure relates to representations of the saint in glazed altarpieces by Andrea della Robbia, such as those in the Chiesa Maggiore at La Verna and two in Santa Croce, Florence (Medici Chapel and Castellani Chapel). Another version was formerly in the Schiff-Giorgio Collection in Rome.",
