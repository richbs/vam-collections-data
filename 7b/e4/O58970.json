            "public_access_description": "Richard Meares (1647\u20131725) was one of the most important viol makers and music publishers in London in his lifetime. He supplied at least two instruments to James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos (1647\u20131744), who employed an orchestra of musicians who doubled up as servants. Meares also published works by George Frederick Handel (1685\u20131759). At the time Meares made this instrument, viols ranging from treble to bass were often played, by both professional and amateur musicians, in an ensemble known as 'a consort of viols'.",
