Some scholars have suggested that this print depicts Nokaze, a courtesan of Matsuzaka-ya, a large and famous house in the pleasure quarters in Shinagawa. However, the clothes and accoutrements shown are those of a courtesan from Yoshiwara, and the 'mon' is not that believed to have been used by Nokaze. The pine motif on the large lantern is thought to indicate Matsuba-ya, a noted house in Yoshiwara, but since no depiction of a courtesan from Matsuba-ya with the 'mon' shown in this print has been discovered, it is difficult to say for certain that the courtesan depicted is Nokaze.\nChuban size.

Harunobu (ca.1724-1770) was the first great master of nishiki-e. His harmonious colours and lyrical romanticism made a major contribution to the development of ukiyo-e (prints of the Floating World). This print shows a high-ranking courtesan parading through the Yoshiwara, the licensed prostitution quarters in Edo, now central Tokyo.",
