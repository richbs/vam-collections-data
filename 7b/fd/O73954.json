The thirteen sticks are carved in pierced openwork, and the extensions which bear the blades are covered in painted paper. A strip of painted paper connects the mica blades at the base. The plain washer is made of brass.\nThe ivory guards are painted with designs of a tiger, bird and foliage. The same design appears on the paper strip pasted to the inside of each guard.\nThe blades of the fan are decorated with a design in enamel colours, chiefly blue, red and green, of phoenixes and <i>qilin</i> among rocks and flowers. A band of lattice work and floral motifs frames the main design at top and bottom. The blades are also decorated with small fragments of mother of pearl and kingfisher feather appliqu\u00e9, some of which are now missing.\nSupply of ivory, mostly from Africa, India and Southeast Asia, was greatly facilitated by the participation of Western merchants in maritime trade between these regions. The Chinese port city Canton became a thriving manufacturing centre of ivory goods. Made for the western market.",
