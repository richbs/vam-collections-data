This chair captures the tension between tradition and modernity. The antique chair parts are counterbalanced with a new frame, meeting but never arriving at fusion, reflecting the contrasts between old lifestyles and new contexts.  \n\nShao Fan is a sculptor and painter who freely experiments with various media. His name is often immediately associated with his reconstructed, or rather, deconstructed Chairs (?) series of 1996 of which this a part.\n\nThe Chinese character 'kun' conveys many meanings and in this chair Shao Fan plays extensively with these. The character 'kun' is a frame which contains wood, and this is played up in the design. The word also signifies being trapped, or a sense of being troubled, hinting at the mood of the times.",
