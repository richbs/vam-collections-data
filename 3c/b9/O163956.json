Haselden was a self-taught artist who produced both political and theatrical cartoons, originally for Sovereign magazine from 1902-1903 and in 1904 for the next 31 years for the Daily Mirror. He was offered a knighthood by Stanley Baldwin but turned it down because he 'didn't want all that fuss'.\n\nThe cartoon shows a moment from Act II in Stanley Lupino's musical comedy Hold My Hand which opened at the Gaiety Theatre in December 1931. The popular stars of the day Stanley Lupino, Sonnie Hale and Jessie Matthews sang the eponymous song 'Hold My Hand'.  The musical was a hit, cheerful and tuneful, with a suitably frothy nonsensical plot featuring parties and weddings. The Gaiety Theatre was the home of musical comedy in London and as one critic decided: 'Such a show renews rather than merely reiterates the Gaiety tradition.'",
