Peta Motture in European Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum (1996) describes the composition as apparently based on descriptions of a lost work by the Greek painter Apelles, which also inspired Botticelli's Birth of Venus.\n\nPope-Hennesy's attribution to Antonio Lombardo is disputed by Anthony Radcliffe in the catalogue for The Genius of Venice. He cites the large empty spaces in the background as uncharacteristic of Antonio's work and notes that the sensuous form of the body and face are closer to the female figures of Antonio's brother Tullio. He concludes however, that the unbalanced composition is foreign to both brothers and suggests that a sculptor, perhaps of a younger generation is responsible for the work and identifies Mosca as a potential candidate. This opinion has since been revised and the attribution remains that of Antonio Lombardo, as it aappears in European Sculpture At he Victoria and Albert Museum 1996.",
