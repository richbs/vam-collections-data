The group, very likely to be Indo-Portuguese (Goa) and made in about 1700, is an inferior version of a commonly known composition. There are comparable ivories and versions in the British Museum, in the Vatican Museum, the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City and there are wood groups in Brazil. They might depend from an Indo-Portuguese source. Clearly the composition was widely disseminated, perhaps through an engraved source. Goa was the second base in India to be established by the Portuguese, having been conquered by Alfonso de Albuquerque (about 1453-1515) during the reign of Manuel I of Portugal initially in 1510, and then reconquered in 1512. Portugal was interested first and foremost in trade, and the discovery of India was motivated by a desire to dominate trade-routes. But the Christian settlers and missionaries were also keen to convert the native populace to Christianity, and religious images in ivory were commissioned to assist in this. Some were exported to Europe, but others evidently remained and were used for evangelical purposes.",

There are comparable ivories and versions in the British Museum, in the Vatican Museum, the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City, wood groups in Brazil. They might depend from an Indo-Portuguese source. Clearly the composition was widely disseminated, perhaps through an engraved source. The previous owner of the present piece, Canon Gilberston, had been a chaplain in the Royal Navy, stationed on different ships from 1909 to 1923, and may well have acquired the ivory abroad.",
