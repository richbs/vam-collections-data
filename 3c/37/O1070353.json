F H A Wallop from an unrecorded source and placed on loan at the V&A 1929-49; the ownership transferred to Alan Evans, 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 78 (as <i>Duchess of Buccleuch</i>, probably early eighteenth century).\n\nVarious attributions have been advanced: by Wallop, with Long's tacit acquiescence, to Nicholas Dixon or 'Lawrence Crosse'; (1) by the valuer for Christie's 1969 valuation to Charles Beale. None of these is right, and the miniature seems more likely, given its polychrome stipple and its striation, to be a copy after Peter Cross or perhaps Richard Gibson. The style of Gibson's children (with the exception of 'S P Rosse) is completely unknown, however, and one or other might have painted in this way, synthesising their father's dense painterly manner with the lighter and more fashionable stipple of Cross. The work, as far as can be seen through what seems to be restoration, is competent, and technically in fair accord with professional London practice in the later seventeenth century. \n\nWallop's identification of the sitter as Anne Scott seems to have no firm basis. Comparison of the likeness with the accepted images of her in the various Buccleuch houses is not encouraging. The main types are by Lely c. 1670, of which there is a copy by Mary Beale; (2) by Wissing, c.1680 onwards; and a very similar Kneller of about the same date-span. The Lely provides the best comparison as to date, but little resemblance in feature. The portraiture of an eminent lady such as Anne Scott, <i>suo jure</i> Countess of Buccleuch and widow of the Duke of Monmouth, would have been subject to proliferation and variation by painters in all media, so this could be an unrecorded image of her. But there is no evidence that it is, and she is very much the sort of person whose name is optimistically attached to anonymous portraits of about the right date. \n\n1 Wallop Loan Book, p. 160. \n2 Formerly Leggatt Bros, photo NPG.\" ",
