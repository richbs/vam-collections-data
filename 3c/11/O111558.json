Ulrich zum Luft's father was a goldsmith and financier, and it is possible that the beaker is his work. Ulrich's son, Dr Arnold zum Luft, gave the beaker to the Treasury of Basle Cathedral, where he was a canon. According to the 1585 inventory of the Basle Treasury, the beaker stood on a gilt wood base on the high altar, possibly with relics inside it. Such re-use of pieces made originally for secular purposes was quite common. \nWith the rest of the Basle Treasure, the beaker was hidden in a cellar in about 1529, at the time of the Reformation, and remained there until 1827.
