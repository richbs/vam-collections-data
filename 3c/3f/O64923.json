            "public_access_description": "At the end of the twelfth century, Cyprus was conquered by Crusaders, whose descendants ruled for almost 400 years, from 1191 to 1571. During that time, Cyprus became the most important commercial centre in the east Mediterranean, acting as the principal trading hub between western Europe and the countries of the Levant. During this period, production of ceramics flourished, supplying local demand, but also a broad trading network with countries in the east, where the products of Cyprus are frequently found in excavations.\n\nThe two principal production centres were at Lemba, near Paphos, in the south west of the island, and at Lapithos, in the district of Kyrenia on the north coast. In addition, there was probably a production centre at Kato Paphos and at Enkomi, near Famgusta, but the evidence for these centres is not as well preserved as at Lemba and Lapithos. The medieval glazed pottery of Cyprus is a local variation of late- and post-Byzantine pottery and shares the same basic features as ceramics produced in the rest of the Byzantine world. It also has affinities with the so-called \"Crusader\" pottery of Syria and Palestine and shows evidence of considerable western influence, particularly in the decorative subject matter.",
