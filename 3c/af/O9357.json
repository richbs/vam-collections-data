Timur had invaded Syria, and forced potters from Damascus to move to Samarqand. Timur was a great patron of art and culture, and having established his court, he needed craftsmen to supply luxury wares. At the time, Chinese porcelain was available in sufficient quantities to be used as tablewares for dining, but supplies had ceased with the fall of the Yuan dynasty. This dish is a close copy of Chinese Yuan dynasty originals, possibly imitating examples included in the spoils from his campaigns in Syria.\n\nFritware shards painted in blue imitating Chinese prototypes have been found in Samarqand (cf. C.189-1911). The petrofabric of this dish reveals that the quartz, a crucial component, was derived from  sand rather than the usual river pebbles used in Iranian technology to make the body. This confirms that the potters from Damascus working in Samarqand, had brought their technology with them.",
