This fashion came from the football terraces where rosettes would be in your football team's colours; it lasted until punk fashion of the late 1970s replaced the ribbon rosette with much smaller button badges.\n\nDavid Cassidy was a child actor whose success came from the American TV series The Partridge Family in the early 1970s. The characters from the show released several albums of pop songs, which included solo outings from Cassidy. His stature grew and he became a teen idol, selling out stadium concerts in the UK, Australia and America. He continued to record up until the mid 1980s and still performs concerts today, as well as taking occasional acting roles.",
