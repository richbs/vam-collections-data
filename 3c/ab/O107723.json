Her dancing was much admired, but it was her naturalness and expressiveness that aroused particular admiration - as did her attractive bandit costume.  \nThe dancing highlight was a 'pas strat\u00e9gique', when Catarina instructed her sister brigands in musket drill and ended with the corps de ballet climbing up the rocky set before charging at the audience.  \"There is\", remarked one commentator, \"Something piquant in the contrast between the feminine gentleness and softness of appearance and the abrupt preciseness of military movements, and the handling of deadline weapons, which has in all times proved successful on the stage.\"",

The ballet was based on an episode in the life of the painter Salvator Rosa; Caterina, dies when she flings herself between the painter and the sword of his rival.  The role of the female bandit Caterina, provided a strong role for the noted dramatic ballerina, Danish-born Lucile Grahn, whose naturalness and expressiveness were much admired.\nThe music was by Cesare Pugni, the scenery by Charles Marshall and the choreography by Jules Perrot. The ballet was notable for its atmosphere and busy miming with swords and muskets.\nAn engraving related to this print, without the background, was made by A.H. Payne and published about the same time at Leipzig and Dresden with the title in German.",

Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched.  The British lithographs are notable for capturing individual performers and their style, often clearly in a theatrical setting.",
