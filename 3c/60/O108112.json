He had grand plans to extend the original mosque and though most of them were abandoned after his death in 1315, this gateway, known as the Alai Darwaza, is the most notable addition he made. It is 17.2 meters square.\n\nThe decoration on the sides and top of the arch are incomplete, and from the proportions of the remains they suggest that the original fa\u00e7ade, particularly over the arch was higher than the present building. The white marble banding would have extended beyond the current parapet. It is likely that the straight parapet is part of the renovation undertaken by Major Robert Smith in 1829.\n\nThe photograph highlights the decorative elements of the building and the photographer has been careful to catch the light as it comes into the gateway so that it is possible to see the ornate carving inside the building through the archway.",

It is 17.2 metres square.\n\nThe mosque and gateway are made out of rubble. It is the first of many Indian Islamic monuments to use a combination of white marble and red sandstone for the fa\u00e7ade. Its distinctive features are the use of symmetry and the finely carved calligraphic and arabesque decoration on the southern fa\u00e7ade of the gateway. This is also the first monument in which a true arch, using the radiating voussoir s shown here, is fully integrated into the design. The design is influenced by the architectural traditions of the empire of the Saljugs from western Asia.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

            "historical_context_note": "This photograph shows a gateway into the extended Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque. \nIt was built by the Afgan ruler Alauddin Khalji in 1311, as recorded on the inscriptions on the south, east and west arches. He had grand plans to extend the original mosque and though most of them were abandoned after his death in 1315, this gateway, known as the Alai Darwaza, is the most notable addition he made. It is 17.2 meters square.\n\nThe building is made out of rubble and is the first of many Indo-Islamic monuments to use a combination of white marble and red sandstone for the fa\u00e7ade. It is distinctive because of the use of symmetry and the finely carved calligraphic and arabesque decoration on this the southern fa\u00e7ade. This is also the first monument in which a true arch, using radiating voussiors, is fully integrated into the design. The design is influenced by the architectural traditions of the empire of the Saljugs from western Asia. \nArchitects and artisans from western Asia found their way to Delhi after the break up of their empires and they bought with them architectural characteristics such as the \u2018lotus bud\u2019 fringe on the underside of the  arch, perforated windows, arabesque low reliefs, ornamental spandrels, bands of inscription and use of red sandstone and marble.\n\nThe decoration on the sides and top of the arch are incomplete, and from the proportions of the remains they suggest that the original fa\u00e7ade, particularly over the arch was higher than the present building. The white marble banding would have extended beyond the current parapet. It is likely that the straight parapet is part of the renovation undertaken by Major Robert Smith in 1829.\n\nBourne took this photograph on his journey through India during the 1860s. In the published account of his journey, on his first encounter with Delhi on June 25th 1863 he wrote: \u2018Of course Delhi can\u2019t fail to be interesting to the photographer: the Cashmere Gate, the fort, and other noted places must be taken, while its mosques and similar buildings will be photographed for their own merits. About eleven miles from Delhi is the famous Kootub, of which many of my readers have seen Beato\u2019s large photograph, published by Hering, of Regent Street.\u2019\n\nBourne, S, Photography in the East, The British Journal of Photography, September 1 1863, pg  345.",
