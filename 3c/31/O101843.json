In the centre is a crowned lion with four small birds above, below and to either side, enclosed in a hollow lozenge and superimposed on bands of stylised pattern based on flower heads. The border contains a stylised plant in a reciprocal border divided by stylised leaves with saw-toothed edges. This pattern is formed of woollen looped pile in only three colours, ochre, yellow and blue. The blue and ochre form alternate bands across the width of the carpet, solid in the border, where the pattern is formed by the introduction of yellow pile, less thick in the central field, where much of the pattern in the stripes is made by voiding the pile, and yellow being introduced only for details and for the central motif of the lion, birds and lozenge. The carpet is formed of three woven strips, varying from 19.5 to 20 inches wide. \n\nLooped wool pile on a linen ground, with four shoots of linen weft between each row of loops. The carpet has a long fringe of green and red wool bound in alternate patches of varying width by linen thread.",
