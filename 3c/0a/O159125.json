The 'bent' cypress of eyelets is repeated at the outer edge, pointing inwards, on a row of eyelets, edged again in black and white.\nThe wide band joined to the crown roundel is padded and quilted in a series of narrow diagonal lines.  The decorative pattern commenced with a line of light green chain stitch, en encircling line of white eyelets followed by an irregular zigzag, another encircling line and the small and larger 'bent' cypress motifs pointing down; all in white eyelets.  This composite band is repeated in an inverted form along the bottom edge.\nLining: cotton through which the quilting and embroidery has been worked.\nEmbroidery Threads: silk: white 2S; black 2S; green 2Z.",
