Above the arches are a fringe of chhattris which obscure the view of the domes behind. \n\nThe mosque is made of red and buff coloured sandstone as well as white marble and this photograph makes it possible to see the details of the carvings.",

The three figures by the marble porch of the entrance indicate the scale of the building.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites.

The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised.\nThis window mount is similar to others in the collection. It has a label with red edging with the title of the photograph. This type of label and mount suggests inclusion in an exhibition, possibly the Paris exhibition of 1867 or the subsequent South Kensington exhibition for which no catalogue has been found.\n\nHistorical significance: This photograph shows the inside of the Jami Masjid, the principle building of Fatehpur Sikri. This is a close-up view of the central prayer chamber on the western side. The image is dominated by an iwan (large arched recess)  which contains the entrance to the prayer chamber. The great dome of the prayer chamber is visible behind the iwan. The archway of the iwan is 14.63 meters high\n\nOn either side of the iwan are a fa\u00e7ade of arches which lead into long pillared galleries that form part of the prayer hall. They measure 28.65 meters in length each.
