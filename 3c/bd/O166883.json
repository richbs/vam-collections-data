The design is based on the popular 'Sanderson Star', originally designed by the quilt designer Elizabeth Sanderson, and much emulated in the first decades of the twentieth century.\n\nAlthough this quilt cannot be attributed to Sanderson, the design testifies to her significance as a designer and teacher. First apprenticed to the renowed quilted George Gardiner, Sanderson went on to built her own formidable career as a quilt top marker or 'stamper'.  For between 1s.6d. and 2s. she would mark out a quilt top in blue pencil. The top could then be quilted by either professional or domestic quilters.  At the height of her career she was marking up to two quilts tops a day.  Sanderson also ran an apprentice system, training young girls in stamping at her house so that they could eventually be hired as professional markers.",

The design is based on the popular \u2018Sanderson Star\u2019, originally developed by the professional quilter Elizabeth Sanderson, but much emulated in the first few decades of the twentieth century.\n\nHistorical significance: At the start of the 20th century, increased access to mass-produced goods such as bed covers marked a decline in traditional needlework skills. Quilt-making survived in economically deprived areas such as Wales and the north-east of England, where the design and sewing of quilts were both an important means of self-expression and a way of earning money for widows and families with no income.",

            "historical_context_note": "Although this quilt cannot be attributed to Sanderson, the design testifies to the significance of her role as a designer and teacher. First apprenticed to the renowned quilter George Gardiner, Sanderson went on to build her own formidable career as a quilt-top marker or \u2018stamper\u2019. For between 1s.6d. and 2s. she would mark out a quilt top in blue pencil. This could then be quilted by either professional or domestic quilters. At the height of her career she was marking up to two quilts a day. Sanderson continued to support the professional apprentice system. At around the age of 14, girls would work for her unpaid while they carried out their training, which usually took between six months and a year. Sanderson offered them board during the week, and at the end of their training the apprentices could be taken on as professional markers.",
