Bankes (d.1855) used to rest on comparison with portraits of Bankes at Kingston Lacy (National Trust), formerly the home of the Bankes family. In Gauci's drawing, the subject is shown holding a scroll in his right hand, which was thought have been an allusion to his involvement in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphic script. However, research by Joseph Attard-Tabone has proved that it is a portrait of the Rev. Thomas Robert Jolliffe, who published two books after travelling in Palestine and Egypt in 1817.  He has discovered a signed, hand coloured lithograph in the British Museum by Gauci, dated 1823 which is a replica of this drawing, entitled `T.R.J. Vestito da Arabo\u2019 For this and further evidence, see  Joseph Attard-Tabone  `A portrait by Massimo Gauci\u2019 in Treasures of Malta, Christmas 2004, Vol XI, no.1 pp.37-42, published by the Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti.",
