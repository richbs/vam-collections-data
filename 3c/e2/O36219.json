            "physical_description": "The whole is made of various wood; simple carved; painted and polished. When working the two figures spin around the top of the pole and the propellers on their noses turn. The mechanism is counter weighted so a gentle spin occurs over a longer period of time. \n1. upright pole; bamboo. At the top end is a mechanism made of two small bamboo poles held in place by a wooden bar. Mounted on the main pole is a two part spinning knob. The upper part is domed and mounted on a dowel stick which fits into the top of the bamboo pole; through it is a long metal shaft and on one side a restraining bar held by a brass nail and a small pin on the side. The lower part; also held in place by the dowel stick; is shaped like a diabolo; it has two small brass nails which act as part of the restraint for the speed. At the middle point of the supporting bamboo pole is a bamboo bar which protrudes each side. Through each end of the bar passes a length of white string. It is knotted to a wooden knob on one side; goes up the side of the supporting pole; through one of the small bamboo poles; is twisted around the diabolo shape at the top; down through the second small pole; along the side of the supporting pole; through the other end of the cross bar and is finally tied to a piece of slate with a small wooden bead at the top. When the knob of the string is pulled the string and the slate rise and twist the diabolo. As it is spin is released in a controlled manner the metal shaft turns. The figures; 3 and 4; are attached to the ends of this shaft. \n2. stand; wood. Four footed flat stand w1th a round disc in the centre into which fits the bottom of the supporting pole. Under each foot is a small wooden disc painted yellow. The whole is screwed together. \n3,4. figures; bird shaped women painted to show them wearing flying helmets and goggles. Each has a length of wire from the back which attached to the ends of the metal shaft. When the whole is moving the two figures appear to be flying. \n     3. with a red propeller on the end of its long nose; painted to show blond hair; red mouth; mid brown helmet; dark brown goggles; cream collar and cuffs; yellow hands; blue jacket with yellow `buttons'; red plaid skirt; pale blue stockings and pink high heeled shoes. \n     4. with blue propeller on the end of its long nose; painted to show blond hair; red mouth; mid brown helmet; dark brown goggles; cream collar and cuffs; yellow hands; red jacket with blue `buttons'; blue plaid skirt; mauve stockings and purple high heeled shoes.",
