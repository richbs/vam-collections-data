Solis was a prolific printmaker, whose workshop produced ornament prints intended for furniture decoration, jewelry and so on, as well as biblical illustrations. Solis borrowed from German and Italian engravers; this example shows him borrowing from Du Cerceau, who was French. Solis produced popular prints, and the antique theme in this print is typical of the time.",

Solis actually copied Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau\u2019s Duodecim Fragmenta structurae veteris published in 1550 in Orl\u00e9ans. Both Du Cerceau and Solis praise L\u00e9onard Thiry, the artist who made the original drawings. Thiry was a Flemish artist who worked at Fontainebleau with Rosso Fiorentino. It is not established whether he went to Rome; he could very well have been inspired by the many prints showing views of Rome that were circulating at the time. The antique theme, and the taste for views of ruins were indeed widespread in the 16th century. \n\nSolis was a prolific printmaker, whose workshop produced ornament prints intended for furniture decoration, jewellery and so on, as well as biblical illustrations. Solis borrowed from German, Italian and French (as was Du Cerceau) engravers. In the first print (The Illustrated Bartsch, vol. 19, part 1, p. 161, no. 352a), he explains that he has copied this set because it was unavailable in Germany: ' I have realized that it would be for the common good and that of all art lovers, if I were to publish it [...], so that our country would be as fortunate as the Italians and the French'.",
