Scenes from the Life of the Virgin Mary and of Jesus Christ were often accompanied by images of the Old Testament prophets who were considered to have foretold a particular event in their lives. The prophet here holds a scroll with the word 'Ecce' depicted on it. This could be referring to the prophecy of Isaiah who foretold the miraculous conception and birth of Jesus Christ: (Isaiah 7:14) Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son. This prophet probably originally accompanied another stained glass panel depicting the Annunciation of the Archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary.\n\nThis fragment is part of a panel which is composed of many different stained glass fragments. These fragments were originally from a variety of panels made in England and in the Netherlands from the late 15th to the 16th centuries. They were part of the collection of Walter Guthrie. Collectors of stained glass in the 19th and early 20th centuries would often glaze a variety of fragments together and then display them in the windows of their homes or galleries. These are known as 'composite panels'. The current arrangement of fragments in this composite panel was done after they entered the museum's collection.\n\nThese fragments are all clear glass with decoration composed of simple brown/black pigment and silver (yellow) stain. In the early part of the 14th century a new technique of decorating glass was developed. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass which, after firing in a kiln, turns yellow. Many panels from the 14th through to the 16th century are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
