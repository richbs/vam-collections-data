She had trained as a painter but from 1932 onwards concentated on designing for the stage. Fedorovitch created 11 ballets for Frederick Ashton, who regarded her as the ideal designer for dance. She liked to work closely with choreographers, attending rehearsals and developing her ideas as the ballet took shape. On paper her designs appear impressionistic, usually no more than a few brush strokes, but capture the mood and the essentials; the practical details came later and could be worked out with the costumier. It is a way of working that many costume makers prefer, allowing them to contribute their own ideas so that the finished costume becomes the result of a collaborative process. \n\nIn 1940 Fedorovitch designed Andr\u00e9e Howard's one-act ballet  La F\u00eate \u00c9trange, a haunting dream-like piece based on Alain-Fournier's novel Les Grandes Meaulnes.  By chance a boy comes to a mysterious chateau where a betrothal party is taking place. The boy is captivated by the beautiful bride-to-be and his innocent love causes the estrangment of the girl and her fianc\u00e9. The design for two guests gives no precise detail but conveys the grace and elegance of the dancers' dresses, the way that the fabric will fall rather than the type of material to be used.",
