Using cast iron allowed elaborate balustrades like this one to be made easily and inexpensively.\n\nStyle\nWith its sinuous curves and stylised leaves, this baluster reflects the influence of the International Art Nouveau style. This style was popular with both craftsmen and designers of ironwork because its extravagantly sinuous forms and vegetal ornament were well suited to both wrought and cast iron. However, British ironworkers were much more restrained in their use of the Art Nouveau style than continental designers such as Horta (1861-1947), Guimard (1867-1942) and Gaudi (1852-1926) who all produced flamboyant architectural ironwork.\n\nCopyright\nCast objects could easily be copied by taking moulds. Various Acts of Parliament in the late18th century sought to provide copyright protection to designers and from then on these Acts were periodically improved and amended. The markings on this baluster, No. 113 and 314890, refer to the Registered Design Number of this object. In 1883 the Patents, Designs and Trade marks Act, under which this object was registered, amalgamated the categories into which designs had previously been divided and registered both ornamental and non-ornamental designs in a single numerical series, extending the copyright protection to 5 years.",
