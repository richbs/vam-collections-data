They are quite different from men\u2019s buttons in design, and are also much heavier, as they are made from two cast halves, which are soldered together vertically.  This is a type of construction which is not found anywhere else in Europe.  They are similar in design to the buttons worn by women in the village of Pogoni, just across the border in Greece, where they were worn as decoration on the formal outer coat.\n\nThey were bought for \u00a32 2s.
