Tin toys cover a vast array of subject matters ranging from the space age to domestic objects. This figure was made in West Germany in the 1950s. The first tin toys appeared in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. The tin toy industry soon spread to Europe, particularly Germany, where many tin toys were made around Nuremberg.\n\nThe toys made in the late forties were a combination of new designs and copies of pre-war designs with new artwork and were all marked 'US Zone Germany', which is the case with this skier. The German tin toy industry was at its peak during the forties and fifties but declined after due to Japanese competition, increased production costs and the popularity of plastic toys and diecasts.",
