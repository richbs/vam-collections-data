In the 16th century this shape was adapted for highly decorative decanting bottles for wine, made from silver or ceramics. In Renaissance Italy pilgrim bottles became a standard feature of extended ceramic dinner services used by the nobility for display and use on special occasions.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTin-glazed earthenware, which could be painted in many different bright colours, was known in Italy as 'maiolica'. Urbino was a famous centre for its manufacture.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDuring the 1560s and 1570s the Fontana workshop in Urbino specialised in maiolica with 'grotesque' decoration on a white ground. This type of decoration, composed of small loosely connected motifs including human figures, animals and fantasy figures, was first introduced by the painter Raphael in his decoration of the Vatican Palace in Rome (1518-19). It was derived from ancient Roman decorations from the Golden House of the emperor Nero (ruled 54-68 AD) on the Esquiline hill in Rome, which came to light during this period. These motifs were made popular though printed editions such as Jacques Androuet I Ducerceau's  'Petites Grotesques', which were published in 1550, and again in 1562. Many objects attributed to the Fontana workshops have grotesques which are directly derived from this printed source and it is extremely likely that the Fonatana family owned a copy of this work.\nGrotesque motifs are also translated in the moulded masks with snake-like tails on the sides of the bottle.",
