            "bibliography": "<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1936</u>, London: Board of Education, 1937.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'TRINICK, John.</B>\n\nDrawing of stained glass of the Tree of Jesse, erected in 1515 in the fourth N. Aisle Chapel at Autun Cathedral.\n<i>Pencil, Indian ink and water-colour.\n</i>E.703-1936\nGiven by Mr. John Trinick.\n<i>Note by the Artist:-</i> \"This window is perhaps a unique example of a 'Tree of Jesse' upon other than the pale blue background almost universal for the subject at this period.\n\n\"It is <i>par excellence</i> a 'glass-painter's window' in that cutting and leading are kept subservient to painting. An inspection of some of the background shapes will demonstrate the lengths to which 'dangerous' cutting has been carried; but the best instance is perhaps to be seen in the figure of the Christ-child at the head of the centre-light. Every artifice seems to have been sought to avoid the use of 'fly-leads' - those that appear being, in almost every case, due to later breakages.\n\n\"Prosper Merrim\u00e9e is quoted as having praised this window for the skilful way in which the leads are concealed so as not to interfere with the effect of pure drawing. One cannot help feeling, however, that the legitmacy of such grounds for praise is open to question.\n\n\"Some French authorities seem ready to concede the possibility of the windows having been made in Germany; and some, at least, of the figures would certainly suggest this. I would point, for instance to the two lower-most 'Kings' in the right-hand light, with their evidence of direct drawing from life. The outer of the two seems clearly of a Scandinavian type; and he, with his neighbour, almost suggests a Baltic sea-port as the possible home of the cartoons.\n\n\"The decoration on the white background is not as it would seem - 'scraped out' of the matt. Direct brushwork is apparent everywhere, and there is none of the slight angularity and side-slipping, nor of the remaining of little 'islands' of unremoved colour associated with scraping out. The method sometimes known as 'never-stick' seems more likely. In this, the <i>background</i> shapes are traced direct in a mixture of whiting and gum; the whole glass is then brushed over with matt mixed with oil or turpentine. In firing all portions covered with the whiting remain free of the matt, which takes the shapes left free by the first tracing. Hence, perhaps, the appearance of direct brushwork.\n\n\"The window was the gift to the Cathedral, of Celse Uforin and his nephew Nazaire - canons of the Chapter - in the year 1515. It is the last example remaining of the old glass which filled the windows of Cardinal Rollin's nave chapels - all the rest, except some few pieces in the traceries of other windows, having been destroyed at the time of the Revolution.
