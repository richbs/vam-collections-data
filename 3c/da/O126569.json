This cross pendant, made from sheet gold cut in a delicate openwork pattern resembling filigree and set with facetted diamonds in raised settings, is typical of that trend.  \n\nIt would originally have been worn on a ribbon round the neck, but a hook has been added at some later period so that it could be hung from a necklace or chain.  At the same time a brooch fitting was added to the cross at the bottom.  This would have prevented the cross from falling about while being worn.  The cross is attached by a hinge to the body of the pendant, so it could not have been detached and worn separately.",
