            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 47\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"COPE, Charles West, RA (1811-1890)\n\nBorn Leeds, Yorkshire, 28 July 1811, son of Charles Cope, a landscape watercolourist and friend of the collector John Sheepshanks. Briefly at school in London, then Leeds Grammar School. Returned to London 1827 to study at Sass's art school and 1828 at RA Schools. Travelled to Paris 1832 and Italy 1833-5. Exhibited 134 works at the RA between 1833 and 1882, 14 at the BI 1836--43, and one at the SBA 1837. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre; the fact that he was Roman Catholic may explain his choice of many of the subjects. Founder member of the Etching Club in about 1840. Awarded one of the three first prizes in the 1843 competition for the new Palace of Westminster decorations with 'An Early Trial by Jury'; travelled again to Italy to study fresco painting before painting several frescos at Westminster. Elected ARA 1843, RA 1848; appointed Professor of Painting at the RA 1867, and examiner in painting for the South Kensington Schools of Art 1870. Visited America and Canada 1876. Died Bournemouth, Hampshire, 21 August 1890. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, ppl77-9; CH Cope <i>Reminiscences of Charles West Cope</i> RA 1891 (referred to below as <i>Reminiscences</i>)\n\n<b>Maiden Meditation</b> \nFA55 Neg HF4821 \nCanvas, on a gesso ground, arched top, 54 x 39.4 cm (21\u00bc x 15\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nAccording to the <i>Reminiscences</i>, sold to John Sheepshanks before being exhibited at the RA in 1847. \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> thought the artist's 'power is not fairly displayed' in this or his other 1847 exhibit, 'A Subject from the Psalms'. The <i>Art Journal</i> critic was more admiring: \n\nThis work is painted from a passage from <i>Isaiah</i>: 'I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, for he hath clothed me with a robe of righteousness'. The principal figure - a maiden kneeling in the attitude of devotion - is more allusive to prayer than to meditation; 'the robe of righteousness' is about to be cast over her by a retiring figure behind her impersonating the Redeemer. This literal rendering of the text is beautiful and impressive in its touching simplicity. The features of the maiden are lighted up with the fervour of admiration; but it is to be observed that it is extremely stiff and formal- the only weakness in this strikingly original production. \n\n\tThe full text, from <i>Isaiah</i> chapter 61 verse 10, is: 'I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels'.\n \nEXH: RA 1847 (43); <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (767, as 'Jeune Fille en Meditation', lent by J Sheepshanks) \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 22 May 1847, p552; <i>Art Journal</i> 1847, p186; <i>Reminiscences</i> pp166, 379\"",
