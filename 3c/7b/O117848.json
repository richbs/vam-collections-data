Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography.In 1941 she emigrated from Paris to New York to escape imprisonment during the Second World War. After a break from photography, she began to start taking commissions for portraits again. \n\nBing applied elements of her oblique, sober, experimental style to commercial photography.  This partly solarised print of Baroness Van Zuilen uses light and stark outlines to surreal effect, recalling some of Bing\u2019s photographs from the 1930s. The lilies behind are abstract, framing the sitter as she floats in her lavish outfit.",
