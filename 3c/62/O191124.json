            "public_access_description": "This poster was issued during the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism. It is a typical example of the Alliance of Young Democrats' campaign which was characterised by spontaneity and informality. The party's electoral offices worked independently and posters were usually designed not by professional artists, but by the young political activists themselves. One of the party logos was the hand-written, graffiti-like rendering of FIDESZ (the abbreviation of the party name - Fiatal Democrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge). FIDESZ sounded like the Latin word fides (meaning trust) and this association was consciously played on.\n  \nThe colours orange and blue were fundamental elements of the party's identity. Orange recalls the expression 'Hungarian orange' from Peter Bacso's film 'A tan\u00fa' (The Witness, 1969) that criticised the anomalies of the communist regime in the nineteen fifties.  One of the lines from this extremely popular tragi-comedy rapidly became a catchphrase in Hungary: 'it is a little bit yellow and a little bit sour, but it's ours'. In this phrase, people saw the essence of life under communism aptly formulated. Magyar Narancs (Hungarian Orange) was the title of a newspaper, founded 1989 by young publishers, several of whom became active members of FIDESZ.  Another point of reference was the Polish opposition movement 'Orange Alternative'.\n\nThe primary effect of this poster is based on the young, attractive face of Tamas Deutsch and on the quotation from one of his speeches 'We want to live in a country where the law protects not only Coca Cola'. This sentence puts into popular form one of the main ideas of democracy - the necessity of a fair legal system.",
