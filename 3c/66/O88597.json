He was also influenced by Swedish fairytale artist John Bauer and later became known for his own fairytale illustrations, published as limited edition gift-books by Hodder and Stoughton from 1913.  \n\nThis image also shows elements of Art Nouveau. Nielsen studied in Paris at a time when Art Nouveau was still influential. He combined the Art Nouveau style with patterns inspired by Japanese art, also in vogue at the time.",
