The ground is sandy coloured, with indigo, red, pink, green and yellow designs of birds, flowers, small animals, and branches. The borders, which have a blue ground, are patterned with foliage and floral motifs. The central design, which is known as the kepala (or head, as distinct from the body of the cloth) has diamond shapes between the pattern of triangles (known as tumpals and deriving  from Indian textile forms) with alternate bird and lobster like designs.\n\nThe colour range of batiks of the north coast of Java, with their strong reds in addition to the indigo, brown and cream which are typical of central Java, have strong Indian and Chinese resonances. The north coast of Java, for centuries one of the links in the long distance overseas trade, had been continually subject to outside influence, both Asian and European, and it is these various influences in combination with the indigenous Javanese styles that are reflected in the batiks produced in the region after 1800.",
