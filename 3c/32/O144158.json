Simple boxes like this one were decorated by the painters and were the basic stock of the shop in Fitzroy Square, London, along with ceramics, furniture and textiles designed by the artists.  \n\nThe box is not signed but we can be sure it was painted by Duncan Grant, as the reclining nude on the lid is typical of his style.  In fact Grant sold it to the Museum, but it might not have been his to sell. A pencil inscription inside the lid says 'A.V. Bell', suggesting it had been given to his daughter Angelica, whose mother was another artist associated with the Omega Workshops, Vanessa Bell.",
