The deity, dressed like a king stands in a full-frontal, unflexed posture <i>(samapada-sthanaka</i>) in his Trivikrama form.  The sculpture has suffered some damage and would formerly have shown the god with four arms holding his attributes with the front right hand shown in the gift-giving gesture  (<i>varada mudra)</i>.  His two remaining back hands hold the mace (<i>gadha</i>) and the discus (<i>chakra</i>). His face is now battered and the crown on his head is missing. The stele, has an arched form with a slight ogival curve rising to a broken-off point, with a shallow-carved foliate moulding along its edge.  It is pierced in the centre behind the body and legs of the deity. He is richly adorned with jewellery worn over a diaphanous clinging garment that is indicated by curving, paired parallel lines across his thighs and torso and his characteristic garland (<i>vanamala</i>) which reaches down to his knees. A horse-shoe shaped nimbus with a double border decorated on its outer rim with a foliate design is carved on the back plate of the stele. Vishnu stands on a double lotus throne flanked by his two smaller consorts on smaller similar thrones in a <i>tribhanga </i>pose.  Sarasvati, on the right hand side, holds a vina with a long plectrum in her left hand while Lakshmi stands on the left and doubtless held a <i>chauri</i>whisk (now missing). Two further diminutive male attendants stand on the outer edge on either side as possible personifications (<i>andhaparushas</i>) of Vishnu's attributes, the right hand one appearing to have a<i> chakra</i> on his head.\n\nBehind these attendants there is an architectural setting to the throne with flat pilasters upon which rise up mirrored sets of animals and figures on either side. A rampant leogryph stands on an elephant. A small warrior wields weapons under the forelegs of the leogryph with another crowned figure riding on its back. The head of a makara juts out above from the ends of an upper crossrail upon which a celestial musician with radiating curly locks (<i>kimnari</i>) - a half-human female creature with wings and birds' legs - is standing. Flying above the god under the curve of the arch is a pair of flying heavenly beings (<i>vidyadharas</i>) carrying swords with tiny figures kneeling in devotion on their outstretched legs.  At the apex there is a face of glory (<i>kirttimukha</i>) from whose mouth spews luxuriant foliage which fills up the  upper part of the stele.\n\nThe pedestal at the base is divided into seven sections with a middle band of deeply carved floral scrolling. in which the small figure ofGaruda, Vishnu's vehicle, identified by his beak-like nose, kneels within it on the right. Two other diminutive figures also formerly knelt as devotees on the opposite side.",
