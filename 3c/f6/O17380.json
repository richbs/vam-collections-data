Baskett (<i>Constable Oil Sketches</i>, 1966, p. 26 and Pl. 4) suggests that the repairs and the windmill on the right are later additions to an earlier, damaged oil sketch which the artist had retrieved and laid down on canvas.  Plausible as the suggestion is, it must be noted that the date is on the extending canvas, and that the style of painting seen in the bushes and the foreground is consistent with other oil sketches made in 1812.\n\u2026On the back is chalked the lot mark 48/3: this indicates that the sketch formed part of Lot 48 at the Executors\u2019 sale, 16 May 1838, the catalogue entry for which reads: \u201cThree\u2014Moonlight; Landscape, and a ditto, with a Rainbow\u201d.  The three works were brought in for the family by Leslie for \u00a35 5s.\n\nNotes on Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], 119 [324-1888], and 120 [127-1888]\n\nAnother oil sketch of the same type, \u2018Dedham Vale\u2019 in the Ashmolean Museum, is dated 13 July 1812; and an oil sketch dated 12 July 1812 was in the Staats Forbes Collection.  J. G. B\u00f6hler, <i>Constable and Rubens</i>, pp. 36 ff. discusses Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], and 120 [127-1888], and suggests that the influence of Rubens to be found in them may have been mediated through Lord Radnor\u2019s \u2018Escurial\u2019.  Constable is known to have seen this painting at some time between May and November, 1812.\nIan Collins, ed. <u>Masterpieces. Art and East Anglia</u> Norwich, Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, 2013.
