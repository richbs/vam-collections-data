Chinese; mid 19th century\nBlack silk, satin weave with reinforced toecaps of leather. Thick leather soles stitched all over the sole, the sides of the soles covered with a strip of whitened cloth. \n\nDate of receipt: 14 August 1957 (same as T195-1957: dragon robe )\n\nFrom whom received: \nMiss C. Oldfield & Brigadier G. Oldfield \n(same as T195-1957: dragon robe )\n\nGift. \n\nDescription of T195-195:\nBlue silk with the pattern woven in golden coloured silk. The pattern follows the traditional sequence of a dragon robe with a large front-facing dragon in the centre cured around a sacred pearl.....The robe was, according to the donors, presented by the Chinese government to the government of Nepal and given to Major H. A. Oldfield, grandfather of the donors by Sir Jung Bahadur (Maharajah) some time in the second half of the 19thC.\n\n_\n\nCondition: Inner lining of shoe seems soiled.\n\n_\n\nAccording to a reference from Musee Guimet:\n\n\"Footwear for the urban Han Chinese evolved from lacquered wooden clogs and rigid-soled sandals, the later often converted to a slipper with the addition of leather or cloth uppers. The form can be dated from the Zhou dynasty (1030-256 BC). An upturned toe with a cloud head shape became a fashion during the Sui and Tang dynasties and remained a feature of men's shoes until the twentieth century. The platform sole made of layers of felt or cotton cloth increased the stature of the wearer and raised the foot off cold tile floors. (Huang Hengfu and Chen Juanjuan, 1994)",
