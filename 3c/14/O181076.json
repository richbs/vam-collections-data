Trained School of Arts and Crafts, Detroit, and Cranbrook Academy. Research For Knoll International, East Grenville, from 1950. Chairs exhibited at Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam 1966; Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris 1968. Major commissions include work for MIT Chapel, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dallas Public Library; St Louis Airport; Dulles International Airport. Gold Medal of Architectural League; American Institute of Architects Design Award 1953; AID Award 1955; Graham Fellow 1957. Hans and Florence Knoll engaged [Harry] Bertoia in 1950 as a sculptor, with an entirely free brief to pursue experiment in or outside the furniture field. His first works for them were in fact a number of variations on his earlier sculpture, but he presently developed a whole range of chairs and related furniture using welded steel rods, brought into production in 1952-53. \n\u2018In the sculpture I am concerned primarily with space, form, and the characteristics of metal. In the chairs many functional problems have to be satisfied first\u2026but when you get right down to it, the chairs are studies in space, form and metal too. If you will look at them, you will find that they are mostly made of air, just like sculpture. Space passes right through them.\u2019 Harry Bertoia\"",
