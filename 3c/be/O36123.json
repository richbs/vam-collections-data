It is in a baulking stance with the legs firmly at an angle and attached to the base. The whole is cast in two halves along the length and held by tongue and slot joints. The ears are placed in slots in the head and move back and forth. The whole is mounted on a mottled green and brown metal base and 4 large plain chromed wheels. Under the front of the base is a friction drive mechanism and at the front of the base itself is a small hole so the toy may be pulled along. Although lithographed it has been painted with a varnish which has yellowed and there are drip marks on the sides. The neck and legs have bend marks which may not be original; it is not possible to tell or move the marks without damaging the surface.",
