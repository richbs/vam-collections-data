Sent three works to the Society of Arts and won a gold medal for a study of a boy's head. Practised as a portrait painter from 1812. Moved to London 1814, and in 1817 married William Hookham Carpenter (1792-1866) bookseller, publisher, artist, and from 1845 Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. She seems to have had some connection with Sir Thomas Lawrence; she finished one of his portraits after his death in 1830 ('Mrs Brandling', exhibited SBA 1832, 164), and at least one of her portraits has been attributed to him ('Major-General John Fremantle', exhibited 'The Portrait Surveyed', Agnew's 1980, 17). She exhibited 147 portraits at the RA between 1818 and 1866 (nine as Miss Geddes 1814-17),50 works at the BI 1819-53 (11 as Miss Geddes 1814-17) - mostly 'fancy' pictures, and 19 at the SBA 1831-6. Several of her works were engraved. Died London 13 November 1872. Her sister married William Collins RA, and two of her children, William and Henrietta Carpenter, were also painters. There may also be a family connection with Andrew Geddes ARA. Three of her portraits are in the NPG; two watercolours are in the V&A collections. Clayton believed her 'one of the most distinguished portrait painters in England', and her husband's obituarist wrote that she 'would certainly have been a Royal Academician but for her sex' (<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> September 1866, p410). \n\nLIT: \t<i>Art Journal</i> 1873, p6 (obit); E C Clayton <i>English Female Artists</i> 2 vols, 1876, I, pp386-8; <i>List of Pictures and Drawings by Margaret Carpenter from the year 1812 to 1864 with the prices paid for them</i>, MS transcript made 1899 for NPG (referred to below as <i>List</i>); C Yeldham <i>Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France and England</i> 1984, I, pp254-7; P Gerrish Nunn <i>Victorian Women Artists</i> 1987, p36 etc \n\n<b>The Sisters</b> \nFA18 Neg GAl190 \nPanel, 30.5 x 35.6 cm (12 x 14 ins) \nSigned and dated 'Margaret Carpenter/Decr [?Delt] 1839' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nPresumably the painting exhibited at the BI in 1840, the size given in the catalogue as '18 by 21 inches', (including frame). The <i>List</i> records a payment of \u00a342 by Sheepshanks in 1842 for 'Henrietta and Jane', and 'The Sisters' has traditionally been identified as a portrait of the artist's daughters. In W H Carpenter's posthumous sale at Christie's 16 February 1867, lot 92 was 'The Sisters - a circle -lifesize'; this picture is recorded in the <i>List</i> number 1866 and identified as the Misses Brandling. \n\nEXH: \tBI 1840 (9) \n\nLIT:\t<i>Gerrish Nunn</i> pp36, 69, repr fig 9\"",
