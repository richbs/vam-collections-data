London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 222-224, cat. no. 280.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nJohann Georg PLATZER (1704-61)\nAustrian School \nBorn at St Michael, Eppan in the Tyrol, he was a pupil of his stepfather Jos. Anton Kessler at Innsbruck and of his uncle Johann Christoph Platzer in Passau. From 1728, when he entered the Vienna Academy, he worked mainly in Vienna. He painted genre, historical and mythological subjects, influenced by the Antwerp school of the 17th century, in particular the Francken family and Jan Brueghel. \n\nLit. G. Agath, <i>Johann Georg Platzer, ein Geseltschaftsmaler des Wiener Rococo</i>, Dresden. 1955. \n\n280 WINTER \nCopper \n17 \u00bc X 22 \u00bd (43.8 X 57) \n370-1901\n\nOne of a set of four Seasons (see the following three numbers). The subjects, especially dancing for Spring, music for Summer and winemaking for Autumn are well known from engravings (for example, the set by J. Saenredam after H. Goltzius; Bartsch, iii, p. 258, nos. 119-22) but the emphasis on bacchanalian feasting is typical of Platzer's work. Another cycle of Seasons by Platzer, with similar but not identical compositions, is in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (<i>Bulletin</i>, li, 1962, p. 80, repr.; <i>Annual Report</i>, 1964). In both series the figures are mainly in 17th century dress. \n\nProv. Capt. C. S. Ricketts, R.N.; passed to his daughter, Mrs J. A. Bonnor, who bequeathed the set to the Museum in 1901.",
