He was appointed as one of the sculptors to Louis XIII in January 1614.  In 1625 he was sent to England to work at the court of Charles I, shortly after the King's marriage to Louis' sister, Henrietta Maria. Le Sueur specialised primarily in bronze.   \n\nThe bust was acquired by the museum not primarily  for the reason to be a great work of art, but for it represents the lost tradition of the English baroque tomb makers and thus constitutes a good example for the museum's study collection.",
