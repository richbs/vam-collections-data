In the first scene, a group of people find an enchanted lake where they see swans transformed into fairies.  Albert falls in love with the fairy Z\u00e9\u00efla and steals her scarf, the source of her immortality.  \nThe critic of The Times was not impressed 'The effects were chiefly of the stamp that are seen in the first part of a pantomime, troops of \"white-muslined\" fairies fluttering about the stage, and going through the old business of wreath-waving.'  But Cerrito was a sensation and many reviewers raved over her lightness and the way she seemed to float and fly through the air.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
