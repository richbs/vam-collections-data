This gift was the outcome of a visit to the Museum by Queen Mary in 1918, when she questioned the correctness of a label identifying a medallion of Lady de la Pole in the Schreiber Collection, believing it to be of Charlotte Augusta Mathilda, eldest daughter of George III. \n\nSolid Jasper backgrounds with moulded rather than wire-cut edges are characteristic of 19th- and 20th century medallions.",
