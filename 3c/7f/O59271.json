Similar cravats appear in architectural decorative schemes associated with Gibbons. This piece was probably made to show and  impress potential patrons.\n\nPeople\nThe cravat belonged to Horace Walpole (1717-1797) who thought highly of Gibbons' work as a woodcarver. His family home, Houghton, Norfolk, included a room decorated with Gibbons' carving. Walpole thought that one of the ivory reliefs on his cabinet (W.52:1-1925) - that representing Judith with the head of Holofernes - was also carved by Gibbons  although this attribution is not accepted today.\n\nPlace\nGibbons' cravat was displayed in the Tribune Room at Strawberry Hill with the Walpole Cabinet.  It formed part of Horace Walpole's collection of special small objects. In 1769 Walpole wore the cravat to receive some distinguished French, Spanish and Portuguese visitors at his Twickenham home, Strawberry Hill.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nWhen this astonishing carving was given to the Museum in 1928 by Mrs. Basil Ionides, Grinling Gibbons was already established as the archetypal English craftsman genius. He is perhaps best known for his work for Sir Christopher Wren at St. Paul's Cathedral and for his royal commissions. Another example of his work - a relief of the stoning of Saint Stephen - had for some time been prominently displayed in the Museum. Not surprisingly, this trompe l'oeil \"cravat,\" carved in imitation of Venetian needlepoint lace fashionable in the late seventeenth century and similar to those used in other schemes of carved decoration associated with Gibbons, was described then as a virtuoso example by a craftsman \"so highly gifted that he transformed existing practice and originated a style.\" Making Gibbons a canonical figure was largely due to connoisseur and collector Horace Walpole, who included an account of Gibbons in his Anecdotes of Painting. As well as attributing one of the ivories on his cabinet (cat. 134) to Gibbons, Walpole also owned this cravat, \"the art of which arrives even to deception,\" and displayed it near the cabinet at Strawberry Hill, Twickenham. In a letter of 11 May 1769, Walpole described receiving a number of distinguished foreign visitors, for which occasion he dressed in the Gibbons cravat and wore a pair of embroidered gloves that had belonged to King James I, reporting that \"the French servants stared and firmly believed that this was the dress of English Country Gentlemen.\"\nIn 1874 Gibbons's life was celebrated in Austin Clare's popular historical novel, The Carved Cartoon, and his work was promoted by those interested in English art and design. Although not among the artists represented in the Museum's so-called Kensington Valhalla created from 1862 to 1871, his statue appeared on the fa&#231;ade of the Aston Webb building in 1909, five years before a monograph about him was published by H. Avray Tipping, editor of Country Life (and the donor of Thomas Carter's Chaloner Chute [cat. 136], with its Walpole associations). However, as a woodcarver his work occupied an ambiguous position between woodwork and sculpture, allowing the Saint Stephen relief to be displayed with English furniture in 1923 and then alongside English sculpture in 1930. With the formation of the English Primary Galleries in 1950, both the relief and this cravat were shown together as part of a narrative about English art.\n\nLit.
