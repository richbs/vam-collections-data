The front shows two children out of doors: the girl is wearing a red and white dress and is blowing a soap bubble, the boy (visible on the inside) wears a yellow jumper, white shirt and blue trousers, and is flying a kite; the soap bubble carries the enlarged figure nine added in gold foil embossed with a duck.  The inside of the card shows the girl on her hands and knees, the boy with his kite, and two younger children running towards them; the verse reads:\nBLOWING A BUBBLE\n      IS ALWAYS GREAT FUN\nFLYING A KITE IS\n      SECOND TO NONE\nMAY YOUR BIRTHDAY\nBE A HAPPY ONE",
