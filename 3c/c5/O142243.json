            "physical_description": "Sleeved waistcoat with linen back and diaper weave linen sleeves, cuffs and fronts of metallic silk brocade. A gold fish-scale design with silver, pink and blue floral sprigs is overlaid. \n\nThe waistcoat is single-breasted, without a collar. Triangular insertions have been let into the yoke to improve the fit. The fronts are curved and the jacket fits tight to the body as far as the hips, where each front flares out at the side to form a skirt. The pockets are also placed at hip level. Consequently the waistcoat is long-waisted, reaching to just above the knees and indicates the beginnings of the long-waisted fashion of the 1760s and 1770s. \n\nThe centre-back is open and held together by a lace. The one in use is late 19th or early 20th century. A woolen flap stitched to the inside of the left back has been added at a later date. \n\nThe right front has eighteen buttons evenly spaced from neck to hem. Only twelve are furnished with buttonholes, the twelfth one is at hip level in line with the pocket flap. The buttons are probably of wood or bone and are covered with silver gilt foil and pearl and sewn on with brown linen thread. The buttonholes are finished with couched silver gilt thread. \n\nThe pockets are very wide with shaped flaps. Five buttons are sewn beneath each flap, at evenly spaced intervals. One is missing from the left pocket. \n\nThe sleeves taper towards the cuffs, which are finished with one button and buttonhole, the latter sewn in cream silk. The sleeves and part of each back are made of cream silk with a small diaper pattern. The back skirts and the sleeve cuffs are made of brocaded silk to match the fronts. \n\nThe waistcoat and sleeves are lined with fustian except the facings, which are of cream twilled sarcenet. The pockets are made of bleached linen.",
