Its curved forms being softened and lightened version of the Moderne style of the 1930s. Clear post-war touches are the handles and the characteristically 1950s shape of the mirror. When the 'A' range was finally launched in 1955 this design, with its daringly 'streamlined' recessed top, was not adopted and nor were the handles.\n\n[Michael Snodin, 'British Design at Home', p.167]",
