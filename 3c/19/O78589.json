An oil burner in the stand could be lit to keep the water hot.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe design of this hot water jug was very popular. From about 1800-1815, the model was made with slight variations of ornament. These variations may have reflected customers' taste or their ability to pay for more costly decorative additions. A drawing in the V&A attributed to Jean-Jacques Boileau (active 1787-1851) shows a more elaborate version of the hot water jug design.\n\nPeople\nThe jug's design has been attributed to the French artist and designer  J.J. Boileau. Boileau came to Britain around 1787 as a painter in order to work with the architect Henry Holland (1745-1806) on the decoration of Carlton House, London, for the Prince of Wales. In time he became a well-known designer for Rundell, Bridge & Rundells and other companies and clients. Rundell's supported a large design studio, with high-calibre artists such as John Flaxman (1755-1826). This enabled it  to remain at the forefront of fashion for many years.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis hot water jug was part of a tea and coffee service ordered by William Henry Vane, 3rd Earl of Darlington (1766-1842) from Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, the Royal Goldsmiths. Serving hot drinks elegantly, from expensive and highly fashionable silver or porcelain vessels, was still an important part of entertaining at home at the beginning of the 19th century.",
