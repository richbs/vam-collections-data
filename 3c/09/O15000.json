She was for many years a successful painter of portrait miniatures whose subjects included Wordsworth and Dickens. In 1851 she went to Paris to study painting; on her return she began to produce romantic figure subjects such as this. Roget, in his history of the Old Watercolour Society (where Gillies exhibited from 1852 until her death), described her themes as 'maiden's sentiment and woman's sorrow'. Such allegorical pictures which showed beautiful young women as the personifications of conventional virtues were immensely popular, and her work was often engraved to reach a wider audience.",
