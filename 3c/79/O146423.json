Innovative concepts in treating gold were developed as never before. \n\nJacqueline Mina is known for her innovative and pioneering use of gold. She creates surfaces that are naturally patterned and sensual in feel. One of her pioneering techniques is fusion inlay with platinum and gold. \n\nIn the foreword of a catalogue to the exhibition 'Or Gold', which she curated in 2004, she wrote: \"I know from my own practice that gold as an artistic medium is an undeniably versatile metal and that many imaginative artists choose to use it for its limitless physical possibilities. In addition to the appreciation of its natural characteristics they find that their jewellery is endowed with an allure that is carried down from antiquity in the collective subconscious.\"",
