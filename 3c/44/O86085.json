It states that at that time Clematius restored the church to house the bones of a group of virgin martyrs. Tradition holds they were killed by pagan Huns in or near the city of Cologne.\n\nOver the centuries one of these virgins was given the name of Ursula. By the 13th century the number of virgins had grown to 11,000. In the Golden Legend, a compilation of saints\u2019 lives written about 1260, she is the daughter of a Christian British king. Ursula was reluctant to marry a pagan Hun prince. Eventually, the King of the Huns had Ursula and her virgin companions killed. She is shown here holding an arrow, the instrument of her martyrdom.\n\nSt Ursula\u2019s cult was enormously successful in Germany, especially in Cologne, but it never became strong in Britain, despite the British connection. It is probable that this window was originally located in the church of St. Peter's in Cologne.",
