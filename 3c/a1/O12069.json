Detached Ionic columns with gilt-bronze capitals and flutes are set at the front corners, attached columns at the rear. The whole standing on four short tapering legs with gilt bronze feet. Surmounted by a grey marble slab. At each corner of the frieze below the slab are four winged gilt-bronze putti standing on top of the capitals and designed to appear to be supporting the weight of the slab on their shoulders, in Herculese or Atlas inspired poses. An oak lined drawer is set into the frieze,in the centre of this is a cast and chiselled key-hole escutcheon set between laurel bearing winged nymphs with foliated tails from which emanate tendrils of grape laden vine-branches. At left and right of the drawer are cast and chiselled handles in the form of winged putti with foliated tails holding drapery.A gilt-bronze band in the form of of laurel divides the frieze section from the fall-front central section.\nThe secretaire front falls to reveal a nest of eleven drawers with a cupboard between. Each drawer front is enriched with gilt-bronze mouldings. The three tiers of drawers are separated by Doric half-columns supported on plinths with matching panels above. Each of these plinths and panels is held in position by a catch, which can be released when the drawers are withdrawn, revealing four small secret drawers. The inside of the fall front is lined with (the original ?) green leather with tooled and gilt borders. \nThe key escutcheon on the outside of the fall-front is in the form of a pelter shield with a palmette finial set between two eagles bearing a bound floral swag and with a thunderbolt held in their claws. A gilt-bronze band of double-guilloche ribbon ornament divides this central section from the lower section.\nA cupboard with two doors forms the lower half of the secretaire. The doors open to reveal three drawers. The key-hole escutcheons on each cupboard door are pearl-bordered with an acorn drop above and below (the lower drop on the left is missing)\nThe frieze,fall-front, cupboard panels and side panels are all surrounded with gilt-bronze borders of upright leaves set between bands of ebony.",

Though unsigned, this secretaire is attributed to Bernard Molitor, the Luxembourg born maker on the grounds of similarities with known stamped pieces. \nRecognised as one of the most distinguished ebenistes in Paris, he had a thriving workshop producing neo-classical furniture characterised by the use of elaborately figured mahogany veneers and embellished with classically inspired and finely cast gilt-bronze mounts which are particularly characteristic of his pre-revolutionary work. His elegant clientele included Marie Antoinette and other members of the royal family and nobility. His workshop continued through the Revolutionary period until approximately 1818.",
