            "public_access_description": "In the 18th century cut-paper images (usually blackened) were called 'shades'. If they were portraits, they were known as 'profiles'. The fashion for 'profiles' grew in the 1770s, when the archaeological discoveries of ancient Roman sites at Herculaneum and Pompeii encouraged a taste for Neo-classicism. The 'silhouette' was later named after a French minister who was notorious for wasting his time on this popular hobby. Commercially, it was very successful, because in its simplest form it was a cheap and quick method of portraiture. With mechanical aids, a sitting could be done in one minute. There was no need for further tedious sittings to make endless repeats of the portrait for family and friends.  Despite more sophisticated and expensive variations on the simple cut-paper silhouette, this continued as an affordable form of portraiture well into the 19th century.  \n\nThis silhouette is one of three silhouettes which have descended from one family (E.176-178-1998).  The silhouettes were acquired with two darning samplers, worked by girls seemingly from the same Quaker family at Ackworth School in Yorkshire, a Quaker school founded in 1779; one by Eliza Broadhead in 1785 (T.731-1997) and one by Jean Miller in1801 (T.732-1997).   \n\nUnlike the silhouettes acquired with this one (E.176-177-1998), this silhouette has possibly been photographically reproduced.  That is to say that it may be a photograph of an original silhouette which has now been lost.  The sitter is unknown, and its link to the sampler by  Eliza Broadhead (T.731-1997), alongside which it used to be displayed by the family from which it was acquired, is also unknown.  The inference of a label on the reverse of the silhouette is that it depicts Eliza Broadhead as a woman. It is not clear what the relationship was between the unknown sitter and the sitters in the other silhouettes, William and Jane Miller, and with Jean Miller who embroidered the other sampler in 1801.  It seems however that, as the samplers and silhouettes have descended within one family, the Broadhead, Miller and Woodhead families were related.",
