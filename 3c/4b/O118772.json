            "public_access_description": "Earthenware flatbacks and figurines for mantelpiece decoration were first produced in  Staffordshire in the late 1830s. The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  They were relatively cheap and easy to manufacture since they were made in moulds. As they soon proved lucrative, Staffordshire pottery firms issued countless other figures during the 1840s. This cannot be identified as a particular smuggler from a specific play; nautical stories and plays featuring smugglers and pirates were very popular during the 19th century.  It was designed to stand on a mantelpiece, probably one of a pair on either side of a clock.\n\nAlthough a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been made after 1905.  During their heyday, however, they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as royalty they represented a wide variety of subjects, including politicians, characters from popular fiction and actors and actresses, which were especially popular.",
