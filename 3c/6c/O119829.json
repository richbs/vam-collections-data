This represents the character Esmeralda with her pet goat, from Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nHugo's novel was first published in 1831 and was transformed into an opera in Paris by Louise Bertin in 1836, and a ballet by Antonio Monticium for La Scala, Milan in 1839. In March 1844 another version was performed at Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre, London, choreographed by Jules Perrot to music by Cesare Pugni, designed as a showcase for the talents of the ballerina Carlotta Grisi and Perrot himself.  Following the success of the ballet, a music sheet illustrated by John Brandard was produced for a selection of its music arranged as The Esmeralda Waltzes.  This illustration was the basis for a Staffordshire earthenware figurine of Esmeralda and the goat, probably representing Carlotta Grisi as Esmeralda. However, when the opera Esmeralda, or The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Vincenzo Battista was produced at Drury Lane Theatre on 30 June 1856, the music sheet was reproduced with the head changed to represent the singer Lucy Escott as Esmeralda. This figurine appears to have been based on that revised music sheet illustration.",
