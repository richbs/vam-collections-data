Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and diplomat. He was a versatile and influential Baroque artist employed by the rulers of the southern Netherlands as their ambassador and became painter to the courts of Europe. Rubens blended features of the Italian High Renaissance, with which he became acquainted during an extended visit to Italy, with northern realism and a love of landscape. He had a deep knowledge and understanding of Classical art and literature and successfully translated these into vivid images of flesh and blood. 308-1864 appears to be a late 18th or early 19th century reduced copy after Rubens' original, dated ca. 1615, now in a private collection, Brussels. Rubens made a red-chalk drawing for the head and the body of Hercules (Louvre) in Rome in the gardens of the Villa Medici, where he copied the fragment of an ancient relief of the same subject. The composition was engraved in 1801.",

From 1600-08 he lived in Italy, entering the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, on whose behalf he visited Spain in 1603. He returned to Antwerp in 1608 and was appointed painter to the Brussels Court of the Archduke Albert in the following year. He was commissioned by Marie de M\u00e9dicis to execute a series of paintings for the Luxembourg and accordingly visited Paris in 1622 and 1625. His activities as a diplomat took him to Spain in 1628 and to London in 1629-30, when he was knighted by Charles I. Having returned to Antwerp in 1630, he carried out the paintings for the ceiling of the Whitehall Banqueting House in the succeeding year. He died in 1640, renowned as a courtier and diplomat as well as a painter. \n\n\nAfter Peter Paul RUBENS \n310 \nHERCULES AND THE NEMEAN LION \nCanvas on panel \n17 \u00bd  X 15 \u00bd  (44.5 X 39) \n308-1864 \n\nA copy of the late 18th or 19th century derived from a Rubens composition, of which the original is in a private collection in Spain (on loan to the Academia di S.

Only in 1970 did the current owner of the autograph work discover that it was the original. Another copy is at Potsdam (Schloss Sanssouci). Rubens made a red-chalk drawing for the head and the body of Hercules, (Louvre, Lugt 1949, n. 1012)  in Rome in the gardens of the Villa Medici, where he copied the fragment of an ancient relief of the same subject. The composition may be derived however from Giulio Romano in the Palazzo del Te, Mantua, where Rubens was recorded in 1602-03 and 1604. The composition was engraved in 1801.",

Artists transformed distant history into contemporary scenes of everyday life, situating classical and biblical scenes in Netherlandish settings with figures in contemporary costume and sometimes even including historicized portraits.\n\nPeter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and diplomat. He was a versatile and influential Baroque artist employed by the rulers of the southern Netherlands as their ambassador and became painter to the courts of Europe. Rubens blended features of the Italian High Renaissance, with which he became acquainted during an extended visit to Italy, with northern realism and a love of landscape. He had a deep knowledge and understanding of Classical art and literature and successfully translated these into vivid images of flesh and blood. He returned to Antwerp from Italy in 1608 on the eve of the Twelve-year Truce with Spain (1609\u201321).",
