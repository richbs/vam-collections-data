In 273 BC the Romans conquered the settlement and renamed it Paestum. The ruins were rediscovered and excavated in the 18th century and attracted tourists from across Europe.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
