The ball is attached to the handle with a thin cord and the essence of the game is that the player tosses the ball up in the air and attempts to catch it on the spike as it falls back. Such toys usually had a shallow, turned cup on the other end of the handle, which provided an easier way of catching the ball. This version probably has that feature, embedded in the square base of mahogany to which it is now firmly attached, lined on the underside with green baize. \n\nThe handle is decorated with spiral fluting and bands of engraved neo-classical ornament including upright leaf and scrolling acanthus, as well as with rows of fleurs-de-lys. Collars at the top and bottom of the handle are defined by carved beading in the ivory. The ball is decorated with engraved upright leaf ornament at the base, with a broad band of scrolling acanthus round the middle, and with the arms of France in the upper part.",

The luxury materials suggest that it was made for adult use and certainly the game, which had originated in Mexico in the sixteenth century, was highly popular at the French court during the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\nIt was a game of skill, played by a single player, who tossed the pierced ball up, by a swift jerk of the arm, and then tried to catch it on a turned spike at the top of the handle. A small cup was worked into the other end of the handle to offer an alternative to less skilled players.",

The game of <i>Bilboquet</i> had originated in Mexico in the sixteenth century.  Henri III of France (1551-1589) was a great enthusiast for the game and was often seen playing in public. It never entirely went out of fashion in the French court but it became particularly popoular again in the eighteenth century.  Many nobles had an ivory version and a second ivory version, also inscribed by the <i>Menus Plaisirs</i> is in the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York (inventory no. 1967-48-42-a,b).",
