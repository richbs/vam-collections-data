Ray, his alcoholic father, was usually drunk, often unconscious. When Billingham moved on to study fine art at University of Sunderland, he continued to photograph his family - partly with the idea of painting from them, perhaps for other reasons. Billingham has spoken about his pictures, 'working like therapy'.  The picture of his mother doing a jigsaw puzzle is his most tender and subtle photograph.",
