They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. This delicate and unusually shaped plaquette originally formed part of an oil lamp, perhaps for the desk of a scholar. The subject was symbolic of Justice. It shows the Old Testament king, Solomon, deciding which of the two women was the mother of the child.",
