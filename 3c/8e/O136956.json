The reverse scimitar blade is uniquely detailed with an elegant soldered cut, subtly displacing the metal. The tang of the blade slots into a solid handle, textured with a matte finish that enhances its heavy, severe form. However the rectangular cut-out reveals the blade end within a gilded recess, injecting warmth and colour to the design. The elegant fusion of gentle curves and stronger rectilinear forms create a distinctive and powerful piece. The silver \"a language in its own right\" is perfectly expressed in this simple design.",

There may be no obvious ornamentation on the surfaces but there is a richness present which undermines the formal austerity.  Her work is about forms and lines which come together in harmony.\" (Amanda Fielding, Silver Launch Liberty Ltd, Craft Notes 1993, p.61)",
