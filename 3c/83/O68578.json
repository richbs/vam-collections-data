The typography is in a three-dimensional style which evokes the sense of a monumental scale. Above this are two portraits of the actors Dharmendra and Hema Malini. The portrait of Dharmendra is on a larger scale  and they are both surrounded by orange and yellow flames which fill the entire poster and allude to the title of the film. The title is also in the same orange and yellow shades. Below the titles are lots of line drawings of figures on a miniature scale depicting scenes from the film. The poster has been done in  a style which is very similar to that of the artist Diwalker and has been  'painted-over' in an way which enhances the facial expressions of the two portraits and gives the design a more dramatic effect. See IS.80-1987 for another poster for the same film which uses the same design concept but advertises the other two stars of the film, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri. The artist's signature is in the bottom right hand corner",
