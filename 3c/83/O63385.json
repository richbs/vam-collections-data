They are of particular significance to the Collection as the teapot for which they were made was acquired by the Metalwork Department earlier this year (M.12-1998). \nThe inspiration for the teapot came from a medieval Spanish castle perched on a rocky outcrop which the designer saw whilst on holiday. She is interested in rounded forms stacked on top of other forms and how they balance and intergrate with each other.
