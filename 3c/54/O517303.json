According to Marco Chiarini, this figure is reminiscent of a similar figure in the background of the recently discovered Martyr of St Catherine (Private collection, oil on slate, 26.6 x 34 cm). Based on stylistic grounds, the execution of the painting is likely to date from Napoletano's first travel to Rome, shortly after 1614. The identification of Filippo Napoletano as the author of this drawing makes an important addition to the artist's corpus of works, especially at such an early date when his style was still evolving.",
