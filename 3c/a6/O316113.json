The design, which is repeated along each side, shows purple-pink tulip-like flowers and leaves with a bough of apple blossom in pink. Leaves and branches are in various shades of green. One corner of the cloth has been embroidered and shows a highly competent technique. Stitches used are satin stitch and couching. It is likely that the embroidery was bought from Helbronner's shop with this section already worked to indicate the stitching. Another corner has been started in a less competent manner but only three flowerheads have been completed. The cloth was intended to have a gold-coloured satin stitched edging.\n[Box] Cardboard box containing various skeins, groups of coloured silks and needles originally sold with embroidery. 33 skeins and bundles of silks show various shades of pink, purples, browns, yellow and pearl. There are seven embroidery needles pinned into an original brown paper cover labelled '9130 Napperon', possibly the pattern number and name. An empty needle case for No 5 embroidery needles is printed with the Helbronner name and address and 'By Appointment to HRH The Princess of Wales'.",
