Worked as assistant to his father by the age of 15. Exhibited 34 works at the RA between 1843 and 1898, 18 at the BI 1844-67, and 25 at the SBA 1846-94. Early works mainly subjects from English history, and from literature, particularly Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites in the 1850s, in both technique and subject matter; painted several scenes of modem life, notably 'Omnibus Life in London' (1859, Tate Gallery). Later works are mostly 18th-century costume subjects. Designed one of the first Christmas cards, an etched greeting dated 1848. Friend of W P Frith, for whom he painted backgrounds on occasion. Died Chiswick, London, 20 February 1916. \n\nLIT: W M Egley <i>Catalogue of Pictures</i>. . .

It is a sketch for 'Argan Feigning Death' exhibited at the RA in 1858 (169); that is no 295 in the <i>Catalogue</i>, and the following lines, in translation, are quoted from act 3 scene 18 of Moli\u00e8re 's last play, first performed in 1673. Argan is pretending to be dead in order to test the affection of his wife: \n\n<i>Toinette</i>: Stretch yourself full-length in this armchair, and pretend to be dead. (To Beralde) Hide yourself in that corner. Here is my mistress. Ah heavens! Ah! what a misfortune! \n\n<i>Beline</i>: What is the matter, Toinette? What ails you? \n\n<i>Toinette</i>: Your husband is dead. \n\n<i>Beline</i>: Heaven be praised. I am delivered from a most grievous burden. How silly of you, Toinette, to be so afflicted at his death. \n\n<i>Toinette</i>: Ah! Ma'arn, I thought I ought to cry. \n\nThe RA painting was bought by John Lomax, but its present whereabouts are unknown. \n\nPROV: Bought by H S Ashbee 1898, and bequeathed by him to the museum 1900\"",
