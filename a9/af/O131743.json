The crest-rail and mid-rail match. They are arched and carved in outline with scrolls above and below, with three turned pendant finails. Both rails are chip-carved on their front face with a pattern of S-scrolls. Applied to the front face of each back upright is a split-turned 'rod' with turnings at the top and bottom. (The presence of wooden pegs into the outer sides of the back uprights above the seat may reflect repairs rather than the method of fixing these applied ornaments.) The front legs and mid-height, front stretcher are turned, with square blocks at the joints. The top of each front leg is carved with a shallow roundel finial. The side stretchers (two on each side) and back stretcher are rectangular and plain. The four seat rails have a simple, scratch moulding. The sunk seat consists of two boards resting on rebates in the rails, held below a nailed batten along the back rail. \n\nModifications\nBoard seat replaced.\nBottom 15cm of both back legs replaced. \nSide stretchers possibly replaced.\nTurned knobs replaced.\nThe front and side seat rails possibly replaced.",

This chair would have been used with a separate seat cushion on the solid seat. The carved, arched back-pieces, board seat and single, turned front stretcher are distinctive features found on many chairs linked to south Yorkshire. They were probably influenced by high-backed, caned chairs with arched crests, made in London. Several workshops must have produced large quantities, to judge by the numbers of such chairs that have survived. \n\nThe chair has been heavily restored. It came to the Museum in 1898 from the collection of Charles H. Marshall of East Retford, a notable collector of British furniture.",
