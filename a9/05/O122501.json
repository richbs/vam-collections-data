The weave is complex using twill and damask weaving, reversing the direction of the twill to give contrasting effect across the weft. There is a dark red fringe at each end which is formed of the warp threads loosely twisted. The fabric is hemmed at both selvedges, There is no repeat.",

In 1921 she entered the Weaving Workshop (the only workshop composed entirely of female students) and had to learn for herself the possibilities offered by the loom and her materials.\n\nThis hanging was made in the years following her formal appointment as technical director of the Weaving Workshop in Dessau in summer 1925, on a small-scale, hand-operated jacquard loom. This type of loom enabled weavers to produce geometric patterns with precisely defined borders.\n\nThe weave is complex, using twill and damask structures. Its pattern does not repeat, and in its format follows abstract art of the period. An underlying graphic design is visible through the arrangement of colourful horizontal stripes, an effect similar to the artworks of the contemporary artists Wassily Kandinsky and Carl Buccheister. This similarity is not surprising as the Bauhaus aimed to unite architecture and the fine and applied arts, and Gunta St\u00f6lzl had begun her studies alongside artists such as Johannes Itten and Georg Muche.",
