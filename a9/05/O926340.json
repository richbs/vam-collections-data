This image is painted on vellum. Professional botanical illustrators in the 18th century often preferred vellum to paper. Its smooth surface enabled them to paint very fine detail. It also helped to give a sheen to the painting of leaves and petals.\n\nGreen milkweed, shown in this botanically accurate study, is a native of North America. Peter Brown may have painted it and his other plant subjects in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. His patron, Lord Bute, advised Princess Augusta on the development of Kew. In 1784 Brown became botanical painter to George, Prince of Wales.",
