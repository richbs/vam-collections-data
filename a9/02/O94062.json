Nixon has been photographing the sisters once a year, in roughly the same pose for almost thirty years, beginning in 1975.  Nixon has used a large format, 10\"x8\" negative plate camera to photograph, which gives maximum clarity in the printed image because of the size of the negative from which it is made. The series maps their shared and also individual passage of time and developing womanhood. One of the sisters, Bebe, is married to Nixon and a query for the viewer that this series raises is if you can tell, by the manners by which these women face the camera, which one is his wife.",
