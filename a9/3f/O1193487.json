This design is Paul Smith\u2019s version of the 1980s iconic wide-shouldered double-breasted suit. His suits were worn by men who aspired to the \u2018dress-for-success\u2019 notion of the Eighties. Smith began showing menswear collections in Paris in 1976, but didn\u2019t add a womenswear collection until 1994. His designs reflect a classic British style with a twist, often through the use of colour and pattern. Smith has had considerable commercial success both in Britain and abroad, particularly in Japan, where he now has more than 200 stores. In 2000, he was knighted by the Queen for his services to the British Fashion Industry.",
