Miniature painting developed as a separate art in the 16th century. In England, it became predominantly a portrait art. On the continent of Europe, however, the watercolour art of the miniature was also used to paint small and delicate genre scenes. In this it reflected the roots of miniature painting in the art of the illuminated manuscript (hand-written book).\n\nMiniature painting was also less of a specialist art in Continental Europe. It was practised by artists who also worked as oil painters, such as Lucas Van Valkenborgh (about 1535-97), or engravers, such as Johan Wilhelm Baur (1600 or 1610 to 1642).\n\nThis miniature is by Bartholomaus Dietterlin. We know very little about him. He was the grandson of Wendel Dietterlin, the German painter, draughtsman and engraver, and he did some engravings after his grandfather's work.",
