There are four red plastic wheels that a caterpillar rubber track has been placed around on each side of the vehicle. Two stickers have been placed on either side of the arms of the digger saying 'HERCULES'. The shovel dozer has some detail cast into the plastic such as a removable silver plastic dash with speedo and other dials. Also some silver plastic piston type detail has been moulded into the sides of the body where the engine would be. There are two black plastic gear levers in front of where the detachable driver sits. There are also two detachable black plastic headlamps. The lead for the control comes from the back of the vehicle and the wires have been covered in black plastic curled cord like a phone cord. This attaches to the red plastic battery holder control.

            "public_access_description": "Palitoy Bradgate was one of the trade names the company used, generally for cheaper dolls. Palitoy was first founded in 1919 as the Cascelloid Company by A. E. Pallet. The company, based in Leicester, manufactured celluloid and plastic fancy goods, including toys. In 1931 Cascelloid became part of British Xylonite (later British Industrial Plastics) and the arm of the company that produced toys took the name Palitoy. Palitoy was the first company to introduce Plastex, a non-breakable, more durable plastic than celluloid. In 1935, in response to a suggestion made by Queen Elizabeth II when she visited a factory, Palitoy introduced Bexoid, a non-flammable material. \n\nIn 1966 the hugely successful Action Man was introduced. This doll, an adaptation of American company Hasbro's G. I. Joe, eventually outsold its counterpart, and was continuously updated with new styles of appearance, clothing and equipment, not all of which were military (football and Olympic athletes were also produced but never proved quite as popular). Palitoy was sold in 1967 to the American holding company, General Mills, principally a food producer, but also owner of other international toy brands including Airfix, Chad Valley, Parker Bros. and Hasbro. Palitoy became the centre of UK operations, swallowing up Airfix and Chad Valley, but continuing to manufacture many of their products.\n\nIn 1984, General Mills decided to sell off or close down their English and American toy firms. The factory site of Palitoy was sold to Kenner Parker Tonka, the Airfix constructional kits were sold to a French company, production of Tiny Tears moved to Spain and production of all Action Force figures moved to the Far East. A Palitoy archive was set up at the V&A Museum of Childhood soon after Palitoy ceased trading. The majority of the archive falls into two categories - Airfix and other construction kits and Action Man.",
