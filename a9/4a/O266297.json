The designer, Barbara Pile, trained at the LCC Central School of Arts and Crafts.  Within the field of textile design, the school remained influential throughout the twentieth century and is now known as Central Saint Martins, part of the University of the Arts cohort.  Past alumni included Terence Conran, Joyce Clissold and Marianne Straub.\n\nPrior to producing this print, Pile had designed prints for several key British textile manufacturers, including the Donald Brothers, David Whitehead and Alan Walton Textiles.  In post-war Britain, textile designers had begun to reduce naturalistic motifs such as leaves, stems and seed heads to more linear, almost skeletal forms.  Often cited as an act of rebellion against a tradition of romantic floral styles, Pile's leaf print is an early example of a move towards greater simplicity and economy within 1950s textile design.",
