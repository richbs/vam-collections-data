It is carved and gilded in the opulent style of the designer William Kent, who drew on ancient Roman architectural features, such as the capitals of columns, to create furniture for the Palladian houses of the 1730s and 1740s. This style of pedestal with a cherub's head was a popular model and can be found in many country houses.\n\nThe origin of this pair of pedestals is not known. When they were bequeathed to the V&A by Claude Rotch in 1962 the gilding had been stripped, they had been painted to imitate mahogany, and angels' wings had been attached to the shoulders. The gilding has since been restored, the wings removed, and missing shell-shapes replaced between the legs.\n\nOn loan to Chiswick House.",
