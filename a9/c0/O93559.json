            "history_note": "Lewis Hine began to take photographs in about 1904 when he was teaching at the Ethical Culture School in New York.  He used photography for educational purposes, to promote the idea of the dignity of working man and women's lives, and also to celebrate the multicultural nature of contemporary American society.  Hine wanted to faithfully represent working people and commonplace things, a theory which for him had an aesthetic justification in 19th-century literary and visual realism.  Hine believed that realist photography could serve a social purpose.  \nHe began freelance work for the National Child Labour committee (NCLC) while teaching in New York.  The NCLC was an agency whose purpose was to help enact laws prohibiting child labour.  Hine's photographs of child workers helped the organisation prove that there was widespread abuse of the laws against child labour.  In 1918 he became a captain in the Red Cross and travelled to France. Later he went to other parts of Europe to document the work of the Red Cross and the social impact of the 1st World War.  When he returned to New York, he moved away from representing people in the depths of oppression and produced images of people (mostly adults) working.  He hoped to show working people the beauty in their way of life.  Hine's reputation was not established at the time of his death in 1940.  His importance as an artist with a progressive spirit was not debated until the 1960s.",
