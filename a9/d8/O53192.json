            "physical_description": "A concertina-action card table, of solid and veneered mahogany inlaid with boxwood(?), and carved in mahogany and boxwood(?). The top leaf is inlaid with a Greek-key border, and edged on three sides (not the back) with a ribbon-and-flower ovolo moulding. The Greek key is repeated, but in relief, on three sides of the frieze (not along the back). It stands on four long cabriole legs of mahogany, carved with scrolling leaves and flower-heads at the knees and with out-scrolling feet. The interior is lined with green baize, stamped with a Greek-key border (on a much smaller scale than the Greek key on the top and frieze)\n\nThe veneered top and the veneered frieze rails are made of oak, as are the triangular glue blocks in the back corners, which support the butt hinges for the fold-out back rail. (Some of the screws in these hinges now extend right through the rail, so are probably replacements.) The two halves of each folding side rail are joined to each other by quadrant hinges -- one at the top and one at the bottom -- and those on the left rail are both stamped by H. Tibats (whose hinges have been found on a number of pieces of 18th-century furniture). The back half of each of the folding side rails is reciprocally rebated -- when folded out -- to a small section of frieze (supporting applied Greek fret) that is presumably tenoned to the leg. When the folding rails are extended, they are held in place by an oak drawer with a bottom rail extending on both sides to run in a groove in the inside of the frieze rails. When positioned to straddle the two halves of the folding rail it keeps them straight. It is accessible if pulled out when the top is folded in, so that it can be used to store cards and counters. And when the whole table is folded up it can be slid away beneath the fixed top.\n\nAs well as lining the interior, green baize is glued to the top of the folding back rail and legs, to protect the veneer of the folding top when this is folded out. This baize is possibly original.",

A date in the mid- to late 1750s is also more consistent with the presence of the Tibats hinges, which have been found on other pieces of the 1770s (and possibly later).",
