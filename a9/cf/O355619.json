Square neck, long medium sleeves, a medium high waist and a gored skirt. The neck, shoulders, cuffs and bow have a blue satin trimming which consists of a double band of tucks, edged with triangles. Around the hem are three padded satin bands, which a tear shows to be stuffed with twisted strands of wool. There is a made-up bow with two pendant ends stitched at the centre back of the waist. The bodice fastens in front, and has a semi-attached glazed cotton lining which fastens with brass hooks and stitched eyes. Boned at each side of the back, on the darts and at the front. There is an inside waist tape. Narrow bands of cream Bedfordshire Maltese lace, threaded with blue silk ribbon, are stitched inside the neck and around the lining. The attached skirt is cut in eight gores, and arranged in narrow tucks at the waist which cover each stem. Slightly trained. Faced with stiffened cotton. Machine stitched and possibly even ready-made.",
