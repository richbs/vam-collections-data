Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of an oni wrestling with a Chinese child.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Ho Kiokumin. This is a lively depiction as the arms and facial features of both the demon and the child are strained due to the exertion of fighting. The netsuke is minutely detailed and despite its compactness the figures have a naturalistic appearance with convincing musculature and tense facial features.",
