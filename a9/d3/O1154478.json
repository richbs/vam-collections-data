Jamie Reid used this design satirically and reorganised the advertisement to give it new meaning by appropriating it in his designs for the reggae compilation album,  The Front Line II (see S. 811-1990). His initial outline doodle can be seen in the lower left hand corner of this ideas board.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
