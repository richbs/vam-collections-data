Gingerbread, a flat dry cake flavoured with ginger, was traditionally sold at fairs from medieval times until the 20th century.  Pieces of gingerbread with gold leaf applied on top were called 'fairings'. There was a gingerbread stall at St Bartholomew's Fair, held in London every year from 1123 until 1850.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis mould has a carved picture on each side. On one side is a horse-drawn coach with a driver.  On the other is a man in a top hat on a hobby horse. This was an early bicycle without pedals, pushed along by the feet, which was in use between about 1817 and 1830.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis mould is carved from beech, which was sometimes used for gingerbread but which was not as suitable as the more expensive boxwood, pearwood, applewood or other fruitwoods, which are smooth and hard when carved. There are patterns on each side to save on space and materials.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis mould was bought by a collector from an elderly baker in Lewes, East Sussex, in about 1890.  It would have been used to make gingerbread for sale in the shop or at fairs.",
