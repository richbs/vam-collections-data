These glazed Fassi (from Fez) wares were made by professional male potters as decorative tableware for urban consumers. Their style may have been influenced by the appearance of Chinese porcelain, historically made available through Mediterranean trade. Another factor was the availability of increasingly pure cobalt blue imported from Europe from the 1850s onwards.\n\nThis dish, or tabsil, was used to serve foods with a sauce. The dish was donated to the V&A by George Maw, founder of Maw & Co., a British manufacturer of ceramic tiles. The company won many medals and awards at the international exhibitions which were a feature of the late 19th century. This dish was displayed at the 1871 Annual International Exhibition held in London. A label on its base suggests that it was loaned to the exhibition by George Maw.",
