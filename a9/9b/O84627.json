The old man is shown in profile facing left towards the younger man on the opposite page (IS 48 3/B- 1956).  He is similarly depicted against a plain buff-coloured background standing on a green margin which has been extended with an additional piece of painted paper to indicate the ground beneath his feet.\n      He is dressed in an ivory-coloured <i>jama</i> which is decorated with a half-drop pattern of a flowering plant.  He wears a turban of a white and gold horizontally-striped material with a ruby and pearl jewel on top.  His <i>patka</i> is of an orange and gold pattern with gold end borders decorated with orange flowering plants .  He has floral pink <i>paijama</i> and brown shoes also decorated with a golden floral pattern.  His curved sword is sheathed in a crimson scabbard decorated with a gold floral design with a highly ornamented <i>talwar</i> hilt.  It hangs from brown leather straps attached to a waistband with jewelled buckles.  His right hand rests upon the hilt of a straight bladed sword with a golden guard decorated in red and green.  Its green scabbard is bound diagonally in gold.\n      The painting has a double frame of an applied paper strip in pale orange and an outer frame of striated marbling in orange and dark green, both of which are decorated with stylised floral scrolls in gold. The inner frame is outlines in white on both sides. A golden outer strip of paper outlined in green on its inner edge and a blue outline on the main complete the framing. The main border is ivory coloured and decorated with alternate red poppy and pink lily motifs flowerheads have been painted on stems and pinnate leaves which are mottled in a sage green colour central petal of the lily points upwards and the buds are beginning to open, while the poppies lack any buds at all.  The design appears to have been made from stencils seen in a number of pages towards the end of the album, where they are rendered wholly in marbled techniques.  The green leaves here appear to have been coloured a speckled green in some technique akin to marbling, while the flower heads above are painted in opaque watercolours.  The motifs are outlined in gold.\n      The margins of the page have strips of buff-coloured paper with an inner white outline pasted on them.  A beige strip of textile has been added to the inner left-hand edge as a gutter for the binding. The edges of the page have been gilded.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal paintings, drawings and flower studies on both sides. The album was rebound in the mid nineteenth century with a striped Indian brocade, patterned with rows of flower sprigs, possibly made in southern India.  The silk may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A",
