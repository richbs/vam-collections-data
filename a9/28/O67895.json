They came in a variety of sizes for holding different kinds of food. This smaller octagonal example has reeded borders and square handles at the ends. The lid is domed and has a central knob. Often they were plainly decorated with only the owner\u2019s coat of arms; this one is engraved with a crest and eagle on a leopard's head.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
