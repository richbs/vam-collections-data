It consists of two skyscrapers or towers of wood, roughly hewn and painted white with black squares representing windows. Between the towers is a series of pulleys, threaded with white string. On the top of each tower is a bamboo pole supporting a crossbar of wood and metal from which hang aeroplanes. The King Kong figure, carved from wood, is suspended between the towers on the string by a pulley attached to his raised arm. On the outside of one of the tower is the mechanism which makes the toy work. It is a simple hook on which a 1lb weight is placed. As the weight pulls the hook down, the aeroplanes turn on the poles and the King Kong figure rises. When the weight reaches the bottom it automatically disengages and the figure slowly drops while the planes continue to turn. \n2. 1lb weight of cast iron with a loop at the top; the lettering is marked with red paint. \n3,4. aeroplanes which hang from the crossbars at the top of the poles on the towers by means of brass hooks. Both are made of wood and have red plastic propellers which turn when the planes are turning. \n    3 represents a biplane and 4 a monoplane. \n\n*The whole is very crudely made with rough wood, nails, screws and odd bits of wood. It is nevertheless very effective as a toy.",
