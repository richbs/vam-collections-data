The two end supports each consist of a single-piece, carved, double-scroll foot and a single-piece upper rail which is moulded on three sides (not on the inner face). The two elements are joined by a central turned and carved fluted column with chubby mask above, which is flanked by two low-relief carved and pierced sections of scrolling strapwork, plain on their inner faces. The top is formed from a single wide walnut board (the underside showing regular saw marks) covered in canvas nailed (with round-headed tacks) along the edges and with a dark stain or pigmented wax. The top is located to the two end supports with a loose tongue held with two pegs in the rail. The two end supports are joined by top and bottom longitudinal moulded stretchers which are linked by 3 vertical turned balusters (tenoned into the stretchers). Two split-turned balusters of the same pattern are applied to the back of the end supports.\n\nModifications\nThe top with canvas covering and metal fixings probably replaced.",

One type,- generally in walnut, of which this is an example, has prominent and richly-carved end supports linked by a series of turned balusters, and was clearly meant to be admired 'in the round' as well as serving a practical function. Some of these have tops with extending leaves to allow them to double in length.\n\nThis version of the design relates to similar tables in Spanish collections, with end supports carved with leafy scrolls.
