The tapestry workshop at Mortlake was established by Francis Crane under the patronage of King James I, and fifty Flemish weavers were brought there in 1620. Through their skill and the advantages of royal involvement, the workshop produced some of the finest tapestries in Europe during its first twenty years; the quality of these fragmentary pieces is testament to that.\n\nWe already have in the V&A's collection Perseus on Pegasus, the only surviving tapestry from the early Mortlake series The Horses, which is, however, missing its border. These fragments may be actually from the missing border, and are at least the only known survivors of the same border design. They include hippocamps, sea creatures half horse and half fish, which in mythology drew Neptune's chariot.",
