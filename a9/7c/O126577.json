The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London\n\"The next (670) chair was to continue even more markedly the trend towards use as the primary consideration. Eames, in fact, started by asking the question; which material provides the most comfortable resilience, and which upholstery allows this resilience to be most effective as well as having comfortable, perhaps even luxurious tactile properties? The answer was down-filled leather, and it is such a combination fastened to moulded plywood shells which makes the Lounge Chair. Equally significant to architecture has been Eames\u2019s demonstration in furniture design\u2026that \u2018what for\u2019 is fundamentally a more interesting question than \u2018how\u2019 and moreover with the great technological choice open, the most appropriate. In this sense Eames\u2019s furniture contributes more to design thinking than \u2018plug-in\u2019, being based on an attitude more appropriate to the present high level of technology. Like the design of spacecraft, it starts from a performance specification and not the random exploitation of the seemingly possible.
