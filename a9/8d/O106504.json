            "history_note": "This gem was part of the collection of the Reverend Chauncy Hare Townshend (1798-1868), who bequeathed his important collection to the South Kensington Museum in 1869. Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.",

There are a number of small red granular inclusions within the moss agate layer, but the green mossy inclusions are not thought dense enough to qualify the material as bloodstone jasper.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Engraved gemstones based on classical models were widely produced and collected in Italy in the eighteenth century.  Many were brought back by British Grand Tourists, and important collections were formed.",
