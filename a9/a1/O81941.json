The main inner part of the assemblage was probably intended originally to be fitted into a velvet covered surround.",

Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>66 A Woman, called Lady Leigh</b>  \n<b>1648</b>  \nP114-1910  \n \n<b>Oval 73 x 60 mm</b>  \n  \nFeatures boldly and freely hatched in brown and sanguine, with some blue shadow and touches of opaque white heightening, on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched with darker colour and with the lights in gouache; dress in brown wash, hatched and with the lights in gouache; background an opaque brown wash, with a sky in opaque washes of blue and grey; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Faded; numerous small losses; the support warped and possibly cropped in parts of the margin.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In gold, centre right: S.C/1648 (see B in Appendix 2).  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century oval gilt-brass frame; the flat glass fitted into a rebate; the inner margin is a row of cast and chased leaves within a shallow depression rising to a narrow reeded band and a broad convex band of acanthus leaves alternating with stemmed trefoils; the outer border is a rope moulding; the whole is inserted into a plain brass strip-ring to which the hanger is attached. The main inner part of the assemblage was probably intended originally to be fitted into a velvet covered surround.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by George Salting (1) from an undisclosed source, and bequeathed by him to the Museum, 1910.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Salting Collection</i>, 1911, p. 46; Goulding 1914-15, p. 21; Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 80, no. 554 (? no signature or date mentioned); Long 1929, p. 88 (<i>A Lady</i>, 1648. Signed); Long 1930, p. 13, fig. 21 (A Lady); Reynolds 1952, pI. IX, no. 24 (as Lady Leigh); Foskett 1974, p. 17, fig. 12 (as <i>Unknown Lady</i>); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p.10. \n\nThe association of the name 'Lady Leigh' with this portrait goes back to the period of Salting's ownership, and may, since it is not particularly ambitious, have been genuinely traditional. Long evidently took it seriously enough to look for likenesses, suggesting comparison with lot 142 in the Sackville Bale sale.(2) Perhaps he thought that it was this miniature, or just that it might show the same sitter, but the Sackville Bale miniature passed to Fairfax Murray and thence to the Fitzwilliam Museum. During its history it has been labelled alternatively as Lady Leigh or Lady Ley; either way the sitter is not the same as in this miniature.  \n \nConfusion about the spelling perhaps reflects difficulty hitherto in finding a reasonably plausible candidate for the identification. The Leys (the pre-Churchillian Earls of Marlborough) present their own problems, and although they may help with the Fitzwilliam miniature, certainly are of no help with this miniature. Of the Leighs, there is Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Francis, Earl of Chichester, who was the second wife of Thomas, 5th Earl of Southampton (married on 24 April 1642) . She was called by Clarendon 'a beautiful and worthy lady', (3) but it is difficult to see why her maiden name (which should anyway be Lady Elizabeth Leigh) should be attached to a portrait dated long after her marriage. A portrait said to be of her and attributed to Van Dyck was in 1919 in the collection of Lady Lucas; (4) there is no apparent resemblance to the sitter for the miniature under discussion.  \n \nA much better candidate is Jane FitzMaurice, daughter of the Baron of Kerry and Lisnaw; she became the second wife of the Hon. Sir Thomas Leigh (1616-1662). Her first surviving son Thomas was baptised on 17 June 1652, and eventually succeeded his grandfather as the 2nd Baron Leigh of Stoneleigh in February 1671/2. She was presumably the right age to have sat for this miniature in 1648. If she were the sitter, it would be interesting that she or her husband's family, who were fervent royalists, should have been in London at this date commissioning miniatures. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4629. \n2 Christie's 24 May 1881, 'Lady Leigh .. signed and dated 1648'. \n3 Quoted from Cokayne, 1900-9. \n4 Photo NPG; see also L Cust, <i>Van Dyck</i> (1905), p. 126.\"\nEmma Rutherford and Dr Bendor Grosvenor, <u>Warts and All.
