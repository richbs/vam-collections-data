            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe term 'miniature' is a description of a watercolour technique rather than the size of a painting. So although this painting may seem quite large, it is a miniature because it is painted in watercolour on vellum (fine animal skin).  Such large miniatures are today called 'cabinet miniatures'.  This is a recent term for miniatures that would have been kept in a cupboard or  a room hung with other small paintings. Both spaces were then called 'cabinets'.\n\nPeople\nRichard Sackville (1590-1624) succeeded as 3rd Earl of Dorset in 1609.  He married Anne Clifford, daughter of George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland.  Her diary records the many extravagances that led the mortgaging of his house, Knole in Kent.  Sackville was a prominent figure in the tiltyard (where a horseman with a spear would charge at a mark or person). His interest in such chivalrous pastimes is reflected in the pieces of armour on the table and floor.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis is one of the biggest and most important of Isaac Oliver's large-scale miniatures.  For Dorset no expense was too great. Here the painter used the three most important blue pigments:  costly ultramarine (lapis lazuli) for his breeches spangled with moons and suns; blue bice (azurite) for the side curtain, pelmet and stockings; and smalt (a pigment made from cobalt-coloured glass) for the greyish curtain behind the sitter.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u2018ISAAC OLIVER\n\n<b>Richard Sacville, 3rd Earl of Dorset</b>, 1616\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (721-1882)</i>\nVellum stuck to plain card, rectangular, 239 x 157 mm, 9 7/16 x 6 3/16 in.\n\nRichard Sackville, (1590-1624), who succeeded as third Earl in 1609 was categorized as \u201ca man of spirit and talent, but a licentious spendthrift\u201d.  He married Anne Clifford, daughter of George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland and her diary records his extravagances, so that by his death he had mortgaged Knole.\n\nOne of the biggest and most important of Oliver\u2019s large-scale miniatures.  Dorset\u2019s prodigality was famous and is here reflected, as V. J. Murrell has observed, in the use of the three most important blue pigments: the costly ultramarine (lapis lazuli) for the trunk hose; blue bice (azurite) for the side curtain, pelmet and stockings; and smalt (a pigment made from cobalt-coloured glass) for the greyish curtain behind the sitter.\n\nThis miniature is a rare instance where the clothes worn can actually be identified in a contemporary inventory.  In 1617 \u201cAn Inventorie of the rich wearing Apparrell of the right honourable Richard Earle of Dorset\u201d was compiled, in which Sacville\u2019s attire is identifiable:\n\n\u201cItem one paire of Bullen hose of Scarlett and blew velvet the panes of Scarlett laced all over with watchett silk silver and gold lace and the puffs of blew velvett embroidered all over with sonnes Moones and stares of gold\nItem one paire of longe watchet silke stockings embroidered.\u201d\n\nThe suit in the inventory consists of only five items, whereas normally it would have been made up of eleven.  By 1617 parts of it must have already been given away or dismantled for upholstery at Knole, as was the case of most of the clothes and caparisons in the inventory.\n\nDorset was a prominent figure in the tiltyard and his interest in chivalrous pastimes is reflected in the pieces of armour on the table and floor.  No other miniature corresponds so closely with the formalized portraits ascribed to William Larkin (no. 277).  The miniature, however startling a feat of virtuosity, is so uncharacteristic of Oliver in its composition and multicoloured tonality that it must reflect the dictates of the sitter.  It is in remarkably brilliant condition, apart from losses to the curtains and helmet crest and the inevitable oxidization which, in the case of the armour, has resulted in the unsightly highlights.\n\nINSCRIBED: Signed bottom right: <i>Isaac. Olliuierus. fecit.; and: 1616.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: Presumably commissioned by the sitter; first recorded in the collection of Jeremiah Harman; C. Sackville Bale collection; sold 24th May 1881 (lot 1424); acquired by John Jones; bequeathed by him, 1882.\n\nLITERATURE: A.
