If two players, one starts from Edinburgh and the other from London, both using two pieces; if four runners, then one piece each.\nThrow the dice for order of playing, the highest starting first.\nShould a runner alight upon a space occupied by an opponent, the opponent must go back two towns.\nIf any runner arrives at any of the following towns:-  Cambridge, Grantham, Nottingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Tynemouth or Dunbar, they must rest and lose their next turn.\nIf any runner plays on to the spaces River Derwent or River Tees they must start again from their starting point.\nAny runner arriving at Peterborough, York, Durham or Berwick moves forward 3 spaces.\nThe first runner to reach the destination wins the game, but the exact number (97) must be thrown.\n\n\n*The playing surface is a complicated S shape rather than a spiral with a diamond shape at the top left for Edinburgh and a circle at the bottom right for London.  The rest of the non playing area is decorated with soldiers, some in red and others in blue.\n\nRules placement: on the back of the game",
