Maclagan notes that the practice of using death-masks for the production of sculpted portraits 'became a popular fashion in Florence in the second half of the fifteenth century' (1923, p. 304). The man's sunken cheeks and lips, barely opened eyes, and lack of expression lend this portrait a particularly morbid feeling, fitted to the funerary function it may have had. There is a female companion in the Louvre (inv. no. 592, formerly in the Courajod collection), and the two might have been made for sepulchral monument. As John Pope-Hennessy remarks, these may have been displayed high above ground, as suggests the angle of the heads (Pope-Hennessy, 1964, p. 345).",
