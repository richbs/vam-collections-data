II, p. 41 (as Nell Gwyn by Cooper; 'a copy'); Long 1930, p. 98 ('supposed ... formerly described as a copy after .. .'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24 (as Katherine Bruce by Gibson); Murdoch and Murrell1981, p. 287, fig. 9. \n\nAlthough Samuel Redgrave was the author of the Paintings and Miniatures section of the catalogue of the Dyce Collection (see Redgrave 1874), the catalogue was to some extent an act of piety towards Dyce, rather than a fully critical appraisal of the objects, and it is unlikely that Redgrave actually believed this clearly Van Dyckian image to be a portrait of Nell Gwyn, who was born in 1650. Many supposed likenesses of her had been shown at South Kensington 1865, including some attributed to Cooper, but none carried conviction. As Piper comments: 'The iconography has been confused almost beyond hope by the continuous baptism of portraits of unknown women of the late seventeenth century with Nell Gwyn's name ... Of the numerous paintings that go over her name, only two types have as yet much authority, that with the lamb [and] a reclining whole-length nude.\u2019(1)\n\nNonetheless, Nell Gwyn evidently did sit to Cooper, for on 24 April 1675 Peter Cross was paid \u00a334 for three miniatures, one of the King and 'two being Copies after Cooper of Madam Gwin' .(2) The attribution of this miniature to Cooper was quietly abandoned as the late nineteenth-century connoisseurs began to establish a firmer notion of Cooper's style. The miniature is thus not mentioned in Williamson 1904.\n\nAlthough heavily overpainted, it appears to be a copy by Richard Gibson, or by a pupil, of the Van Dyck portrait of Katherine Bruce in the National Gallery of Scotland (see also entry for Hoskins, Cat. No. 27, which is also related to a version of Van Dyck's Katherine Bruce). The attribution to Gibson was suggested by the apparent use of this miniature as the model for the Van Dyckian costume and pose of Gibson's Elizabeth Mitton, Lady Wilbraham of the mid-1660s at Ham (Cat. No.106). The extent of restoration on the features of the present miniature means that the characteristics of Gibson's style normally visible to the naked eye - the diagonal striation across the features and the imp as to 'wiped' around the eye sockets - are obscured. Nevertheless, the restorations seem to sit on top of a characteristically thick and heavily worked paint surface, and the painting of the hair and costume is similarly in Gibson's manner. If associated with him, and if as suggested the model for Lady Wilbraham, this miniature still looks earlier than other certain works by Gibson of post-1660, when his palette lightened. Possibly it was one of his own early works painted while he was working under Francis Cleyn, who was patronised by the Dysarts; or possibly it was painted by one of his children, similarly learning to paint miniatures from oil paintings in a style unlike that of the traditional limners. \n\n1 The former by Lely's studio, the latter by Lely himself; respectively: in the NPG (Piper 1963, pl. 9d; also NPG 1974, no. 240); and in the Royal Collection (Millar 1978, no.43. catalogued as unknown Lady, who 'bears a considerable likeness to the Duchess of Cleveland'). \n2 Quoted from Piper 1963, p. 149n. 'from an album of material relating to Nell Gwyn belonging to the Duke of St Albans'.\u201d\n",
