Further sprays fill the points of the star and also the ground between the centre-piece and the elaborate border. At each corner are larger elaborate, densely worked sprays which extend to the centre of the veil.\nThe border is formed by a solid, serpentine line, broken at intervals by sprays of flowers and by elaborately-patterned cartouches. The filling stitches used are clear-cut, solidly-worked and very varied. The effect of the border is three-dimensional and architectural. The area between the serpentine line and the scalloped edge is filled with naturalistic flower forms.",

It became increasingly popular once again in the later 1880s, and it experienced a boom in the 1890s and 1900s, peaking between 1895 and 1905. Point de gaze needle lace was the most fashionable type, and fine pieces were made for exhibitions or special commissions.\n\nThis veil was worn by Roxana Atwater Wentworth (1854-1935), daughter of a former Chicago mayor, for her wedding to Clarence Winthrop Bowen (b.1852) on 28 January 1892. It was said by the family to have been exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago, U.S.A., in 1893.The veil was also worn by Roxana Wentworth Bowen, their daughter, when she married in 1917.",
