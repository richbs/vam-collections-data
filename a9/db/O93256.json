This should mean that the JF or JE mark is a 19th century one.\nThese are always referred to as drinking vessels, however it has been suggested that owls were often awarded as shooting prizes and  have inscriptions relating to Aristotle's comments on the owl. Also, owls with bells tied to their feet were used as decoys in 16th-century shooting competitions.\nThe foot is of northern Renaissance form and Dutch silver of this time is very rare.",
