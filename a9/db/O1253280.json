This illustration, the front cover of the magazine The Mirror, or, Literature, Amusement and Instruction for Saturday 29 July 1837, shows Mr. Robert Cocking's Parachute with Mr. Cocking (1776-1837) in the wicker basket attached to a tin frame covered with linen. Robert Cocking is depicted doffing his hat to the crowd that gathered below to see his parachute ascending from Vauxhall Gardens on Monday 24th July, towed upwards by Charles Green's 'Royal Vauxhall' or Great Nassau Balloon, being flown by Charles Green and Edward Spencer.\n\nRobert Cocking had been concerned with finding a safe parachute system for several years and has been awarded a medal by the Society of Arts in 1814 for his work. The demonstration on 24th July ended fatally for Robert Cocking however since he had not included the weight of the parachute in his calculations. The parachute fell to earth like a stone when freed from the Great Nassau Balloon, and Cocking died of his injuries in an inn near Lee, Lewisham, South London, where the balloon descended.",
