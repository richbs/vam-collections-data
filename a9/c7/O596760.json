Introduction to Lancashire and Westmorland, p.1.\n'Even without a war, Lancashire could scarcely be recorded fast enough.  What is left of its landscape is of exceptional beauty, but often it is necessary to shut one's eyes to the chimneys creeping along its valleys and the pylons breaking the line of its crests.  As for the towns and cities which, in the industrial areas, form a London-like, an almost uninterrupted mass of brick and stone, they contain little that is not nineteenth century as well as blackish, and that little needs a deal of finding.'\nPollard, Richard and Nikolaus Pevsner. <u>The Buildings of England: Lancashire: Liverpool and the South-West</u>. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2006. pp.344-353.\n'Liverpool Cathedral, the life's work of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, represents the final flowering of the Gothic Revival as a vital, creative movement, and is one of the great buildings of the C20.  Construction began in 1904 at the height of the city's prosperity, and finished in 1978 as her long economic decline reached its lowest point.\n[...]\nAccording to the new scheme construction progressed from E to W over seven decades, though Scott continued to revise and refine the design until his death in 1960: choir and E transepts were consecrated in 1924; under-tower and W transepts were opened in 1941; the final pinnacle of the tower was set in place in 1942; and constructing the nave took from 1948 to 1978.'",

In 1940 the Committee for the Employment of Artists in Wartime, part of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, launched a scheme to employ artists to record the home front in Britain, funded by a grant from the Pilgrim Trust. It ran until 1943 and some of the country's finest watercolour painters, such as John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint and Rowland Hilder, were commissioned to make paintings and drawings of buildings, scenes, and places which captured a sense of national identity. Their subjects were typically English: market towns and villages, churches and country estates, rural landscapes and industries, rivers and wild places, monuments and ruins. Northern Ireland was not covered, only four Welsh counties were included, and a separate scheme ran in Scotland.\n\nThe scheme was known as 'Recording the changing face of Britain' and was established by Sir Kenneth Clark, then the director of the National Gallery. It ran alongside the official War Artists' Scheme, which he also initiated. Clark was inspired by several motives: at the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a concern to document the British landscape in the face of the imminent threat of bomb damage, invasion, and loss caused by the operations of war. This was allied to an anxiety about changes to the landscape already underway, such as the rapid growth of cities, road building and housing developments, the decline of rural ways of life and industries, and new agricultural practices, which together contributed to the idea of a 'vanishing Britain'. Clark also wanted to help artists, and the traditional forms of British art such as watercolour painting, to survive during the uncertain conditions of wartime. He in turn was inspired by America's Federal Arts Project which was designed to give artists employment during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nOver 1500 works were eventually produced by 97 artists, of whom 63 were specially commissioned. At the time the collection had a propaganda role, intended to boost national morale by celebrating Britain's landscapes and heritage. Three exhibitions were held during the war at the National Gallery, and pictures from the collection were sent on touring exhibitions and to galleries all around the country. After the war, the whole collection was given to the V&A by the Pilgrim Trust in 1949, and it was documented in a four volume catalogue published between 1946 and 1949. For many years the majority of the collection was on loan to councils and record offices in each county, until recalled by the V&A around 1990. The pictures now form a memorial to the war effort, and a unique record of their time.",
