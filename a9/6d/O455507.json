The body is in red, and the border and figures are outlined in black against white. The two central sections depict the Mata (twice) seated on a throne in a five domed temple, facing left and holding in her four arms a bottle, an incense burner, a trident, and a fan or whisk. She is adorned with jewellery - a crown, earrings, nose ring, necklace, arm bands, bracelets and ring bangles. In the left hand section, are three women at the top carrying pots on their heads and processing towards the enthroned god Ganesha. In the middle, a pig stands above two seated musicians with cymbals and drum gesturing toward the face of the sun, and a horn player goes in front towards the Goddess. Below this are seven fishes and a goat. Between the two goddesses is another goat. On the top right, six women walk to the left with pots on their head. Below them are the sun, a parrot, and a man and woman holding pestles. A woman rides a dog and a man carries a man and woman in a palanquin. At the bottom, Hanuman is preceded by an archer and followed by a man carrying a woman on his shoulders.",
