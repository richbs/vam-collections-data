            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton, probably hand woven, embroidered with silk in straight stitches and pulled thread work; whitework; backed with block printed cotton \nPieced. The central panel has four corner units, and so has a double mihrab/arch form of lozenges formed of straight stitch triangles placed within narrow pulled thread diagonal bands - all four edged with a row of reciprocal trefoils in straight stitch.  At the junction of the top 2 corner units is a pendant rectangle using the same pattern [for the mohr tablet], followed by 2 rows of small straight stitch lozenges [for the rosary].  Then with a frame of touching 8-pointed stars/flowerheads, individual stylized motifs of stars, plants, long-legged birds and 2 human figures and an inverted water jog [ablutions completed, the empty jug is turned upside down], all in straight stitches.  Below this is a tall plant motif decorated with more bird forms. This area is framed with a composite border, showing spacing inaccuracies top and bottom of the inner frame of the left hand pieced section - suggesting either the embroidery was worked in sections and the design wasn't matched correctly, or more than one person was involved.\nThe border consists of:\n[a] a row of tiny lozenges in straight stitches\n[b] pulled thread work in a basket weave pattern\n[c] a row of lozenges\n[d] 4 rows of small lozenges in straight stitch on a pulled thread lattice\n[e] as [c]\n[f] a row of squares either side of a diagonal pulled thread section in basket weave pattern\n[g] as [c]\n[h] a row of fan-shaped leaves in straight stitch, pointing outwards.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\n\nBacking: white ground printed with a dense pattern of fine curving black stems bearing a variety of exotic blossoms and buds in red, purple and blue.  There is inaccurate block registration along one side.",
