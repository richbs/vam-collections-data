The arms seen here are those of the Swiss bishophric of Constance quartered with that of the family von Hohenlandenberg. The arms of Constance occupy the first and fourth quarter and show a red cross on a white ground. Angels serve as supporters to the arms. Such angel supporters are often found in ecclesiastical coats of arms in mainland Europe. They bear the bishop\u2019s mitre and crosier. \n\nLukas Zeiner was a glass painter and glazier. He is recorded in the town records of Zurich between 1479 and 1512. At this time, the records are quite specifc and often record glass painters like Zeiner by name rather than as simply \u2018glass painter\u2019. In the 15th and 16th centuries it became more common to commission secular, heraldic, glass. It was especially common in mainland Europe, where the rules as to who could claim a coat of arms were more relaxed than in England. Zeiner was a leading glass artist in the field of heraldic painting. His style featured a coat of arms with supporters within an elaborate canopy. It set the stage for similar work for the next 100 years. \n\nZeiner used a pale red enamel on the angels\u2019 lips. This was a new pigment that began to be used in the 1500s.",

            "bibliography": "Williamson, Paul. <u>Medieval and Renaissance Stained Glass in the Victoria and Albert Museum. </u> London, 2003. ISBN 1851774041\nThe arms are those of Hugo von Hohenlandenberg, Bishop of Constance from 1496-1532.  The shield is charged with his personal .arms, Landenberg quartering Greifensee, quartered with those of the see of Constance, and the angels present his mitre and pastoral staff.  The rich diaper work and luxuriant canopy of branches might indicate the painter's indebtedness to Upper Rhenish models, but the technical and artistic brilliance of the execution singles out Zeiner in this work as one of the most gifted glass-painters of the late Middle Ages.  At least three other heraldic panels for Hugo van Hohenlandenberg as Bishop of Constance still exist, although these are all slightly later in date: two, of ca.1506 and 1521, are now in Zurich, and although the first is probably from the Zeiner workshop it is not of the same high quality as the V&A panel (Schneider, <font -i>Glasgerm\u00e4lde</font -i>, vol.I, cat. nos 101, 164; see also Lehmann, <font -i>Lukas Zeiner</font -i>, pl.XVI/41).  The third, in the Rathaus of Stein am Rhein, has been attributed to Ludwig Stilhart (active 1507-35) and was made in Constance in 1516 (<font -i>Die Renaissance im deutschen S\u00fcdwesten zwischen Reformation und Dreissig-j\u00e4hrigem Krieg</font -i> [Karlsruhe, exhib. cat., 1986], cat. no.D18).\nH.
