The lid of the box is mounted with a central roundel with a heart-shaped piercing. This, when turned on its central pin, reveals Arabic numerals from 1 to 9 and the letter X.  The top surface of this dial is decorated with flowers. On either side of it are oval panels of pen decoration, that on the left showing a man with a bottle and a glass, that on the right showing a man with a tambourine. The inside of the lid shows a white panel decorated with flowers and two dovers and inscribed below 'Mariaval  le Jeune \u00e0 Paris fecit'. \n\nThe box contain 29 counters (18 long narrow octagons, of 20 originally; 4 shorter octagons, of 5 originally; 7 circular, of 10 originally), decorated in a similar technique.",

This was an old Italian card game, the basis for two very popular 18th-century games, hombre and quadrille.  Card playing was a necessary accomplishment for those hoping to take their place in polite society and all manner of people played at many levels of society. Such counter boxes would have been a luxurious and fashionable accessory for a card player of either sex. \n\nThe boxes and counters were colour coded to relate to the suits of a pack of cards.  Green was for diamonds, red for spades, yellow for clubs and white for hearts. Although these boxes are signed by the maker, Mariaval, we know little about him, except that he obviously had a large trade in such items, as many sets survive.  He may have been the son of the engraver to the king.",

He seems to have made a speciality of such boxes, stained with this form of wax resist, with details added in penwork and paint. Such boxes are traditionally attributed to a <i>tabletier</i>, a maker of small boxes, of this name, who worked in Paris and, possibly, Rouen. A notarial deed dated 1727 records the name of a Claude-Fran\u00e7ois Mariaval who was engraver to the king (<i>graveur du roi</i>).  This could be the maker of the boxes, or more likely, it was his son who made them. \n\nSets of boxes decorated in the same technique appear regularly at auction and others are held by museums, including the Mus\u00e9es des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge and the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight. One or more of the boxes in most of these sets is signed by Mariaval. \n\nFormerly, the boxes were dated to about 1690 but they must have been made in the years around the middle of the 18th century, although in a rather old-fashioned style of decoration.  Another set in the V&amp;A collections (Museum no. 1444-1902) shows portrait profiles of Louis Ferdinand, Dauphin of France (1729-1765) and his second wife, Marie Josephe de Saxe (1731-1767) who did not marry until 1747.",

            "production_note": "The three coloured boxes (green, red and yellow) of this four-box set of counter boxes were presumably decorated by a wax-resist technique of staining, which was then further decorated with penwork and painting. The coloured counters each show a minute pierced hole near the edge, suggesting that they were strung on a thread, after the wax was applied, and then dipped into coloured stain. The white counters have no such holes. This technique seems to have been used mainly for such boxes but the Fan Museum at Greenwhich, London, is said to have a fan with sticks decorated in such a manner.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Such boxes were made in sets of four to hold counters for a card game, probably the game of <i>reversis</i>, an old Italian card game, from which the games of <i>hombre</i> and quadrille were derived in the 18th century. Such games were popular throughout Europe at the time, particularly quadrille. The four boxes were coloured green (for diamonds), red (for spades), yellow (for clubs) and white (for hearts).  The counters for such boxes were made in three shapes. The longer octagonal ones carry no numerical value but the shorter octagonal ones are each marked with a multiple of ten, from 10 to 50. The disc-shaped counters carry individual mottoes but no values.",
