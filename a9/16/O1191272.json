The vase is of a mottled reddished brown clay with darker brown colouration due to the accidental application of natural ash deposits during firing. Natural ash glazing and irregular scorching of the clay surface were achieved through the use of a wood-firing kiln.",

This bottle functioned primarily as a utilitarian object rather than a decorative piece, as suggested by its well potted, robust form. Admired for its restrained colour, Tanegashima wares, are potted from an iron-rich clay and minimally decorated. This piece has only two encircling grooves near the neck to emphasis the width and bulbous form of the vessel. Known as 'namban ware' or Southern Barbarian' pieces due to their Southerly location of the coast of Japan, these vessels were exported in large quantities to Japan to be used and admired for their wabi or 'quiet taste'.",
