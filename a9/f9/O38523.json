It shows a toy-mender's workshop, furnished with shelves, drawers, a work table and a desk.  He is seated by the table looking at the child over the top\n of his spectacles & is holding her broken doll; she stands to one side, eyes downcast (possibly crying) her pinafore crumpled in her hands.  The workshop is evidently a room in a cottage, rather than a shop, with a wooden door to one side: bottles & pots of glue, paint etc & brushes stand about the room, with dolls & parts of dolls (including a large dressed doll sitting in a trunk on the floor, & two complete dolls, one of them dressed, hanging in the window); there is also an open fire, and a pair of bellows. The toy-mender wears typical artisan's clothing of the period: a dark (probably leather) apron over a collarless white shirt, dark waistcoat & trousers; the child has short hair & wears a white pinafore over a short-sleeved dark green frock with red socks & black shoes with instep straps.",
