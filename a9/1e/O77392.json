When one entered a house in the 18th century, whether modest or grand, one stepped into the hall.  Here, the staircase leading to the upper floors caught your attention.  Triangular-shaped brackets such as this one were used to finish and embellish the ends of  the stair tread.  In smaller houses such brackets were often painted a plain white.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis stair end was made between 1740 and 1770, when the fashion for Rococo was at its height.  Within this small piece several key elements of  Rococo design can be spotted.   Curving  scrolls in the shape of a 'C' combine with a naturalistic pattern derived from the acanthus plant, which has spiky, feathery leaves.  Equally important, the overall design is not disciplined and symmetrical, but spontaneous and exuberant.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis piece is made from walnut.  This is a hard wood which can be carved into crisp shapes with the help of a mallet.",
