            "physical_description": "The sgabello is stained throughout, with no trace of gilding, and made up of a carved, fanshaped backrest, octagonal seat with a box-like apron below and a carved front and plain back board, swelling towards the base and linked to each other with a baluster.\n\n The crest of the backrest is emblazoned with a coat of arms of a tree growing from rocks (Chesi family?) in the centre, flanked by two acanthus ornaments arranged in a cruciform pattern, and terminates in two volutes, each of which is rounded to accommodate a rosette. The main body of the back rest consists of two diagonal and one upright stile, all three decorated with a guilloche frieze with plain triangular panels in between. The seat is flat and octagonal, with simple moulding on all eight sides. It has a paneled box-like apron with a rosette carved on the front. The richly carved front board consists of a rosette in a cartouche, crowned with an anthemion and flanked by two acanthus scrolls, which rest on a series of mouldings, indented, plain and gadrooned at the bottom. They in turn rest on plain bracket feet. Like the crest, the background surfaces of the front board or 'legs' are punched. The boards are linked to each other with a balustrade: the front end coincides with the rosette on the front board, but the back end is at odds with the knob, placed in the centre of the outer surface of the back board. \n\nThe front and back boards are made of one piece each, with vertical graining. The apron is made up of four panels, with mouldings nailed all four sides of the bason. The seat is fixed with one nail each to all four sides of the apron: the nails are concealed with diamond-shaped wooden covers. It also has three holes at the back of the seat to accommodate the stiles that form the back rest. The diagonal stiles terminate in integral mortices at the top and bottom and fit into rectangular slots. (There is no sign of nails being used).\n\nThe front and back boards appear to be made of old wood. Rasp masks (later instruments) are visible on the sides of the front board. The abbreviated appearance of the acanthus ornament, at the sides, suggests that damaged edges were rasped away at a comparatively recent date. The rosette has been crudely nailed to the front board and the knob at the back does not correspond with the baluster stretcher that links the two. The latter, together with the rosette and knob, are later additions. Although split in parts, the seat looks rough and worm-eaten on the left but surprisingly smooth on the right.  The panels, diagonals and uprights are very smooth and probably date from the mid 19th century. The back of the crest looks rougher and has small bits added to the bottom of the proper right volute. The bulk of the crest could possibly be made from an earlier piece of wood. Nevertheless the quality of the carving and the essentially smooth surface of the stiles indicate 19th century work. The front and possibly the back legs, and possibly the crest, date from the 16th century: the rest probably from the 19th.",
