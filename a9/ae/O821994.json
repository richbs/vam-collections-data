The text is as follows: PORTA, GIACOMO DELLA (c. 1537-1602) B1 Design for a gateway: probably for the Prta del Popolo, Rome Pen and ink 7 5/8 x 6 (193 x 152) As Dr Schwager has informed me, the drawing is by the same hand and probably for the same building as two drawings in the Uffizi (nos. 3001A and 24539). A contemporary inscription on these two drawings attributes them to della Porta. They are unmistakably connected with the Porta del Popolo and prove that della Porta had at lest as much to do with the building of the gate as Vignola, to whom the work is usually attributed. Alum (quatro), in modern binding containing 70 sheets of ornamental and architectural drawings by different hands, pasted in. Inscribed on the first page: 'A sketch book of Claude G. Lorrain bought at Rome, Liber Veritatis, by Verschafelt, architect to the Palatine...and subsequntly of his heirs by me Col. B Ansley 1839'; and again lower down in the same hand: 'Col. Benj Ansley Naples. March 1 1845' Inscribed also in another hand: 'Purchased by Samuel Pett at the sale of the effects of late Col. B. Ansely at Naples Dec. 4 1846'; and again in a third hand: 'Bought Wm. Tebby in the sale of the effects of the late Samuel Pett Esq., 9 Albert Road, Regent's Park July 4th 1873.' At the foot of the page an inscription in Pett's hand identifying Verschaffelt with the author of the bronze figure of St. Michael on the Castel Sant Angelo, ROme, ie. with Pieter Antoine Verschaffelt (1710-1793) PROVENANCE Maximilian von Verschaffelt. (The artist whose heirs sold the book in 1839 was more probably Maximilion, who died in 1818, than his father Pieter Antoine, who died in 1793); Col. Benjamin Ansley; Samuel Pett; William Tebb; bought from Messrs Sotheran, 1920 There are no drawings by Claude in the album. There are, in addition, 36 architectural drawings of a type that falls outsdie the scope of this catalogue. A short account of them is given below to avoid the inconvience that might arise from an incomplete account of a collection of drawing contained in a single album.",
