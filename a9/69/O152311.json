The under drawing is very clear. The stems form part of a lattice; they are crudely worked with black silk around which silver strip has been open [loosely] S-wound. The flowers and leaves are worked with:\n[1] silver strip open S-wound around a white silk core\n[2] silver-gilt strip open S-wound around a yellow silk core\n[3] laid and couched silk thread in which the laid silk is floss [ie. untwisted] and the couched thread is 2S. The colours are: light pink, pink, blue, cream, brown and a greenish-brown. Outlines are in laid and couched black silk.\nInner and outer borders: a meander with a split leaf in silver strip on a white silk core and a split leaf in silver strip on a pink silk core either side of a 4-petalled flower head in either brown or very light blue  silk, laid and couched with a spiral of metal thread in the centre. Two pink and silver threads have been couched to form a fine border either side.  \nMain border: The same pink and silver threads have been used to create diagonal bands containing the same pattern as the inner and outer borders. Two of these bands meet in the centre of each side to form a triangle. Between these bands there is a single, large serrated leaf, alternately silver on white or silver on light yellow.  Coloured silk details are laid and couched in brown, white, light pink, light blue, light yellow with black stems and outlines.\nNote: the 'light blue' silk is purple on the reverse side.\nFacing: bias-cut striped silk plain weave in light orange, pink, light pink, light purple.\nBacking: plain weave light orange cotton; undecorated.\nThere are four green silk twill tabs have been attached along one edge.  The same sort of twill has been used to attach tabs to 945-1889 and so was presumably done in the museum for display purposes.",
