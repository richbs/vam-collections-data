            "public_access_description": "Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was a Bengali polymath, being a poet, playwright, novelist, composer and visual artist. His work reshaped Bengali literature and music during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913.\n\nRabindranath's earliest visual work appeared in his manuscripts of poems (eg. Purabi) and comprised of doodles, scribbles and erasures made out of unwanted words and lines. Towards the end of his career, Tagore aged 67, striving to create a universally accessible art, took up painting more consistently. Around 1928, the artist made thousands of sketches and drawings using brush, pencil and pen. The artist developed a style characterised by simple bold forms and a rhythmic quality. The subjects depicted often involved animals, figures and statuesque women.\n\nThe painting depicts a semi-abstract landscape. The artist has used a warm colour scheme  comprising variations of brown, red, orange and pink. Landscapes constitute a major and constant theme in the artist's work. These studies occur from about 1929 until 1939, however the bulk of them are done during the second half of the 1930s. In this case, the artist does not study nature with the attitude of an observer. Instead, nature spurs him to explore his personal reflections and moods pictorially. The silhouetted forms of column-like trees are arranged on either side of the composition. The middle is opened up and reveals a softly glowing evening sky. In the middle we notice that the sky is reflected in a blotchy puddle of pinkish water. The scene could have been inspired by an actual evening but the lack of realistic details suggests that it was more of a personal vision, occasioned by a possible contact with nature.",

His work reshaped Bengali literature and music during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1913, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature and was knighted by the British Crown in 1915. \nRabindranath was born in Calcutta and grew up into a family whose exceptional creativity spearheaded the city's cultural scene. In 1901, he set up the Santiniketan School (later known as Visva Bharati University) on the Birbhum family countryside lands (outside Calcutta). The institution, conceived as an alternative to the educational system set up by the British, was modelled after the forest schools of ancient India. In 1919, Rabindranath founded the art wing Kala Bhavan at Santiniketan and invited the artist Nandalal Bose to paint frescos on the walls.Rabindranath was involved with the Indian independence movement for independence but maintained throughout the role of the enlightened poet who champions the universality of artistic expression. His earliest visual work appeared in his manuscripts of poems (eg. Purabi) and comprised of doodles, scribbles and erasures made out of unwanted words and lines.\nTowards the end of his career, aged 67, striving to create a universally accessible art, Rabindranath took up painting more consistently. In 1924 he travelled to China and Japan with Nandalal Bose and experimented the brush and wash techniques. \nThe artist developed a style characterised by simple bold forms and a rhythmic quality. The subjects depicted often involved animals, figures and statuesque women.Around 1928, Rabindranath made thousands of sketches and drawings using brush, pencil and pen. The artist\u2019s work has been exhibited in India and internationally.",
