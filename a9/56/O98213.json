Men's dress from the period 1800-1900 does not survive in such large quantities as women's clothing because it is often made of plain fabrics. This large square of cotton would have been folded and placed around a starched collar and then tied in one of the fashionable knots.  \n\nThis neckcloth forms part of a collection that belonged to the family of Mr R.W.S Brander, the donor. He believes that the initials G.S.B here refer to Gustavus S. Brander, who was in the Royal Horse Guards at the Battle of Waterloo and died in the 1850s.\n\nThe collection spans the period from about 1700 to the 1920s. It was kept by his aunt, Miss Anna Alicia Spieker Brander, who was interested in historical costume, theatrical performances and fancy dress. On her death the collection was handed down to Mr Brander and, until recently, stored in trunks.",
