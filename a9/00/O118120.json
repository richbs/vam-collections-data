Born in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1927, she emigrated to Britain in 1938. She studied fine art at St Martin's School of Art, and jewellery and enamels at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. On leaving in 1956, she took the then highly unusual decision to work as an independent designer and maker. In 1962 she established a pioneering course in experimental jewellery at Hornsey School of Art. Many of the next generation of British artist-jewellers were taught there. Fl\u00f6ckinger was the first contemporary jeweller to have her own exhibition at the V&A, in 1971. \n\nIn this ring, the flat polished surfaces of Gerda Fl\u00f6ckinger\u2019s early work have made way for encrusted, organic textures. These have come to typify her work. At this date, large, unusual stones - cameos, soft-coloured cabochons, veined turquoises and irregular pearls - were incorporated to give glowing pools of colour amidst the swirling metal.",
