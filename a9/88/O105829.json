Her off-the-shoulder dress has a white bodice edged with gold; fitting over this to below the bust, is a blue top edged with 'gold' is cut with a very low neck to fasten under the bust; the wide straps are edged with 'gold' coins.  From the left shoulder to right waist is a white sash.

Parts of the costume, like the overbodice and the style of the jewellery, are taken from Indian sources, simplified and grafted onto the pointed bodice and bell-shaped skirt of the a 19th century ballet costume; the resulting stylized stage costume would be recognized by audiences as 'Indian'.  \nBy 1860, photography had become a viable commercial medium, and several of the prints in the series Les Danseuses de l'Opera seem to be copies of photographs.  Maybe this was because most photographs were quite small and, of course, sepia toned; translated into lithographs, they could be larger and then hand coloured, making them more suitable for display.",

The print is No. 6 in the series Les Danseuses de l'Opera, published ca. 1860.  There were 14 in total, all the work of Alophe.  \nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering over 130 items, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Although it is often referred to as the Rambert-Dukes collection of Romantic Ballet prints, it includes important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
