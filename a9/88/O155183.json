A comedy show featuring the two Americans Neil Gladwin and Steve Kearney, the production won the Perrier 'pick of the fringe' award at the Edinburgh Festival in August 1983. The theatre club was started in 1979 by the American director and writer Lou Stein in a room above the Prince Albert Pub in Notting Hill Gate. Dedicated to producing the best works of foreign writers, by 1981 the Gate established itself as one of London's best fringe venues, along with the King's Head and the Bush. In 1982 for the club expanded to include a brand-new custom-built studio theatre in Battersea, above the Latchmere Pub.\n\nThe poster illustration shows a bottle of Perrier water in the spotlight, about to be yanked off stage by a hook, the traditional method used to curtail bad music hall acts. The critic Charles Spencer would doubtless have used this technique on the production himself, describing it as a 'painfully unfunny show'.",
