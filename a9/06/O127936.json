The painting is of exceptional quality, with very fine linear treatment and detailing: the style and overall composition emulate court flower painting on silk.\n\nThe colour scheme used by the painter is known in the West as 'famille rose' (literally 'pink family'), because of the prominence of the pink enamel. This was one of several  terms coined in the 1870s, when Chinese Qing dynasty enamelled wares were all the rage in Europe and they were claaified according to their predominant colours, the other main categories being 'famille verte', 'famille jaune' and 'famille noire'. \n\n'Famille verte' ('green family') was the earliest and most common of these four 'families'. All the coloured enamels used - mostly green but sometimes also blue, red, yellow and aubergine - are transparent. The pink enamel and the opaque yellow, seen on this 'famille rose' dish, appeared in the 1720s, at the least. A relatively large number of Jesuit missionaries served at the imperial workshops at the time that this colour was developed and it has been suggested that they introduced the method for achieving a pink enamel to Chinese craftsmen, but this has yet to be proved.",
