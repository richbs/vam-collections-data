S., p. 326) identifies No. 375 [1249-1888] as a study for 'The Valley Farm'. The ash tree in the right foreground of the painting is the same as the one depicted in the drawing, which may be clearly identified by the dead branch hanging down vertically. The tree in the drawing is also approximately the same size as that in the oil painting; but Constable added in the painting a branch and another part of the crown springing from a point in the trunk at which there was a break when he made the drawing from nature, No. 163 [252-1888]; he has also deviated from No. 375 in details. Constable's letter of 14 February [1835] to John Dunthorne, senior (L. ed. S., p. 324) suggests that this ash was studied from those at East Bergholt: \"If you can lend me two or three of poor John's studies of the ashes in the town meadow, and a study of plants that grew in the lane below Mr. Coleman's, near the sprouts which ran into the pond [that is, by John Dunthorne, junior, Constable's boyhood friend and later his assistant, who had died in 1832] I will take great care of them and send them safe back to you soon. I am about an ash or two now\". On the other hand the facts given in the note on No. 376 [1248-1888] suggest the possibility that he may have made use of studies drawn at Hampstead for both Nos. 375 [1249-1888] and 376 [1248-1888].\u201d",
