By the first half of the 19th century it was the main centre of production for small silver items in the region.  The silversmiths specialised in popular and devotional jewellery.  They sold their work at markets throughout the Alpine region, and at major international trade fairs all over Europe.\n\nMen rarely wore jewellery in Germany.  They made an exception for watch chains, which were often ostentatious and decorated with numerous pendants.  These frequently referred to their owner\u2019s occupation or interests.  The pendants on this chain include a miniature horse and grooming combs, and the decorative plaques also show a horse, and a man with hunting dogs.  It is marked with the unicorn\u2019s head mark of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, and the silver mark 12.  It was bought for 13 shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.\n\nThe word Schariwari, or Charivari, is used in southern Germany for all kinds of pendants on traditional watch chains.",
