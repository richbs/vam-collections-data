            "public_access_description": "The case of this watch is a fine example of an important development in the history of enamelling.  In about 1630 improved techniques made it possible to execute miniature painting in enamel in a wide range of colours. The metal was covered with an enamel ground and fired in the kiln. It was then painted with metal oxides mixed with oil. Each colour had to be fired in turn to fuse it onto the enamel ground. Such was the potential of the new technique that some watchcases, like this one, became wider and flatter to provide an extensive surface for enamelling.  The technique was used to decorate watches and other goldsmiths' work as well as to paint portraits in minature.\n\nThe key figures in this development, among whom the leading role is given to Jean Toutin (1578-1644), were enamellers and goldsmiths in Paris, Blois and Ch\u00e2teaudun who had close links with watchmakers. \n\nNicolas Bernard, who put his name to the movement of the watch, became a master in the Paris Corporation of  Clockmakers in 1636.  He had a son in 1642 and died in 1670.  In 1645 he was one of five watchmakers who put forward twenty-four articles to provide a new constitution for the Corporation, which received the approval of Louis XIV on 20 February 1646.",

In about 1630 improved techniques made it possible to execute miniature painting in enamel in a wide range of colours. The metal was covered with an enamel ground and fired in the kiln. It was then painted with metal oxides mixed with oil. Each colour had to be fired in turn to fuse it onto the enamel ground. Such was the potential of the new technique that some watchcases, like this one, became wider and flatter to provide an extensive surface for enamelling.  The technique was used to decorate watchcases and other goldsmiths' work as well as to paint portraits in minature.\n\nThe key figures in this development, among whom the leading role is given to Jean Toutin (1578-1644), were enamellers and goldsmiths in Paris, Blois and Ch\u00e2teaudun who had close links with watchmakers. \n\nThere has been considerable discussion about how the techniques employed in the new painted enamels differed from those which went before, but it is apparent that the effect was different: previously it had not been possible to create enamel paintings in such a wide range of colours as to rival or to copy an oil painting. \n\nNicolas Bernard, who put his name to the movement of the watch, became a master in the Paris Corporation of  Clockmakers in 1636.  He had a son in 1642 and died in 1670.  In 1645 he was one of five watchmakers who put forward twenty-four articles to provide a new constitution for the Corporation, which received the approval of Louis XIV on 20 February 1646.",
