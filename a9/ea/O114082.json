The cup on the left is supported by an Atlas figure. The scrolling acanthus was a popular motif in ancient Rome, and was much copied by Renaissance artists. The use of the scrolling acanthus leaf was an essential part of the goldsmith\u2019s skill from about the mid 17th century to the end of the 18th century. Ornament prints like these were copied by artisans working in different fields, and were responsible for spreading the influence of various decorative styles.",
