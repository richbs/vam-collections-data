He worked in Dublin before moving to Rome to live and work in 1765, where he remained for the rest of his life. He specialised in portrait busts of British visitors on the Grand Tour and established himself as one of the prominent British sculptors working in Rome at that time.\nAnother version of this bust, probably cast by Valadier in Rome at the same time for Sir Thomas Gascoigne\u2019s friends Mr and Mrs Swinburne, is now at Lotherton Hall, near Leeds in Yorkshire.",
