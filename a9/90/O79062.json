Hangings of leather were preferable to textiles, as they did not retain the smell of food. Fruit and flowers were thought a suitable subject for such a room.\n\nMaterial & Making\nSilver leaf was applied to one side of the leather, which was then embossed and painted with  red  and green glazes (varnishes). Finally, an overall yellow glaze was applied to the light grey background. Holes at the edges, and the lighter pigment of the border, suggest that the panels were slightly overlapped when nailed to the walls. \n\nPlace\nHolland, particularly, Amsterdam, was famous for the making of gilt-leather hangings. The most important manufacturer, the Compagnie van Goudleermaken (Company of Gilt Leathermakers), was established in 1641 and continued till about 1700.",
