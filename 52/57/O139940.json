Skidmore.  There are numerous designs for 'wrought iron terminals vanes etc'  in an earlier volume of printed designs entitled 'Skidmore's Art Manufactures Co Book of Designs', 1859-1870, in the Public Library in Coventry.\n\nNow little known, Skidmore was once famous as the maker of the Albert Memorial (1863-1876) and the Hereford Screen (which was exhibited in London at the International Exhibition of 1862). Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) designed both the memorial and the screen and employed Skidmore to execute them. Skidmore also produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork. Based in Coventry, Skidmore worked for some of the leading designers of the Gothic Revival movement, particularly Sir George Gilbert Scott.",
