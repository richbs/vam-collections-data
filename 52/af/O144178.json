She holds a cornucopia in her left hand.  Dressed in Qajar style with a pattern of roses either on a diaphanous blouse or tatooed onto her shoulders, with a string of embroidered pearls worn either as a necklace or stitched onto the neckline of the blouse. Embroidered pearls are also in her bracelets, armlets, tassels, earrings, headdress and down the bodice opening.  There are metal spangles applied at the waist and around the sleeves. Metal thread is used mainly as an outline.\nThis is framed with a light brown border creating the effect of a sash window which was a very fashionable architectural feature at the time.  there is a narrow blue border, a wide red border with a meandering stem in light and dark blue with blue, yellow and white pansy flowers embroidered with coloured silks.  Narrow black border and finally a red border.  Chain stitch forms a decorative pattern over the seams.\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk, light and dark pink, purple, yellow, light and dark green, light and dark blue, black, white, brown.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound on light yellow Z-twist silk.\nInset wool: white, dark blue, yellow, black, light blue, brown, green, red.\nBacking: glued in place, not stitched: resist-printed; brown ground with very small white and red ovals.",
