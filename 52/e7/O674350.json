Today the suite is famous among print and ornament specialists both for the singularly atypical approach it takes to a stock ornamental motif and for the beauty of Bossi's refined etching tehnique.",

The title plate is dated 1764 but the last few plates in the sequence are dated 1765 indicating the entire suite was not published until then. The suite is frequently cited in the literature as both the 'Suite <i>de</i> Vases' and the 'Suite <i>des</i> Vases'. This confusion stems from the addition of an engraved title-plate to a later re-issue in which the suite was entitled the 'Suite <i>des</i> Vases'.",
