            "physical_description": "Rectangular box, wood (unidentified) with a roofed compartment attached to the lid, decorated in gesso ornaments painted yellow, on a blue background. These include profiles of Minerva, Lord Leighton,  his coat of arms, pallet and brushes, as well as signs of the zodiac on gilt backgrounds, acanthus scrolls and grottesques. \n\nThe lid is decorated with a narrow oil gilt and studdded border on the outside and broad one on the inside, composed of gesso knots on a blue ground, running round all four sides (10 each on the back and front, and four each on the left and right  sides). A roof-shaped compartment is placed within the inner border: the front and back are both decorated with gesso ancanthus leaves and flowers, arranged in a cruciform pattern, on a dark blue background. They are flanked at both ends with zodiac medalions, painted dark blue on an oil gilt background, and set in diamond-shaped frames - capricorn and aquarius on the front, gemini and leo on the back. The sides of the roof are decorated with gesso zephyrs, placed in the bottom corners, blowing across each other, with clouds floating by. The front of this compartment serves as the lid: it has knob in the centre and hinges at the bottom. It opens, revealing a red velvet interior divided into two sections, and the inscription of the maker and the date, in alternating blue and gold letters, on the inside of the lid. \nThe front of the box is divided into three narrow sections, bordered with gesso laurel leaves, with two broad ones set in studded frames, in between: the narrow outer ones consist of gilt zodiac medallions (Sagittarius on the left and pisces on the right) set in a pattern of gesso anthemia on a blue groud, and the one in the central compartment consists of a profiled head and three-quarter view shoulders of Lord Leighton in gesso, wearing a blue smock with a red collar, placed above his coat of arms. The broad sections are acanthus scrolls and flowers in gesso on a blue ground, the one on the left arranged in a cruciform pattern, and the one on the right emanating from a vase, with grottesque monsters, placed either side. This decoration is largely repeated on the back, although in this case the signs of the zodiac are cancer and virgo, and the central section is decorated with a medalion of Minerva in a laurel-wreathed and beribboned frame, placed over another one, which surrounds the artist's pallet and brushes. Both the sides have a broad central section in the form of a fountain crowned by an anthemium, flanked by two opposing dolphins whose tails terminate in acanthis scrolls. These ornaments are also in moulded gesso, set on a blue ground. The base consists of an oil gilt torus mould, set on a blue plinth decorated with oil gilt studs.\n\nThe construction is partly concealed by the red velvet lining inside the box and the reinforced corners. The base consists of two boards, the plinth and the torus mould, glued to the other. The plinth has a split near the front left corner, which runs both vertically and also along the lower edge of the torus. The sides are nailed to the base at the four corners, and would seem to be glued to each other vertically: the front and back overlap the edges of the left and right sides. The corners of the box are indented and each glued to two decorative strips of wood which act as reinforcement: those at the front have mitred edges and those at the back are half jointed. The middle sections of both the back and front are indented so as to accommodate the decorative strips depicting Lord Leighton, Minerva and other ornaments. The lid is fixed to the box with two hinges. It is made up a single piece of wood, indented in the middle so as to accomodate the roofed compartment, the sides of which are inserted at a slant. \n\nThere is no sign of subsequent repairs or alterations.",

This was often scented and described in contemporary inventories as <i>pasta di muschio</i> (musk paste). The <i>pastiglia</i> figures and motifs were shaped with a lead mould and then glued to the gilt surface of the box - hence their frequent recurrence on other boxes. The boxes are decorated with legends of Ancient Rome and the scenes copied from woodcuts such as Jacobus Argentoratensis' <i>Triumph of Caesar</i> (Venice, 1504) or illustrations of Livy's <i>Roman History</i>.\n(Label text, circa 2000, from old Medieval & Renaissance Galleries)",
