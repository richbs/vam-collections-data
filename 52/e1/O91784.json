The Museum\u2019s early acquisitions of European silver in the 19th century relied heavily on important sales of private collections. During the early 20th century however the Museum was able to shape the collections more deliberately by influencing Hildburgh\u2019s prolific collecting. Hildburgh travelled widely on buying expeditions, usually recording when and where he bought something, but not (frustratingly for posterity) from whom. He added over 500 objects to the collection either as gifts to the Museum or as part of his bequest.",
