Hilliard completed several drawings for the commission and the Queen chose the one that she liked best for the final design.  This was not the chosen version.\n\nDesign & Designing\nHilliard was an established goldsmith as well as a painter of miniatures.  Indeed, between the ages of 15 and 22 he had been apprenticed to the Queen's own Goldsmith, Robert Brandon.   This explains why some fifteen years later the design of  the silver seal fell to him.  Hilliard later complained that the commission caused resentment amongst employees of the Royal Mint who considered the project their own: 'I had once envy enough ..for my doing well in other men's offices.'\n\nSubjects Depicted\nSeveral factors show that this is a portrait of Elizabeth I and a design for her second Great Seal.  Because Hilliard rarely produced pen drawings, the very existence of this work suggests a special story; one which in turn fits the evidence that the Queen insisted on seeing several preliminary 'patterns on parchment' before choosing the final design.  The costume, jewels and facial features also correspond to other portraits of Elizabeth.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>Elizabeth I</b>, c. 1585\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.9-1943)</i>\nPen and ink on vellum, rectangular, 13.7 x 11.6 cm., 5 13/32 x 4 9/16 in. (the borders have been chamfered).\n\nThere are only three surviving drawings certainly by Nicholas Hilliard, of which this is the earliest.  The costume in this drawing, which was originally rectangular, is from a decade earlier and the silhouette and details of the dress can be closely paralleled in a series of dated images of Elizabeth I.  The first is in the illuminated charter for Mildmay College, 1584 (no. 191), the second the \u201cErmine Portrait\u201d at Hatfield, 1585 and the third the \u201cArmada Portrait\u201d, celebrating the defect of the Spanish Armada in 1588, at Woburn Abbey (Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pl. 77).  The formal bows across the shoulders and down the front of the dress are indeed identical to those in the \u201cArmada Portrait\u201d.  So spectacular are both dress and jewels that there can be no doubt that this drawing, until now regarded as being of a lady of the court, must be of Elizabeth I.  The face, rendered in linear terms, is perfectly compatible with dated images from these years.\n\nPope-Hennessy cites this drawing as evidence for Hilliard\u2019s likely use of an optical device similar to that which must have been used by Holbein for executing this type of precise drawing.  All the technical evidence, however, excludes such a possibility: this is a drawing direct from life.  He also locates the style as French which is not likely.  Although Hilliard was familiar with the work of the Clouets, his drawing style stems from a direct imitation especially those by D\u00fcrer, both of which he specifically recommends as basic training in his <i>Treatise</i> and the treatment of the folds in the sleeves of the dress is directly D\u00fcreresque.  Technical evidence would not support Pope-Hennessy\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe painting of Hilliard\u2019s miniature was almost certainly prefaced by careful graphic studies and that a series of pattern drawings parallel to the Holbein series at Windsor must once have existed.  On the contrary, all Hilliard\u2019s miniatures were conceived direct with not preliminary studies, making this drawing something quite exceptional.  IT IS AT THIS PERIOD, C. 1585, that Hilliard began to paint large, full-length miniatures, so perhaps this was a drawing in preparation for an especially splendid miniature of the Queen.  There is however, another more likely possibility.  In 1584, Hilliard designed a second Great Seal, for which the Queen\u2019s commission runs: \u201cYou shall embosse\u2026patterns for a new Great Seal according to the last pattern made upon parchment by Our servant Hilliard.\u201d  The obverse of that seal is identical in silhouette to the drawing but clearly not the same.  The commission, however, states that this was according to the <i>last</i> pattern\u201d meaning that others had been prepared and rejected.  It can therefore be suggested that this drawing may be connected with the preparation of patterns for submission to the Queen.  The drawing is clearly, even the face, from life and the placing of the figure outdoors fulfils exactly the Queen\u2019s famous choice of location to sit for her miniaturist: \u201cin the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all\u201d (Strong, <i>Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I</i>, p. 8).\n\nTwo full-length miniatures of Elizabeth did once exist; one is recorded in the will of his son, Laurence: \u201cQueen Elizabeth drawn from head to foot in small volume and in a jet box\u201d and the second, referred to by De Piles, \u201ca whole length of her sitting in her throne, which was deservedly esteem\u2019d\u201d (Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pp. 229-30).\n\nCOLLECTIONS: Francis Wellesley collection, sold Sotheby\u2019s June-July 1920 (lot 428); A.
