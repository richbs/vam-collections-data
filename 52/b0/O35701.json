The body, arms and legs are covered with a light brown clipped mohair trimmed with long white mohair around the jaws. The hands are moulded and painted and the right one is holding a banana. The flat feet are covered with orange plush on the top and light grey underneath. The head is moulded sightly to the left with the eyes of brown and black glass and the mouth open to reveal a pink inside and darker pink tongue. The feet are probably metal. Inside the body is housed a clockwork mechanism, protruding at the upper back, which opens and closes the mouth on a wire while making the figure move by vibration. *Although not illustrated in any existing BGM books or catalogues, this is probably a SCHUCO toy, as monkeys were popular moving toys they created, and one opening and closing its mouth is described. \n2. key plain metal wing shaped key \n3. identification tag; cardboard disc edged with metal which has the name on one side and DRGM 942166 printed in red on the other",
