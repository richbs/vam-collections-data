It is the document setting out the terms on which the merchant Shylock agrees to lend Antonio 3000 ducats, noting the forfeit of a pound of flesh which he must pay if he defaults on the repayment.  Shylock wields the bond when Antonio cannot pay, saying: 'Let him look to his bond', and it is a vital prop in the courtroom scene when he hands it to Portia who begs him 'Let me tear the bond...' before Shylock snatches it back.\n\nThe Merchant of Venice was considered one of Irving's finest productions, and his portrayal of Shylock both innovative and sympathetic.  As usual in Irving's productions at the Lyceum Theatre, where this opened in January 1879, enormous care was taken with the scenery, costumes and properties.  Critics were fulsome in their praise for the designs of Hawes Craven, which they agreed had never been surpassed.",
