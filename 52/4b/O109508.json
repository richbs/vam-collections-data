The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.  They represented a wide variety of subjects but those of actors and actresses were especially popular.\n\nThis probably represents William Charles Macready (1793-1873) as Rob Roy Macgregor, a character from Sir Walter Scott's novel Rob Roy first published in 1817 and dramatised several times, notably in J. Pocock's operatic version at Covent Garden Theatre in 1818 and again in 1831.  The story is set before the Jacobite uprising of 1715 when Rob Roy Macregor helps foil a plot by Rashleigh Hilderbrand to steal his family fortunes, and Diana Vernon. Macready first played the part in 1818 and it became one of his favourite roles. It is similar to another flatback [S.331-1984] but has an axe instead of a dirk, and a sporran.",

Pocock's operatic version which was performed at Covent Garden Theatre in 1818 and again in 1831.  The story is set before the Jacobite uprising of 1715 when Rob Roy Macregor helps foil a plot by Rashleigh Hilderbrand to steal his family fortunes and Diana Vernon.\n\nRob Roy Macgegor was a farmer at Balquhidder.  After his herds were stolen he formed a band of men to protect his and other farmers' cattle.  After borrowing money from the Duke of Montrose to buy more catle, he could not repay the debt and the Duke siezed his house and lands.  Macgregor, feeling cheated, gathered the other clans and declared war on the Duke.  The stories of his attacks and escapes became legendary.  Finally he gained protection from the Duke of Argyll and changed his name to Campbell.\n\nVarious figures of Rob Roy Macgregor, Helen Macgregor and Diana Vernon were produced in the mid 19th century.  This figure is very similar to another one in which the sword is relaced by a dirk and he is not wearing a sporran.",
