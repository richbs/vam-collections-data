She left Argentina in her 20s and her lifestyle has been largely nomadic. Her work is inspired by the condition of itineracy and the importance migrant people attach to photographs of family and friends \u2013 often the only material possessions they carry with them. \n\nShe carries with her a troupe of dolls, which she has made by photographing her own face, manipulating the image on the computer, and digitally printing it onto a sheet of cloth. This she trims, stitches and stuffs to form a head, attaching found objects, which act as reminders of places in which she has stopped. She creates installations with these dolls in a variety of situations, which she often photographs. In one project she created a set of \u2018ID\u2019 cards \u2013 \u2018ID\u2019 meaning \u2018Intensively Displaced\u2019 not \u2018Identity\u2019  (see Museum nos. E.215-218-2005).
