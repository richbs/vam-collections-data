His work in this manner is technically highly accomplished, although his shapes and decoration look somewhat timid and over-refined when compared to wares by some of his contemporaries, such as Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Norah Braden or Katherine Pledell-Bouverie. This stoneware bowl is not, however, typical of Vyse's work, for it was made to serve as a gift to Ernest Marsh from Francis Berry. Marsh and Berry were avid collectors of the wares produced by the Martin brothers, whose famous bird motifs are depicted on the bowl. The motto, 'ADSUM PENE ADEMALL' is a Latin spoof ('had some, nearly had them all'), referring to Marsh's and Berry's good-natured rivalry as collectors.",
