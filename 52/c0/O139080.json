The former differ in alternating rows by having either light of dark centres. Each band is framed above and below by pairs of light red leaves that join to form the horizontal. There are 8 complete bands and 2 partial bands. Lying across these bands are 3 rows of 5 figures outlined in dark blue which are formed by 2 indented lozenge shapes filled with flowers and are double-waisted to incorporate the star-like flower (as above). These 3 rows give a vertical element to the design. Each of the many framed areas has a network of small white flowers on angular stems.\nMain border: dark blue ground with a light red meander bearing multi-coloured rosettes and along the meander are narrow compressed light red and dark yellow serrated leaves. Above or below each rosette is a stem bearing a pair of brown flowerheads.\nInner: white ground with a dark blue curved meander based on a linked barred S-design. From each bar a pair of small 3-petalled flowers fill the curve.\nMiddle: dark yellow ground with a broken meander in dark blue on which are stylised lilies and small light green horizontal leaves.\nOuter: dark yellow ground with a wide meander alternating in dark blue and dark green on which lie angular blossoms",
