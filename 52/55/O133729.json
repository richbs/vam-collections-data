Introduced to Thomas Stothard RA c1793. Worked as theatrical scenery and panorama painter, notably for Henry Barker. Exhibited nine works at the RA between 1812 and 1818, eight at the BI 1817-36, and five watercolours at the SBA in 1835. From 1820 increasingly painted in watercolours; founder Associate of OWS 1824, Member 1825. Numerous illustrations for books, including Shakespeare, Scott and Burns; many drawings engraved for annuals and magazines. Several engravings, watercolours and drawings are in the V&A collections. Died 13 May 1866; despite a long and industrious life, had received a charitable annuity from the RA since 1858. \nLIT: DNB \nDon Quixote Outside an Inn \n1855-1900 Neg HF968 \nCanvas, 30.5 X 25.4 cm (12 X 10 ins) Ashbee Bequest 1900 \nThe subject is taken from chapter 2 of book 1 part 1 of Cervantes's Don Quixote. The episode depicted is the Don's first expedition at the beginning of the book. Having encountered no adventures, he stops at an inn and mistakes 'two young women of easy virtue' at the door for 'graceful ladies taking the air at the castle gate' to whom he offers chivalrous assistance; eventually, they feed him, with appalling salt-cod, through his helmet which he has refused to remove. It is possibly the 'Don Quixote Being Fed by the High-born Damsels' exhibited at the RA in 1815, but see the comments on what might be the companion piece, 'The Barber and Others Purging Don Quixote's Library', 1852-1900). There is a watercolour by Wright of a further Don Quixote subject in the V&A collections (also Ashbee Bequest, 1801-1900).\n\nEXH: ?RA 1815 (244)\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
