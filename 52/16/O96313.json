This luxurious object would have formed the focus of its owner's prayers.\n\nCameos with religious imagery were objects for personal devotional use in the Byzantine world. The choice of a semi-precious hardstone for this piece emphasises both its importance as an object to its original owner, and its luxurious nature. The suspension loop, although not original, almost certainly reflects how the object would have originally been used, when it was probably worn as an 'enkolpion', a sacred image to be worn at the breast.",

            "history_note": "This piece was bought from Adolpho Loewi, an art dealer in Venice, who had 'purchased it from a private family in Rome' (V&A archives). Nothing is known of its early history. It is possible, given the Roman provenance, that this was one of the many portable Byzantine objects that seem to have made their way into Italy before the fifteenth century.\n\nHistorical significance: The Crucifixion was one of the central Christian images, in the Byzantine East as much as the West. This luxurious object would have formed the focus of its owner's personal devotional practices.",

Subsequent scholars have accepted this as a much earlier piece.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Cameos with religious imagery were objects for personal devotional use in the Byzantine world, in effect portable icons or amulets. The choice of a semi-precious hardstone for this piece emphasises both its importance as an object to its original owner, and its luxurious nature. The suspension loop, although not original, almost certainly reflects how the object would have originally been used, when it was probably worn as an 'enkolpion', a sacred image to be worn at the breast.",
