They usually worked from home, and their finished work was bought by dealers (less the cost of any patterns and thread supplied).  While working from home would give a more pleasant environment than, say, a factory, the lace workers were very much dependent on the dealers to pay a fair price, and would often work many hours a day to make enough money.  There were other health issues, too: Major J G Burns reported to the Children's Employment Commission 1842  \"Mr Collier, surgeon of Towcester, gave me a paper on the health of lace-makers\u2026he also told me that much injury ensues to young girls from a habit they have of wearing a strong wooden busk in their stays [a wooden bar to stiffen the front of their corsets] to support them when stooping over their lace pillows; this being worn when young and the bones soft acts very injuriously on the sternum [breastbone] and ribs.\"",
