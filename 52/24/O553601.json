She learnt to draw, sew and embroider at a young age, and developed a passion for Art History. Leaving school at 17, Muir chose not to attend art school and viewed this decision as advantageous for her career.\n\nShe made clothes that were both radical and classic, breaking the barrier between couture and ready-to-wear. Jean Muir made her name in the 1960s, creating a reputation for exquisitely tailored, timeless, and feminine clothing. Fashion design by Jean Muir, London, of a woman in a long-sleeved blue mini-dress with button detailing and detailing on the neckline and a green headband shows the radical change in seventies fashion, but Muir\u2019s inspiration from classic fashion.\n\nMuir is admired by the likes of Gaultier, Issey Miyake and Giorgio Armani, and has received countless awards in Europe, the UK, the US and Asia for her work in the fashion world.",
