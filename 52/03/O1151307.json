Captain Edie in turn gave them to Dr Lawrence Holker Potts (the donors' great-grandfather), who was a surgeon, and also an inventer (he invented the hydrawlic pile-driving apparatus, also known as the \"Potts method\"). They have been kept in their original Chinese packaging, and then wrapped in an English newspaper dating to the 1840s, giving us a strong date of origin for the objects. It was likely that Catherine Potts catalogued the silks and wrapped them in the newspapers in 1844, and this gives us a strong indication of the approximate date the silks might have been produced.",
