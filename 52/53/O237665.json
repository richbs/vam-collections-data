The jacket was made for him by the performance artist and club host Leigh Bowery. He wore this outfit to the supermarket, where he enjoyed the reaction of others. \"People were completely shocked when I wore it to Tesco - and it looked good with a big trolley.\"\n\nBowery had experience in the fashion industry. He had worked with the 80s youth fashion label Body Map, and continued to make clothes for his friends. The leotard and cap were made by James Montgomery, a pattern cutter for Richmond Cornejo (a '80s fashion label run by John Richmond and Maria Cornejo which dissolved in 1988 when they went their separate ways).\n\nRegistered File number 1994/1482.",
