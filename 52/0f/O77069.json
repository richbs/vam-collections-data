They appealed particularly to collectors such as John Sheepshanks (1787-1863) and the Reverend Chauncey Hare Townshend (1798-1868).\n\nSubject Depicted\nItaly had long been recognised as a fertile source of themes for paintings and many artists travelled there in the 19th century. Italian beggars or 'mendicants' of the Roman Campagna (the countryside around Rome) looked very picturesque in the eyes of British artists, especially if the Italians were young, female and pretty, as here. Their colourful costumes and the beauty of the Italian countryside made a most attractive subject, especially as the darker aspects of poverty were not shown.\n\nPeople\nRippingille exhibited this painting at the Royal Academy in 1844. According to a note on the back of the picture, he was furious to find that it was hung by the organisers virtually at floor level, so that the public were unlikely to see it. Nevertheless, John Sheepshanks noticed it and bought it directly from the artist. Rippingille claimed to be the first person to advocate the establishment of the Schools of Design.",

Lectured, established the short-lived <u>Artists and Amateurs Magazine</u>, wrote 'Personal Recollections of Great Artists' for the <u>Art Journal</u>, wrote fiction for periodicals and poetry (the unpublished <u>Consolation of Hope</u>), and claimed to be the first to advocate the formation of Schools of Design. Died suddenly at Swan Valley railway station, Staffordshire, 22 April 1859. His brother Alexander was also an artist, exhibiting 1815-35. The poet John Clare called him 'a rattling sort of odd fellow with a desire to be thought one ... a man of genius as a painter'. \n\nLIT: <u>Art Journal </u>1859, pp187 (obit), 332;<u> Athenaeum</u> 7 May 1859, p187 (obit); F Greenacre <u>The Bristol School of Artists </u>Bristol City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue, 1973, ppl21-7 \n\n<b>Mendicants of the Campagna </b>\nFA173 Neg V649 \nCanvas, 36.8 X 57.3 cm (14\u00bdX 22 5/8 ins) \nSigned and dated 'E V Rippingille ROMA 1840/London 1844' on stone bl Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1844 as 'Beggars of the Roman Campagna'. On the back of the canvas is the inscription: \n\nBeggars of the Campagna Romana/Mem: This picture, sent for exhibition at the/Royal Academy was placed on the/<i>floor</i> and has never been seen by the public/painted almost entirely with a/Magnilp or solution of sugar of/lead in Water & Mastic Varnish 1844/Bought of the Artist by John Sheepshanks Esqr. \n\nThis anguished inscription provides a vivid reminder of the crowded walls of the Victorian Royal Academy, hung from floor to ceiling with paintings, and the importance of a picture being hung 'on the line'. This term referred to a ledge 5.4 cm (2 ins) deep which ran round the walls in the earlier homes of the Academy at Somerset House and Trafalgar Square, at a height of 243.8 cm (8 feet) from the floor. All large pictures were 'above the line', the weight of the larger being supported by the ledge. Thus the best position was 'on the line', or just above eye level; a contributory factor to the smaller average size of paintings in the second quarter of the 19th century. When the Academy moved to its present home at Burlington House in 1869, the line was abolished and larger pictures again became fashionable. \nThe critic of the <u>Art Union</u> commented \n\n'Mendicants of the Campagna Romana. Two females with children, and not in the immediate exercise of their ancient and honoured vocation. We do not, therefore here 'Un qualtrino per l'amor di Dio', for they are lying at length and leisure, abiding their time and their patrons. The figures are highly characteristic, and closely descriptive of the parties. \nAt the same RA exhibition, Rippingille showed 'Children of Sonnino, Italy' (275), which may be a pendant to the present work. \n\nEXH: RA 1844 (273) \n\nLIT: <u>Art Union</u> 1844, p159 \n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson.\"",
