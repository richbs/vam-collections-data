It shows elegant figures distributed a grappolo (i.e. like a bunch of grapes) on the edge of a wood.  Light effects focus on a couple of lovers while other couples and lone figures are clustered in the shade around them. A similar composition, representing  the same main characters with fewer figures and minor variations is in the  Wallace collection, London (RCIN 400671) while another more complex version, with an additional scene in the middle distance, is housed in the  Museum Boijmans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam (Inv. no. 2585). \n\nScenes of amorous encounters in idyllic and wooded landscape are characteristic of the genre of the 'f\u00eate galante', which can however be subdivided in several categories: these pictures can show concert scenes, games, diner parties, all set in outdoor spaces and in a romantic context. The present painting appears to be a conversation piece.\n\t\nPater was much influenced by Watteau's art but showed nevertheless a distinctive manner in its use of more vivid colours and more explicit subject matter lacking thus a part of mystery that characterised Watteau's scenes.  Pater appeared less innovative than another great follower of Watteau, Nicolas Lancret, of whom the museum also owns interesting examples (see 547-1882 and 515-1882).\n\nThese elegant and mischievous genre scenes anticipate somehow the development of the pastoral in French art, of which Fragonard and Boucher would be the most famous exponents. The use of nature to enhance the intimate atmosphere of these paintings would also become the hallmark of the Rococo movement.",
