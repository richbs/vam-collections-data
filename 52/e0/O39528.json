            "physical_description": "to be checked against object - this text applies to 672 not 672a jan 2008\nCorner vestibule of 3 storeys and a cresting, containing a hinged jib-door, in plan forming two and a half sides of a regular decahedron. \n\nIt consists of a structural framework with two full-height stile-buttresses, each with a pentagonal footprint and decorated with carved crockets and various types of scale and twig pattern, and at the left side a plain return (originally fixed to the wall of a room); with horizontal rails dividing the 3 main storeys of panelled decoration and the cresting from each other; the eight-panelled jib-door is of canted form corresponding to the foot-print of the vestibule. The cresting sits between two concave moulded rails (4 of the 6 sections are probably 20th century copies based on 2 short older sections of rail), and consists of 2 rows of panels with pierced  tracery, (assembled in June 2006 using the most intact parts from 672-1895 and 672a-1895); the 6 panels are held from behind with metal fixings not in conventional grooves. \n\nNote \nThe physical and stylistic divergence of the crest panels from the rest of the vestibule suggests that the cresting is a 19th century replacement (probably using some older woodwork). Similar vestibules illustrated in 16th century manuscripts or prints show crestings close in form and decoration to 672a-1895, usually with pinnacles surmounting the buttresses. Pierced panels would have permitted some light inside the vestibule and stairway when closed.\n\nDescription of the panels\nThe third storey consists of 5 tall panels (sight size 77 x 17cm) of quartered oak (probably split and planed) carved in relief, with plain edges, and held in grooves in the moulded edges of the stiles and top rails. From the left, panel 3.1, (ie first panel from the left of the 3rd storey), a fox facing left on hind legs below a stylised vine with leaves (nicely undercut) and grapes on which perches a crow-like bird pecking at grapes; panel 3.2 a vertebrate vase design with symmetrical dragon heads supporting a vessel on which stands a male figure without a torso ???? on whose head stands a naked man holding plant tendrils; panel 3.3 a dragon facing left on hind legs swallowing a plant stem with spiky leaves and 3 flowers, in which perches a pigeon-like bird; panel 3.4 a dragon facing right swallowing a thistle-like plant stem with spiky leaves and 3 flowers on which perches an eagle; panel 3.5 a vertebrate vase design with a boar facing right with head turned left on hind legs swallowing the foliate body of a male figure, supporting a vessel with two downward facing dragons, atop which a dragon with wings outstretched supports a leafy stem with the head of a man.\n\nThe second storey of 5 tall panels of blind tracery with stylised flower heads, 4 of them part of the jib-door which hangs on 2 original pintle hinges, with the following ironwork fittings: a pierced iron strap nailed around the top corner with traces of textile underneath, and an iron latch fitting nailed with textile surviving underneath, an iron latch housing, on the inside of the door an iron latch on a ring fitting nailed; panel 2.1 (76 x 17cm sight size); panel 2.2 (66 x 11.5cm), with a non-original iron fitting that probably served as a pull; panel 2.3 (66 x 16cm); panel 2.4 (66 x 16.5cm); panel 2.5 (66 x 11.5cm).\n\nThe first storey of 5 linenfold panels, 4 of them part of the door, the left hand buttress with 3 iron latch fittings: panel 1.1 (77 x 16cm sight size); panel 1.2 (77 x 11.5cm); panel 1.3 (77 x 16cm); panel 1.4 (77 x 16cm); panel 1.5 (77 x 11.5cm), replaced probably post 1700.",

Parts of a screen or internal porch (such as the Oudenaarde panelling in S.K.M.) Panelled in three rows. Linen pattern below. Pierced crestings in two rows. (about 10 ft. high & 3 ft 6 wide)...These [ie nos. 7 & 8] are from Tours.\" The sketch annotated \"Panels - Linen. Panels - arabesque. P. cresting. Pierced cresting\". \nOn the list C (Typed inventory of the Peyre Collection) it is recorded as item 90 \"Two half tambours, Gothic 4 panels each\", and on the list B of disputed items (during the negotiations) that the Museum specifically stipulated to be included in a revised deal, they are listed as 'Two tambours and the arch between them\", which refers to item 91 (673-1895), associated with the two vestibules in Peyre's house, where they were exhibited together in room G (the large ground floor room facing the street), but not historically ensuite with them.\n\nAn entry in Peyre's own ledger (held at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, no listing no. was been assigned to these documents, spring 2007) appears to relate to the two vestibules, to their purchase from Paul R\u00e9capp\u00e9. Meubles et Curiosit\u00e9s. 9 Passage Ste Marie: \"Recappe 17 Fevrier 1877. Les deux tamboures/d'Escalier avec frais divers 5300 [the 5 not quite legible].\" A bill from R\u00e9capp\u00e9 seems to suggest a price of 10,000 francs for one tambour, but this is not certain. Note that the valuation cited in 1895 (Peyre VA papers, appendix F) by the Museum gives 7578 francs, commuted to \u00a3300.",
