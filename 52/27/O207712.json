Designed as a townhouse the rooms are spread over several floors linked together with several staircases. From the outside the house has a very distinctive appearance with large vertical windows which span three floors. The interior walls can be moved around to create new spaces and the front and side of the house can be opened allowing children (and adults) to play imaginatively with the dolls and furniture inside. \n\nThe house reflects aspects of changing lifestyles at the time, with modern appliances and spacious family rooms. It is furnished with Scandinavian style furniture including a number of pieces by Lundby, Brio and Hanse of Denmark. Lundby started producing dolls\u2019 houses and furniture in 1947 and continue to do so today. The houses and furniture they produced are notable because they reflect the period in which they were made. It was always Lundby\u2019s ambition to keep up with the times, producing houses with electric lighting, and following trends with interior decoration and design.",
