These include the Clown and Harlequin, as well as Mother Goose herself. Places in London also feature, including St Dunstan's Church and Vauxhall Gardens. The game was published at the height of Grimaldi the Clown's career, and he appears in playing space number 21. Since much of the playing surface is taken up with the rules, the number of spaces is reduced to 33. Of these, 17 are illustrated, each with its own story and reward or forfeit. Half the remaining spaces show a golden egg, which, if landed on, has a reward of one counter. The other half, which are blank, carry a forfeit of one counter.",

This game is played with a Teetotum marked on 6 sides, and any number of persons may play.\n2.  Each player must be provided with two dozen counters, (which, before playing they may value as they please), and a coloured one for a mark.  At the beginning of the game each player must put 6 into the pool.\n3.  Spin for first player and whoever spins the highest number must begin the game.\n4.  Whatever number you spin, place your mark on the number; and if it be a print, refer to the explanation.  When it is your turn to spin again, add the two numbers together and move on accordingly.  (For example if the first spin is 6 move to No. 6 and if the second spin is 3, add this to the 6 and move to No. 9).\n5.  Whoever spins a Golden Egg takes a counter from the pool; but if you spin a blank, put one in.\n6.   If two players arrive at the same number, he that was there first is to move back to the place the last player left, from whom he is to receive 2 for resigning his place.\n7.  Whoever arrives at the exact number (33) first, wins the game; but if by spinning, he goes beyond that number, he must move twice as many back as he exceeds it.\n\nReferences to the Game:\n1.  Mother Goose mounted on a gander - Pay 4 to secure her favour.\n3.  Mother Goose's Retreat.\n5.  Colin receiving the goose from Mother Goose, who tells him to give the Egg to Avaro, Colinette's father.  Take Up 2.\n7.  Colin shows the golden egg to Avaro who wants him to kill the goose, that h may give him all the eggs at once, before he marries Colinette.\n9.  Colin, having, ungratefully consented to kill the goose, presented him by his best friend, is changed by Mother Goose to Harlequin, and Colinette to Columbine.  Pay 3 for Ingratitude.\n11.  The mock dance between the Clown and Harlequin, dressed as a Barrow woman.  Stay 1 turn to see this.\n13.  The Clown and Pantaloon (formerly Avaro) coming to an Inn, they sit down to supper with the Landlord, when Harlequin enters and causes the chairs and tables to ascend with them, while he and Columbine sit down quietly to their supper, laughing at the situation of the others.  Before they can get down you may move on to No. 18.\n15.  the Clown and Pantaloon entering in pursuit of Harlequin and Columbine, the former is caught in a steel trap while a spring gun goes off and frightens Pantaloon, who leads off the Clown by the leg.  Pay 2 to have your wound cured.\n17.  Harlequin and Columbine, to elude pursuit, place themselves as the two well known figures at St. Dunstan's Church, striking the bell.  Take up 4 for this ingenious thought.\n19.  Vauxhall Gardens, where the Clown gains admission by appearing as a Pandean Minstrel, playing on a fish kettle with a ladle and whisk, with his chin resting on a hair broom.  Stay two turns to see the amusements of the place and laugh at this curious figure.\n21.  The clown steals a letter from the Post Office, containing a bank note, which he pockets; then another in which he finds a small cord and the words 'Sir, I'll trouble you for a line'.  For this knavish trick pay 3.\n23.  The Clown, attempting to drink out of a bottle, finds himself disappointed by the bottom always presenting itself to his lips.  You must be disappointed by going back to No. 14.\n25.  Harlequin pours wine from his sword into the mouth of the Odd Fish.  For this act of humanity take up 6.\n27.  Odd fish, in gratitude to Harlequin, dives into the sea after the golden egg, which he presents to his benefactor.\n29.  Harlequin restores the golden egg to Mother Goose, who is at length pacified.  Having made some amends for your fault, take up two.\n31.  Harlequin and Columbine united by Mother Goose in a submarine palace, the dwelling of Odd Fish.  This being a most beautiful scene, you may stay one turn to admire it.\n33.  An exact representation of Mother Goose mounted on her favourite gander.  By her permission you are allowed to take all the fish remain in the pool and are declared the winner of this game.\nNB  If the players are inclined for another game, the winner of the first to begin it now.\n\n\nRules placement: on the playing sheet",
