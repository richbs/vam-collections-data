Resist-dyeing involves treating certain areas of the cloth with a \u2018resist\u2019 to prevent them absorbing the dye; In this example starch has been used.  The pattern has been hand painted onto the cloth using chicken feathers, the mid rib of a palm leaf and a matchstick for different thicknesses of line.  They were made by women and worn as wraparound skirts\n\nThis pattern is known as Ibadandun which means \u2018Ibadan is good\u2019 in Yoruba.  This cloth was made in the town of Ibadan in south-western Nigeria which specialised in producing hand painted adire cloths.  The pattern is made up of squares which contain a variety of designs. In one square five pillars can be seen alternating with spoons,  the pillars are a reference to Mapo Hall, the town hall of Ibadan and it is from this square the cloth takes its name.\n\nThe underside of this cloth has been signed with a scorpion symbol but it has not yet been possible to trace the name of the maker.  There is a second cloth in the collection painted by the same woman.",
