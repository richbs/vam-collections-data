It was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by his goddaughter in 1936. Speedy was an army officer and colonial official. In 1860 he travelled to Ethiopia to assist the emperor Tewodros II (Theodore) with military training. Speedy returned in 1868, this time as civilian interpreter to a British military expedition aimed at releasing British subjects held hostage by Tewodros. The expedition ended with the capture of the emperor\u2019s fortress at Magdala, but not before Tewodros had committed suicide. The following death of his wife, Queen Woyzaro Terunesh, left an orphan son, Prince Dejatch Alamayou, whom the Amharic-speaking Captain became guardian to. \n\nIt is unclear how Speedy acquired the hair pin, which would have been worn by an Ethiopian woman. A report of the expedition produced by the Illustrated London News noted that \u2018ornamental hairpins are [amongst] the fashionable decorations of the female sex\u2019 (1868).",
