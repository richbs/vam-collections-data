The blue curtains are deliberately left open revealing the tall windows.  \n\nDesigner Alexandre Benois had a long involvement with productions of The Queen of Spades which he admired when he first saw its original production in 1890. He had assisted with the decor for the 1903 production at the Maryinsky Theatre, St Petersburg, and was co-producer, with Emile Cooper, as well as designer of sets and costumes for the production at the State Theatre for Opera and Ballet, Petrograd, on 3 May 1921. The opera, in three acts and seven scenes by Peter Tchaikovsky, had a libretto by Modest Tchaikovsky based on the story by Pushkin and the 1921 production appears to have been adapted by Benois. The choreography in the 1921 production was by Leonid Leontiev.",
