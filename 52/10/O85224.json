ISBN 1851773088.\nDuring the early decades of the twentieth century the Museum continued to instruct its visitors to distinguish between what was considered good design and bad design, even though Henry Cole's systematic attempt in 1852 to single out bad design by exhibiting \"Examples of False Principles in Decoration\" was short-lived (see cats.19-20) . This framed display, with its original label written by V&A curator and watercolour specialist, Martin Hardie, dates from around 1923. The text favours the revised lower design over the one at the top, but viewers in the 1990s may have difficulty distinguishing between the merits of the two designs.\n\nELIZABETH A. MILLER",
