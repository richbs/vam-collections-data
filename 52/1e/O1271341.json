There is a matching yellow checked scarf around the neck stitched at the back. The  material varies - the head and hands are plush, the top and feet are flocked  and the trousers and scarf are smooth. The scarf has tasselled woollen ends. The feet are marked in black to indicate shoes.\nThe eyes are black plastic and the nose and mouth embroidered in black  thread. There is a label sewn into the seam between the top and the trousers  on the back left-hand side to which are attached two card labels.",
