The figures were bought in 1937 and are mostly made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960).\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nThe baby is small enough to be held and thrown by Punch and Judy, and Punch's careless treatment of the baby is traditionally the starting point of the show. In Professor Bavister's version, Judy asks Punch to look after the baby while she is cooking sausages for their supper. Punch throws him out of the window when he won't stop crying, with the traditional Mr. Punch remark: 'That's the way to do it, boys and girls...'",
