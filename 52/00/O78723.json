A difficult technique, with little room for error, it gives the feeling of spontaneity, although the brushwork is tightly controlled. Watercolours of exotic subjects such as this had been popular in Britain since the 18th century, but the Victorian period was the time of greatest demand. By the end of the 19th century, however, the rise of cheap photography and coloured photo-mechanical illustrations had reduced their popularity.\n\nPeople\nCollins was a painter of landscapes, costume, military and architectural subjects who exhibited widely in London. He also illustrated books, including his own published works on the cathedrals of Spain and Italy.",
