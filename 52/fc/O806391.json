Pen and ink and wash. 6 X 9 (152 X 229) 8639 E PROVENANCE Given by Miss Georgiana Lornlin 1880 About a third of the sheet has been cut away leaving an irregular outline on the right side, where the legs of a horse can be seen, presumably the horse of the commander of the troops. Previously catalogued as anonymous, the drawing was attributed to Baglione on grounds of style by Pouncey and Bean, independently.",
