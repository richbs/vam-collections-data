It is not typical of Egyptian traditional jewellery today.  The design is most common in Arabia, where objects like this are worn on the upper arm, but an example from the 11th century was found in an excavation at Jerusalem, and more modern examples, from the 19th century, have been recorded in Syria.  \n\nAlthough Islamic traditional jewellery is very conservative in design and aspects of its form and function can be traced back for centuries, individual pieces rarely survive for more than a few generations.  As most pieces in the V&amp;A collection were acquired in the 19th century they often represent rare examples of objects which have gone out of use and may now have been totally forgotten in their home countries.",
