            "public_access_description": "This fork is part of a set comprising also a spoon and knife. The trefid (three sectioned) end of the fork and spoon handle became fashionable in the 1660s, evolving from earlier \u2018Puritan\u2019 spoons and French forms. The octagonal knife handle is typical of the mid-late seventeenth century, and the square-ended blade was developed in the 1650s perhaps in response to the introduction of forks for food-spearing instead of knives.\n\nAlthough four registered London silversmiths have the initials TT, the crowned TT mark has not survived in the records at Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall. The mark has been ascribed to Thomas Tysoe, but he was apprenticed in 1674 and would not have registered a mark until the 1680s.\n\nThe rich and finely engraved decoration was inspired by continental prints. The small roundels are engraved with classical scenes; that on the fork may depict Perseus and Andromeda. Scrollwork with stylised foliage and putti intermingle with homely vignettes of fashionable ladies, buglers and soldiers.\n\nThe coat of arms on this fork, also found on the spoon, are those of Sir Robert Button of Tockenham Court, Lyneham, Wiltshire and his wife Eleanor, daughter of William Compton of Hartbury, Gloucester. It has been suggested that the cutlery was made during Button\u2019s term of office as High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1670.",
