Hansel has a painted pink head, arms and upper legs, pink plastic hands, yellow nylon wig, green painted lower legs and black painted feet. The puppet has metal jointing at the neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, waist, hips, knees and ankles. He is dressed in a blue and white shirt, pale green trousers, red felt braces.\n\nThe control consists of two wooden bars pinned together at the centre so that they can be opened to form a cross. The heads are controlled by two strings, one to each side; the hands by two red strings one to each hand, the legs by two blue strings one to each knee. There is also a single yellow string to the centre back. There are appropriately coloured washers over the string hooks on the control. These prevent the strings coming off but also allow their removal in case they got tangled. \n\nThe puppet is housed in a yellow and white cardboard box which has instructions for removing and replacing the puppet and for making it walk The outer window sleeve is also of yellow card and decorated with drawings of various characters.",
