To create a daguerreotype, a silver plated sheet was given a light sensitive surface coating of iodine vapour. After a long exposure in the camera, the image was developed over heated mercury and fixed in a common salt solution. The image lies on a mirror-like surface and is best seen from an angle to minimise reflections. \n\nThis family portrait shows Gustav and Julia Hiller and their daughter Luise. \n\nThe surface of daguerreotypes is delicate and easily damaged, so professionally-finished images were presented in a protective case or frame. This portrait is held in an elaborate painted and lacquered black case with a tortoise-shell inlay. The outside of the case has a floral design and gold-leaf edging.", 
            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "Coe, Brian &amp; Haworth-Booth, Mark. <u> A Guide to Early Photographic Printing</u><u> Processes</u>. London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n<i>\nAnonymous American photographer\nGustav Adolph Hiller, his wife Julia and their daughter Luise   1851-52\nDaguerreotype in papier-mach\u00e9 case painted and inlaid with mother of pearl\nImage size 122 X 88 mm (reproduced same size)   Mus. no. 263-1975   Purchase</i>\n\nThe Daguerreotype process required skilful manipulation in the sensitising and developing operations, but the key to success lay in the polishing of the plate.  The better the polish, the finer was the quality.  Hand polishing using leather buffs and jeweller's rouge was the method generally employed in England, and considerable effort and care were needed to get a first class finish.  As might be expected, many American photographers mechanised the process, polishing their plates on steam-power-driven buffing machines.  The mirror-like surface required could be produced in a short time and this is the main reason for the high average quality of American Daguerreotypes.  American Daguerreotypists took three out of the five prizes awarded for the process in the photographic section which was part of the Great Exhibition of 1851.  Daguerreotypes polished with rotary buffs do not normally show the fine parallel lines produced by hand polishing in which the plate was slid backwards and forwards on the polishing buff.  \nThis family portrait is labelled on the back in German by one of the children of the child in the picture.  The label also dates the Daguerreotype and mentions where it was taken- Cincinnati.  The case is painted with flowers, decorated with tortoise-shell, and got up as a book- with the word Friendship on the 'spine'. \nA historian of Cincinnati, Charles Cist, wrote in 1851 that the city had 37 Daguerreotypists plus 78 assistants.  He noted with pride: 'Our Daguerrian artists stand high everywhere...their works are recognised at a glance in Florence, by Frenchmen and others, as American productions, and superior to anything produced on the continent of Europe'.  One Cincinnati establishment was described at length in 1854.  Its opulent setting was surmounted by a painted ceiling with a centre piece representing the aerial regions, in which Venus, the goddess of Beauty, is sitting recumbent on a splendid throne....The very seat on which you sit and the carpet on which you tread seem to be a gem culled from the fragrant lap of Flora' (<i>Gleason's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion</i> 1 April 1854).  Such were the surroundings in which families - proudly, nervously or unselfconsciously - returned the camera's stare.  The resulting picture might cause misgivings on the part of one of more of the sitters but the silvered plate itself was usually regarded with wonderment:\n<sup>'Here's a present I got for you in New York.'  It was a Daguerreotype, clear and soft as an engraving, representing Eva and her father sitting hand in hand. (<i>Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>1852).</sup>",
