The main hall with plain walls and to each side at an upper level two windows with pointed arches, the bay with false arcading at its lower level and statues of kings in niches above and, above the door, carved shields and a stained glass window of three lights, the larger, central, light containing a figure. The floor of the main hall of white tiles with black diamond shaped tiles set at each corner, the bay of alterate black and white tiles. In the main body of the hall stand two male figures in Tudor dress, the nearer, left hand, figure carrying a sword of state over his left shoulder, the right hand figure leaning on a short staff held in his right hand, with, in the doorway, a third male figure holding a halberd. The design is drawn to a strict perspective with faint pencil lines converging on a focal point behind the head of the figure in the doorway. \nThe design is laid down on a sheet of thick cartridge paper and 'framed' with a wash border. On the reverse is an inscription in a late 18th century or early 19th century hand, the writer having gone over a faint pencil inscription which is still partly visible beneath. The ink tracing appears literal and accurate except for the substitution of the word 'take' for the pencilled word 'of'.",

The theatre's manager, John Philip Kemble, appointed a number of scene painters to remedy this lack in 1794-95 and subsequent seasons, among them Thomas Malton for whom 'correctness of architectural detail was a speciality' and William Capon 'who shared Kemble's passion for the medieval and Gothic and who was  ready to take infinite pains to reproduce actual buildings on stage' (Sybil Rosenfeld, Georgian Scene Painters and Scene Painting (C.U.P., 1981), pp.36-37). Either of these artists could have been responsible for this design.  The costumes and accessories worn by the figures appear to be early Tudor, so it is possible that the design may have been meant for the production of Shakespeare's Henry VIII staged at Drury Lane in 1794.\n\nHistorical significance: This representation of a detailed Gothic setting is typical of the new scenography of Drury Lane in the 1790s, which itself reflected a growing interest in lavish settings for historical plays and melodramas.",
