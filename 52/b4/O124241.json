It was an imperial spectacle in which the manufactures and raw materials of more than thirty British colonies and dependencies were displayed to demonstrate the commercial and artistic wealth of Britain\u2019s colonial possessions and to re-invigorate British design. Key to the success of the Exhibition was Joseph Paxton\u2019s revolutionary glass building; the Crystal Palace. \n\nThe building and displays drew over six million visitors to the Exhibition and generated a booming trade in souvenirs and commemorative items. This transfer-printed plate was produced as an affordable souvenir. It pictures the iconic Crystal Palace in the background and, in the foreground, a group of four figures representing the Four Continents. Each figure can be identified through their dress and associated objects. \u2018Africa\u2019, for example, is represented by a black figure holding an ivory horn and \u2018America\u2019 by a figure in a feather headdress. The convention has its origins in the Counter-Reformation when it was used to symbolise the worldwide spread of Catholic Christendom. In the context of the Exhibition it perhaps reflects the \u2018world\u2019 of goods available to the British consumer.",
