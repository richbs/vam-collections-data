Faure Walker works consistently across these mediums, moving between them to explore their relationship with one another. At times his work deliberately call attention to its construction, appearing collage-like with richly detailed overlapping layers.  Despite their computer-generated production, many of Faure Walker's prints return our attention to more traditional notions of gesture, surface and mark making.\n\nThis composite inkjet print is made up of three narrow printed strips joined together because the artist's inkjet printer at the time, a Xerox 3020, could not print images any larger than 15cm x 20cm.  Faure Walker has commented that this encouraged \"a new way of thinking about a composition, an image that you could not see as a whole till printed and assembled.\"",
