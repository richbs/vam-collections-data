            "public_access_description": "Andrew Robertson (1777-1845) was born in Aberdeen.  In 1792, due to his father\u2019s illness, he had to abandon training for the medical profession, and moved to Edinburgh to earn his living.  He  worked as a theatrical scene-painter and a portrait miniaturist, but being ambitious he left for London in 1801 and joined the Royal Academy Schools.  Here the focus of his studies was anatomy and the life drawing classes.  His letters home record the struggles which led him to develop a new style of miniature painting, which eventually set the standard for the next generation of miniaturists.  \n\nRobertson believed that the small oval miniatures of the previous generation of painters were \u201cbut toys\u201d.  He resolved to develop a \u201cgreat style\u201d of miniature painting which emulated oil painting in its strength of colour and which did not just focus on the head of a sitter, but used his skills as a draughtsman of the human figure.  Unfortunately this \"great style\" was a labour intensive and so expensive method and, as can be seen from this miniature, Robertson had to continue to paint \"ovals\" to survive.  \n\nThe dating of this miniature has presented problems, as it is inscribed on the front \"1830\", but on the back is an inscription, almost certainly by Robertson, which gives his address, and in another hand, the date \"1812\".  The address, 33 Gerrard Street, is correct for 1812, but from 1817 he lived at number 34.  Additionally, the costume and hair-style of the sitter are more appropriate for 1812 than for 1830.  As the date of \"1812\" is by a different hand to that giving the address, it has been decided to date the miniature to the dates Robertson lived at 33 Gerrard Street; 1806-1817.",
