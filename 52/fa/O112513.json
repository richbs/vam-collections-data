To achieve the desired effect, she calculated that it would be necessary to take the photograph on the shortest day of the year when the sky was sufficiently dark, but when New York city workers would still be in their offices with lights burning. The architecture is defined by the patterns of lighted windows representing the thousands of individuals creating the energy of the city.",
