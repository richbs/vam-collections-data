This watercolour dates from Golden's time  at the RCA, where she trained in illustration.\n\nGolden spent most of her career capturing life on  and around the Thames. Her meticulous eye for  detail and human interest creates work rich in  documentary flourishes. In 'Fourstones  Tournament', the cropped legs of adults and the  closeness of the paving slabs propel us into the  children's intense world.  Meanwhile, on 'The  Bridge', boys clamber upon this climbing frame  and viewing platform suspended high above the  city.\n\nGolden's work is represented in many national  collections including the Museum of London,  Imperial War Museum and the Tate.\n\nThe children in Golden's paintings are working  class Londoners, and her snapshot-like paintings  offer a colourful record of the appearance and  activities of this group of children between the  Wars.",
