This instrument was probably played until the 19th centuryas it is fitted with iron levers, dating from about 1800,  which raise the bass strings a semi-tone. The body of this example was made in 1619 by Matteo Buechenberg (d. 1628), a luthier of German origins who settled in Rome and is best known for his chitarroni.",
