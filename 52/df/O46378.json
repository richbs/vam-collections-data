Peacocks symbolized the sun, and were the national emblem of the Konbaung Kings (1752-1885). The use of their imagery was restricted to the royal family and the artists of the palace workshops. However, after the annexation of  Burma by the British in 1885 and the exile of the royal family, designs and materials which had been reserved for royalty became accessible to everyone.\n\nThe extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the mid 19th century. This example,  of black wool with an appliqu\u00e9d coloured cloths, silver and gilt sequins and threads, was intended as a table cover for the European market.",
