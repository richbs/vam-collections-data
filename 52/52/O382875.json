Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nA well-dressed woman from Sk\u00e5ne wore multiple pairs of silver clasps along the front edges of her outer clothes.  Some of these were functional, and hooked into each other.  Others were purely ornamental.  \n\nHeart-shaped clasps like these were originally worn as cloak clasps, but by the 19th century they had moved to the outer jacket, and were often purely decorative.  This clasp is marked with the maker's mark E H, and is probably the work of Erik Holmberg, who worked in Lund from 1774-1837.  This clasp was described as 18th century when it was acquired in 1886, and the filigree rings are certainly of an old design, also found on buttons.",
