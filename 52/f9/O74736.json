The main pattern is that of six pierced pentagonal facets that come down from the finial and imbricate with pentagonal facets that rise up from the drum of the dome.\nA plain hinge attaches the cover to the well.\nOn the underside there is roundel depicting a bird in profile framed by a circular band of incurving rays enclosed by two plain fillets.",
