Orr's drawing is a copy - of sorts - of 'The Miraculous Draught of Fishes', one of the Raphael cartoons (which are themselves working drawings on a grand scale) - but he embellishes and animates his drawing with characteristically playful features such as the various fishes and sea-creatures which populate the foreground. \n\nThe drawing works on several levels: it is not only a demonstration of an artist in dialogue with the art of the past, it also has strong links with the characteristic English tradition of caricature, and social and political satire - in the blackened and smoking buildings in the background Orr makes subtle allusions to the political climate at the time, in the light of the impending war (with Iraq) and the on-going war in Israel and the Occupied Territories, giving us a subtle subversion of our conventional view of the 'Holy Land'. It is also a splendid manifestation of drawing as an end in itself, rather than as something which stands in a preliminary or subordinate role to a work in another medium.\n\nThe artist has given a fascinating account of the circumstances and experience of making this drawing: \"Thinking I only had 20 mins (luckily I had about 45 minutes in fact) to do my piece of the roll I decided to make it a sort of performance piece and practised until I knew the composition like a musical score and could rapidly re-make it.\"",

Orr's drawing is a copy - of sorts - of 'The Miraculous Draught of Fishes', one of the Raphael cartoons (which are themselves working drawings on a grand scale) - but he embellishes and animates his drawing with characteristically playful features such as the various fishes and sea-creatures which populate the foreground. \n\nWe also have an email from the artist (see Acq RF) which gives a fascinating account of the circumstances and experience of making this drawing: \"Thinking I only had 20 mins (luckily I had about 45 minutes in fact) to do my piece of the roll I decided to make it a sort of performance piece and practised until I knew the composition like a musical score and could rapidly re-make it.\" Along with other drawings made as part of the Big Draw, this was originally intended for the Paintings in Hospitals scheme, but because of the allusion to war it was considered to be inappropriate for that scheme, and instead the artist offered it to the V&A as a gift.",
