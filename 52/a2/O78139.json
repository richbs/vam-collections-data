With the completion of  Aston Webb building in 1908 the museum was at last established in permanent buildings and the core collections recognisable today.  The art and science collections were finally separated with the new Aston Webb building, designed by Sir Aston Webb (1849-1930), providing  opportunities for re-arrangement and re-display.\n\nHistorical Association\nTo coincide with the laying of the foundation stone of the new buildings it was decided to change the museum's name from 'The South Kensington Museum'. Initially Queen Victoria wanted the museum to be called 'The Albert Museum' but was prevailed upon to add her own name. The ceremony had all the pomp and circumstance of a state occasion, with the Queen travelling from  Buckingham Palace in an open landau carriage, escorted by the Life Guards, and entering a specially constructed pavilion with seating for the royal family and other dignitaries.  The programme lists the events of the day in detail. In her reply to the opening speech Queen Victoria emphasised the royal couple's interest in the museum since its inception: the original concept of the whole South Kensington complex had been originally conceived by Prince Albert himself.",
