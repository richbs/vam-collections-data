The design is signed and dated Comelli, 1905.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert and Sullivan productions.\n\nThe Prodigal Son was written by Hall Caine and featured incidental music composed and arranged by J.M. Glover. The action in the original text was set mainly in Iceland but a 1906 revival changed the setting to Sicily which created the opportunity for a dramatic eruption of Mount Etna in the final act.\n\nThis design comes from a collection of costume designs, some of which are costumier's copies, which were originally part of the Archives of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.",
