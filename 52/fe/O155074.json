An interest in technology led him to start creating kinetic sculptures, and, eventually, he moved to the University of New Mexico where he further developed his interest in the connections between art and science and began making programmed computer drawings.  The University of New Mexico owned an IBM mainframe 1401 computer, and Mattox encouraged other members of the University\u2019s art department to learn how to create computer programmes for drawing.  \n\nThis work is a screenprint, made after a plotter drawing. The original drawing would have been produced by writing the programme, which would have been very time consuming, and then transferring it to an IBM punchcard machine.  The punchcards would then have controlled the computer's output and driven a mechanical arm and pen across the drawing surface.",
