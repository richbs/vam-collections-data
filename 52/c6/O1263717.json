The name Karagoz means \u2018black-eye\u2019 and his eye was always designed with a black pupil. He had a thick, curly beard but was completely bald.  He tries to hide this under an enormous turban but the running joke is that his turban is repeatedly knocked off. \n\nLike Mr. Punch, Karagoz was an extrovert but simple and violent and given to amorous and sometimes obscene adventures, with a native wit that always let him come out of situations on top.  Hacivat acts as his foil; he is always wiser and more cultivated than Karagoz, and is usually represented with a neat beard and a tall pointed hat. The female characters included Karagoz and Hacivat\u2019s wives, young women, servants and dancers, and characters such as Karagoz\u2019 and Hacivat\u2019s neighbours and officials including Kawassan, the rich Jew and Bekri Mustapha, the peasant who comes to town and gets drunk. The plays were farcical, and were traditionally improvised by each puppeteer around the basic plots and characters. The texts of the various puppeteers were not recorded until the 20th century.",
