Bound by William Wood. English, c.1810-20.\n<i>Pen and ink and wash, with some pencil.</i>     E.70-124-1964 \n\n<i>Note:</i> The goldsmiths who made these pieces of plate for the firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, such as Paul Storr and Philip Rundell, worked from drawings commissioned from a number of artists, but in most cases direct evidence on who originated the design is lacking. For the reasons given below there is evidence that the following designs may be firmly associated with these specific artists: \n \nThomas Stothard     E.110,111-1964\nJohn Flaxman     E.l19-1964 \n\nOn grounds of style E.109-1964 may also be attributed to Stothard.\nOther designers who worked for the firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell\nat the time and whose drawings may be included in the volume are\nWilliam Theed I and Edward Hodges Baily, R.A. \n\nAmong the items of interest are:  \n\nDesign for a dessert stand with the same motif, a bacchante, a faun and a boy with pipes, as a silver-gilt dessert stand, one of four in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, made by Paul Storr in 1813\u201414 for George IV when Prince Regent. The base, stem and dishes differ from the original design. (G.l54, Pl.L) The same motif was also used in a pair of six-light, silver-gilt candelabra made by Paul Storr for the Earl of Harewood. They were exhibit No.54 in the Regency Exhibition, held at the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, 1951.      E.83-1964\"",
