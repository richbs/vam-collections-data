ISBN: 1854375830.\nExhibition catalogue.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 69, 74, 75, 77\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"As numbered here the view on the <i>recto</i> is taken nearer the house, and shows a black-and-white dog running along the footpath by the side of the stream; No. 110a is taken from slightly further away, and the footpath curves off the picture at the left.  The cottage is seen from a slightly different angle in the latter, and a horse grazing in the foreground is seen from behind.\n\nNo. 329a [787-1888] is regarded in this Catalogue as a later replica of No. 110a [166-1888] with suggestions from No. 110 [166-1888].  Lucas\u2019s mezzotint (S. 33) of Willy Lott\u2019s house and its relation to Nos. 110 [166-1888], 110a [166-1888] and 329a [787-1888] are discussed in the note on the latter.  The relationship of these two sketches to other paintings by Constable of the same subject, and the extent to which this makes it possible to form an estimate of their date, is discussed in the notes made by Davies, pp. 23-6 on \u2018The Hay-Wain\u2019 (N.G. 1207).  He gives reasons for believing that the \u2018Mill Stream\u2019 ion the Ipswich Museum was being painted in 1814.  It may be the work exhibited as \u2018Landscape: the Ferry\u2019 at the Royal Academy that year.  The version of the same composition at the Tate Gallery (No. 1816) (reproduced in L. ed. S., Pl. 43), which indeed appears to be a ketch for the Ipswich picture which was at that time Constable\u2019s most careful treatment of the theme of Willy Lott\u2019s house.  This would suggest a date of <i>c.</i>1811-14 for Nos. 110 [166-1888] and 110a [166-1888], if Holmes\u2019s estimate for the Tate Gallery\u2019s picture No. 1816 is accepted.  This result is in accordance with the agreement in style between the two sketches and No. 109 [134-1888] above, here dated <i>c.</i>1810-15.  A small sketch of Willy Lott\u2019s house also at Ipswich Museum, which is comparable in style with Nos. 110 [166-1888] and 110a [166-1888], is, however, dated on the back 23 July 1816; it was No. 28 in the exhibition of the works of Constable at Manchester City Art Gallery, 1956.  Davies (<i>loc. cit.</i>) suggests that Constable may have used Nos. 110 [166-1888] and 110a [166-1888] for \u2018The Hay-Wain\u2019 though the sketches may well have been made \u201clong before\u201d.  He points out that the feature of a browsing horse in No. 110a [166-1888] was used, with a boy on it, for the finished picture, but was used in the full-scale sketch for \u2018The Hay-Wain\u2019 (No. 209 [987-1900] below).  These considerations alone would show that the dating of <i>c.</i>1824 given by Holmes, p. 247, for No. 110 [166-1888] is too late, since \u2018The Hay-Wain\u2019 is of 1821.\n\nNote on Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888]\n\nNos. 109-113 form a miscellaneous and somewhat unhomogeneous group.  Most of them have either been assigned to a date near 1811 or may be compared with another oil sketch assigned to that date.  Accordingly, though their general character hardly warrants a dating more exact than <i>c.</i>1810-15 or within even wider limits, they are grouped together here.  Their relationship to Nos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888], the earliest oil sketches in the Museum to show the full effect of the revolution in Constable's style, helps to justify this grouping.\"",

His attachment to Maria Bicknell became known during this year, and he received her father's permission to write to her in October.'\n\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 69]",
