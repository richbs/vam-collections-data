McKay, 1912\n\n<b>C.F.A. Voysey (1857-1941)</b>\nPencil and watercolour\nV&A: E.285-1913\n\nThis constructional design drawing is typical of Voysey's architecturally trained draughtsmanship. First he would put the commissioner's name and address at the top of the large sheet of paper in a big stylised typeface. He then filled the paper with a range of precisely executed elevations, plans and details in different scales, all clearly drawn and labelled and finished off with his signature and date at the bottom. One of the main Arts and Crafts proponents working in this style at the beginning of the 20th century, Voysey like to keep the decoration on his works to a minimum. This piece of furniture has bronze hinges and fittings as the only addition to the oak and sycamore wood construction, very like the funiture in the 'St Ives' suite shown in plate 71, which was strongly influenced by his work. This washstand is a rather clever design - when not in use it looked like a closed cupboard, but opened up (including the top which contained a mirro) to reveal the bowl and jug, with a towel rail on the side. Most of Voysey's designs were for individual pieces rather than complete architectural furnishing schemes, and this washstand is very typical in that it is a small commission for a particular piece of furniture for domestic use. In 1902 Voysey made some furniture designs for a Mrs van Gruisen, who lived a few streets away from Miss McKay in Oxton, Cheshire. It is likely that they knew each other, and that Miss McKay liked what she had seen in her friend's house and ordered the washstand for her own home.\"",
