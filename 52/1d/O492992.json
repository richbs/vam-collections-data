Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of an oni (demon) stealing a pagoda. \n\nIn Japanese folklore oni are devious creatures with an ugly appearance capable of causing mischief and misfortune. This finely carved netsuke exaggerates the oni's grotesque appearance through its detailed features, such as its jowls, bulging eyes, sharp teeth and two protruding horns. By stealing the pagoda the demon exemplifies its roguish nature and disregard of religious property.     \nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masakazu.",
