The left-hand dancer stands on her left leg, the right pointed to the front; her right arm is outstretched and her left curved across the upper body; she leans backwards from the waist, kissing the right-hand dancer, whose pose is the mirror image - standing on her left leg with the right pointed to back, leaning forwards with her left arm across the body and right outstretched.",

Britain became more consciousness of Spain and Spanish customs following the war against Napoleon in the Iberian peninsular between 1807 and 1812 and Spanish dances were often incorporated into ballets in the 1830s and 1840s.  \nEven without the title, the dancers can be identified as Spanish by the characteristic hairstyles, the hair pulled back into a knot covered with frills, and, of course, by the castanets.  Once native Spanish dancers began to perform throughout Europe in the 1840s, it appears that they adopted the bell-shaped full skirt with flounces and fringes, worn by ballerinas in Spanish-style solos.",
