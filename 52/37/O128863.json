He kneels and faces to the right of the plaque.  He wears a blue robe and violet dalmatic (long-sleeved ecclesiastical tunic) with jewelled neck and hem conveyed by the use of paillons. At the top of the panel in gold are the words 'AVE MARIA GRACIAS' (the S reversed), and at the bottom of the panel in gold are the (somewhat garbled) words 'MISUS EST GRABIEL AMARIO DI...'.  Gabriel bears a wand or sceptre around which is wrapped a scroll.  Where the lettering on the scroll is visible, it reads 'AVE GRA... MES...'\nThe faces, the rendering of flesh tones, and paillons, some surrounded by a ring of white dots, are all characteristic of this artist.  The architectural setting with pilasters and Corinthian capitals behind the archangel includes a panel of green stonework, very unusual in the Limoges enamel repertoire.  This type of wainscotting is, however, seen in manuscript illumination - for instance the paintings of Jean Fouquet after his return from Italy at the end of the 1450s, including the Hours of Etienne Chevalier, and in the work of Jean Bourdichon.

She wears a blue mantle lined with green and with gold highlights, and a violet robe.  There are paillons on her halo, around her neck, at her wrists and on the lower border of the plaque.

            "public_access_description": "This pair of panels depict the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary. The Archangel Gabriel, on the left panel, announces that the Holy Spirit (depicted as a dove) hasvcome upon the Virgin Mary, on the right panel. The Virgin Mary will give birth to a son, to be named Jesus. who will be the Son of God (Luke ch. 1 v.26-38).  At the top of the panel in gold are the words 'O MATER DEI MEMENTO', a prayer of the panel's owner to the Virgin Mary.  Small diptychs and triptychs were used for devotional purposes, usually in a private chapel or oratory.  \nThese panels are by the anonymous Master of the Louis XII Triptych, a triptych also in the collections of the V&A.  They are comparable in date, and depict the Virgin and Gabriel in very similar poses as on the central Annunciation scene of the Louis XII Triptych. A number of other works attributed to this artist are found in other public collections.  He was active from the late 15th century to about 1515 and clearly highly regarded by the French court as he was also commissioned to paint Pierre II Duke of Bourbon (1439-1503) and his wife, Anne of France (ca.1460-1522), eldest daughter of Louis XI, on two wings of a triptych formerly in the collection of Baron Edouard de Rothschild in Paris. The style of the Master of the Louis XII Triptych (as in the type of wainscotting, for instance in the background in these panels) reflects the paintings of the Loire School - at first the style of the Master of Moulins and influence of Jean Fouquet, and then after ca.1508, the style of Jean Bourdichon.  The earliest painted enamels of the sixteenth century bear much similarity to images in contemporary illuminated manuscripts. The subject matter is similar and they employ the same stylistic techniques as illuminations, such as the use of gold highlights, especially for the clothes and drops of enamel to suggest jewels.  It is thought that some artists were able to work in both art forms.  \nLimoges, central France, was famous for the production of champleve enamels from the late 12th century until the town was destroyed by the Black Prince in 1371.  The enamel industry began to revive about a century later but the technique of painted enamels produced from 1460s/70s was quite different from the earlier medieval work.  The copper, probably from Spanish mines, was first of all hammered to thin sheets which were then worked on by the skillful enamellers.  It was a long and careful process, with several firings to achieve the finished result.",

Currie\n\nHistorical significance: These panels are by the anonymous Master of the Louis XII Triptych, also in the collections of the V&A.  They are comparable in date, and depict the Virgin and Gabriel in very similar poses as on the central Annunciation scene of the Louis XII Triptych. A number of other works attributed to this artist are found in other public collections.  He was active from the late 15th century to about 1515 and clearly highly regarded by the French court as he was also commissioned to paint Pierre II Duke of Bourbon (1439-1503) and his wife, Anne of France (ca.1460-1522), eldest daughter of Louis XI, on two wings of a triptych formerly in the collection of Baron Edouard de Rothschild in Paris.  At about the same time, the Master of Moulins painted the same couple on the back of the triptych which they had commissioned for the collegiate church of Moulins (now the Cathedral).  The style of the Master of the Louis XII Triptych reflects the paintings of the Loire School - at first the style of the Master of Moulins and influence of Jean Fouquet, and then after ca.1508, the style of Jean Bourdichon.  The earliest painted enamels of the sixteenth century bear much similarity to images in contemporary illuminated manuscripts. The subject matter is similar and they employ the same stylistic techniques as illuminations, such as the use of gold highlights, especially for the clothes and drops of enamel to suggest jewels.  It is thought that some artists were able to work in both art forms.",

            "historical_context_note": "Limoges, central France, was famous for the production of champleve enamels from the late 12th century until the town was destroyed by the Black Prince in 1371.  The enamel industry began to revive about a century later but the technique of painted enamels produced from 1460s/70s was quite different from the earlier medieval work.  The copper, probably from Spanish mines, was first of all hammered to thin sheets which were then worked on by the skillful enamellers.  It was a long and careful process, with several firings to achieve the finished result.\nThese are two panels from either a diptych or triptychs.  Small triptychs were used for devotional purposes, usually in a private chapel or oratory.  These figures of the Virgin Mary and Gabriel from an Annunciation scene have borders inscribed in gold with a prayer to Mary, the Mother of God, to remember the owner of the panels.",
