            "physical_description": "Circular roundel with scalloped edge, forming sixteen lobes, made in carved stucco. In the centre is a heraldic shield bearing the motto of the Nasrid dynasty, \"Wa la ghalib ila Allah\", or \"There is no conqueror but God\". From the bottom of the roundel, two scrolling motifs branch to either side of the shield. The scrolls contain three large flowers which each have five petals. The petals and leaf forms have a characteristic spiky appearanace.\n\nRoundels like this one form part of the frieze of stucco decoration which adorns the walls of the Court of the Myrtles in the Comares Palace, which was the main throne and reception area of the Alhambra Palace complex. The stucco frieze runs along above the dado of coloured tile mosaic in geometric patterns ('azulejos'). The stucco decoration consists of long cartouches containing poems about the beauty of the palace by the Nasrid courtier Ibn Zamrak (1333-1392). The inscribed cartouches alternate with lobed roundels containing shields and flowers which are very like the roundel in the V&A, though they contain eight flowers rather than six, of which six of the flowers have an elongated spiky petal.\n\nThis makes it more likely that the roundel in the V&A comes from the fa\u00e7ade of the entrance to the Comares Palace, in the court known as the Patio del Cuarto Dorado. The whole fa\u00e7ade is encrusted with carved stucco decoration and there is a wide frieze about halfway up the fa\u00e7ade below the windows of the upper storey which contains eleven such lobed roundels. Only three of them contain shields. The roundels are arranged in groups of two with the shield-roundels in between them. It has not been possible to find a clear enough photograph of the decoration of these roundels, so positively identifying the original location of the V&A roundel will have to await further research.\n\nBoth types of roundel are found within the decoration of the Comares Palace (also known by the names 'the Court of the Myrtles' and 'the Hall of the Ambassadors'). The original Comares Palace was built under the Nasrid Sultan Ismail I (1314-1325), but it was extensively remodelled under his grandson Muhammad V (1354-1359 and 1362-1391). This work included redecorating both the Court of the Myrtles and the entrance fa\u00e7ade in the Patio del Cuarto Dorado. It was completed in 1370, and this is when we can date the V&A roundel. It was probably removed from the Alhambra during restoration work in the 19th century, which is when it was acquired by Dr Hildburgh, who subsequently gave it to the V&A.",
