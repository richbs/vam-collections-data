The tight-fitting top is attached to the skirt with a series of complex fastenings.  The skirt itself is very full and heavy, with panels of integral silk velvet that create the appearance of a massive bow, which Dior described as the 'natural ornament' of a dress.\n\nThe dress is typical of Dior's collections of the time, which featured flying panels and protruding angles.",

In spreads that grew in ambition and number, photographs of particular dresses from named couture houses in textiles from named manufacturers appeared at the beginning of a magazine.  Often the text was simple, merely indicating the name of the couturier, and the name of the textile and its manufacturer.  For example, in Autumn/Winter 1949, in the same advertisement Dior and Balenciaga used self-coloured velvet and faille from the silk manufacturers Bianchini F\u00e9rier of Lyons for two evening dresses (pl.5.4).  A black evening dress, 'Cygne Noir' ('Black Swan'), in Dior's Autumn/Winter collection of 1949-50, is surely made from silk velvet and faille from these manufacturers and reveals the glorious crisp quality of the textiles (pl.5.5).  It contrasts with an elaborate Dior evening gown, in machine-embroidered velvet by the Swiss firm of Abraham et Cie., which appeared in British <i>Vogue</i> in 1958 (pl.5.16).\nDior Archives, Paris\nThe house photograph shows the dress modelled with full-length black satin evening gloves, necklace, brooch and earrings.  The caption reads:  \nCHRISTIAN DIOR.  Automn Hiver 1949-50.  Mode MILIEU DU SIECLE.\n<u>CYGNE NOIR</u>: Robe de soir en satin noir et velours noir.",
