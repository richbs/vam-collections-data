She kisses the brow of Labour, represented as a nude male figure, who bends before her, his right hand grasping a mallet. In the background a laurel spreads its branches so as to form an arbour. The back of the medal shows a laurel shrub and the exposition buildings in the background.\n\nThe medallist Castiglioni Giannino was trained at the company Stabilimento Stefano Johnson, which was a die-sinking and casting firm. Many of his medals were cast there.\n\nThis medal for the Milan International Exposition in 1906 is a very well-composed work and remains one of his strongest. He was very skilled also in doing portraiture showing with great accuracy the physical attributes of his subjects.",
