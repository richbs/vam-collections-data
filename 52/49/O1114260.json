The masks  were traditionally carved from a tree known as the kaduru tree which was  believed to have mystical powers. It has soft, light wood,that is easy to  carve. After the wood is dried and smoked to help preserve it from insects,  the masks are carved with chisels and mallets and painted with a light  yellow undercoat before being painted with codified colours to denote the  particular features of each character.\n\nAccording to legend Sri Lanka was once ruled by a race known as  Rakshasas whose king was Ravana of the Ramayana. Rakshasas could  assume various forms, one of which was the cobra. Although there were  24 forms of Rakshasas, only a few features in Kolam dances, and the  carving of the head dress on this mask in the form of three cobras identify  it as a cobra mask or naga raksha.",
