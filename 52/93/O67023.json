A photograph taken at the time shows that the tile was fitted into a frame containing sixteen tiles in a 4x4 formation, with this tile in a corner position. The other tiles in the frame certainly included examples of the interlace pattern (C.86-1998), and it is likely that all twelve tiles of this type were included, so as to form a block, with four additional tiles (this marbled tile among them) forming a border along one side.It seems highly likely that the remaining three tiles of the border would have been the three additional marbled tiles (C.96, 97, & 99-1998).",
