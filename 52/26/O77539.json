However, other Wedgwood cream vases are made in four pieces, having an interior lining (which helped keep the cream cool) and a two-part cover. The notch in the cover of this piece would have been used to accomodate the handle of a spoon. The potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1975) is known to have made cream vases for dairies as early as 1769, and his Staffordshire factory supplied tiles and dairy wares to a number of grand estates during the 1780s and 1790s.\n\nTrading\nProspective buyers could examine samples of Wedgwood's dairy wares at his London showrooms by 1769, when he wrote to his sales manager telling him to show and take orders from the 'Cream Vases for daries of a new pattern'. By about 1815, sketches of his dairy wares were being shown to potential clients by one of the firm's travelling salesmen. A surviving salesman's notebook of about this date includes numbered drawings of creamware cream vases, a 'Butterkit', milk sieves, whey cups, skimmers, dairy spoons, cheese covers and churns.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe vase is made from a type of creamware, a hygienic and durable kind of glazed pottery, which would have been highly suitable for dairy wares.",
