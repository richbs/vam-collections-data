His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nThe Sleeping Beauty, first performed by the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet in 1946, is Messel's most enduring production in Great Britain.  He designed over one thousand costumes for the many revivals of this production between 1946 and 1970.   The fanciful costumes and sets are inspired by the work of artists and stage designers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  \n\nMessel designed a rocky landscape for Prince Florimund hunting by moon light.  The stark rocks and the dark red and brown tones contribute to the autumnal, melancholic atmosphere of Act II, which contains a battle between Prince Florimund and the evil fairy Carabosse to release Princess Aurora from her spell induced sleep.",

Choreography by Marius Petipa.  Oliver Messel\u2019s production first performed by the Sadler's Wells Ballet at the Royal Opera House, London on 20 February 1946.  It was produced by Nicholai Sergeyev and has additional choreography by Frederick Ashton and Ninette de Valois.  It featured Margot Fonteyn as Princess Aurora and Robert Helpmann and David Paltenghi as Prince Florimund. This performance marked the re-opening of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, as a theatre after its war-time use as a dance hall. \nIt was also performed on 9 October, 1949 at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, the production with which the Royal Ballet conquered New York. It was revised on a number of occasions most notably in 1952 and 1960  when several of the costumes as well as choreography and the production were reworked and was mounted in 1959 for the Royal Ballet Touring Company.  It remained in performance by the Royal Ballet companies for twenty five years.  Sarah Woodcock said of this production  \u201c<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> was to be Messel\u2019s biggest and most enduring production \u2026 The production was performed nearly one thousand one hundred and fifty times, from London to Los Angeles, from Leeds to Leningrad, becoming the Company\u2019s \u2018signature ballet\u2019.\u201d  (Pinkham, ed., 1983).\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel's costume and set designs for the Sadler's Wells Ballet production of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> in 1946 became the definitive stage designs for the ballet, enduring many revivals to 1970.",
