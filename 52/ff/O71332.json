An early owner has added the following note on the reverse: \n'. . . Considerable allowance must be made for Poetic or Painter's license in this representation. The Bheesti in reality is anything but a swell, and the beard and ornaments exist only in the vivid imagination of the painter. . . The only garment worn by the gentleman in question . . . is of a dirty white colour and certainly has no spangles on it.'\n\nPublished: W.G. Archer [1971] pl.6, p.47.",

            "history_note": "The Tarakeshwar murder case of 1873 was a public scandal in Calcutta based on an affair between Elokeshi the young attractive wife of  Nabinchandra Banerji and by the mahanta or chief priest of the Shiva temple at Tarakeshwar. Upon discovery of the affair, on 27 May 1873  her jealous husband Nabinchandra Banerji cut Elokeshi's throat with a fish knife ('bothi'). In the trial that followed Nabin was sentenced to life imprisonment and the Mahanta was fined and imprisoned for 3 years. Different variations of this affair favouring the various characters occur in several Bengali plays and Kalighat images between 1875-80. See Archer p12. However, it is doubtful that the Mahanta's punishment also included the task of that of a bhisti. The bhistis were generally Muslim men.\n\nHistorical significance: Calcutta was recognised as the Capital of British India from 1833-1912.By the 1830s, artists had arrived from rural villages in Bengal and began to produce paintings that reflected local history, mythology, customs and conflicts of a colonised society. As a popular art form, these artists are recognised for their use of brilliant colour, simplified images and swift brushstrokes that became the hallmark of Kalighat painting in the 19th and early 20th century.",

Archer suggests a date of 1830 whilst Jain dates this painting to the 1870's as he argues it relates to the Tarakeshwar murder affair which started in 1873 and depicts the Mahanta or priest rather than a water-carrier.",
