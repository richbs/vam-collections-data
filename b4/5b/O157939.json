            "public_access_description": "Mary Churchill (died 1750) was the daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Both of her parents' miniature portraits are also found in the Gilbert collection.  Her husband, John, became 2nd Earl of Montagu in 1709.\n\nContinental artists first introduced enamel painting to England in the 17th century, but it was in the early 18th century that it became fashionable. The young German Christian Friedrich Zincke dominated the market in London. It was Zincke who trained a number of English artists, including William Prewett. Most artists working in enamel were taught by an experienced enameller. It is not known who trained Gervase Spencer this difficult art, but he later taught Henry Spicer, who in turn taught William Birch. In 1794 Birch successfully established himself in America as an enamel painter.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
