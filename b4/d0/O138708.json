There are three parking areas for the vehicles. Around and between the roadway are pictures of buildings and waterways. There are four tabs protruding from one long side, coloured red, green, yellow and blue. Lifting these causes short areas of the roadway to move and this causes the vehicles to stop. There are eight designated places where the road signs are to be inserted\n[vehicles] Three coloured vehicles, a bus and two cars. The bus has a red top and a white body with its name in blue. One of the cars is red and blue, the other blue and yellow. The vehicles all have the passengers as part of the exterior design. All vehicles have clockwork mechanisms and holes in their sides where a key would be inserted.\n[toys (recreational artifacts)] Set of six complete and two partial road signs of cream plastic",
