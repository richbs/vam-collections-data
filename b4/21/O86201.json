            "physical_description": "Carpet of woven wool and hemp. At the centre of the rust-red ground are three rosettes, the largest in the centre set in a medallion and enclosed in three contiguous wreaths of flowers. Outside and resting on the central wreath are two wicker baskets filled with flowers and leaves, while similar flower-decked pedestals or urns rest on the far ends of the two smaller wreaths. The rest of the ground is filled with scrolling fleshy stems which spring from the arrangements of flowers and border the carpet with pendant husks and swags of flowers. A straight stem of leaves in orange and yellow marks the edges of the field.\n\nThe wide border, edged with two bands of gadrooning in shades of brown-yellow and orange, contains rosettes within wreaths of laurel, linked by swags of brightly coloured flowers on the same rust-red ground as the field. The colours used for the flowers, leaves and scrolling stems are bright and varied. Purple, lilac, puce, pink, green, blue, orange, yellow and brown with a very dark brown for the shadows. Outside the border is a plain surround of dark brown pile.\n\nTechnique: Warp of 4-ply white wool, S-plied, Z-spun, and 10 to the inch. The thickness of these warp threads varies considerably. The weft of hemp, brown, Z-spun, two shoots of two strands unplied, and seven set to the inch. The pile is of wool, 11 strands S-plied together, Z-spun, about 0.5 inch deep. Turkish knot, 35 to Sq. inch. The ends have simple warp fringes. The sides have 2 cords of 2 warp threads each, and oversewn in yellow wool.",
