As an apprentice to his father, he made figures in clay, attracting the interest of the portrait painter Alexander Mosses (1793-1837). Studied in his spare time at the drawing school of the Royal Institution, Liverpool, and apprenticed to a local painter and engraver. Achieved local success as a portrait painter and for his 'candlelight' studies, and exhibited frequently at the Liverpool Academy from 1831, although he did not become a member. Exhibited seven works at the RA in 1840 and 1846, all single figure studies such as a beggar and a friar, except for the portrait of ' Sir Joshua Walmsley' (see p65) who seems to have been his chief patron. The <i>Magazine of Art</i> writer recorded that he 'lived boisterously ... But he also felt the fascination of strong drink'; he is supposed to have declined to paint Prince Albert. He died at Everton, 13 October 1880. \n\nLIT: <i>Magazine of Art</i> June 1882, pp341-3; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp95-8 \n\n<b>Charles Kean as Hamlet</b> \n369-1872 Neg 70313 \nCanvas, 59.7 x 43.8 cm (23\u00bd x 17\u00bc ins) \nSigned and dated 'Daniels/1835' in shadow r \nBequeathed by Sir Joshua Walmsley 1872 \n\nExhibited at the Liverpool Academy in 1835. Charles John Kean (1811-68) was the second son of the famous actor Edmund Kean; he first appeared on the stage at Drury Lane in 1827, and became one of the leading actors of the day, his Hamlet being particularly admired. He first played Hamlet in Liverpool in October 1833, and again in 1835, the year of this portrait; he played the role at Drury Lane in 1837/8. He made his last public appearance at Liverpool, on 28 May 1867. There are many recorded portraits of Kean, including two as Hamlet: one attributed to William Mulready, the other by Richard Dadd (R Ormond <i>Early Victorian Portraits</i> 1973, I, pp245-7; P Allderidge <i>The Late Richard Dadd</i> Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1974 (38); the Theatre Museum has a half-length portrait of Kean by Samuel John Stamp dated 1838.\n \nEXH: Liverpool Academy 1835 (101); <i>The Liverpool Academy 1810-1867</i> Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool 1960 (41)\n \nLIT: G Ashton 'Paintings in the Theatre Museum', <i>Apollo</i> April 1987, p259, repr fig 3\"",
