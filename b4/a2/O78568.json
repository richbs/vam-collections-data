The hot water was drawn off by using the tap at the front of the urn.  The interior is fitted with a tube, within which is a heated cast-iron ingot.  This kept the water hot.\n\nOwnership & Use\nHot water urns stood on a side-board or dresser.  They were made in a variety of materials, including silver, Sheffield plate, brass and copper.  Copper urns were the most popular, the surface either deliberately patinated to a dark colour or, as with this example, polished bright and then lacquered.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThese urns were intended to form part of the furnishings of a dining room, and therefore were well-designed, imposing vessels.  This urn supported by reeded columns is in the fashionable style of the 1820s, when Neo-classicism was still very popular.",
