Hume, and she attached an explanatory note thus:\nIn 1900 the 4th Balloon Section commanded by A.H.B. Hume R.E. was sent to China to take part in the operations to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. The journey from England took 9 weeks and in the event the Section arrived after the relief of the British Legation in Pekin [sic]. However, in the aftermath there was plenty of work to be done. On one occasion the Section was sent out to recover any useful engineering materials found in factories which had been sacked in the fighting.\nIn his diary, Captain Hume records: \u201cWe captured a retired Senior German Army officer redhanded looting the village Wuh-li-tun 5 li i.e. 10 miles from Pekin. He had engaged a gang of Chinese Bandits and 16 Pekin carts to carry the loot being torn from the villagers\u2019 houses. Afterwards the villagers showed us gratitude.\u201d\nThis was manifested by the presentation to Capt. Hume, as a mark of great honour, of a large ceremonial umbrella. The umbrella is decorated with a number of short white \u2018streamers\u2019 carrying the villagers names and two long streamers bearing an inscription which may be translated \u2018Three villages of Chin-ssu offer this ceremonial canopy to the great and exalted Englishman Hu (Hume)\u2019",
