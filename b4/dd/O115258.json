            "public_access_description": "The crozier, also known as a pastoral staff, is a symbol of office used by bishops and mitred abbots. Its form is generally believed to symbolise a shepherd's crook, emphasising the role of the bishop or abbot in guiding his flock. The crozier would have been held by a napkin or sudarium, which hung from the lower part of the knop - every alternate buttress of the knop's tabernacle is pierced for the cord with which to suspend it.\n\nThe origin of this crozier can be reconstructed from the inscription on it. Eberhard of Brandis was abbot of Reichenau 1343-1379. According to the chronicles of the abbey, he was responsible for impoverishing the community through his careless and spendthrift character. The inscription suggests that the crozier, although made for Eberhard, who must be the kneeling figure shown praying to the Virgin and Child, was commissioned by the abbey's treasurer, Nicholas of Gutenberg, who may well be the smaller figure represented praying beneath the angel.\n\nThe crozier was owned in the nineteenth century by the Russian collector Prince Soltikoff, and was bought from the Soltikoff sale of 1862 on behalf of the Museum by the dealer and collector John Webb. Its provenance before this is unknown, but it has generally been assumed to have come onto the market during the monastic suppressions of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.",

            "history_note": "The crozier was owned in the nineteenth century by the collector Prince Soltikoff, and was bought from the Soltikoff sale of 1862 on behalf of the Museum by the dealer and collector John Webb. Its provenance before this is unknown, but it has generally been assumed to have come onto the market during the monastic suppressions of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The early history of the crozier can be reconstructed from the inscription on the piece. Eberhard of Brandis was abbot of Reichenau 1343-1379. According to the chronicles of the abbey, he was responsible for impoverishing the community through his careless and spendthrift character. The inscription suggests that the crozier, although made for Eberhard, who must be the figure shown praying to the Virgin and Child, was commissioned by the abbey's treasurer, Nicholas of Gutenberg, who may well be the smaller figure represented praying beneath the angel.\n\nHistorical significance: The fact that this piece is dated, and that its original ownership is known, makes it a particularly important piece for understanding the production of metalwork and enamels in Southern Germany in the mid-fourteenth century.",

            "production_note": "A number of similar fourteenth century metalwork croziers survive, across Northern and Southern Europe: examples exist in Italy (Citt\u00e0 di Castello) and England (New College, Oxford). Closer comparisons exist in the Netherlands (Haarlem) and Germany (Cologne). However, as H.P. Mitchell pointed out, 'in spite of their general similarity...these [the enamels] are widely different in style.' What the general similarities between these enamelled croziers suggest is a shared European taste at this date.\n\nAlthough the exact place of production for this piece is not specified in the inscription, the style of the enamels is undoubtedly German. Close similarities exist between the enamels of the crozier and the slightly earlier chalice from St Johann zu Constanz of about 1320 in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore. Constance was a goldsmithing centre, and Reichenau lay within its diocese, so this is a likely place of production. In the nineteenth century, before the inscription had been deciphered, there was an erroneous tradition that this piece came from the Basel Cathedral treasury.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The crozier is a symbol of office used by bishops and mitred abbots. Its form is sometimes interpreted as symbolising a shepherd's crook, emphasising the role of the bishop or abbot in guiding his flock. Other authors have traced an affinity with the \"lituus\", or rod used by the Roman augurs in their divinations. The crozier would have been held by a napkin or sudarium, which hung from the lower part of the knop - every alternate buttress of the knop's tabernacle is pierced for the cord to suspend it. It is worth noting that although the Reichenau crozier is a sumptuously decorated piece, it is rather coarser in execution than some of the other surviving fourteenth century metal croziers. This, along with the fact that the crozier is mainly of copper gilt rather than the silver gilt of other examples such as the crozier in Cologne Cathedral, means that the V&A crozier was a slightly cheaper commission. The crozier would still have been new when its owner, Eberhard of Brandis, received the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV at Reichenau Abbey in 1353, an occasion when the crozier would almost certainly have been used.",
