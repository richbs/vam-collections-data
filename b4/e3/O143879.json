This tile resembles two others in the collection, but differs slightly in its colouring.  The panel comprised an alternating pattern covering four tiles of similar baluster-shaped vases in orange with a decorative scrolling pattern in grey. Alternate different bunches of flowers rise out of these vases. The flowers include irises, roses, tulips among other types in manganese purple, orange, white and grey, all on a yellow ground.  This particular tile has half a vase on the left hand side and half a spray of flowers to the right with purple roses and daisy-like flowers with orange tulips in between.",

He had been living in Srinagar, where he was Director of the Technical Institute of Kashmir, and wrote to the museum in 1922 offering to sell his collection before he left that year to return to the UK. All were acquired in Kashmir. These tiles are said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal, Srinagar, Kashmir. The building dates from the mid-fifteenth-century, but it was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman in the time of Shah Jahan.  The tiles were probably made in Lahore.",
