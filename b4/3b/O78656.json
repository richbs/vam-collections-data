The custom of a christening gift may have begun in the Tudor period (1485-1603). Silver spoons were a popular present, hence the saying 'born with a silver spoon in the mouth'. In 1661 the diarist Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) gave a set of silver spoons as a christening gift to a child in his family. Cups and porringers (small, two-handled bowls) could also be given as christening presents.\n\n Time\nBy the 19th century the standard gift for a christening was a set of cutlery, a cup or a mug. Manufacturers' catalogues from the later part of the century show boxed sets of cutlery with a cup, mug or egg cup. These could cost over \u00a312 depending on the number of pieces and the richness of the decoration.\n\nManufacturer\nBarnard & Sons was one of the largest and most successful manufacturing silversmiths in London in the 19th century. They supplied retailers throughout England with good-quality silver and also exported to such countries as America and India.",
