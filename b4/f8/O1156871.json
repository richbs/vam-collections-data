It is part of a collection made by Arthur Astill, who kept posters, handbills and advertisements from theatres where he appeared in variety. \n\nArthur Astill (1887-1962) started his career in a Pierrot Troupe known as the Olympic Serenaders. Subsequently he appeared on his own as 'the Whistling Ploughboy', which was his billing at the Palace Theatre, Blackpool, in June 1912. He went on to form a double act with his wife Gwen Fontaine (1891-1978) whom he married in 1911. They appeared together at Bradford where they shared the top of the bill with Bert Weston 'The Inebriate Idiot'. They are described as 'Presenting Mirth, Mimicry and Voice-throwing in a delightful scena'. One of their later acts was entitled 'Impressions of Country Life' and included mimicry of birds, animals and children.",
