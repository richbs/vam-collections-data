Lined with woollen fabric.  Probably the shoe for the right foot.\" [In fact shoes at this date were made as 'straights' with no left and right.  An adult by habitual wear might shape a shoe to his or her right and left foot, but it is unlikely that this would happen with a fabric shoe for a child of this age, nor is there so far any evidence that an adult carer would try to follow consistent usage in this way when dressing the child.]",
