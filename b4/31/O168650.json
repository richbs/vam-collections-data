Using concrete poetry as a kind of springboard Hou\u00e9dard developed a way of making more purely abstract or pictorial images with the typewriter keys. \n\nHere, the image and text together play with the idea of 'thumia'  - a Latin word translateable as 'heat', 'hot' or 'burning' with a variety of meanings ranging from indignation and desire to suffering. The enclosed smoking pyramid suggests some kind of ritual burning or sacrifice.\n\nThis is one of a number of so-called typestracts by Hou\u00e9dard in the museum\u2019s collection. Some contain a legible arrangement of words, others are abstract, often resembling the drawings of the Russian Constructivists.",
