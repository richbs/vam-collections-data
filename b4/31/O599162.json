This was a reprint combining three series of prints that appeared between 1774 and 1783 depicting the manners and fashions of fashionable society. This image originally formed part of the second set, first published in 1776. They tell the story of a fashional lady called C\u00e9phise from the announcement of her pregnancy through to motherhood and her return to court society. \n\nThe purpose of these series was to show the fashions and customs of French high society, including changing tastes in room furnishings. This print shows a private boudoir where C\u00e9phise reclines on a daybed to receive her guests. The boudoir is subtly panelled in the Neo-classical style with up-to-date furnishings, the oval-backed chairs with straight legs, the classical scroll decoration on the table, the tassled and fringed upholstery and drapery framing a mirrored alcove, and the parquet floor, which became fashionable again during the classical period. By the time this second series was published the Rococo style was disappearing in favour of the more sedate Neo-classicism. Le Camus de M\u00e9zieres in his book Le Genie de l\u2019Architecture in 1780 commented on the amount of house building in the new style taking place in the Paris suburbs. By this date it was becoming usual for architects to get inspiration from examples of the new style in Paris as well as antique and Italian Renaissace classicism in Italy.",
