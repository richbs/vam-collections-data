His sitters included the Queen, Prince Philip, the Prince of Wales and the Prince Royal. He produced ten portraits of the Queen and was said to be one of her  favourite portraitists. \nBoden had a great fondness for opera, often listening to recordings of arias while he worked. In 1955 he painted a full-length portrait of Tito Gobbi as Scarpia. Gobbi (1913-1984) was famous for the role, appearing opposite some of the great Toscas of the day. In his autobiography, My Life (published 1979), he recalls that the first sittings for the portrait were undertaken while he was in London, singing in Tosca at Covent Garden with Renata Tebaldi. The finished portrait (reproduced on the book jacket of My Life) is owned by the Gobbi family and a copy hangs in the Royal College of Music in London. The Theatre Museum's head and shoulders painting appears to be a preliminary sketch for the full-length.",
