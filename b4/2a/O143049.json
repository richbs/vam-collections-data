The house which was built in 1843-4, and the papers were designed around the same time.\n\nThis pattern is a dramatic design with heraldic motifs in roundels interspersed with diagonal bands, on a ground patterned with scrolling foliage, printed in bold colours. The design incorporates the initials AWP, the Pugin motto \u2018en avant\u2019 is repeated on the diagonal bands, and the black bird in the roundels comes from the Pugin arms. This design is characteristic of Pugin\u2019s \u2018medievalising\u2019 style. The V&A holds the original design for this paper (D.1045-1908) which is inscribed \u201cThis part of Pattern [apparently referring to the foliage ground] white on Red for Dining Room / white on Blue for Drawing Room / light green on dark green for Mrs Pugin\u2019s Room\u2026\u201d\n\nThe V&A has a number of Pugin\u2019s wallpapers and designs, but these are of particular interest because Pugin designed them for his own home, and they were found in situ.",
