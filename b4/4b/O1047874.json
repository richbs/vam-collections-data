Comment: Painting in watercolours was an activity which her daughters may have enjoyed, much as Lady Hawarden and her sisters may have done when they were growing up. In this photograph Florence Elizabeth appears to be dipping a paintbrush into a glass of water while examining a sketchbook open in landscape format before her. Unfortunately no watercolours by Lady Hawarden's children are known.'",
