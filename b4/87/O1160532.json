Commissioned as a celebration of the 300th anniversary of William of Orange's accession to the English throne, I Am Curious, Orange was noted for its irreverent themes and the outlandish costumes, including dancing citrus fruit. Many of the costumes were designed and made by performer and designer Leigh Bowery, who also appeared in the work. The bolero was conceived by Bowery and made in collaboration with corsetier Mr Pearl, costume maker Clive Ross, and Nicola Bateman, who Bowery was to marry in 1994",
