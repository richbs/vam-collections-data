            "public_access_description": "Scraps first appeared in the early 19th century as black and white engravings, and were later coloured by hand. By the 1820s they had become more elaborate and sometimes embossed, and within a decade both the printing and embossing processes were automated. They were colour printed by chromolithography, and coated with a gelatine and gum layer to give them a gloss finish. After being embossed they were die-cut and put through a stamping press to cut away the unwanted areas of paper, leaving the individual images connected by small strips, often bearing the name or initials of the maker.\n\nScraps became extremely popular in Victorian England to be cut out by adults or children and stuck into albums, on to screens, or used for decorating greetings cards. This scrap is one of a series depicting Shakespearean characters played by popular actors, although sometimes in fanciful pairs. Lady Macbeth was one of Sarah Siddons' most notable roles and one she played at her farewell benefit performance at Covent Garden Theatre on 29 June 1812. Macbeth was one of Macready's most successful roles but he never played it with Sarah Siddons since he made his debut in the role in 1820.",
