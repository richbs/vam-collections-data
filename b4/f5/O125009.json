            "public_access_description": "Matthew Meadows is an artist whose recent work has taken the form of printed wallpapers produced as one-offs for exhibitions, and as part of residencies and teaching projects. This piece -'Razor Wire' wallpaper - was inspired by his interest in adapting historic patterns and by his experience of teaching in prisons.\n\nThe design of this piece is a fascinating conflation of different patterns; the underlying motifs derive from 18th century damask, and mock-flock wallpapers, and 19th century floral stripes, printed in shades of blue, black, white and grey; 'woven' into these patterns are stripes created by the cut-out negative silhouettes of strands of razor wire. The 'over' and 'under' layers of pattern are so subtly interlaced that it creates a kind of trompe l'oeil effect, so that is not clear whether the wire motif overlays the conventional pattern or is integral to it. Wallpaper is usually taken to be a symbol of domesticity, security and comfort, but these associations are contradicted - indeed graphically cancelled out - by the imagery of the wire here which suggests darker feelings of pain and confinement. It also alludes to the way that prisoners use symbolic and familiar objects to create a sense of homeliness in their cells, but this homely atmosphere is constantly contradicted by their setting, with its bars, locks, and the wire on perimeter walls.",
