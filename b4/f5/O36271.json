The seating area is of moulded black plastic and is the same design as that used for the Planetary Patrol Vehicle. At the front has been added a grill block and the whole is mounted on four wheel which are themselves on a flexible axle similar to that used for off-road vehicles. Each pair of wheels is on a bar which passes through a tube housing a spring. Also attached to the bars are two triangular blocks. A third bar passes through the blocks and is attached to the centre of the vehicle's base. As the wheels move they can move up and down independently allowing the vehicle to traverse rough terrain. The  body of the vehicle is decorated with paper panels and strips; painted in various colours to show the `Space Ranger' motif.",
