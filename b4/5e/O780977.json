            "public_access_description": "Full-size elevation and detail section of an octagonal frame by John Yenn (1750-1821) from the office of leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). This drawing has been trimmed from a larger sheet. It shows the lower left-hand corner of a large octagonal frame. At the corner is a patera. The profile through this is shown. The frame is ornamented with laurel leaves and berries, the sprays of which diminish towards the centre of each side of the frame.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
