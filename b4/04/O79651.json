The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThis chain belongs to the urban tradition.  The pendants were described as zrar fuddah or \u2018buttons for the waistcoat\u2019 when it was acquired in 1872.  These buttons, made from bullion thread more often than silver, were worn on the waistcoat or jacket of male Ottoman dress throughout the empire up to the First World War.  In Turkey and the Middle East silver examples were often added to chains, like this, to make a woman\u2019s necklace.  The words zrar fuddah simply mean \u2018silver buttons\u2019 in Arabic.\n\nThis example was bought for five shillings and six pence at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.",
