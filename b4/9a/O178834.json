            "public_access_description": "Rupert Potter (1832-1914), father of the children's writer and illustrator Beatrix Potter (1866-1943), took up photography in the 1860s when it was still a relatively new art form.  An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he was elected to the Photographic Society of London in 1869 and later contributed to photographic exhibitions.  Rupert assisted the artist Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896), a close friend, by photographing backgrounds for paintings and sitters for portraits. His favourite subject, however, was Beatrix herself and his prolific legacy of several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial account of her life from infancy to marriage.\n\nRupert was also a skilled landscape photographer.  During the Potter family's extended summer holidays to Scotland and the Lake District he photographed in particular the countryside in Perthshire and the landscapes of Wray Castle near Ambleside and of Lingholm, a house on the edge of Derwentwater.  From 1871 to 1881 the Potter family rented Dalguise House near Dunkeld.  This photograph, dated July 1880, depicts Rupert with a male servant standing beside a dead hind, the trophy from a day's hunting.  \n\nThe twenty-foot mercat cross (market cross) of Dunkeld originally stood in the centre of the Cross, or High Street, of the town of Dunkeld as a symbol of the town's right to trade.  In the past it was also the focal point of town events, such as executions, announcements and proclamations.  However, in 1864 the cross was removed to make way for the impressive Atholl Memorial Fountain erected in memory of the Sixth Duke of Atholl, George Augustus Frederick John Murray (1814\u20131864).  The mercat cross was resituated in the grounds of Dalguise House and was a preferred backdrop to several of Rupert's portraits; it is now housed in the Birnam Institute.",
