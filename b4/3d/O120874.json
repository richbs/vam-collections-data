            "public_access_description": "David Garrick (1717-1779) was recognised during his lifetime as one of the greatest actors ever in both comedy and tragedy. He was born in Hereford and came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but he made his London debut as an actor in 1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre as Richard III. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted during his lifetime in many of his most famous roles, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810). Richard III was a role with which he was especially associated, both from his London debut and his first appearance as Richard at Drury Lane Theatre on 11 May 1742. \n\nThe figurine of Garrick as Richard III is copied from an engraving by J. Dixon, published in 1772 after a painting by Nathaniel Dance exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1771. It was produced by the Derby porcelain factory, established in about 1750 by the Huguenot Andrew Planch\u00e9 who, in partnership with William Duesbury produced figures of extremely high quality.  By 1770, Duesbury acquired the famous Chelsea China Works and the Bow moulds which resulted in the transfer of a number of extremely skilled craftsmen from London to Derby. They opened a London showroom in 1773, and in 1775 King George III  granted the factory the honour of incorporating a crown into the backstamp.",
