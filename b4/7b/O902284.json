Tatham \u2018Designs by Giuseppe Boschi\u2019; the two left figures entitled \u2018Vestal\u2019, the third figure \u2018Bacchante\u2019, the right hand figure \u2018Faun\u2019; inscribed along the lower edge \u2018Each design I\u2019 : I\u201d high will cost 60 scudis the pair: i.e. abt. \u00a315\u2019 Pen and ink, tinted in green, red and yellow wash 6 \u00bc x 9 \u00bd (158 x 242) D.1528-1898 PROVENANCE C.H. Tatham; Henry Holland; Sir J. Soane (in the album described in no. 1050 below) Tatham, Henry Holland\u2019s agent in Rome, refers to Boschi in several of the letters he sent to Holland in London (they are in the same album as the drawings). In a latter dated 10 July 1795 he describes Boschi as a little known artist who ran a bronze manufactory in rivalry with the better known firms of Antonio Righetti and Giuseppe Valadier, Boschi\u2019s prices were lower than his rivals\u2019, but Tatham had been assured by Canova, Visconti, Bonomi and Antonio and Angelica Zucchi that his work was not inferior to theirs. For a short account of Boschi\u2019s career, doubtless comprising all that is known, see Hugh Honour, \u2018After the Antique.
