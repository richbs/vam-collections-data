Corinthian pilasters line the walls. A chandelier hangs from a tasselled rope from the ceiling and there are candles in sconces around the room. Around the top edges of the room is an elaborate cornice, including acanthus scrollwork decoration. The ceiling has been painted with images of cherubs and garlands. There are three arches set into the back wall, of which the two outermost contain doors, and above these are paintings of cherubs and vases. The central arch has a mantle, clock and large mirror. Three arches are visible along the wall on the left hand side, the two outermost with windows with drapes, the centre being a fireplace with vase and two bowls of roses on the mantle and large mirror above. There are vases with garland decorations and more garlands around the room. The floor is parquet. \n\nA woman sits in a chair by one of these windows and reads. Near the centre of the picture, a man and a woman are playing a dice game, with a man observing from behind. To the right a group of three women and two men are playing a card game on right hand side of the image. To the centre right of the image, a man and a seated woman are having a conversation. Two dogs are playing in the centre of the image. \n\nIn the lower margin below the image is a representation of the coat of arms of Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Bourbon set among a military trophy.",

            "public_access_description": "This engraving and etching is one of a pair (along with L\u2019Assembl\u00e9e - Au Concert, museum number E.364-2013) made by Fran\u00e7ois Dequevauviller based on gouache paintings by Nicholas Lavreince. Nicolas Lavreince (real name Niclas Lafrensen) was a Swedish miniaturist, draughtsman and gouache painter active in Paris until 1791.  Originally his father\u2019s  pupil, he visited Paris 1771-3 before returning to Sweden where he was made a member of the Stockholm Academy. Returning to Paris in 1774 he made numerous models for engravers including the gouaches on which these two prints are based. \n\nWhen L\u2019Assembl\u00e9e - Au Salon  was announced in the Journal de Paris of 20 March 1783 priced at 9 livres it was noted in the best celebrity journalistic style that  \u201cCette estampe nous para\u00eet repr\u00e9senter assez bien ce qui se passe dans les meilleures assembl\u00e9es \u201d. It  has been suggested that it depicts the salon of the Duc de Luynes to whom the print is dedicated. (This is presumably Louis-Joseph-Charles-Amable d\u2019 Albert de Luynes , (1748-1807) sixth Duc de Luynes.) Whether this room on a palatial scale bore any resemblance to his actual residence is unclear but the image clearly satisfied the aspirational impulses of Parisian print buyers.  \n\nAccording to Mimi Hellman, L\u2019Assembl\u00e9e au Salon, \u201cseems to typify this mode of elegantly appointed French ease. ... Regularly spaced arcades, separated by fluted pilasters and capped by a richly articulated cornice, enframe the windows, doors and two mirrors placed over a fireplace and console table. Matching light fixtures flank the mirrors, and identical large urns set on pedestals punctuate the corners of the room\u2026 The chairs match; in actual rooms such sets were distributed at regular intervals along the walls-one is visible in this position to the right of the console table-and displaced according to the spatial and social conditions of different leisure situations.\nEighteenth Century Studies, Vol. 32, no. 4, Summer 1999, p. 415-445.",
