Briefly at school in London, then Leeds Grammar School. Returned to London 1827 to study at Sass's art school and 1828 at RA Schools. Travelled to Paris 1832 and Italy 1833-5. Exhibited 134 works at the RA between 1833 and 1882, 14 at the BI 1836--43, and one at the SBA 1837. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre; the fact that he was Roman Catholic may explain his choice of many of the subjects. Founder member of the Etching Club in about 1840. Awarded one of the three first prizes in the 1843 competition for the new Palace of Westminster decorations with 'An Early Trial by Jury'; travelled again to Italy to study fresco painting before painting several frescos at Westminster. Elected ARA 1843, RA 1848; appointed Professor of Painting at the RA 1867, and examiner in painting for the South Kensington Schools of Art 1870. Visited America and Canada 1876.

It seems to be an unusual subject for painting in the mid-19th century. \n\nEXH: RA 1846 (102); <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (769 or 770, both\n'Une Mere et Son Enfant' lent by J Sheepshanks)\n \nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 16 May 1846, p504; <i>Art Union</i> 1846, p174; <i>Reminiscences</i>, pp165, 379\"",
