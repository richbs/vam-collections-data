His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s painterly and poetic interpretation of medieval period costume and architecture complemented Christopher Fry\u2019s verse play, The Lady\u2019s Not For Burning (1949), about a woman wrongly accused of witchcraft in a small English market town around 1400. It was Fry's first play to be presented at a West End theatre, winning critical acclaim when opened at the Globe Theatre in 1949. The production was taken to New York in November 1950, where it won the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Foreign Play of 1950-51.",

It was also performed at the Royale Theatre, New York, on 8 November 1950.  \n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.

The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Association with Christopher Fry's abortive poetic drama movement.",
