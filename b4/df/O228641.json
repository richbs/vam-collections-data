It has an undyed plain weave ground divided into a diamond lattice by laid and couched black silk.  There is a blue roundel where the lines cross. Each diamond contains a yellow and green bowl and 3 round fruits in either red [faded] or yellow.  On the left hand side, towards the top, one bowl has been embroidered upside down.  The applied border is also made from many pieces.  A red silk satin is in each corner with a floral motif and a small bird [metal thread is silver strip open S-wound around a yellow silk core]. Light brown plain weave silk forms the long borders with a bird perched on a flowering plant.  There is some metal thread [as above].\nBacking: roller printed cotton with wavy stripes in brown, dark red, green and white with flowers.\nFacing: bias cut blue silk satin.",
