Chauveau but since this drawing does not appear to be by an engraver and has several different features from the corresponding figure in the engraving it would seem to have been done by Gissey who preceded B\u00e9rain <i>pere</i> as <i>Dessinateur du Roi</i>, and died in 1673 aged 65 (<i>see</i> 'Ab\u00e9c\u00e9dario\" by P. J. Mariette, Paris, 1853-4, Tome II, P. 313. The illuminated copy of Chauveau's Carrousel in the Albertina Gallery, Vienna, shows this figure on the right of a group of three <i>Estafiers Romains</i>: the colouring is different and probably historically inaccurate.
