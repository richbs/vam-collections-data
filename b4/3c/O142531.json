The British response was a military expedition of huge complexity and expense led by General Sir Robert Napier. The expedition marched to Tewodros\u2019s fortress at Maqdala where a brief battle took place. Britain won the conflict, but not before the captives were released and Tewodros himself had committed suicide.\n\nThe expedition, which involved more than 13,000 men and a journey of some 400 miles, received unprecedented publicity in Britain. Crucially, it was one of Britain\u2019s earliest military operations to be captured via the relatively new science of photography. Two sets of photographic stores and equipment were sent from England by the Royal Engineers\u2019 Establishment and used to record the landscapes, camp scenes and leading individuals associated with the expedition.\n\nThis panoramic image presents a view of the expedition camp at Senafe. Taken from a raised viewing point, it shows white tents and rows of equipment set out on a stony plain against a background of large rocks. In contemporary written accounts the orderly military camp was contrasted with the \u2018mud-built native cottages which form the village of Senafe\u2019, which lay just a quarter of a mile away. This image, however, contains no evidence of indigenous habitation of the landscape.",

The equipment was supervised in the field by a chief photographer, Sergeant John Harrold, and seven assistants. Besides their other duties, the Royal Engineers used the camera to record scenes of the expeditionary forces, portraits of officers and landscape views. Although it is not known how many such photographs were made in total, a series of seventy-eight, including landscape views, camp scenes, sketches and portraits were subsequently assembled into albums and presented to various worthy institutions of government and science, from the RGS to the Foreign Office, by the Secretary of State for War in 1869. A number of the photographs were also used, along with drawings by various officers, as a basis for the illustrations in the official <i>Record of the Expedition to Abyssinia</i>.' (p74)\n'Unlike commercial photographers who accompanied earlier and subsequent campaigns, the photographers of the Royal Engineers were not treated as privileged artists. Nor were they individually acknowledged on their photographs. Their work was represented as a collective record rather than a series of subjective studies.'
