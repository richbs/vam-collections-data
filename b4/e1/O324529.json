They consisted of iron plates bolted together and were basically free-standing box-shaped structures which contained the burning fuel.The stove-plates were made in the same way as firebacks, although thinner and lighter. Iron to be used for casting had to be heated to liquid form, which required a very high temperature. The patterns on firebacks and stove-plates were created by pressing one or more pattern-moulds into a bed of sand. After removing the moulds, the liquid iron was then poured in and allowed to cool. \n\nMoulds for firebacks and stove plates were generally made of carved wood. Designs for stoves often depicted Biblical subjects, as on this, which shows the Marriage feast at Cana in Galilee, when Christ turned water into wine ( Gospel of St John, chapter 2).",

They consisted of iron plates bolted together and were basically free-standing box-shaped structures which contained the burning fuel.The stove-plates were made in the same way as firebacks, although thinner and lighter. Iron to be used for casting had to be heated to liquid form, which required a very high temperature The patterns on firebacks were created by pressing one or more pattern-moulds into a bed of sand. After removing the moulds, the liquid iron was then poured in and allowed to cool.  Moulds for firebacks were generally made of carved wood.",
