Arguably the most famous architect, of any country, in the twentieth century: himself a prolific writer, he has been the subject of innumerable studies. A catalogue of his complete work, edited by W. Boesiger, has appeared in seven volumes but is available in condensed version (London 1960). His own My Work  was published in 1960, in the same year as the biography Le Corbusier: Architecture and Form by Peter Blake (London).\"",
