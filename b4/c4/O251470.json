Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nThe Danish silversmith Else Nicolai Hansen (born 1960) initially worked an apprenticeship at Georg Jensen, Copenhagen, before taking further training in London and Copenhagen. \n\nOf this piece 'Results Nr. 12' she explains 'all in all I have made 15 different \"results\" from the same size of fine silver disk and hand raised them into different shapes but with the same chased pattern/surface. Even if  they all have the same weight they are completely different'.",
