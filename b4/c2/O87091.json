It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
