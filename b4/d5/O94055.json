The front is carved with a representation of two monks venerating relics in a <i>stupa</i>(the left hand monk has lost his face).  They are shown kneeling in three-quarter profile on either side of a <i>stupa</i> shrine with their hands together in the conventional <i>anjali mudra</i> position of adoration.  The <i>stupa</i> in the centre rises from a square base to a domed <i>harmika</i> decorated with hanging lotus petals, above which there is an inverted pyramid supporting the<i> chattravali</i> of five parasols. This has a drapery either side fluttering from its apex which projects in front of the plinth on which the main statue stands.",
