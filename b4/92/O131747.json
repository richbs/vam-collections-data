Entered RA Schools November 1815; travelled to Italy 1818. Exhibited 126 works, almost all portraits, at the RA between 1815 and 1879, 26 various subjects at the BI 1820-61, and 30 at the SBA 1824-56. His portrait painting practice attracted a distinguished clientele. Published 'Twenty Sketches of Miss Fanny Kemble in the Character of Juliet ... ' (1830), 'The Court Album ... ' (1850), and 'Beauties of the Court of Queen Victoria ... ' Married Augusta Bramley 1822; there were seven children. Died Gillingham, Kent, June 1895. His group portrait of himself, Charles and Sir George Hayter, and Sir Edwin Landseer, was exhibited at the RA 1823 (now Shipley Art Gallery, Gateshead).\n \nLIT: B Coffey <i>Drawings by ... John Hayter</i> exhibition catalogue, Morton Morris 1982 \n\n<b>Viscountess Dungannon</b> \n227-1871 \nCanvas, 236.2 x 176.5 cm (93 x 69\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'J Hayter 1839' \nGiven by Viscountess Dungannon 1871 \n\nSophia Irvine, the fourth daughter of Colonel George Marcus Irvine of Castle Irvine, Fermanagh, married in 1821 Arthur Hill-Trevor (1798-1862), who succeeded in 1837 to the title of 3rd Viscount Dungannon (of the second creation in the Irish peerage). This portrait, in the manner of Sir Thomas Lawrence, shows her in her peeress's robes, and was presumably commissioned in the year of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. It does not seem to have been exhibited. \n\nAccording to an inscription on the back of the canvas, the artist retouched the painting in 1855, presumably on the occasion of the commission of the companion portrait of Viscount Dungannon painted by Stephen Catterson Smith and also in the V&A collections (see below 226-1871, p269).\"",
