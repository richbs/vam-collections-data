The carpet is heavily patched and it is difficult to distinguish the original colours; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 181 per sq. inch (2888 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: missing\n\nEND FINISH: missing\n\nDESIGN: field: dark blue ground; very light green panel takes up most of the field.  It has a scalloped niche at both ends.  The panel is filled with a small-scale diaper pattern outlined in black.  In the centre lies a dark blue lozenge containing a four-lobed stylised pink flower from which spring tendrils and buds in shades of pink.  The lozenge is outlined by pink hooks.  The panel has a row of blue and pink buds on the sides and pink intrusive hooks entereing from the scallops.  Hanging from both niche points is a sprig ending in pink carnation and buds.  The four spandrels are heavily decorated with multi-coloured carnations, dark pink serrated leaves, flowers and pink curled leaves.  Within a narrow pink border is a lower panel with a light blue ground on which are four angular multi-coloured sprays of flowers and leaves.  Within a narrow light purple border is an upper panel containing a floral meander in purple and green.\n\nMain border: broad zigzag in the diaper design of the central panel (black on very light green): the intervening triangles have dark blue ground with a dark purple or pink hooked outline and containing a sprig of one large and four small flowers.\n\nInner border: very light green ground with a central blax axis on which lie stylised sprigs, predominantly in purple and pink.\n\nOuter border: incomplete and missing from the lower end.  Very light green ground with floral meander with green angular stem outlined in black; flowers are purple and pink.",
