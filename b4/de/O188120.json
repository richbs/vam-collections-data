This poster is of particular interest because it depicts a new form of graphics which was introduced in the 1960s - the decorated acid blotter squares. Blotting paper was soaked with LSD and divided by perforations so that individual 'hits' could be sold. The different types of LSD were indicated by the different imagery printed on them: the blotters had specially designed logos and a wide range of images.",
