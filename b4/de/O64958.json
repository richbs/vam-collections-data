It began a world tour in September 1972, first visiting Europe, then returning for a Christmas season at the Aldwych before playing for a week at Stratford and then embarking on a year-long tour to America, Japan and Australia.\n\nHistorical significance: Few costumes remain from Brook's legendary production as, according to Patricia Doyle, most were burned at the end of the world tour as Brook felt the production had come to the end of its natural life.",
