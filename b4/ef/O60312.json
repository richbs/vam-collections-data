            "public_access_description": "This chair was exhibited at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1900, which established Art Nouveau as the dominant modern style of decoration throughout Europe. The complex, flowing lines of the chair are typical of the style, as are the formalised motifs on the leather panels. The use of chestnut leaves, mistletoe and sprays of ivy, shown in a much more realistic fashion on the legs and back, was less typical of the style. This may have been a speciality of the maker, A. Darras, about whom very little is known. The walnut frame is robust, but the original leather panels suffered from \u2018red rot\u2019, which made them crack and disintegrate into a red powder. The current panels were remade in the V&A, following the original design.",
