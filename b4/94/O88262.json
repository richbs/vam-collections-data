The figure stands in a small grotto of simulated rocks, ferns and flowers mounted on a circular black wooden base and covered by a glass dome. A musical mechanism has been fitted to replace the original one, now missing. When the two tunes, from Rigoletto and Carmen, are played, the monkey plucks the strings of the mandolin, turns his head from side to side and while opening and shutting his mouth. He also rolls his eyes.",

They were made as toys for very wealthy people in Europe and America. This one plays tunes from Rigoletto and Carmen when it is activated.",
