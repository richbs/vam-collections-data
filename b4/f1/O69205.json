Much of the glass from such settings was removed from its original location and dispersed, often because of religious or political upheaval. \n\nStained glass played an important role in the art of the Christian church for many centuries.  The church used stained glass to help in the teaching of the central tenets of the Christian faith. This panel could have been part of a window that acted like a large, colourful picture storybook in which worshippers could \u2018read\u2019 the stories of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.",
