Construction began in 1571 and work continued on various buildings until 1858. The gateway is known as the Hathi Pol or Elephant Gate. Through it you can see the Hiran Minar or Deer Tower.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
