It also features the Scottish comedy juggler Selbo (the stage name of David Horne), Larry Jason in an act named 'Hollywood Calling', and Arthur Astill (1887-1962) and Gwen Fontaine (1891-1978), billed as 'Mirth, Mimicry and Ventriloquism', in an act entitled 'Down on the Old Farm Yard'.  At other times their act was entitled 'Impressions of Country Life'. It came with a countryside set and involved the mimicry of birds, animals and children.\n\nThis hanging card was part of a collection made by Arthur Astill of advertisements from theatres where he and Gwen Fontaine appeared. It is typical of the format of two-colour printing used in the 1940s to advertise Variety, with the names of the most popular stars literally appearing at the 'top of the bill'. The names of Astill and Fontaine are at the bottom.",
