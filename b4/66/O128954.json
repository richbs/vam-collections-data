Pharmacies were, subsequently, a major market for maiolica. The pharmacies and dispensaries of monastic orders, hospitals and noble families required large numbers of jars to store their various herbs, roots, syrups, pills, oinments and sweetmeats. These were sometimes marked with coats of arms or other heraldic devices. The production of drug jars inscribed with their contents began in the middle of the fifteenth century, although, non-inscribed vessels continued to be used enabling their contents to be changed as required.\n\nDrug jars were produced at Castel Durante from the first half of the sixteenth century. Earlier ware, such as this example, consist of urn-shaped jars painted predominantly in blue and orange colours. The maiolica painter's preoccupation with ornament is particularly apparent on jars of this period. Distinctive treatment is accorded to the entire vessel; the reverse being as elaborately decorated as the front.",

Earlier wares, of which this is such an example, consist of urn-shaped jars painted predominantly in blue and orange colours. The maiolica painters' preoccupation with ornament is particularly apparent on jars of this period. Distinctive treatment is accorded to the entire vessel; the reverse being as elaborately decorated as the front.",

Pharmacies were, subsequently, a major market for maiolica. The pharmacies and dispensaries of monastic orders, hospitals and noble families required large numbers of jars to store their various herbs, roots, syrups, pills, oinments and sweetmeats. These were sometimes marked with coats of arms or other heraldic devices. The production of drug jars inscribed with their contents began in the middle of the fifteenth century, although, non-inscribed vessels continued to be used enabling their contents to be changed as required.",
