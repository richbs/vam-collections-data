This sword is not among the most elaborate examples to survive and would have been worn by a gentleman of moderate means.\n\nWorn in a scabbard and suspended from a belt, a sword boasted of its owner's status and honour. In England permissable lengths of blades and degrees of decoration were regulated according to rank by sumptuary laws.\n\nThis type of sword is known as a rapier. It developed as a specialised fencing sword, but by the 1570s had become a civilian weapon of self-defence. Its long, stiff, sharp blade was designed to pierce clothing rather than armour. Its elaborate, curving hilt (known as a swept hilt) protected an unarmoured civilian hand. Rapiers wre usually accompanied by daggers for in-close fighting. \n\nIt was common for swept hilts to be decorated in as rich a way as possible without impairing their function. The hilt is damascened with gold and silver, an Islamic technique adapted in western Europe and used on boxes, gun barrels and jewel caskets. Damascening was probbaly introduced into Europe via great trading cities such as Venice. Many English swords of this period were decorated in this way and 'damaskers',mentioned in contemporary accounts, were specialist craftsmen.",
