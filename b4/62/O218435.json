            "public_access_description": "A dynamic and dramatic new style of gold jewellery emerged in London during the 1960s, distinguished by asymmetrical contours, splintered surfaces, textured gold and unusual gemstones often left rough or in crystal form. Originating within the mainstream market for precious jewellery yet drawing inspiration from fine art, these more rugged pieces provided a young and exciting alternative to the predictable polished gold and neat diamonds that were more readily available. \n\nDavid Thomas (born 1938) was a key proponent of this new style. He studied at Twickenham School of Art and the Royal College of Art, and was one of the innovative young jewellers included in the 'International Exhibition of Modern Jewellery 1890-1961' held at Goldsmiths' Hall in 1961. This magnificent necklace was commissioned from him by the model Ann Mollo, and she wears the pendant as a brooch in her portrait of 1969 by photographer Michael Seymour in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.",
