Men often wore these in extravagant quantities with traditional costume.  In the south of Germany they also wore decorative silver hat buckles.\n\nMen's hats in south Germany traditionally had a wide brim and high crown.  The owner added a broad ribbon round the base of the crown, fastened at the side with a silver buckle, like this one.  When this buckle was acquired, in 1872, it was described as worn by peasant lads from Bavaria, but the shape and decoration are more typical of the area around Ulm, in Swabia, and the mark is probably that of an unknown silversmith recorded as working in Ulm at the end of the 18th century.\n\nIt was bought for nine shillings and three pence at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
