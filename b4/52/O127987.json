His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel designed costumes and sets for Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's play Suddenly Last Summer (1959).  The disturbing story about the mystery surrounding the death of Sebastian, the poet son of the rich, eccentric Mrs. Venable, gave Messel the opportunity to create a fantastic, exotic garden which contributed to the dark atmosphere of the film.  It starred Elizabeth Taylor, Katharine Hepburn and Montgomery Clift, and was nominated for several Oscars, including two Oscars for Messel\u2019s set designs.\n\nMrs. Venable tends the exotic garden of her late son Sebastian, including feeding insect eating plants.  It forms a backdrop to key scenes, contributing to the unsettling atmosphere of the film.  It gave Messel the opportunity to explore the surreal side of his imagination, and he filled the garden with a mixture of natural and man-made materials.",
