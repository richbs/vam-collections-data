The oval base is chased with gardoons and naturalistic foliage with three applied lizards, and the stem is formed as a tree trunk with an engraved foliage calyx at the top. The repouss\u00e9 hull of the ship is chased with cartouches of sea monsters and with scrolls and fruit on a matted ground. The spout of the nef issues from an applied mask at the bow. Another lizard is applied to the interior of the hull. The mizzenmast has two furled sails, the mainsail is engraved with a later coat of arms, and a flag is flying from the top of the mainmast.",

Though this example was probably intended for display, the spout protruding from the bow suggests it could have been used as a ewer. The upper section lifts off the hull to reveal a lizard in the bowl.\n\nThe Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Schatzkammer is one of the few collections of its kind formed in the late 20th century. The Schatzkammer, or treasury, was a new concept in the 16th century. It referred to a special chamber in which the most precious artefacts of a princely collection were housed.  Gold and jewelled objects were mounted alongside exotic natural curiosities, including rock crystal, nautilus shells and ostrich eggs. Together they demonstrated not only the wonders of nature and the technical achievements of the artist, but also the intellect and culture of the patron. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Although considerably smaller than the Schlusselfelder Nef [Nuremberg, 1502-3; Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, inv. no.HG2146; ...] it is in the same tradition in its basic form and function. Both are constructed with numerous figures on deck [...] More significantly, both may ostensibly function as a ewer or drinking vessel when the superstructure has been removed.[...] In the case of the Gilbert nef, the spout or siphon projecting from the figurehead is so constructed that its point of intake is located at the deepest part of the bowl, thus allowing the vessel to be drunk from without lifting or tipping it.  The lizards around the foot and inside the bowl are reminiscent of the technique of casting animals and foliage from life developed by Wenzel Jamnitzer and also used during the late sixteenth century by Nuremberg makers such as Jacob Frohlich.\" (Schroder, 1988)\n\nProvenance: Sale, Sotheby's, Geneva, lot 157, November 12, 1985.",
