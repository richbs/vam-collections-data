It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nA. G. Spry was a supporting act at Hanley. He is described as a \u2018low comedian\u2019 in the list of performers compiled by Cooke. Stand-up comedians and singers were an indispensable item on any music hall or variety bill, not least because they could be \u2018front-cloth\u2019 performers, working in front of a drop-cloth while scenery was changed behind for another item.",
