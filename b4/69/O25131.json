His talent for dramatising the 'gaffe' was cleverly chosen by the Government to illustrate a series of wartime posters encouraging voluntary fuel economies in British homes.\n\nWith many people fighting and others working long factory shifts, it was thought reasonable for those on 'The Home Font' to make some contribution to the war effort. In this design, a selfish brother is rebuked by his patriotic sister for wasting town gas (and indirectly its source, coal) needed to fuel the nation's armament factories. The old-fashioned chimney piece and primitive gas fire suggest that Bateman, ever alert to such matters, intended to depict a household of a lower social class to that shown in E.158-1973.\n\n[Kevin Edge, 'British Design at Home', p.130]",
