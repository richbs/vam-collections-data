In 1695 she married the painter Juriaen Pool and in 1701 she entered the painters' guild at The Hague. From 1708 until 1716 she was court-painter to Johann Wilhelm, Count Palatine, who bought most of her pictures of this period. She appears to have spent most of the rest of her life in Amsterdam; there are dated works until 1747. \nRachel Ruysch was essentially a painter of still life. Closely dependent on Willem van Aelst, she continued to use the dark tones and especially the dark backgrounds of the older generation long after they had been discarded by her contemporaries. \n\nLit.

Carel Borchaert Voet (1671-1743) is a little known still-life painter born in Zwolle (Northern Holland) who worked principally in The Hague and Dordrecht. His principal patron, by whom he was engaged from circa 1689 and whom he accompanied to England on numerous occasions, was Hans Willem Bentinck, later Earl of Portland. There is a fruit still-life by Voet in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Quimper (inv.nr. 873-1-195) and have been several on the art market in London (ie. Sotheby's 1995-12-06) and New York (ie. Christie's, 1988-06-02).",

            "historical_context_note": "The term \u2018still life\u2019 conventionally refers to works depicting an arrangement of diverse inanimate objects including fruits, flowers, shellfish, vessels and artefacts. The term derives from the Dutch 'stilleven', which became current from about 1650 as a collective name for this type of subject matter.  Still-life reached the height of its popularity in Western Europe, especially in the Netherlands, during the 17th century although still-life subjects already existed in pre-Classical, times. Dutch painters played a major role the development of this genre, inventing distinctive variations on the theme over the course of the century while Flemish artist Frans Snyders' established a taste for banquet pieces. These works were developed further in Antwerp by the Dutchman Jan Davidsz. de Heem (1606-1684) who created opulent baroque confections of fruit, flowers, and precious vessels that became a standardized decorative type throughout Europe. Scholarly opinion had long been divided over how all of these images should be understood. The exotic fruits and valuable objects often depicted testify to the prosperous increase in wealth in cities such as Amsterdam and Haarlem but may also function as <i>memento mori,</i> or <i>vanitas,</i> that is, reminders of  human mortality and invitations to meditate upon the passage of time.",
