The front, which holds the glass in a rebate, has flat sides with ribbed face.

Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>30 Unknown Woman</b> \n<b>1640-5</b> \nP75-1984 \n<b>Oval 59 x 48mm</b> \n\nFeatures in fine, elongated hatches of brown and sanguine, with perhaps some grey in the shadows, grey -green in the eyes, touches of red at the corners of the eyes and in the lips, and a white highlight in each eye; all on a thick pale carnation ground; hair in pale brown wash, lined with darker colour and stippled with grey; the lace in white over pale brown wash with some pale grey modelling in the shadows; head-dress in opaque grey wash, modelled in darker colour and the lights in pale greys over the collar; background a solid blue wash; a gold marginal strip; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Faded in the face with a conspicuously darkened retouch in the sitter's left cheek and down to her chin; retouch in the lips; the features otherwise sound.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In gold, centre right: <i>IH</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century silver locket, with a convex back turning into a flat flange over which the front of the frame is a push-fit. The front, which holds the glass in a rebate, has flat sides with ribbed face. The loop and crest are of one piece of double-channelled strip which tapers to the tail of a single-turn spiral on each side.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Anonymous vendor at Christie's 27 November 1984, lot 47a, bt by the Museum.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> <i>Recent Acquisitions</i>, V&A Print Room, 1985-6 (unnumbered).  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> C M Kauffmann, Recent Acquisitions (1985-6), unpaginated leaflet. \n\nThough it is faded this miniature is technically and stylistically interesting. The features are painted deftly and directly in fine, elongated hatches of brown and sanguine with apparently some grey blended into the shadows, but there is none of the elaborate polychrome stipple evident in other works of the 1630s, from the Mauritshuis Henrietta Maria (1632) 1 to the Katherine Bruce (1638; Cat. No. 27 [HH274-1948]) and the two lady d'Aubiqnys (Cat. Nos 28 and 29 [P.157-1910; P.105-1910]). Other works of the same decade, such as the 4th Earl of Dorset (Cat. No. 35 [P.104-1910]), which are suggestive of Cooper, are constructed in a much bolder or broader version of the red-brown hatching style, which makes that of the present miniature seem reticent. Technically, the closest relations here are with the Unknown Woman (Cat. No. 32 [P.117-1910]) and the Sir JohnWildman (Cat. No. 33 [P.2-1962]), which both share this fine and deft hatching style, combined with touches of local colour when appropriate - as for the eyes - on a thick, rich carnation ground. The miniature is probably earlier than either of these comparative pieces and may therefore indicate the beginnings of that oeuvre which in the present catalogue is associated with the younger Hoskins. For other remarks on the general question of the plurality of hands working under the IH monogram in the 1630s and 1640s, see Murdoch 1978, the Hoskins biography above and other individual entries. \n\n1 Repro.Murdoch 1981, fig.110.\"",
