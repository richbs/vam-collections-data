The original painting belonged to the Duke of Devonshire.\n\nHistorical Association\nThe display of 'False Principles of Decoration', held at Marlborough House, London, in 1852, included a tray, no. 79, which may have been this one. The catalogue explained that the tray had been selected because of the incongruous combination of the copy of the painting with the gilt border and mother-of-pearl decoration. Charles Dickens also described 'that tray with a bit of one of Landseer's pictures on it' in his satirical description of the display, 'A House Full of Horrors', which appeared in his magazine Household Words in December 1852.\n\nPeople\nJennens & Bettridge, the firm run by Theodore Hyla Jennens and John Bettridge between 1816 and 1864, were famous for the range of papier-m\u0192ch\u201a goods manufactured in their factory at 99 Constitution Hill, Birmingham. They also had premises at 6 Halkin Street West, Belgrave Square, London. The company produced a range of products, including writing boxes, trays, fans and larger pieces of furniture such as chairs, tables and sofas.

Woodbridge, Antique Collectors' Club, 2012 (ISBN 978 1 85149 686 0), p. 105, fig. 95\nYvonne Jones believes that this may be the tray criticised by the Department of Practical Art in 1852 and it may be the same design, but is unlikely to be the actual one as it was not acquired until 1920. On p. 103 she quotes the description of such a tray in a critique entitled 'A House Full of Horrors', published in 1852. This attacked a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 tray with had been selected as a specimen of poor design for the Department of Practical Art's Museum at Marlborough House. It was'painted with a bit of one of Landseer's pictures' and was described as:\n'An example of popular but vulgar taste, of low character, presenting numerous features which the student should carefully avoid:- First, The centre is the piracy of a picture; Second, The picture on which the most labour has been bestowed has been thrown away. It is wrong to hide a picture by putting a tea-pot on it: if a picture is wanted it should be placed where it can be seen, and will not be destroyed by use; Third, the scroll lines of the ornament, instead of following the form, are directly opposed to it, and are scattered, as if by chance, anywhere; Fourth, the glitter of the mother-of-pearl is the most prominent feature of the whole, and being spread about, creates the impression that the article is slopped with water.' (this quotation taken from Henry Horley, 'A House Full of Horrors', published in <i>Household Words</i>, vol. 6, 4 Dec., 1852, pp. 265-270)",
