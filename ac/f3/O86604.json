It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nBobbie Comber started his career as a Civil Servant and made his first appearance on the stage at the Theatre Royal Bournemouth in 1904 in a small part in the musical comedy The Geisha.  He spent ten years touring the provinces in musical plays, after which he toured in Chu Chin Chow from 1919 until 1920.  He made his first London stage appearance at the Adelphi Theatre in 1920 when he understudied W.H. Berry in The Naughty Princess and went on to undertake many roles in the West End and on tour, and in films including Elstree Calling (1930) and Lazybones (1935).",
