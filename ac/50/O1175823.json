A ban on Christmas cards to conserve supplies of paper was mooted during the First World War but the idea was abandoned in the interests of maintaining the troops' morale. This propaganda postcard commemorates the death of British nurse Edith Cavell, executed by the Germans in Brussels in 1915 for assisting escaping British soldiers.",
