The tassels hang from short bundles of silk cords in dark pink and white, and bound with wefts of the same colour from the heading.\n[Fringe] Fringe with dark pink and white heading, and long cords of the same colour binding small tassels. The tassels are of white unplied silk covered by a layer of purple plied silk, mixed with a little dark pink.\n[Fringe] Fringe with a deep heading of purple and white silk, with a checkerboard pattern. The latter is largely hidden by sewn-on pompoms of unplied silk in purple, white and a little dark pink. The 2-ply weft of the heading forms a long hanging fringe caught into bundles by short tassels of white and purple unplied silk.\n[Fringe] Short tasselled fringe tacked to a fragment of yellow silk. It has a heading of dark pink and white 2-ply silk, with the weft binding small tassels of unplied silk in purple, at the outside, and white, at the inside.\n[Border] Fragment of a brocatelle border, used to frame silk damask panels on a wall. The design shows a large leaf meander and narrow leaf patterned guard stripes, which are all in purplish pink on a yellow ground. The warp and pattern weft are of silk.",

Bielke, a Swedish Baron, completed his education in Paris in the 1660s, where he developed a deep appreciation of French culture and taste. Later he was appointed Swedish Ambassador in Paris, and purchased rich furnishings which he took with him when sent to Pomerania as Governor-General.\n\nIn 1689 Bielke was charged with high treason and condemned to internal exile in Sweden, remaining for the rest of his life at Salsta. His fine furnishings were installed there, and some time between 1705 and 1713 the Isabella bedchamber was fitted out, so called because of the while silk damask, known as Isabelline, which was used throughout. These purple and white fringes trimmed the white damask upholstery.",
