            "public_access_description": "In its strict sense, the word \u2018miniature\u2019 describes a technique of painting in watercolour rather than the size of a painting. Miniature painting developed as a separate art in the 16th century and in Britain it became predominantly a portrait art. In Continental Europe, however, the taste for portraits small enough to be carried on the person was often met by artists working within very different artistic traditions. One type of \u2018miniature\u2019 (as all such small works are now known), produced more on the Continent than in Britain, was the oil miniature, usually painted on metal, although this example is painted on panel. Most of these oil miniatures are anonymous, since the art of painting small portraits in oil on metal was not one in which leading artists specialised. More often it was part of a repertoire of portrait styles offered by less well-known oil painters. In Spain, however, from the 16th century and into the 17th century, there was a marked taste for these small oil portraits. \n\nThis is a portrait of the daughter of Philip II of Spain by his third wife, Elizabeth of Valois. In April 1599 she married Archduke Albrecht \u2018the Pious\u2019 of Austria and ruled the Spanish Netherlands until 1621. Her father unsuccessfully proposed her as the Catholic heir to the throne of England after the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nOne problem with oil miniatures, which probably became apparent quite quickly, is that the varnish often discolours, which results in a darkened effect, as seen in this oil miniature.",
