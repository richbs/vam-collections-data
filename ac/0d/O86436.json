It was designed in 1930 by Shelley Art Director, Eric Slater, who studied under Gordon Forsyth, an advocate of improvement in industrial design. Slater's 'Vogue' shape, was very modern and made from finely-turned high quality bone china, the geometric form--conical cups with solid triangular handles--was well-matched with a range of dynamic Art Deco patterns, such as Red Blocks, which has the appealing addition of silver lustre. Despite the novel appearance of Vogue, some customers criticised the wide-mouthed cups for allowing drinks to cool too quickly, and complained that they could not put a finger through the solid handle, nor hang the cup by the handle for storage.",
