The text is written in black ink in Prakrit, seven lines to the page between red and gold marginal rules and blue border decoration. The text of a Sanskrit commentary is inserted in small Nagari characters in the margins. Central and marginal string-holes are decorated but not pierced and on the obverse of each folio the central hole only is marked. Folio numbers are written in the lower right-hand corner of the reverse of each folio but are defective from folio 85 onwards due to insect damage. The colophon is written in red on f.92 verso (see Marks).\nThis folio is illustrated with Stulabhadra in his cave, assuming the form of a lion when visited by his sister (above) and they (below) recount their experiences to Bhadrabahu.",

            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThe illustration on this folio shows an episode from the story of Sthulabhadra, who was the disciple of Sambhutavijaya, one of the two successors of Yashobhadra, the fifth head of the Jain monastic order after Mahavira's death. Sthulabhadra had had great success in subduing the passions, an essential goal of a Jain monk, and with mastering the Jain scriptures. Sthulabhadra's seven sisters had become nuns and wished to visit him. They were directed by Bhadrabahu, the other successor of Yashobhadra. Bhadrabahu was an important Jain leader who was said to have composed the part of the Kalpasutra dealing with the lives of the Jinas. In the upper register of the illustration, Sthulabhadra is visited in his cave by his sisters (here, two of the seven are depicted). He assumes the form of a lion in order to demonstrate his powers to them and show them a miracle. However, they were terrified and ran back to Bhadrabahu in the belief that Sthulabhadra had been eaten by the lion. In the lower register, the sisters recount their experience to Bhadrabahu. He explained the truth to them and they returned, though Bhadrabahu criticised Sthulabhadra for this ostentatious performance. The picture is labelled 'si[n]ha gupha' or 'lion's den'. The cave itself is not depicted as such, although caves do appear in other Jain paintings.",
