It was modelled after a Johann Kaendler figure of the 1740s, Kaendler being the talented sculptor who worked for Meissen and who specialised in figures, groups, and wonderfully modelled  wreaths of flowers, clusters of fruit and swinging cupids, executed in the round.\n\nKaendler (1706-1775) modelled this figure after an engraving by Jacques Callot (1592-1635), the French artist who recorded theatrical events that took place at the Medici Court in Florence. This represents Harlequin, a character from the Italian knockabout comedy called the Commedia dell'Arte, or 'artistic comedy'.  This was the popular improvised type of comedy which flourished in Italy from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries and had an impact on theatre throughout Europe, especially France. Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability for improvisation and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest.",
