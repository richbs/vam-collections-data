Moved to London and worked as a draughtsman in the lithography firm of Day & Haghe; studied watercolour printing with Louis Haghe from about 1847, and probably studied at the RA. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, and by the writings and personal encouragement of John Ruskin. Exhibited 30 landscapes at the RA between 1851 and 1885, one at the BI in 1854, three watercolours at the SBA in 1849 and 1850. Travelled with Ruskin to Switzerland in 1856 and 1858; also visited Spain, Italy and Algeria. Not a prolific artist, and little is recorded of him, although he is the leading landscape painter in the Pre-Raphaelite manner along with John Brett and Thomas Seddon. He published a volume of sonnets, <i>AnnusAmoris</i> (1876). Died at his sister's home in Headingley, near Leeds, 23 January 1888. His funeral ode was composed by Swinburne. Groups of his works were exhibited by the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society in 1887, and the RWS Club 1888. Some of his works were engraved. \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 4 February 1888, p154 (obit) and 11 February 1888, p188; <i>Loan Exhibition</i> ...

It is the only known surviving work from Inchbold's visits to Switzerland in the 1850s. \n\nInchbold was in Switzerland with John Ruskin both in 1856 (they are recorded in Lauterbrunnen, near Berne, a village with a famous view of the lung pass, presumably inspiring Inchbold's 1857 RA exhibit 'The lung Pass, from the Wengern Alps'), and in 1858 (at Bellinzona, and at Fluelen which is on Lake Lucerne). Inchbold was in Chamounix in 1857, some 100 miles from Lucerne. Mont Pilatus is to the east of the lake. 'A By-Path to Chamouini [sic]' was owned by the <i>Art Journal</i> and engraved in it in 1871 (facing p264); according to the accompanying text, it was 'painted on the spot'. \n\nStaley points out that 'the effect of the distant mountains, with the outlines crisply drawn and the interiors lost in haze, is close to that in many of Ruskin's own drawings, and the similarity is heightened by the fact that Inchbold's picture looks so much like a watercolour'. Indeed, Inchbold's method here of allowing his white ground to show through in places, the overall thinness of paint, and the matt surface, led the work for some years after its acquisition by the museum to be regarded as a watercolour. However, Ruskin was highly critical of Inchbold's Swiss scenes, and Staley suggests that this may be why Inchbold did not exhibit any paintings (including the present work) in 1858 and 1859. Ruskin's methods of encouragement could certainly be a trial: he wrote to his father on 9 August 1858 that 'It was a delicate and difficult matter to make [Inchbold] gradually find out his own faults ... At last I think I succeeded in making him entirely uncomfortable and ashamed of himself, and then I left him'. \n\nStaley also compares the painting with the earlier Alpine watercolours of J R Cozens, and suggests that it anticipates the work of Ferdinand Hodler. \n\nAfter 1857 Inchbold's work became broader in treatment and more atmospheric; the present work seems to represent 'the end of Inchbold's truly Pre-Raphaelite pictures, but it is the most beautiful of them all' (Staley, pI18). \n\nPROV: Richard Mills (of 34 Queen's Gate Place, SW London); his sale, Christie's 13 April 1908 (46), bought Agnew \u00a310 l0s; ... bequeathed to the museum by James R Holliday 1927 \n\nEXH: Presumably Liverpool Academy 1860 (76, as '<i>Above Lucerne</i>'); <i>Victorian Painting</i> Agnew's 1961 (49): <i>Victorian Painting</i> Arts Council 1962 (32); <i>19th Century English Art</i> New Metropole Arts Centre, Folkestone, 1965 (70)\"",
