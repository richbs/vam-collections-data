Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  The garnets in this earring have been backed with metallic foil to improve their colour.  Red and gold are the dominant colours in Italian traditional jewellery.\n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  One of the most popular designs was the girandole, with three drops hanging from a central boss.  This 17th century pattern survived until the end of the 19th century with traditional costume in Italy.  This earring is typical of the Romagna, although similar patterns were found throughout central and northern Italy in the 19th century.  The original owner of this earring would probably have had a long matching pendant as well.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a35 4s. (the pair) as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
