The cup had to be drained at one go and upturned.\n\nThis cup has silver mounts and lining. Silver featured in all aspects of a gentleman\u2019s daily life, from the morning toilet to an evening at his club.  Personal silver was commonly engraved with armorials or a crest, a name or initials.  The less affluent would aspire to a few small pieces of silver, perhaps a pair of shoe buckles, a snuff box and a watch.",
