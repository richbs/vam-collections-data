She studied with Hubert von Herkomer at his art school in Bushy from 1900 to 1904. By this time she had already begun to practise as a miniature painter; she began to exhibit miniatures at the Royal Academy in 1901. Aristocratic and royal patronage followed, and her later sitters included Prince George of Battenburg and Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1912 Burrell was elected an Associate of the Royal Minature Society. \n\nThis portrait of the artist's daughter Philippa, then aged nine, shows her wearing a fashionable sailor suit. At the time Burrell, a widow since 1908, and her daughter were living in Los Angeles.  \n\nThe painting was presented to the V&A in 1995 by the sitter, Philippa Burrell, along with eight watercolours by her mother.",
