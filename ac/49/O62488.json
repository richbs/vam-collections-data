This linen tablecloth was worked by Ann Macbeth in about 1900. It exhibits many of the characteristics associated with the Glasgow School. Its colouring is muted and it is decorated with stylised roses and leaves appliqu\u00e9 in shades of green and cream linen, outlined in satin stitch worked in shades of white and green silk. The design is simple but graphic, and the materials and method of contruction and decoration are practical and functional.\n\nAnn Macbeth (1875-1948) enrolled as a student in the Embroidery and Needlework Department at the Glasgow School of Art in 1897. Following the retirement of Jessie Newbery, for whom she had acted as Assistant Instructress since 1901, she became Head of the department in 1908. She was a talented embroiderer but her importance, and international recognition, lie in her contribution to needlework education, particularly for children. The system she developed was devised to gradually build a child's skills and teach hand and eye coordination without stifling imagination and enthusiasm.",
