The section of fabric forming the pocket is first folded under around the edges to a depth of two centimetres.

He was not the first leader to wear the style, however, as several famous leaders wore it before Mao himself. In China it is not called a Mao suit but rather a Sun Yatsen suit. Contrary to myth, not everybody wore the Mao suit during Chairman Mao's leadership - it was rather a formal garment- and, among those who did, there were variations in fabric, fit and colour.  It continued to be worn after his death, less so as the years went by. This suit, for a woman, was made at the Red Flag Factory in Shanghai.
