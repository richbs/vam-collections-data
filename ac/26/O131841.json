            "public_access_description": "Carole Robb is one of a number of talented British artists who studied at the British School in Rome during the 1970s. Like Stephen Farthing (b.1950) and Christopher Le Brun (b.1951), she rejected abstraction in favour of a figurative style informed by old master painting. This drawing is part of a group of fourteen works (E.3719 to 3732-2004) that illustrate Robb's journey through Rome to Tivoli, and the Veneto, that she undertook in 2003/4. As such, it constitutes a contemporary uprise to the V&A's numerous Grand Tour watercolours of Italy, dating from the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nThis watercolour of a fountain probably represents one designed by the sculptor Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini (1598 \u2013 1680).  The jutting rocks are similar to those in his \u2018Fountain of the Four Rivers\u2019 in Piazza Navona and other fountains in Baroque Rome.  In this work Robb also focuses on the naturalistic elements of an artificial environment.  The rocks in this fountain are built up with thick bold graphite marks.  Cross hatching and darker areas suggest Bernini\u2019s creation of artificial depth through sculpted stone.  The larger white areas in the top left corner suggest the flanks of a sculpture\u2019s marble base.",
