Mid-16th century. 78 x 135 x 61cm Of panelled hutch-type construction, the chest incorporates two figural panels, carved in high relief on the front, on either side of a representation below the oblong lock plate of the <i>Virgin and child</i> and goldfinch (the figure of the Child is damaged). Pairs of panels, carved in low relief, are at each end. Four Gothic-style saints are depicted under Renaissance-type canopies, namely St Barbara on the left, two unknown in the centre, and St Margaret at the other end. The figures on the front are combined with areas of Renaissance grotesque decoration. The end panels display medallions under birds. Its is noticeable that the decorative carving on the margins of the main panels is incomplete, petering out about one-third the way along the front towards the right-hand side. Also on the end panels one medallion has not been executed, having been only lightly inscribed. The conceit of tent tops above the saints being held up in the beaks of birds is reminiscent of the angels holding up the tent curtains on the early 16th century French altar frontal at Hever Castle (A/2).",
