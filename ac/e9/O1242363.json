Some rare recordings survive from the 1888 festival, these were the first ever recordings made in a live concert environment.\n\nThe Crystal Palace was a vast cast-iron and plate-glass building originally erected in Hyde Park, London, England, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. After the exhibition, the building was moved to a new park in Penge Common, near Sydenham Hill, which was then a suburb full of large villas, it remained there from 1854 to 1936, when it was destroyed by fire. \n\nThis sketch is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",

He was also the Managing Director of The Illustrated London News from the late 1870s until 1900 and became the proprietor of a number of additional publications including The Sketch and The English Illustrated Magazine. \n\nThe Illustrated London News was the world's first illustrated weekly newspaper. Founded by Sir William Ingram\u2019s father, Herbert Ingram, in 1842 the first edition was sold on 14th May 1842 at a cost of sixpence per copy. Building from an original circulation of 26,000 to in excess of 300,000 at its peak, The Illustrated London News remained in print until 2003 and commissioned illustrations from many of the leading artists of the late nineteenth century. Photographs were used alongside illustrations from the late 19th century onwards but illustrations were a major feature of paper until after the end of the First World War.",
