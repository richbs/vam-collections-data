In profile, the  ball-shaped butt (the part next to the suspension ring) and turned muzzle (the open end of the barrel) copies that of pistols made around 1590.  There are three settings for jewels, of which one is empty and two are mounted with emeralds.  Hinged into the stock (the support that holds the barrel) are three toilet instruments: a hooked tongue scraper, a straight spike for picking teeth and a small spoon for removing ear wax.\n\nPeople\nThe first mention of the jewel is in the will of George Pasfield, dated 8 November 1660.  Pasfield was a merchant from Rotherhithe in south London (then in Surrey), who is known to have traded extensively with Barbados from about 1647 onwards.  He commanded his own ship, the Barbados Merchant, and had a share in a plantation in Barbados.\n\nCondition\nThe jewel is dramatic, beautiful and rare, but it suffered badly in a house fire in 1817.  The goldwork survived well, but the enamels, which had a lower melting point, were heavily damaged and discoloured.",
