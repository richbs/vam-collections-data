This was in part a consequence of female reticence but also reflected the preoccupation with inactivity and social status. No working hand would be gloved in silk and furthermore they protected the hand and arms from sunshine, bronzed skin being an attribute of those who worked outdoors. Mittens were popular as they covered the backs of hands, but left the thumb and fingers free to do needlework or play cards. As an inexpensive alternative to leather, many gloves and mittens were made of silk in a variety of colours to complement gowns and other accessories.\n\nThis pair of mittens discoloured cream silk, are typical in shape and construction. They have a separate thumb and come to an elegant point at the back of the hand which was folded back when worn. The gloves are not lined and all the seams have been embroidered with herring bone stitch. Echoing the style of leather gloves, three lines of 'pointing' in slightly darker thread on the backs of the hands, provide the only decoration.",
