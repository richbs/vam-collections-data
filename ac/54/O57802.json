It nevertheless demonstrates the level of sophistication to which the court and nobility of Tudor England aspired.\n\nPeople\nThe Tudors, as fairly recent upstarts, took an almost obsessive interest in their ancestry and their claims to the English throne, allowing their coat of arms to be used in a wide variety of decorative contexts. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) in particular was fired with ambition to raise the status of the English monarchy. He wished to be wholly identified with his people, and latterly with the Protestant cause in its struggle with Roman Catholicism and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nOwnership & Use\nBy about 1500 the wood-fired ceramic stove was widely used in Northern Europe. Built up entirely from deep concave moulded tiles, with both stoke-hole and flue outside the room, such stoves were clean in use. They were eminently suitable for application to a heated bath chamber, such as that excavated at the Tudor palace of Whitehall in London. Though also capable of providing hot water in cisterns, which, like this example, clearly formed an integral part of the stove, they never became popular. The technique of making moulded tiles, probably introduced by German potters working on the Surrey-Hampshire borders, did not take root in England. Despite their manifest disadvantages, open fires continued to be favoured.",
