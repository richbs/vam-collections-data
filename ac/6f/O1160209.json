The background image (showing Bernhardt in a  black cloak and dress, seemingly before a stage curtain) is based on a lithographic reproduction of a hand-coloured woodcut, by William Nicholson (1872-1949). The productions are being presented in association with the company of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance of which Bernhardt was director from 1892-1897.\n\nThe Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de G\u00e9n\u00e8ve is a theatre in Switzerland which opened in 1876. The interior was lavishly decorated and the stage technology installed there was extremely advanced for the period.  It included a stage curtain powered by hydraulic pressure from the nearby Usine des Forces Motrices power plant on the river Rh\u00f4ne. When Bernhardt performed here in 1897 gas lighting was still in use but electric power was installed between 1905 and 1913, allowing the installation of a safety curtain, operated by an electric winch, and the electrical lights for use during performances.",
