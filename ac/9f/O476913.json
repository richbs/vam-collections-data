Two green silk gussets are inserted under the arms and it is trimmed round the neck and down the front to the waist with silver-gilt braid. It has long, full sleeves which narrow to the wrist. \n  \nThe panels of embroidery are as follows: a large oblong panel pointed at the top down the middle of the front; another oblong panel on either side of the opening and two smaller panels at the wrists. All these panels are filled with a variety of geometrical devices. Rosettes and other objects are embroidered in coloured silks along the upper end of the sleeves. \n\nThere is an embroidered band of narrow green and yellow horizontal stripes in alternation, edged with green, down either side of the middle panel. A similar band forms a border to the base of the tunic. A large oblong panel of red cotton has been let into the back to protect it from the hair hanging down. The gilt braid is Czech-Slovak work imported and made in imitation of the old handmade gold braid.",
