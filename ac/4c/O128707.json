It bears the town mark of Abruzzo's modern capital, Aquila. The church of San Bernardino da Siena was built in Aquila in the late 15th century, where the Saint is now buried. The appearance of St Bernadino upon this chalice may reflect the local importance of the church and the relics of this saint.\n\nSt Bernardino of Siena became a Franciscan friar in 1402 and was famous for his zealous preaching. At the end of his sermons he would hold up for veneration a plaque  with the letters IHS surrounded by rays. This plaque became the symbol of Bernardino in medieval iconography. The Saint is depicted on this chalice holding the IHS sign (without rays). St Bernardino died in Aquila in 1444. He was on his way to Naples, preaching as he went. The town of Aquila kept his body as a relic and built a church in his honour.\n\nRelics were very important aspects of the medieval treasury. They gave a town power, status and wealth. Pilgrims would come to visit town's relics and make generous gifts to the churches who kept them. This chalice may be one such example of a gift given to the town of Aquila in honour of St Bernardino.\n\nThe rich materials of gilded silver and enamel show that this object was commissioned by a wealthy person. Cheaper materials, such as bronze or copper were often used for chalices, however the bowl was always made of gold or silver gilt. This was both symbolic, as the chalice would hold the blood of christ, and for hygiene, as base metals were known to contaminate the liquid they held.",

            "historical_context_note": "Medieval Treasuries\n\nChurches and Cathedrals owned collections of valuable objects called Treasuries. Medieval Treasuries contained two types of object; functional items used during the liturgy such as chalices and symbolic items to be revered and admired, namely reliquaries. These objects were made from rich materials such as gold, silver, enamel and gems. Such materials were considered to be the best way to honour God. The development of a treasury relied upon gifts. People donated precious objects as a sign of their wealth and status and to ensure remembrance after death. Some churchmen also sought to obtain treasures for their Church stores. Abbot Suger for example worked hard to improve the treasury at St Denis.\n\nTreasuries signified the wealth and power of their Church. Important relics attracted pilgrims, bringing wealth and status to the area. Many church treasures were kept on public display and used in public processions and festivals, which encouraged a sense of community. Other treasuries however were more closely guarded. The Basel Cathedral Treasury was kept locked in cabinets in the sacristy, only to be used on special feast days. This exclusivity only served to increase the objects' status as important and sacred objects.\n\nA chalice was used during the mass to hold the consecrated wine. Chalices were usually made from gold or silver, although less valuable chalices were made of base metal. The bowl however was always made of precious metal because it would hold the sanctified wine, which Christians believe is transformed into the blood of Christ during the Mass. Precious metals were also used for reasons of hygiene, as base metals could contaminate the wine.",
