The front shows an anthropomorphic rabbit driving a blue go-cart, while another animal holds a stop-watch and chequered flag; the wording reads \n4 TO.DAY Happy Birthday to You !\nwith the large figure four embossed with toys and flowers and printed in gold coloured ink.  The rabbit in the go-cart becomes a pop-up figure when the card is opened, cheered on by other animals; the verse reads:\nYour Birthday be off to a flying start, \nJust like this bunny in his cart,\nHe's on his way - he mustn't be late\nUpon this most important date,\nHe brings a wish to you - from me (deleted and 'us' substituted)\nFor a Birthday happy as can be.",
