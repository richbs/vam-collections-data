He has worked in various media - including kinetic sculpture, film, performance, and the making of environments - but the constant in his work has been drawing, either as a working tool, as a means of recording and observing, or as an end in itself. For Martin, drawing is a system of signs analogous to those of language, and also an intellectual process of enquiry, analysis and proposition. \n\nHis gift of drawings spans his career from the time he was a student in the 1960s, until the 1990s. This drawing was made at the World Chess Championships at the Savoy Theatre, London, in 1993, when Martin was the official match artist. He achieves a nice sense of the suppressed energy and dynamism of the players in this study of an essentially passive and sedentary subject. For other drawings by Martin in the V&A collection see E.315-321-2006",
