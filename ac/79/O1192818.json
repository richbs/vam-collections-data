The scene shows a woodland landscape, in the foreground, to the left a man is kneeling on the bank of a stream; the man is wearing a brown cap and a red tunic, he has a quiver full of arrows on his back and a bow and arrow in his hands. On the right bank of the stream is Imam Reza, he is seated and wearing a white robe and has a yellow ethereal glow around his head and above him two brightly coloured birds flutter. Beside him are four gazelles. In the distance the stream leads to a shrine with a golden dome and minaret, behind are mountains. Large in the night sky is the faint outline a man's head, he has facial hair and is wearing a head covering.",

One day Imam  Reza appeared before a hunter and asked him to allow the mother  gazelle, who he was about to kill to return to feed her fawn. Imam Reza  promised the hunter that if he did, the gazelle would return a couple of  days later and submit to her fate. The hunter did as he was asked and  when she did indeed return he refrained from killing her in reverence to  Imam Reza.\n\nAs a direct descendent of the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Reza is an  important figure for Shi'ite Muslims. In particular Iranian Shi'ites because  Imam Reza is buried in Mashad in Iran. His shrine, which is depicted in the background of this poster forms part of the  biggest mosque complex in the world. Posters celebrating the life of Imam  Reza are very popular and displayed in the home, workplace and religious  buildings.",
