Giovanni restored the palace at Como in 1514 and the chimney piece was probably made at that time. Fireplaces in main rooms were frequently decorated with the coat of arms of the owner and with supporting or Atlas figures on the jambs, like the male nudes shown here (both damaged, and repaired in stone and terracotta; the fig leaves are additions).
