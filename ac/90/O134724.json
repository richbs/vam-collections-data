They were cheap, and the simple 2-D shape was ideal for the bold graphic prints that were so fashionable. Paper manufacturers in the USA predicted that disposable clothing would transform the clothing industry, but in practice, most paper garments creased and tore too easily. High street fashions in conventional fabrics were changing every week, and were at affordable prices too, and the novelty of paper dresses soon wore off.\n\nThe distinctive design on this coat (matching the dress T.34-1992) is reminiscent of the work of the nineteenth century artist Aubrey Beardsley. In 1965 the V&A held an exhibition of Beardsley's work which influenced many fashion and textiles designers in 1960s London.",
