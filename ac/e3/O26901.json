            "historical_context_note": "Rewards: n/a\nForfeits: n/a\nNo. of Players: any\nEquipment required: 52 cards in 4 sets of 13 as follows:-\nnumbered A1 to A13, showing Italian paintings\nnumbered B1 to B13, showing French paintings\nnumbered C1 to C13, showing British paintings\nnumbered D1 to D13, showing German paintings\nrules \n\nRules:\nRULES FOR PLAYING THE GAME OF ARTISTS, No. 1117, COPYRIGHTED 1897 BY THE FIRESIDE GAME CO., CINCINNATI, USA\nThe pack consists of 52 cards, 13 each illustrating the work of the leading artists of Italy, France, England and Germany.  Each set of 13 cards, for the purpose of distinguishing the nation they represent, is designed by a letter:  A (Italy), B (France), C (England), and D (Germany) and the cards of each set are numbered consecutively from 13 down to 1.  Various games may be played with them according to the following rules:\n\nGame of Artists - No. 1\nThis game represents a struggle for supremacy in art, in which Italy and France are allied against England and Germany.  \nDeal seven cards to each player, one at a time, then turn up the top card on the pack.  Whatever country this card represents is said to be `crowned' and the cards of that country have greater value than those of any other country.  When a country is crowned the national card, only, of its allied country is crowned also.  The national card of the country crowned is the highest card in the pack and the national card of the allied country is the next highest.  Thus, if a card representing Itlay is turned up, Italy is crowned, and its national card (A13) is the highest card in the pack.  The national card of France (B13) being next.\nThe cards rank as follows:-  !st national card of crowned country, next, national card of allied country, next cards of the crowned country according to number 12 first, 11 next etc; then the cards of the other three countires, according to number and the country led, the national card of each ranking first (except of the allied country which now belongs to the country), 12 next, 11 next etc.\nThe player at the left of the dealer begins by playing a card from his hand, and each player to the left playes on it.  If possible, each must play a card of the same country as led; if not, he can play a crowned card to take the play, or may throw an unimportant card of any other country on it.  The highest card of the country led takes the play, unless crowned cards have been played on it, in which case the highest crowned card takes it.\nThe winner of this play then leads a card and each player to the left plays on it as before.\nWhen all the cards are played from the hands, the points are counted and a new deal made, the deal passing to the left.\nEach play taken in scores one point and 11 points constitute a game.\nIn leading a high card of an uncrowned country should be led, unless numerous high crowned cards are held, in which case the highest should be led.\n\nGame of Artists, No. 2.   (The corner of the sheet is missing).\nIn this game the French artists have incurred the will of their brothers of the other countries, who no longer desire to associete with them - the (aim of) the play, therefore, being to get rid of the (cards repre)senting these undesirable artists.  The (following rules) must be strictly observed:-  (deal the) pack one at a time to the players. (.......) card C1 should be discarded, or (.....)d should be discards, so that (.....) evenly to the players.  The player to the dealer's left leads a card of any country and each player to the left plays, in turn, on it.  Each must play a card of the same country as led, if he has it.  If not, he may discard a French card on it, since the object is to get rid of the French cards, or a card of any other country.\nThe highest card of the country led takes the play, and the winner leads to the next play, and so on until the hands are played out when the points are counted and another deal is made as before.\nThe entire object of the game is to avoid taking any French cards and to get rid of those held.  A player having a card of the country led and not playing it (playing a card of some other country instead) is fined three points.\nIn playing, the cards of each country rank in value as follows: 1 national card, next 12 and so on down to No. 1 (there being no crowned or allied cards as in game no. 1).\nAfter each hand is played out, one point is scored by each player for every French card he has taken it.  The player first scoring 20 points loses the game, and should be made to pay any reasonable penalty, to be named by the player having the least number of points.  Or, the remaining players may continue the game untill all except one have score 20 points.  This one player then wins the game.\nAs a general rule, during the first part of the play, each player should get rid of his highest cards, the object being to get the hand in such shape that for the latter part of the play or when the French cards begin to be played, no tricks can be taken....cards should never be led unless they.....ones that you are sure some one will.....take them.  Thus, the French cards.....led, as the other players must....card on it and thus take it.\n\nGame of Artists, No. 3.\nIn this game the numbers of the upper left hand corner only are used.\nDeal four cards to each player and turn four face up on the table.  If the player at the left of the dealer finds that by adding the number of any card in his hand to that of a card (or to the sume of two or morecards) on the table he can secure the sum of 26, he immediately makes such play, taking in all the cards in such combination.  Or if he finds that he can add a card in his hand to one or more cards on the table and by letting them lay untilit is his turn again to play can then secure the sum of 26 by adding a second card from his hand, he so plays, and announces that he is `building'.  if he can not make any successful combination, he muyst lay one card on the table.  The player to the left then plays, and so one around the table.  Any player can take a `builded' lot of cards if he can complete the combination and secure the sum of 26 with a card from his hand.\nPoints count as follows:  Most cards 2, most cards of each of the four countries1; national card of England 2; each other national card, 1; lowest French card 1.  Nineteen points constitute a game.\n\nGame of Artist No. 4 - Or Game of Hoo Doo\nAfter shuffling the pack, the dealer should draw one card at random from it and lay it to one side, so that its face can not be seen by any of the players.  The cards are then all dealt out one at a time around towards the left.\nThe players then assort all the pairs out of their hands - two 1's, two 2's, etc without regard to what country they represent, constituting a pair, and lay them on the table.  The player to the left of the dealer then begins the play be drawing from the dealer's hand.  If with the cards drawn, the has another pair, he immediately lays it aside.  The next player to the left then draws a card from the first player's hand and so on round the table.  The player holding the odd card at the end of the play is the Hoo Doo (Old Maid).\n\nGame of Artists, No. 5 - Or Snap Jack\nDeal out all the cards, one at a time, each player laying his cards on the table in front of him, face down.  the player to the left of the dealer begins the play by taking one of his cards and placing it quickly on the table in front of him, face up, so that all can see it; the next player follows, and so on around the table.  Should two pictures by the same artist be turned up at the same time, the first player who correctly calls out the name of the last one turned up, takes all the cards in the two piles on which these cards lie.  The player having the most cards at the end of play wins the game.\n\nthe rules used in the game of Authors may also be applied to this pack.  Deal four cards to each player, and lay the pack on the table, face down.  Each player beginning at the dealer's left calls from any of the other players, by name of artist and title of painting, for a card needed to complete or help complete a book, part of which he holds.  If held by the player called upon, it must be given him, and he calls again as before.  If he fails to secure it, he takes one card from the pack.  The call passes to the left.  The player securing the most books wins the game.  A book consists of the four cards of each artist.  The four national cards also constitute a book.  If all the cards are exhausted from a player's hand, he draws one from the pack.  if the pack is exhausts, the players call from each others' hands only.\n\n\nGENERAL HAPPY FAMILIES RULES\n\nThree or more can play and special cards are normally used, each showing four members of a family, mother, father, son and daughter,  However, variations have been developed to use groups of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to a set.  Also subject variations occur and some are educational, for example The Counties of England.\n\nThe object of the game is for each player to collect as many complete `families' as possible.  \nOne of the players deals out all the cards.  If more than one round is played, the players take it in turn to deal.  It does not matter if some players have one card more than others.\nEach player looks at his cards and sorts them into families.\nIt is important that players keep their cards hidden from each other.  With young children it is a good idea if they can lay their cards out of view of the other players.\nWhen all the players are ready, the person to the dealer's left asks any player, by name, for a particular card (eg Master Baker).  He must already possess at least one of member of the same family, ie Mrs. Baker.  If the person asked has the card, he must give it to the first player, who may again ask anybody for a card of any family as long as he already has one card belonging to that family.  \nHe continues to do this until he fails to obtain a card.  If the person asked does not have the card requested, it is his turn to ask for cards.\nWhen a player collects all the cards of the same family, he puts them into a pile face down in front of him.\nPlay continues until all the families have been completed\nThe winner is the person who collects the most families.",
