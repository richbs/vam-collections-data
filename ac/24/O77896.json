The Derby factory advertised 'biscuit' (unglazed) figures as being 'particularly suited for the Embellishment of Desserts'. However, given its size and frontal pose, this particular figure was probably intended for display on a mantelpiece or other form of domestic furnishing.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Derby porcelain factory first made a figure of Britannia in the 1760s. This was available in three sizes and stood on a tall Rococo base. The factory reissued the subject around 1780, completely remodelling it to bring it more in line with Neo-classical taste. Derby's modeller may have originally adapted the design from a lead garden sculpture by John Cheere.\n\nTrading\n'A large figure of Brittania' was included in a London auction of Derby porcelain held in 1779. This would have been painted in enamels and was bought for \u00a31 3s. An undecorated version like this one would have been more expensive, as the standard of finish had to be higher. The earlier figures of Britannia were priced at 36 shillings in 1763, and enamelled and gilt versions are priced at \u00a32 2s, \u00a31 11s 6d, and \u00a31 1s in an undated factory list.",
