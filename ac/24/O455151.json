Two stylised rosettes, the larger a red chrysanthemum type, the smaller light green and of indeterminate species repeating alternately in a trellis of delicate curving stems with buds and tendrils in shades of green on a dark blue ground.\n\nPrinted in outline in black and in colours from wood-blocks and with details painted by hand. Parts have been 'reserved' by wax-resist.\n\nDiagonal rows of red aster-like flowers placed alternately in the centre of quatrefoil and star-shaped compartments outlined by curving stems which bear fan-like leaves covering the points of contact of the quatrefoils, all in shades of green on a deep blue ground. In the centre of the field is a lobed, diamond-shaped panel of undyed buff cotton printed in yellow and green with a small symmetrical design of flowers on scrolling leafy stems surrounded by a running fillet of the same motives. In each corner of the field is a quarter panel duplicating the central one. Round all four sides, is a wide band of the pattern of the field with red flowers and blue stems and leaves on a green ground edged with fillets of scrolling floral stems in green and yellow on a buff coloured ground, and a counterchange brattishing in green and blue. At each corner of the border is a square panel containing a rose spray in green and a delicate seaweed-like plant with small white flowerets in pink on a red ground.",
