            "public_access_description": "The company was founded by Carl Hugo Pott in 1904 and began as a workshop for damascening knives. Damascening was at that time an art. Today it is not so well-known. However, at the beginning of the last century it was unusual for a hunting-knife, pocket-knife, sword or dagger to leave the factory without its blade having been richly and emblematically decorated. It was only when Carl Pott Jr. joined his father's firm in 1932 that the independent manufacture of Hugo Pott cutlery began.\n\nCarl Pott - Artist and Cutlery Manufacturer (1906 - 1985)\n\nCarl Pott's influence on the business was seminal. Carl Pott completed an apprenticeship as a damascener and galvaniser. During his training he became acquainted with the principles of Bauhaus and Werkbund. From the mid-thirties on he developed a new, progressive generation of cutlery designs. The classic HUGO POTT style grew out of a rigorous renunciation of florid ornamentation and decorative adornment. Its aesthetic charm lies in its sculptural appeal. The essence and purpose of the cutlery remain the starting points for the creative design process.\n\nThis carving set was awarded a silver medal at the Milan Triennale in 1957.",
