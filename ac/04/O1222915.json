The designs, which date from 1615-1635, are from the workshop of Daniel Rabel (1578-1637), the artist responsible for creating costumes for the spectacular entertainments performed by and for the French court. The ballets were based on the social dances of the day, but this was social dance elevated to an elaborate art form which combined choreography with poetry, music, song and pageantry, and included elements of satire and burlesque. The ballets were enormously popular. Most were given at least three performances and all required a great amount of work from their creators and  performers: the Ballet de Tancr\u00e8de of 1619, which used elaborate stage machinery, is known to have had 30 rehearsals. Some professional dancers, actors and singers took part  but the majority of the participants were members of the nobility. Many of these aristocratic amateurs were skilled performers, including the King, who adored dancing and devised some of the ballets himself.\n\t\t \nThe Ballet d'Apollon, also known as the Ballet du Roy, was first performed on 18 February 1621. The music was composed by Antoine Bo\u00ebsset and court poets Ren\u00e9 Bordier and Th\u00e9ophile de Viau contributed verses.",
