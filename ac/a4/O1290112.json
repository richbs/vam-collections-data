Each stanza of the poem is accompanied by a muttering, one or two words printed at the edge of the page, which remain in view as each subsequent page is turned.\n\nThe variously shaped leaves are made up of a complex series of cut out pastel paper shapes that mimick the patterns of a quilt. This diamond-shaped book designed by Claire Van Vliet is in an accordion fold format that can stretch to 105 inches revealing all the stanzas, and is housed within a floral fabric covered box.\n\nThe text, materials and format all combine vividly to examine the notion of the quilt as artefact, elevating its status to that of a complex historical record, rather than merely a pretty, decorative object.",
