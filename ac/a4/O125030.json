The increasing ease of travel meant that many more artists, illustrators, travellers and tourists were able to sketch and paint rapidly in watercolour those places they had previously known only from written accounts. \n\nMen sitting smoking either very long stemmed cherry-wood pipes, or ornate water-filled hookahs, were a common sight in Turkey and Egypt. Travellers were offered these pipes as part of the hospitality they received, and most devotees of coffee-houses were smokers as well. The contrast between the rather plain clay or wooden European pipes and the ornate eastern equipment was often remarked on. \n\nAlfred Hassam was a painter and stained glass window designer who worked mainly in Birmingham.  Very little is known about his life, although it is possible that he later went to work on stained glass in America. When he exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy and elsewhere in the 1860s, his subjects included portraits and historical subjects. This intensely coloured scene seems to show the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites. He is alleged to have visited the Near East, yet it is impossible to say whether this particular scene is set in a studio in Britain or Cairo, or if the smoker is a genuine Arab or a model posed in costume for the occasion.",
