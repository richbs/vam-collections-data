The competition included 1000 dolls, and was judged by the artist Walter Crane (Lady Cave's prize winner's card is attached to the original 1931 departmental register entry at South Kensington).  She comments in a letter also attached to the page \n\n\"Every stitch had to be done [by] the competitor, so certain of the clothing might be better.  I had never knitted in my life neither had I made shoes before.  Still I do think myself the stays are really good also the embroidered collar.  The garments are perfectly right as to date, for there was a very old lady living here at the time & she told me how every garment was made.  The chemise is most utilitarian, as in the day the flaps kept the stays clean & at night it was tied round the neck to make a night gown.. The doll [is] quite like my grandmother Sarah Penfold whose picture it was copied from\u2026I think she was 32 when she was painted\u2026.  She lived to over 80 & died before I was born, in 1856.  My mother told me much of her history & I was always interested in her...\"",
