In 1796 Jonathan Jr. left for America, settling in New York, where he worked with a mason and painter, returning to Heathfield in May 1800. His younger brother John had previously settled in New York, but also later returned to Heathfield. Jonathan Harmer Junior was working at Heathfield, Sussex, from 1800 till about the middle of the 19th century. He made reliefs by pressing a local terracotta into moulds. The squeezes were then touched up by hand and baked in a wood oven. A complete set of Harmer's terracotta reliefs is in the possession of the Sussex Archaeological Society at Lewes. Apparently he used a village bread oven for baking his clay.",

These were inherited by Miss W.T. Lister, Heathfield Park, from her father, and she subsequently (in 1919) gave the present piece, together with cat. nos. 447 to 459, to the Museum, from this stock. Miss Lister also gave three examples of Harmer's pottery to the Department of Ceramics and Glass. A complete set of the pottery reliefs produced by Harmer was given in 1908 by Mr Alexander to the Archeological Museum of Sussex, now Sussex Archeological Society, located at Barbican/Anne of Cleves House, Lewes.\n\nGiven by Miss W.T.
