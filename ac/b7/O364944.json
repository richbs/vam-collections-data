The colours were originally very bright with a central ground of mustard yellow and a border of strong salmon pink between stripes of blue. Some motifs are embroidered with two silk threads of different colours twisted together, for example, yellow and green. \n\nIn the centre, a wreath encircles a shield emblazoned, argent bendy of five, with a double-headed eagle with wings outstretched.\n\nThe remainder of the ground is divided into a lattice-work by chains of linked S-shaped or knots with roses at the intersections. The diamond-shaped compartments contain a series of stylised fruit, gourds and flowers.\n\nThe borders are filled with Renaissance motifs. The side borders contain columns composed of a series of urns and architectural motifs, with dolphins, grotesques, goat-masks, swags of flowers and portrait heads within roundels. The base of each column is inscribed with the name and date. The portrait heads are repeated in the roundels in the centre of the top and bottom borders. They are flanked by scrolling floral forms combined with grotesques.\n\nScattered over the first, second and fifth row of diamond-shapes and within the central wreath are tiny animal and bird motifs including a dragon or griffin, a dog, a lion, a stag and various birds.",
