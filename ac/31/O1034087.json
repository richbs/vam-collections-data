The portfolio includes two works by the Computer Technique Group, plus single works by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer, William Fetter, Maughan S. Mason, Donald K. Robbins, and Kerry Strand. The complete set was acquired by the Museum in 1969, at a cost of \u00a35.\n\nThe original plotter drawing for Return to Square (a) was created by members of the Computer Technique Group in late 1967 or early 1968, at the IBM Scientific Data Centre in Tokyo. The book published to coincide with the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition includes the following information about the artwork: \n\n\"Return to square (a)\nA computer metamorphosis. A square is transformed into a profile of a woman and then back into a square.\nIdea by Masao Komura, programme by Kunio Yamanaka (CTG) (p.75)\n\nThe text goes on to describe a related image:\n\n\"Return to square (b)\" \nOne of two works on this theme. Return to square 9 (a), however, is programmed according to an arithmetic series, and this one is programmed according to geometrical progression\" (p.75)\n\nEarly references to the group include the English language spelling Komura, but the artist himself prefers the spelling Kohmura.",
