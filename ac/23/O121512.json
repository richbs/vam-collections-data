It was produced in Japan from the early seventeenth century and gradually replaced the stiffer silks used previously. Rinzu was a popular fabric for kimono, the T-shaped garment that, from the early sixteenth century, was the principle garment for both sexes and all classes, and was generally woven, as here, with a key-fret and small flower design known as sayagata.  This nineteeth century example was part of a gift of objects given to Queen Victoria by the last-but-one shogun in 1860.",
