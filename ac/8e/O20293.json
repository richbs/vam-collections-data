According to his printed sale catalogue of 1779, the ones of this size were especially suitable 'for inlaying in fine Cabinets, Writing-Tables, Bookcases [etc] of which they form the most beautiful enrichment at moderate Expence.' They were also mounted on wooden and ivory tea canisters, on small boxes for snuff, patches, toothpicks and cards, and were incorporated into cut-steel brooches, bracelets and other jewellery.\n\nTrading\nThe medallions were sold through Wedgwood's catalogues, through export agents in continental Europe, and direct to British manufacturers.\n\nPeople\nThis medallion is one of a group once owned by Ralph Vaughan Williams, the composer, who was a descendent of Josiah Wedgwood.",
