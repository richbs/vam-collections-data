The whole of the centre contains one width of cloth printed with four Indian scenes (repeated in half drop) on a tea ground. The first scene is of a tiger hunt with the tiger attacking a man on horseback and some men on elephants, the second scene is of a picnic under an improvised canopy, the third scene is of men shooting birds of paradise, and the fourth scene is of men (one with a fishing net) by a river. Thirty-six inch repeat, no blue threads. \n\nAround this is a border, printed as such with outer guard-stripes, with a repeat (17.75 inches) of two Chinese scenes, one scene is possibly of a temple and two men of which one is riding a water buffalo, and the other scene is of two men on a river bank with a junk and an elaborate bridge. This border is repeated at the edges of the cover but not reaching into the corners. The border does not have blue threads in the selvedge.\n\nAbove and below the centre piece is a floral panel with roses, poppies, passion flowers, tiger lilies and lilly-of-the-valley, backed by their leaves (no repeat in height). At the sides are other flowers with stiple engraved shading on a tree ground. (Repeat 12.25 inches). This piece is probably roller printed. It includes a bright mid-blue.\n\nThe shapes left at the corners are filled with a patchwork chiefly of one bright print of smaller flowers. The repeat, 12.25 inches, is also possibly roller-printed in blacks and madder colours. No blue threads. \n\nThe colours are in madder reds and pinks, with yellow and blue making double green and orange.",
