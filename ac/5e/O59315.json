The design was executed for a production of  Benjamin Britten's opera \"Peter Grimes\", performed by Scottish Opera at the Edinburgh King's Theatre, August 19th 1968.  The libretto by Montagu Slater is based on George Crabbe's poem \"The Borough\".  The production was conducted by Alexander Gibson; directed by Colin Graham; and lit by Charles Bristow.  The cast included Richard Cassilly as Peter and Phyllis Curtin as Ellen Orford.\n\nThe production was later revived by Scottish Opera in the springs of 1973 and 1980, and by English National Opera North in the spring of 1979.",
