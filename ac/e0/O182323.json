By the late 19th century wallpapers were widely used by all classes, both in homes and in public buildings.\n\nSocial Class\nIn the 1850s wallpapers with pictorial patterns seem to have been very popular and were sold in large quantities. However, art educators such as Richard Redgrave and Henry Cole considered such papers to be examples of bad design because they gave the illusion of three dimensions on a flat wall surface. But despite these faults there were some critics, such as a writer in the trade journal The Builder (1851), who believed that pictorial wallpapers were suitable for 'the houses of the humbler classes of society', especially if the subject depicted was educational. Most papers of this kind have not survived, but it is likely that they were used to decorate social spaces such as railway station waiting rooms, cheap hotels or public bars.",

The correct principles for paper-hangings were said to be:\n\n'1 The decoration of paper-hangings bears the same relation to the objects in a room, that a background does to the objects in a picture.\n 2 It should not, therefore, be such as to invite attention to itself - but be subdued in effect, and without strong contrasts either of form, colour or light and dark.\n 3 Nothing should be introduced which disturbs the sense of flatness.\n 4 All natural objects, therefore, when used as ornament for these manufactures, should be rendered conventionally flat and in simple tints.\n 5 While the decorative details should be arranged on symmetrical bases, these should be so resolved into the minor forms as not to be intrusively prominent.\n 6 Colour should be broken over the whole surface so as to give a general negative hue - rather than masses of positive colour.'\n\nHow the wallpaper exhibited here departed from these principles was explained in the catalogue entries, quoted in the descriptions given above.\n\nOther objects submitted to this derisive treatment included a pair of scissors in imitation of a stork with the beak opening the reverse way, 'glass tortured out of its true quality to make it into a cup of a lily or an anemone' and a gas burner with 'Gas flaming from the petal of a convolvulus'. <sup>9</sup>\n\n<sup>9</sup> <sup>Quotations from a Department of Science and Art, <i>A Catalogue of the Museum of Ornamental Art, at Marlborough House, Pall Mall, For the use of Students and Manufacturers, and the Public</i>, 1853.</sup>'",
