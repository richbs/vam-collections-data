The Museum\u2019s Register of Reproductions notes that these casts were \u201cReceived in exchange from the Academia de la Historia, Madrid, per Se\u00f1or Ria\u00f1o and G. Hodgson, Puerta del Mar, Malaga\u201d. The casts were clearly made at Granada, and shipped from the nearby port at Malaga. Mr Hodgson, a local transport agent, was paid \u00a39. 14s. 6d. for \u201cRail from Granada, cartage, the clearance, the commission\u201d.\n\nThe panels represent ornament from throughout the palace complex, including the Torre de la Cautiva and Torre de las Infantas, but come mainly from the Comares Palace, especially the Sala de las Camas in the royal baths, the Hall of the Ambassadors, and its ante-chamber the Sala de la Barca. This final group is particularly interesting because they predate the fire of 15 September 1890, in which this hall was badly damaged. \n\nA few years after this major acquisition of Alhambra ornament, the casts were put on display in the Museum\u2019s Architectural Courts: the Guide to the Collections of the South Kensington Museum from 1888 mentions that thay were displayed \u201calong the wall within [the Portico de la Gloria]\u201d and near to other examples of \u2018Spanish Moresco\u2019 architecture which the Museum had acquired in 1871.",
