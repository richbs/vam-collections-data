His style is marked by a great clarity in the composition, delineated with sharp lines and shaded with a pale wash, as noticed by the great 18th-century collector Pierre-Jean Mariette who owned a few works by Delaune. \n\nIt has been suggested that the drawings were made first for submission to patrons, which would explained their high degree of finish and refinement, and subsequently engraved for a wider audience. Most of the drawings which correspond closely to the engravings are made in the same direction . This implies that Delaune used to reverse his image on the plate in order to be as close as possible to the presentation drawing (this belies the assertion made by Isle O\u2019Dell, who thought that this drawing was a copy after the print because they were executed in the same direction).\n\nThis drawing shows the death of an Antique heroin sometimes interpreted as Julia, daughter of Titus, but most likely to be identified as Julia, daughter of Cesar and wife of Pompey. The story related by Plutarch in his <i>Life of Pompey</i> (53) corresponds closely to the scene depicted here. A soldier brings to Julia the blood-stained toga of her husband Pompey, which causes her to faint away and regained her senses with difficulty. The allegorical figures of Fortune on the top of the cartouche and of the four Elements on the sides add some dignity to the scene depicted in the centre. \n\nThis design could be related to a series of designs called of the \u2018Tragedy of Cesar and Pompey\u2019, which were executed for the King Henry II in the same period in 1561.\nDelaune made another similar composition of the same subject, a design for a gem-set oval, now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (pen and brown ink with brown wash on vellum, WA 1863.133.265). While the main corpus of Delaune\u2019s drawings can be found in the Ashmolean Museum, the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich and the Louvre, Paris, the V&A owns another design by Delaune: 2243.",
