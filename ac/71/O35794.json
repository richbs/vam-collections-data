There are silver and clear plastic headlamps; a gear stick with a cream plastic knob and a plastic hook at the back so another piece of equipment could be towed. Because there is a small slot where a driver could sit it is probable that the toy came with a driver figure of some sort. \n2. lid of the tractor which fits over the 'engine' area. It can be removed so batteries may be installed. \n3,4. battery ends; a triangular shape of three tubes of clear plastic to house small round batteries. Unfortunately two batteries are stuck in the housing and they have deteriorated. The batteries would power the tractor.",
