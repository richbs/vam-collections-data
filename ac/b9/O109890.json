The ballet was based on the opera of the same name by the great Russian composer, Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The treatment was a very Russian mix of earthy humour and the supernatural, pointing the moral that dishonesty and ingratitude will receive just punishment and satirising military incompetence.\n  \nGeneral Polkan is Commander-in-Chief of King Dodon's army, forced to lead his ruler's futile military enterprises.  In keeping with the ballet's subject and its satirical treatment, his armour is exaggerated and slightly caricatured, as can be seen in the over-large shoulder guards in the form of masks.  Clearly, given the character and the style of his costume, the role did not call for flashy virtuoso steps, but was more a mime or character part, with a burlesqued or humorous slant.",
