            "public_access_description": "This elaborate crozier was made by Nicholas Deutschmann (or Teutschmann), who also executed decorative and architectural sculpture for the Aldersbach monastery in Bavaria from 1762/3 onwards. \nThe crook of the staff is made of two large pieces of ivory from the same tusk fitted together, with smaller additions at the sides, carved with four cherubim, shell-like and auricular scroll motifs, as well as the head and arms of a putto wearing a bishop's mitre, and a further winged putto below. In front of the putto with the mitre is the coat of arms of Cistercian monastery at Aldersbach in the diocese of Passau, Lower Bavaria, and the Holy Spirit, incised with the motto 'IN SIGNUM'. The other full-length putto holds the coat of arms of Theobald Ritlinger, the abbot of the monastery. The eyes of the cherubim and putti are painted, and their playful air seems to act as a witty counterpoint to the solemn liturgical function of the pastoral staff. The body of the staff is composed of three cylindrical pieces of ebony, with decorative fluted ivory fringes, and metal screw fittings. Theobald Ritlinger became abbot of the monastery in 1745; the staff was probably made shortly after that date.",
