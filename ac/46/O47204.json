Clarke's caption identifies the subject: 'A section of the Lingkor or outer pilgrim route that encompassed Lhasa in a five-mile circuit. If pilgrims had come from far it was common to make the entire circuit by prostration, measuring their length on the ground. This normally took three days, but the particularly devout made each prostration keeping the Potala on their right. Circumambulation must always be carried out in a clockwise direction around a sacred structure, which is thereby kept on one's right. Here the Lingkor, skirting the Iron Hill, descended so steeply that prostration became difficult'.",
