His range of subjects was very wide, although he was famous for his depictions of birds' nests - indeed, he was known as 'Birds' Nest Hunt'.  (For an example in this exhibition, see cat.no. 122).  Hunt's special contribution to the history of watercolour concerned technique, his use of 'body-colour'.  Purists would say that true watercolour painting consisted in the use of transparent washes of pigment, but opaque white paint had long been employed to give increased 'body' to pictures.  It could be used in three ways: as an alternative method of rendering highlights from leaving the white or cream paper unpainted, as a mixture with the transparent watercolour to produce an opaque effect identical to the medium of gouache, and - this was Hunt's speciality - as a base ground on which the transparent watercolour was applied to create a greater degree of brilliance.",
