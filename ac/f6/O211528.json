He was the fourth child of Crown Prince Fredrich William of Prussia (later German Crown Prince and then German Emperor as Fredrich III), and Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of the British Queen Victoria.\nThis photograph is an albumen print.  The albumen print was invented in 1850 and was the most common type of print for the next 40 years. It produced a clearer image than its predecessor, the salted paper print. An albumen print was made by coating paper with a layer of egg white and salt to create a smooth surface. The paper was then coated with a layer of silver nitrate. The salt and silver nitrate combined to form light sensitive silver salts. This double coated paper could then be placed in contact with a negative and exposed to the sun to produce a print.",
