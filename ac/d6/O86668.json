They are admired for their monumental size, accomplished potting and well-planned decoration. This basin has a stylised leaf and rosette pattern on the outside. The interior is painted with tulips and vases filled with hyacinths and roses.\n\nIn the mid 15th century, potters in the small town of Iznik in north-west Anatolia specialised in modest earthenware imitations of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. In the 1460s or 1470s, under the patronage of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, they began to manufacture bowls, dishes and other pieces of fritware. These were elegant in shape and decoration, and often very large.",

This example has been painted under the glaze with patterns based on the standard Iznik repertoire of four flowers \u2013 tulips, carnations, roses and hyacinths. This repertoire had developed by the middle of the sixteenth century, but this bowl pre-dates the introduction of relief red to the Iznik palette, which happened a few years after it was made.",
