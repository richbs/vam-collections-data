The gown was constructed with eight panels of silk sewn together, selvedge to selvedge, to form the skirt. The back panel extends to the neck and is pleated.  The two front panels are pieced at the top and gathered into a band, apron style, tying at the back waist.  \n\nThe design shows a vertical mirror image of an orb and bouquet of large dentellated leaves and blossoms.\n\nAlterations: The piecing indicates that the gown may have been made over from a mantua style, using the train to form the added panels in front.  The lining appears to have been reworked at this time.  In the late 19th century, hooks were added down the front edges, the robings unpicked and five casings for boning and seven pieces of bone added.",
