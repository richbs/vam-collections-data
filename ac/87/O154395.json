The raised embossed waves function as a draining-board and make piercing of the blade superfluous. The handle has the same pressed pattern and fish forms as the blade. It carries a heavy longitudinal rib on the top centre side, characteristic of Hope\u2019s use of rib joints in his panel structures. The handle, of roughly triangular cross-section, rises from the rear of the blade on a waved boss structure that matches the blade pattern.",

Panel construction in Britain goes back to the middle of the 18th Century, to power stamping and other processes that came to the fore, especially in the fabrication of Old Sheffield articles. But Hope lends a new dimension to the technique with the beautiful ribbed effects that are prominent in his work. This server is about rhythm and flow. The fish beneath the waves give it a hidden depth; they swim down the handle and into the pool-like blade. This freedom of movement is controlled within a clear geometric form. As Adrian confesses, \u201cSometimes the idea comes from the metal, from the process, sometimes from the many sketches and drawings, but it is the eventual form that should tell its own story.\u201d",
