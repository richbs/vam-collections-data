This is supported by Avril Hart's observation (1) that the structure of the dress, particularly at the junction of sleeves and bodice, appears to have been misunderstood, and that the standing ruff is not correctly placed. \n\nAlthough Foster recognised the poor quality of the miniature, Goulding was the first to dismiss both attribution and identification. He regarded a version in the collection of the Dukes of Rutland at Belvoir Castle, called Frances Cecil, Countess of Cumberland, as the original, and the Beauchamp and the Jones Collection examples (both called Mary Sidney) as replicas of it. Long (2) discussed the rival identifications, preferring Frances Cecil, and in 1930 definitively rejected Mary Sidney. On the other hand, he evidently disagreed with Goulding that the Beauchamp version was a copy of the Belvoir, and listed it in British Miniaturists (3) as autograph. Meanwhile, the Beauchamp Collection had been on loan at the V&A, where the label claimed that the miniature was 'much like' the so-called <i>Catherine Knevet, Countess of Suffolk</i> in the Buccleuch Collection, which Long, again in British Miniaturists. listed also as autograph and which he nowhere else considered as comparable with the Beauchamp/Belvoir/Jones group.  \n \nOf the sitters thus suggested for a portrait of c.16 2 0, Mary Sidney (1561-1621) is clearly impossible; Catherine Knevet (who was already a widow in 1583 when she married the Earl of Suffolk, b.1561) is unlikely, and Frances Cecil (1594 ?-1644) is at least possible. It is not possible to go further, unless to say that this miniature, sharing an impossible identification with the finer Beauchamp miniature, presumably derives from it. \n \n\n\n1 Personal communication, 1993. \n2 Long 1923, p. 82. \n3 Long 1929, p. 226 . \n4 Ibid.\"",
