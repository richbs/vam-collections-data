Any number of persons may play.\n2.  The pack of 36 cards is dealt in rotation, face down, until it is exhausted.\n3.  Each player then sorts his cards into as many families as possible; Mr., Mrs., Master and Miss.  Complete families are placed on the table face down, in front of the player.\n4.  The player on the dealer's left commences to play by asking any other player for a card towards completing one of his families.  He can only ask for a card if he has one or more of that family in his hand.  If the player that has been asked has the card, he must surrender it.  The first player continues in this way until he is refused, then the person who refused him commences to play. \n5.  The winner is the player who completes all his families and has no card left in his hand.\n\n\nGENERAL HAPPY FAMILIES RULES\n\nThree or more can play and special cards are normally used, each showing four members of a family, mother, father, son and daughter,  However, variations have been developed to use groups of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to a set.  Also subject variations occur and some are educational, for example The Counties of England.\n\nThe object of the game is for each player to collect as many complete `families' as possible.  \nOne of the players deals out all the cards.  If more than one round is played, the players take it in turn to deal.  It does not matter if some players have one card more than others.\nEach player looks at his cards and sorts them into families.\nIt is important that players keep their cards hidden from each other.  With young children it is a good idea if they can lay their cards out of view of the other players.\nWhen all the players are ready, the person to the dealer's left asks any player, by name, for a particular card (eg Master Baker).  He must already possess at least one of member of the same family, ie Mrs. Baker.  If the person asked has the card, he must give it to the first player, who may again ask anybody for a card of any family as long as he already has one card belonging to that family.  \nHe continues to do this until he fails to obtain a card.  If the person asked does not have the card requested, it is his turn to ask for cards.\nWhen a player collects all the cards of the same family, he puts them into a pile face down in front of him.\nPlay continues until all the families have been completed\nThe winner is the person who collects the most families.",
