            "public_access_description": "The Christian church has always believed that God spoke through his prophets. They were seen as the deliverers of God\u2019s messages concerning the future, including the Coming of the Messiah. Zephaniah was one of the minor prophets. \n\nStained-glass panels with figures of the prophets bearing scrolls with text are known as \u2018prophet (or messenger) panels\u2019, because they convey these divinely inspired prophecies or messages. \n\nThe Book of Zephaniah in the Old Testament records his prophecies concerning the judgement of all nations on the \u2018Day of the Lord\u2019. The text on the scroll is abbreviated and translates from the Latin as: \u2018On the day of my resurrection I shall gather the gentiles\u2019.\n\nOriginally, the panel would have been placed above or below a larger one depicting a scene from the New Testament. This scene would be related to the prophecy recorded on the prophet\u2019s scroll. Here it would be the image of the Resurrection of Christ. This arrangement is known as a \u2018typology\u2019, by which persons or events in the Old Testament are prophetic symbols of ones in the New Testament.\n\nThe panel was once in a series depicting the prophets. It may have been in the church of St Cecilia in Cologne. The windows from this church have been dispersed and can be found in other museum collections in Britain and in the United States.",
