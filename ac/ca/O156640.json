            "history_note": "The coat of arms are those of Meynell quartering Poyntz and Littleton, for Littleton Poyntz Meynell (d. 1751) of Bradley, Derbyshire, son and heir of Godfrey Meynell, high Sherif of Bradley. In 1720 he married Judith, daughter of Thomas Alleyne of Barbados, and in 1747, Elizabeth Button, a widow (Schroder, T., 1988, p. 184)\n\nProvenance: Littleton Poyntz Meynell, Bradley, Derbyshire.  Purchased from S. J. Phillips, Ltd., London, 1982.\n\nHistorical significance: The shape of this tray is most unusual. It is approximated for example, by a tray, also from 1726, by John Tuite, in the Untermyer Collection, Metroplitan Museum of Art, New York (see fig. 50 in Schroder, 1988, p.186), and a pair of salvers of about 1730 by Thomas Farren, now divided between Colonial Williamsburg (Davis, 1976, cat. no. 129) and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, but in few other instances. The same engraved cartouche appears on a group of pieces dating from the mid 1720s and later, bearing a number of different maker's marks and enclosing various coats of arms; all the engraving appears to be by the same hand. The group includes a salver of 1723 (sold Christie's, Dec. 13, 1967, lot 25), a bottle stand the same year by Augustine Courtauld in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (see fig. 51 in Schroder, 1988, p. 186), a basket of 1737 by Thomas Farren (sold Sotheby's, May 9, 1974, lot 149), and the Untermyer tray by Jodn Tuite. These have strong a affinity to a cartouche that appeared around 1730 and which Charles Oman (1978, p. 80) attributed to Joseph Sympson. Although the latter's work is generally more annimated than this, he handles the scrolling foliage in exactly the same manner, placing the heraldic shield on a murally engraved ground and anchoring the entire composition to a similar strapwork frame (Schroder, T., 1988, p. 184)",
