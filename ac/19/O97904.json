A portrait by Herkmer (sic) of her father, Col. Nathaniel Barnardiston, who was the first chairman of the West Suffolk County Council, hangs in the Shire hall at Bury. \nThe chalice and paten are to be dedicated by the vicar of St. John's, the Rev. John Peach on September 12.\nThe Barnardistons have a long history of service to Suffolk and at various times were domicilied at Kedington, Brightwell and Henny.\nThe late Miss Mary Barnardiston was engaged in social work at a Church of England convent before her retirement to Bury where she was regarded with great esteem. But she was not the last of the line of this ancient Suffolk family.  Two nieces, a nephew, two great-nieces and a great nephew survive.\n\nMEMORIAL CHALICE\n\nJohn Grenville, who lives in a 14th century moated farmhouse at Brockford, where he has a workshop, was asked to design something \"absolutely plain\" for the Barnardiston memorial chalice.\nSo he aimed at complete simplicity, directness of use, and, having in mind its sacrd function in offering the wine at the Eucharist, perfection.\nIn his first design, outside traditional concepts he was led to avoid making decorative additions beyond functional needs and has achieved balance by great skills and artistry. \nThe chalice, which is depicted in this column today, weighs 25 ounces.\nBoth chalice and paten have been suitably inscribed by C.H. Rodgers, the engraver, of St. Stephen's Lane, Ipswich.",

Simpson, V.G. Mallender, Churchwardens\n7th February 1966\n\nTranscipt of the letter from Miss Bertha Barnardiston to Hugh Wakefield, Circulation Department, V&A, 12/02/1966\n\nDear Mr Wakefield,\n\nIt was such a pleasure to meet you the other day, and to know that you would like the Barnardiston chalice and paten for the Victoria and Albert Museum.  I enclose the form of gift, and also a signe renunciation from the vicar and churchwardens at St. John's, Bury St. Edmunds.\n\nAs I told you I offered a memorial to the church which my aunt attended, to be given anonymously and take whatever form they liked.  The vicar asked for a chalice.  Being, it seems, more hallowed than businesslike, he then omitted to ask the Diocesan Chancellor for the necessary Faculty, and omitted to show the designs to his churchwardens or P.C.C.....  The Chancellor first heard of the gift through the press.  If he was highly indignant I wouldn't blame him.  Anyway he refused a Faculty on the grounds of the inscription.  As there is no theological or doctrinal error in the inscription, and it states a simple, accepted, fact, you can draw what conclusion you like.\n\nFor my part, I am content that such a lovely piece of modern craftsmanship should be appreciated by as many people as possible, and give as much pleasure as possible, instead of being shut up in a church safe, and brought out for a small number of church-goers.\n\nThank you for accepting this gift,\n\nYours sincerely,\n(Signed) Bertha K. Barnardiston",

Ashbee, initiated a decisive shift towards fine craftsmanship in church silver. This led to a sharp fall in the standing of commercial manufacturers but provided a steady source of work for many designer-silversmiths that has lasted into the present day. This revival of craftsmanship came out of the Arts and Crafts movement, one of the greatest social and artistic forces of the age. Favouring small studio workshops and simplicity of form, the movement set the pattern for church silver throughout the 20th century, whether for major cathedral commissions or for parish churches.
