C.116 and 117-2011 are of closely similar body, technique and profile, as are Museum nos. C.119, 120 &amp; 121-2011, the profiles of which are shallower. Museum no. C.118-2011 is of similar body and profile to  Museum nos. C.116 and 117-2011, but the back is differently trimmed and the plate is decorated using different materials and techniques. Museum no. C.122-2011 is distinct from all others in the group in its body, method of forming, and in its decoration, and it has been pierced with larger and fewer round holes.",

A contemporary photograph of the interior from an architecture journal shows that the plates were wall-mounted and spaced at intervals across the wall surface. One plate from the group (Museum no. C.117-2011) is visible in the photograph. The group includes plates made both by Margeret Hine and by Nicholas Vergette. Vergette is also known to have made sculptural pieces for shelves in La Ronde. The plates are said to have been acquired from a sale at the time of the closure of the coffee bar. They were subsequently sold through Woolley &amp; Wallis in their sale of British Art Pottery, Wednesday 30 November 2011, lot 482, alongside a larger plate by Hine for La Ronde, lot 481.",
