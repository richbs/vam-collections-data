            "public_access_description": "Card-playing was regarded as a sophisticated and skilful activity in late 18th-century European society, but one that carried a risk when money was at stake. This is one of a pair (with 633-1868) of triangular card-tables that each unfold to reveal a square playing surface.  They were deliberately designed to be small, light and portable, serving as decorative side tables when folded up, but easily moved into the centre of a room and unfolded for games.  The inlaid designs on this table and its pair are similar to those on pieces of furniture produced by Giuseppe Maggiolini, the foremost cabinet-maker in late 18th-century Milan. Maggiolini and his workshop specialised in marquetry scenes inspired by antiquity, based on drawings by late 18th-century artists and designers such as Andrea Appiani, Giuseppe Levati. However, the card tables bear an even closer resemblance to a small number of works signed by the Milanese cabinet-maker Francesco Preda.  The recurring frieze motif of a vase of flowers supported on the backs of two birds and flanked by floral garlands and strings of pearls, is particularly characteristic of Preda's work.",
