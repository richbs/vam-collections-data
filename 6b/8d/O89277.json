The character of Lorenzaccio was based on Lorenzo the Magnificent, a member of the Medici family who ruled the city-state of Florence in the Renaissance period. The title role was played by the actress Sarah Bernhardt, and it is her figure that is seen in this poster. She is dressed in a sumptuous black period costume, with a dagger hanging from her belt, holding a book. Lorenzaccio is lost in thought, pondering how to save Florence from a power-hungry conqueror. The conqueror is represented by the dragon at the top of the image. The muted colour palette of blue, gold and black, combined with the long lean lines of the image, make this poster a typical example of the period and of Alphonse Mucha's work. Although Mucha resisted being labelled an Art Nouveau artist, this print fits into the Art Nouveau style.",
