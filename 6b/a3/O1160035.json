It takes the form of an op\u00e9ra comique with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers, although its authors designated it an op\u00e9ra s\u00e9rie. The libretto, by Charles Guillaume Etienne, is based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale Cinderella. The work was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Paris on 22nd February 1810. \n\nThe actress shown in the print is Alexandrine St Aubin, the second daughter of the singer and actress Charlotte Saint Aubin (1764-1850). Alexandrine was born in Paris in 1793. She made a very successful debut at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau in 1809, and her performance in Cendrillon the following year was equally successful. This was however the only original part in which she distinguished herself and, on her marriage to an actor at the Vaudeville in 1812, she retired from the stage.\n\nThis design appears to be part of a series of prints published by Martinet, Rue du Coq, of which this example is labelled as number 226. It is part of the Harry Beard Collection.",
