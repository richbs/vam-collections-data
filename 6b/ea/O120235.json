The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few were produced after 1905. During their heyday they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. They represented a wide variety of subjects but those of actors and actresses were especially popular.\n\nThis figurine of Ophelia was modelled on a plate in the Tallis Shakespeare Gallery engravings, 1852-1853. Since there was no engraving of Ophelia, the artist adapted the image of Perdita in the engraving of Perdita and Florizel in A Winter's Tale. In  February 1852, around the date of the Tallis engravings, Miss Reynolds played Ophelia at the Haymarket Theatre to Barry Sullivan's Hamlet, but there is no evidence that this figurine was inspired by her performance..",
