The words STELARC are printed in large red letters and spread over the whole print. On the right side the following text is printed in white letters: \n'THE END OF EVOLUTION\nIt is perhaps a natural evolution for a performance artist who creates his art out of his own body to discover the limitations of that body and then go on to redesign it. Stelarc, who recently returned to Australia after living in Japan for nineteen years, considers the human body to be obsolete in today's technological world. He suggests we extend and redesign the human biological form using implanted and attached technologies, to begin our own artificial, hybrid man-machine evolution and mark the end of Darwinian evolution.'\nAnother legend as part of collage: 'Redefining our roles as humans'\nOther words appearing on collage: 'Information', 'Hybrid Symbiosis', 'Dump', 'Brainwaves, Heartbeat, Muscles, Heartbeat, Muscles, Bloodflow', 'Third Hand', 'Amplified Body', 'Male Hero', 'Art and Technology', 'Interactive Command'.",
