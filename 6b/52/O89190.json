Poltrone is a character from the Italian commedia dell'arte, a clumsy soldier. He is often paired with Scaramuccio (Scaramouche). Such small-scale figures were produced not only in ivory but also in porcelain at the Meissen factory near Dresden, and at other porcelain factories in Germany. The probable artist, Johann Christoph Ludwig L\u00fccke, who produced numerous ivory sculptures in Germany and elsewhere, worked as a modeller for the Meissen porcelain manufactory in his youth, and this ivory is clearly related to contemporary porcelain figures.",
