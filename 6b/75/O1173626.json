None of the plays which she mentions have been bought for the New York stage though they have been hawked round for years.

In 1956 she moved to Canada and thence to the United States, where she directed and managed a number of theatres. She returned to England in 1987. The letters are from her theatrical contacts and cover her career from the 1930s to the 1990s. Associated production: Susannah and the Elders. Recipient and actor: Joan White. Duke of York's Theatre, London, 31.10.1937. Performance category: Drama. The play was given three performances at the Duke of York's on 31 October, 7 November and 14 November 1937.
