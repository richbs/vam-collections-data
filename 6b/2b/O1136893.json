Moskowitz (ed), <i>Great drawings of all time</i>, New York, 1962, 1 pl. 1 The scenes correspond closely with passages in Giusto's frescoes in the Baptistery at Padua, completed in 1376. For illustrations of the passages (painted round the lower part of the dome), see Degenhart, <i>loco cit</i>., fig. 4 and Bettini, <i>loco cit</i>., fig. 78. As Degenhart holds, the drawings are probably copies rather than studies, as they faithfully follow the frescoes, and in the scene of ]oseph cast into the pit the figures are cut by the edge of the picture exactly as in the frescoes. Degenhart maintains that the copies are so accurate that they must have been made by an artist standing on a scaffold at eye-level, since the frescoes are too high to be seen well from the ground; and he goes on to suggest that the artist was probably Giusto himself, who made these records for his own use before the scaffold erected for his task had been taken down. Bettini considers that the copies were probably made by a local artist early in the 15th century. The drawings should be compared with those in the so-called <i>Libretto di Giusto</i> in the Museo Nazionale, Rome (for illustrations see A. Venturi in <i>Le Gallerie Nazionali Italiane</i>, 4, 1899, pp. 345 ff. and 5, 1900, pp. 391 ff., and Bettini, <i>loco cit</i>. figs. 40-54). Our drawing does not appear to be by the same hand. The miniatures in the codex at Rome have been the subject of a controversy, and it is not yet settled whether they are or are not by Giusto. In the present state of knowledge, it is difficult to decide whether our drawings should be attributed to Giusto himself or to an early copyist. (For a summary of the controversy over the drawings in the <i>Libretto diGiusto</i> see Bettini, <i>loco cit.,</i> pp. 112-21).",
