It described her marital status and might help to protect her from spiritual harm, as well as showing off her wealth.  Married women wore the most elaborate head dresses, and the largest and most expensive hair pins, to demonstrate their status.\n\nIn some places women wore silver hair bands, called fasce,with their traditional dress, instead of the more usual hair pins.  These hair bands were worn mainly in Lazio (in central Italy), and in Lucania in the south.  This fascia comes from Sicily, and must have been made there, as it carries silver marks which were only used on that island.\n\nIt was bought for 16 shillings as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
