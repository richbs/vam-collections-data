There are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian, and each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  Ring brooches differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  \n\nA bursring is a ring brooch made of sheet silver with a curved front.  They were the commonest type of ring brooch in the west of Norway, and were worn as far north as Lapland.  Similar ring brooches are also found in Sweden, where lozenge-shaped pendants are also common, and in Finland.  \n\nThis bursring was bought by the donor in Trondheim in 1882.  The original pin has been soldered fast to the ring, and there are traces of a modern pin fitting at the back.  It may have been made as a modern brooch in the shape of a traditional bursring.",
