L (as \u201cpossibly Frances Jennings ... by Nicholas Dixon\"): <i>Illustrated London News</i>, 18 April 1942, p. 478, repro.; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24; Murdoch and Murre1l 1981, p. 289, fig. 24; Murdoch 1981, pl. 24d. \n\nThe Buccleuch attribution to Dixon was not accepted by Carl Winter, who catalogued the miniature when it came to the Museum. His formulation, 'more probably by Richard Gibson', was consistent with the belief at that time that later works in this style were by Richard Gibson, the dwarf, as distinct from the earlier works which were by the separate 'D Gibson'. Winter would have had in mind for comparison Lady Charlotte Fitzroy, Countess of Lichfield (Welbeck Abbey), which is one of the miniatures Goulding had regarded as firmly attributable to Richard Gibson (1) and which was hesitantly endorsed as such by Long. (2) \n\nThe present miniature and the Countess of Lichfield are both mounted on a tablebook leaf, a characteristic they share with Cat. Nos 103 and 112 of the Gibson group assembled here. Although the diagonal striation on the present miniature is less marked than in other instances, it is clearly visible, and other technical criteria - the heavily impasted flesh-painting visible under raking light, and the extension of the carnation ground under the hair - are fulfilled. In composition, colouring and finish, the miniature is one of the most beautiful of Gibsori's works, and shows him at his most competitive in relation to Dixon and Cross in the years immediately after Cooper's death. \n\nThe identification as Frances Jennings (c.1648-1730/ 1) was probably made in the trade in the nineteenth century. As noted above, the miniature has 'restorations' and a dealer's frame, and it might have been offered to the 5th Duke of Buccleuch both as a beautiful object and as a portrait of one of his distant ancestors. \n\nFrances Jennings was the sister of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough; Sarah was the grandmother of Mary, the last Duchess of Montagu, whose daughter Elizabeth married Henry, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, in 1767, bringing with her the whole Montagu property. It is possible (though on the physical evidence of the miniature and its framing less likely - cf. Dixon, Cat. No. 159) that the miniature descended through this Montagu connection, for it is credible that Sarah would have owned a miniature of her sister Frances. \n\nFrances was a Maid of Honour, and as 'La Belle Jennings' was one of the Carolean Court beauties, celebrated for her wit and sweet nature as well as for her bright complexion and flaxen hair. She was the daughter and co-heir with her sister of Richard Jennings of Sandridge, Hertfordshire, by his wife Frances, daughter of Sir Giffard Thornhurst, Bart (cr.1622) of Agnes Court, Kent. Her first husband was Sir George Hamilton, apparently a French count, by whom she had three daughters. After his death she married in France in 1679 Richard Talbot, scion of an important Irish Catholic family, a soldier and loyal adherent of the Duke of York. He was in Paris after escaping from arrest for suspected involvement in the Popish Plot of 1678. She and her husband returned to England at the accession of James II, by whom Talbot was promoted Lieutenant General and created (20 June 1685) Earl of Tyrconnell, before being sent to Ireland to take control in the Catholic interest and reorganise the army. In 1686 he was appointed to succeed the 2nd Earl of Clarendon as Viceroy, and, after James's flight from England but while he was still de facto King of Ireland, was raised to a dukedom (30 March 1689). He died 14 August 1691, still defending James's cause. For the rest of her long life, Frances lived mainly abroad, known always as 'the Duchess'. A miniature by Cooper, said to be of her and dating from the mid1660s, is now in the NPG. (3) It has a family provenance, but the sitter does not look like a famously blonde Carolean beauty. \n\n1 Goulding 1914-15, pp. 28, 107,no. 108,pl.XVl. \n2 Long 1929, p. 172. \n3 Repro.
