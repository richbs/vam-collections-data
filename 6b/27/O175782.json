Philip Oliver Goldsmith, a salesman for a small optical firm, founded his eyewear company in London in 1926. In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company\u2019s offices in Poland Street, his sons  A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales. \n\nA. Oliver Goldsmith designed this frame as an alternative to practical eyewear available at the time. In 1965, Mr. Goldsmith noticed that French fashion designer Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges was designing glasses with narrow slits, and decided to use this feature here. Its whimsical   use of the Union Jack received much press attention at the time.",
