Because of the thickness of the cloth, piercing and sewing the quilts was extremely difficult and it is unlikely that any military quilts were made by women.  The mid-nineteenth century was a period when the fashion for colourful and elaborate patchwork was most prolific in Britain and military quilts represent a unique chapter in the history of the craft.  \n\nMilitary quilts are often referred to as 'Crimean Quilts' (Crimean War 1853-56). Brightness of colour is a key feature of quilts made in India, unlike the more subdued colour palette of Crimean quilts.  Erroneously attributed to one William Brayley, research revealed that the quilt was actually made by his father, Francis Brayley, a Private in the 1st, 11th Foot Regiment, who served in India between 1864 and 1877.  Within a month of returning to England, Brayley married Mary Ann Ash, with whom he had one son, William.  Brayley died three years later from tuberculosis.",

This exhibition aims to examine the historic, social and cultural context of British quilt production and seeks to challenge popular misconceptions, including the assumption that quilt making was 'women's work'. This article will draw on published sources and research carried out in a quilt documentation project to consider the role of men in quilt production in the nineteenth century. Using primary sources, it will examine the provision of skills workshops and the learning of trades in the army. In considering both primary and secondary sources, this paper outlines the difficulties in undertaking object-based research that is dependent on oral testimony\nChristopher Breward, 'Sewing Soldiers', in Sue Prichard (ed.), <i>Quilts 1700-2010</i> (London: V&A, 2010) pp.84-7",
