Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of a fox on a cloud. \n\nThe fox in Japanese mythology and folklore is both the God Inari of rice and crop protection as well as a mischievous ambivalent creature that could shape shift into human form. This netsuke depicts the God Inari walking above the clouds and could possibly have been worn as a good luck charm either for success in agriculture or fertility. \n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Shoju.",
