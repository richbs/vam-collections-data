By the first half of the 19th century it was the main centre of production for small silver items in the region.  The silversmiths specialised in popular and devotional jewellery.  They sold their work at markets throughout the Alpine region, and at major international trade fairs all over Europe.  \n\nAlmost everyone in the town was involved in this production.  Many of the filigree pieces were put together by home workers, including women and children.  This kept costs down, and allowed the silversmiths to sell their goods at a low price.  \n\nWomen in the Alpine regions of south Germany, Austria and Switzerland often wore chokers of various kinds, to hide the ugly swelling of goitre, which was endemic in the area.  This clasp was worn at the front of the neck, attached on each side to a light gauze scarf.  It is marked on the back with the unicorn's head mark of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, and the silver mark 13.",
