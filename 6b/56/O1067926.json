Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>73 Unknown Man, formerly called Sir Thomas May</b> \n(d.1650)  \n<b>1653</b> \nP121-1910  \n \n<b>Oval 52 x 42mm</b> \n\nFeatures firmly hatched in brown and sanguine over a thick pale carnation ground; hair in dark brown washes with gouache heightening; collar in white over pale grey-brown wash; sleeves in white shaded with grey; background a blue wash lightened with pale opaque hatching, especially to right; a gold marginal strip; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book.  \n \n<b>Condition:</b> Some fading in the flesh; old retouches in a large part of the upper background and elsewhere.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In gold, centre right: <i>S.C:/ 1653</i> (see D in Appendix 2). Inscribed on the back late inscriptions in pen: <i>S3/210/-</i> and in graphite: <i>S Cooper/ [1653]?</i>  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century copper-gilt locket; the back flat and the straight sides with a half-round central moulding; the bezel turned over the convex glass; the hanger of cast metal set transversely with two side projections and a small button finial; flanked by thin flat wire spirals tapering through six turns. A label on the back of the case inscribed: <i>William [deleted] Thomas May aged 25 by S Cooper</i> in a nineteenth-century hand.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> By 1862, Samuel Addington; sold Christie's 26 April 1883,lot 105; bt Joseph \u00a353.11s.; by 1887, J L Propert; acquired by Salting from the FAS, 1897, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910.  \n \nIn 1861 Charles Sotheby bought from the dealer Thomas Whitehead a Cooper, signed and dated 1653, for \u00a330. In 1862 he exchanged it in part payment for the Hilliard <i>Earl of Cumberland</i> (1) which Whitehead had bought at the Northwick sale in 1859. Addington was another customer of Whitehead, so this may be the same miniature. If so, the label on the case would be an instance of dealers providing identifications for previously anonymous miniatures.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> South Kensington 1862, no. 1909 (as May); South Kensington 1865, no. 304 (repra., although confused with no. 304, Cooper, <i>Earl of Pembroke</i> in the caption); BFAC 1889, p. 99, no. 25; FAS 1897, no. 55.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> L Caldesi and A B Edwards, <i>Photographic Historical Portrait Gallery</i> (1864), pl. XLI; Propert 1887, facing p. 78; Propert 1901, p. 108 and repro. p. 107 (as formerly in his collection); Foster 1911 p. 548; Goulding 1914-15, p. 22 (A Gentleman); Foster 1914-16, vol. Il, p. 78, no. 531 (as' called by Propert Sir Thomas May'); Long 1929, p. 88; Long 1930, p. 13; Foskett 1974, p. 113; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p.10.  \n \nThomas May died three years before this portrait was painted. The sitter is anyway a much younger man than May in 1650, and May, according to Anthony \u00e0 Wood (2) was very fat. His death (13 November 1650) was allegedly caused by 'tying his nightcap too close under his fat chin and cheeks, which choked him when he turned on the other side'. (3)  \n \nIn a note in the department file, Long recorded a 'similar smaller miniature, not signed, in an enamelled 17th-century locket' in the possession of the Revd M de la Hey in September 1929. The signature here, from the year of Cooper's changeover from the separate to the conjoined initials, may be of an intermediate or transitional type. \n\n1 Now Kansas City.
