This bed is part of a group of furniture that has been preserved because it belonged to David Garrick (1717-1779), the celebrated actor. It was made for the guest bedroom at his country villa at Hampton, Middlesex. The room also contained armchairs, a sofa, a dressing-table and a wardrobe, all painted blue and white to match with blue silk upholstery and curtains.",

It was made by the cabinet-making firm of Thomas Chippendale, which Garrick also employed to furnish his London house in the Adelphi. Chippendale supplied much of the furniture for the house, including a green and white painted suite of furniture for Garrick's own bedroom. This cabinet bedstead formed part of a suite of furniture for the 'best bedroom', or guest room, at the front of the house overlooking the Thames. It was intended to look like a bookcase, so that the bedroom could be used as an extra reception room during the day; it was referred to as a 'bookcase bedstead' in a later Chippendale account for a repair, and in a 1769 account for refurbishing the bedclothes. The room also contained armchairs, a sofa, a dressing table, and a wardrobe, all painted blue and white to match, with blue silk upholstery and curtains. Painted furniture is very easily damaged and much from this date must have been discarded; this furniture was preserved, with its associated documentation such as bills and inventories, because of its association with David Garrick.\n\nDuring 19th century the bed was repainted green and white and converted into a wardrobe. It was acquired as such by the V&A in 1917, and it was not until 1970 when the inventory of the villa taken after Garrick's death in 1779 came to light that its true function was realized. The later overpainting has been removed to reveal the original surface treatment.\n\nMr and Mrs Garrick employed their friend Robert Adam (1728-92) to make the necessary architectural improvements to the house, and it was decorated to the height of fashion; Mrs Delany, celebrated artist and correspondent, visited in 1770 and wrote: 'The house is singular...and sems to owe its prettiness and elegance to her [Mrs Garrick's] good taste...on the whole it has the air of belonging to a genius'.",

It is decorated with the attenuated classical motifs characteristic of Robert Adam's later work, unlike the furniture for Garrick's own bedroom which is painted white with light-hearted chinoiserie motifs in green.  Painted decoration rivalled marquetry as a fashionable finish for furniture in the latter half of the eighteenth century.",
