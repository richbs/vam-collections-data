First studied music in the Westminster Abbey choir, then painting with John Hoppner RA; entered RA Schools 1797. Exhibited 129 works at the RA between 1799 and 1844, and 14 at the BI 1806-38. A few early exhibits were portraits, but he soon achieved success with picturesque landscapes influenced by Gainsborough and 17th-century Dutch painting. From about 1815 exhibited principally coastal and marine subjects; his work was compared to that of Aelbert Cuyp and, especially, Turner, with whom he had a close association. Also painted classical landscapes in the manner of Claude, and a variety of genre, humorous, literary and historical subjects. Travelled abroad, notably in 1827-8 following his marriage to Maria Graham, a writer of art and travel books and most famous for <i>Little Arthur's History of England</i> (1835). Elected ARA 1806, RA 1810, knighted 1837. Served on committees for the Government Schools of Design and the National Gallery, and was appointed Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures 1843. Died Kensington 25 November 1844; his studio sales of drawings and watercolours were at Christie's 8-12 May 1845 and 22 June 1863. Although in his lifetime his work commanded high prices and attracted the leading patrons of the day, it was not always well received by the critics, particularly in later years; Ruskin wrote that 'he painted everything tolerably, and nothing excellently'. \n\nLIT: \t<i>Athenaeum</i> 17 December 1831, pp817-8, 30 November 1844, pp1097-8 (obit); <i>Art Union</i> 1845, p15 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p9, 1866, p99, 1896, p334; J Dafforne <i>Pictures of Sir A W Callcott</i> ... nd [1875] (referred to below as Dafforne); <i>Portfolio</i> 1875, p161; DB Brown <i>Augustus Wall Callcott</i> Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (with full bibliography and list of archival sources) (referred to below as Brown) \n\n<b>An Inn Door Near Gravesend</b> \nFA14 Neg GK5683 \nMillboard, 11.5 x 29.9cm (4\u00bd x 11 \u00be ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nIdentified by Brown as one of the '3 small sketches painted of various subjects at Gravesend purchased by John Sheepshanks Esqr.' listed in the artist's manuscript catalogue sometimes in the 1830s, and dated to the years 1830-5. It was certainly in Sheepshanks's collection by 1847, when Dibdin's lithograph was published. \n\nBrown comments that 'despite the precise topographical origin, it is characteristic of Callcott's later cabinet pictures in avoiding any contemporary features and rather evoking the Dutch seventeenth century'. Dafforne doubted it was an English subject, the figures suggesting to him a Dutch scene; however, Gravesend was already associated with the title in the entry for the picture in the 1857 <i>MS Register</i>, and the landscape accords with that of Gravesend, a port in Kent on the River Thames. \n\nEXH: <i>\tAugustus Wall Callcott</i> Tate Gallery 1981 (21) \n\nENGR: T C Dibdin <i>Sir Augustus Wall Callott's Italian and English Landscapes. \nLithographed by T C Dibdin</i> 1847, pl IX, as 'Inn Door on the Roadside' \n\nLIT: <i>\tDafforne</i> p37; <i>Brown</i> p87\"",
