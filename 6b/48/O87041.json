The Buddha sits in the centre under a tripartite bodhi tree, on broad, relatively high socle bearing  a flat relief decoration showing the Wheel of the Law and two gazelles.  The gazelles lie turned outwards, their legs doubled under their bodies, but they eagerly turn back their heads in order to hear the Master.   This scene is a representation of the Buddha's First Serman in the Deer Park of Benares.  The Budha himself is sitted in the lotus position on a cushion-covered socle; his left hand lies on his lap, the right hand was probably raised in abhayamudra.  The head is in frontal position, the eyes are half closed with a noble and reserved expression.  His mild face is framed by softly waved hair- also the folds of the sanghati are rendered in clear lines.   The Buddha is surrounded by a crowd of listeners, some of them reverent, some gay and and excited. On both his right and left, in the foreground, two monks are sitting in meditation on low cushion-covered socles.  The monks faces are raised attentively towards thier teacher.  Unfortunately only the one on the extreme right is preserved undamaged: the mere outlines of the three others are sufficient to establish that their position must have been that described.  Behind the four monks, in the background of the work appear lay listeners, five on the left side and four on the right.  They wear neckbands over their garments, some of them have jewels in their ears.   All have gathered their long wavy hair in a knot over their foreheads with exception of the one in the foreground to the right , who wears his in ringlets. One figure on the top left raised his left arm in joyous excitement.\n\n.",
