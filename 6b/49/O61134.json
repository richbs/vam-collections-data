The Ballerina dances watched by the admiring Moor and an agonised Petrushka.  The ballet was premiered in Paris in 1911 and was first seen in London in 1913 with Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina in their created roles of Petrushka and the Ballerina and Alexander Kotchetovsky as the Moor. \n \nIn Bookseller at the Ballet,  dance historian Cyril Beaumont describes how he was inspired by reproductions of designs for the Diaghilev Ballet and by the atmosphere of the studio of painter Adrian Allinson, to attempt painting himself, trying to copy reproductions of the designs while giving his own impressions of the ballet.  To his surprise, he sold the first of his paintings, of Scheherazade, but Allinson's own reaction to Beaumont's work was 'he paints' rather than 'he is an artist'.",
