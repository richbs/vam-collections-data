The original scheme that included this relief of a two boys and a horse and the others is unknown.\n\nOn acquisition this group of reliefs was thought by the then Keeper of the  Department of Architecture and Sculpture, Eric Maclagan, to be related to the  work of John Bacon the Elder (1740-1799), but he considered them to be  probably early 19th century.
