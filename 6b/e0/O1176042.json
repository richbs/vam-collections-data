The costume consists of a tightly fitting corset worn over a one piece draped silk sleeved and skirted cloak, and is worn with two leather arm cuffs and a wide beaded necklace. It was designed by Julie Taymor (b.1952) and was worn with a mask co-designed by Julie Taymor and Michael Curry (owner and president of Michael Curry Design Inc). \n\nJulie Taymor is a director and designer and has worked with both stage and screen productions. She received two Tony Awards for her work on The Lion King, one for direction and one for Original Costume design, making her the first woman to win a Tony Award for directing a musical. \n\nThe musical of The Lion King is based on the original 1994 Disney film.  Directed by Julie Taymor, the musical debuted on the 8th of July 1997 at the Orpheum Theatre Minneapolis, Minnesota, before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre on October 15th 1997. The London premiere of The Lion King took place at the Lyceum Theatre on October 19th 1999 and the show is still running. \n\nSarabi is the queen of the Pride Lands; mother of Simba, mate of Mufasa and sister-in-law of Scar. This costume is a replica of the original Sarabi costume that was specially made for the V&A.",
