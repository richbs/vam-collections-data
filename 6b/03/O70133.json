They were trials of patterns and stitches that had been copied from others, and records of particular effects achieved that could be recreated again. This is a type known as a band sampler. With the composition of band samplers comes the first clear indication in England of the form being used as a method of instruction and practice for girls learning needlework. This unfinished example is one of a type that combines repeating patterns worked in coloured silks with areas of cutwork (holes that are cut and then bound by stitches) and needle lace stitches, working from either end towards the middle.",
