The story of Maria occurs towards the end, in the chapter 'Maria: Moulines'; Steme had told it before in his earlier novel <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. The passage illustrated is as follows:\n\nWhen we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening in the road, leading to a thicket, I discovered poor Maria sitting under a poplar. She was sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one side within her hand:- a small brook ran at the foot of the tree. She was dressed in white, and much as my friend described her, except that her hair hung loose, which before was twisted with a silken net.- She had superadded likewise, to her jacket, a pale green riband, which fell across her shoulder to the waist; at the end of which hung her pipe.- Her goat had been as faithless as her lover; and she had got a little dog in lieu of him, which she kept tied by a string to her girdle.\n \nThe image of the disconsolate Maria was especially popular in the later 18th century for its display of sensibility. Angelica Kauffmann's painting of the subject, for example, was made widely known through engravings (see the 1779 print by W W Ryland in the British Museum); the painting, according to a note in the Departmental files, was very similar to the present work, which may also be compared with E F Bumey's painting (this does not seem to have been exhibited) engraved by J Heath (repr <i>Connoisseur</i> 1914, p31). J G Strutt exhibited the subject at the RA in 1819. \n\nThe dog is traditionally supposed to have been painted by the artist brother, Sir Edwin Landseer. \n\nEXH: ?BI 1836 (38)\"",
