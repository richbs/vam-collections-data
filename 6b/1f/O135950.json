It was probably enlarged by Henri Leboss\u00e9, Rodin's trusted associate, before being cast in bronze. The modernity of Rodin's approach is expressed here through the block-like forms and the seam lines left by the plaster moulds (these are usually removed). Their presence challenges conventional ideas of 'ideal beauty' and what might be conventionally accepted as a finished sculpture. Rodin's Head of Iris, like The Crouching Woman, was to have great influence on later 20th-century sculptors.",
