This was an important component because the design - 30 centimetres high by 13 centimetres wide -  was to be transformed into a much larger, life-size marble sculpture.  \n\nDesign & Designing\nThe next stage in the design process was to make a terracotta model (see museum no. A.1-1938). This was then scaled up into the full-size sculpture.\n\nThe engraver and diarist George Vertue (1684-1756) criticised the final result in April 1731. He wrote, 'Sett up in Westminster Abbey the monument of Mr Michael Rysbrack, and much to his Reputation tho the design and drawing of it on paper was poor enough, yet for that only Mr Kent is honoured with his name on it.'\n\nPeople\nSir Isaac Newton was a physicist, mathematician and professor at Cambridge University.   His first great discovery was the law of gravity.  His contribution to optics was his recognition that white light is a mixture of coloured light, which can be separated by refraction.   He also invented calculus and the reflecting telescope.  Newton was knighted in 1705.  The poet Alexander Pope wrote an epitaph originally intended for the memorial to Newton.   His couplet, though not used, honoured one of the greatest scientists of all time:\n\n'Nature, and Nature's laws, lay hid in night;\nGod said, Let Newton be, and all was light.'",

A drawing by Rysbrack of the modified design is in the British Museum and his terracota model for the figure of Newton is in the Department of Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nSculptures known to have been designed by Kent are relatively few but are accorded positions of great prominence. In Westminster Abbey Kent designed the monuments to Newton and Earl Stanhope (both carved by John Michael Rysbrack) and to Shakespeare (carved by Peter Scheemakers) and received substantial fees for doing so. He also designed the figures of Palladio and Inigo Jones (carved by Rysbrack) for the entrance front of Lord Burlington's Chiswick House. It is, therefore, possible that he may have designed sculptures for other locations.",
