Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke. \n\nThe netsuke depicts a tanuki, or Racoon Dog, a mischievous creature in Japanese folklore that is often represented with a large stomach and with an equally large bottle of sake. These creatures could assume human form and were harmless and playful tricksters known for their wastefulness of money. As with this netsuke tanuki are often represented playing their stomach like a drum to entice and confuse travellers, monks, hunters and passers-by. \n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Ikko.  During this period there were eleven netsuke carvers who took the name of Ikko.",
