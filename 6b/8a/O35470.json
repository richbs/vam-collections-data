From the hands are a dowel stick and a larger ball painted yellow - these form a rattle. The mouth is an open shape formed by an outer ridge painted red with white inside; the nose is a small button. The eyes are painted green, black and white with black lashes. The hair is black nylon floss glued to the head and styled in two plaits with red and yellow feathers attached. Around the neck is glued a length of sheepskin and around the lower torso a 'skirt' of multicoloured raffia. Around each 'ankle' is a brass ring. Stringing of thread to two metal loops on the head; one to the body back;\none through each hand; one to each thigh. Controls; two plain bars of wood linked by a large metal clip with two metal eyelets each surrounded by coloured plastic caps. \nStamped PELHAM PUPPET on the top which has a large metal hanging hook. This predates the two catalogues and is a subject which would\nbe removed from sale.",
