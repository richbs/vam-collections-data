            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nOne page shows Mahavira's birth, with his mother Trishala and an attendant. It is richly illustrated with gold, green and red paint on a blue and red background, reflecting the importance attached to such manuscripts. One eye of each figure is depicted protruding from the outline of the head, a convention of Indian painting of this date. There is text on the right-hand side and also on the back in Prakrit (IM.161-1914). The other Kalpasutra page has text only (IM.161:A-1914).",
