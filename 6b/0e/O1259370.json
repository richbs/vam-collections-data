Due to the outbreak of World War I, the demolition was postponed and the theatre stood derelict until it was eventually demolished in 1916.\n\nThe Tivoli Theatre, designed in an Oriental style by architect Walter Emden, had opened on 24 May 1890, with 1500 seats.  In 1891 architect Frank Matcham was brought in to re-design the building and the front-of-house facilities, and the seating capacity was increased to 1900. Walter Emden returned in 1910 and carried out further alterations, this time in a Louis XIV style with decorations by J.M. Boekbinder.",
