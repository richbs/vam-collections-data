He brought together a group of artists to design furniture, pottery, glass, textiles and entire schemes of interior decoration.  Their radically abstract style was far ahead of its time and was influenced by developments in contemporary painting. In keeping with the painting tradition, Fry believed that designs should not be too mechanical and should show evidence of the artist's hand.  The workshops aimed to 'preserve the freedom and spontaneity of the original drawing', a particular issue when using the printing process. \n\nThis unique stole, painted by hand in bright clear colours on a silk base, is the epitome of freehand spontaneity. The motif - the peacock - was a staple of the Arts and Crafts movement, although here the colours and the treatment are quite different.It is thought that the stole was given as a wedding present to the dressmaker who worked for the Omega Workshops, after they had closed down.",
