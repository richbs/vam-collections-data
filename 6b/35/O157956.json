The image of the elector \u2013 a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the Emperor \u2013 is set into a jewelled frame so that the wearer, probably someone in his service, could demonstrate their relationship and loyalty to him.\n\nIn the 17th century, new techniques of painting enamels allowed delicate portraits resembling tiny oil paintings to be created. These enamel miniatures were first fashionable in continental Europe, but were particularly in vogue in Britain from the 1720s to 1760s. Enamel portraits performed a wide variety of functions. They were often given as diplomatic gifts or awarded to recognise official service. Some celebrated historical figures, while others commemorated a marriage, or departed loved one. Sitters often commissioned enamel copies alongside an original portrait in oils, in order to have a more intimate and portable version in a robust material.
