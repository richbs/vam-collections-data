            "public_access_description": "This poster was issued during the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism. It is a typical example of the Alliance of Young Democrats' campaign which was characterised by spontaneity and informality. This poster is the work of a young professional designer, but it consciously mirrors the spontaneous, irregular character of graffiti. The design of the poster may well have been triggered by the graffiti-like party logo 'FIDESZ' (an abbreviation of the party name - Fiatal Democrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge), which is repeated in the background. \n\nThe colour orange was a fundamental element in the party's identity. Orange recalls the expression 'Hungarian orange' from Peter Bacso's film 'A tan\u00fa' (The Witness, 1969) that criticised the anomalies of the communist regime in the nineteen fifties.  One of the lines from this extremely popular tragi-comedy rapidly became a catchphrase in Hungary: 'it is a little bit yellow and a little bit sour, but it's ours'. In this phrase, people saw the essence of life under communism aptly formulated. Magyar Narancs (Hungarian Orange) was the title of a newspaper, founded 1989 by young publishers, several of whom became active members of FIDESZ.  Another point of reference was the Polish opposition movement 'Orange Alternative'.\n\nThe designer's little twist in this poster is the word 'M\u00c1S' in the upper left-hand corner. It is the end of the candidate's name, Tam\u00e1s. As a separate word it means 'different' or 'something else'.",
