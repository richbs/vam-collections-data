There is a tradition that during work on this group he was advised by Leonardo da Vinci, whose influence is reflected in a number of small terracotta groups of fighting horsemen and figures in the Museo Nazionale, Florence, and elsewhere. Rustici was also responsible for a series of terracotta roundels with mythological scenes in the Villa Salviati, Florence. About 1527-8 he left Florence for France, where he worked for the remainder of his life.",
