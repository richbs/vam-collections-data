The sleeves are short and straight, and the front waist is low rising in the point at the centre front. There is a straight tie belt stitched at each side seam. The back is straight with no waist seam. A panel and bands of hem-stitching trim the neck opening and are arranged at the sleeve borders. The bodice is trimmed with panels of hand tucking at shoulder and waist, joint by rows of semi-pressed narrow vertical tucks. A panel of similar tucking, from which depend narrow pleats, heads the skirt. The dress is unlined but the back hem is faced back with a matching silk. Ornamented with panels of narrow pin tucks, hand stitched in matching thread.",

The tucks provide a linear vertical patterning which enhances the straight lines of the dress. This is echoed by geometric drawn threadwork on the bodice front, short sleeves and long streamers which tie in a bow at the collar. The low waist seam curves to a point in the centre front from which the calf-length skirt falls in pin tucks and narrow pleats.\n\nJeanne Lanvin was born in Brittany. In 1890 she opened her millinery shop on the rue Faubourg Saint Honor\u00e9 and attracted a large clientele. Lanvin maintained that the exquisite embroideries for which her house became famous were the foundations of her collections. Her inspiration and choice of colours often came from nature or works of art.",
