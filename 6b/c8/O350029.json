The twelve apostles wear loose cloaks and gowns. Christ holds a loaf of typical mediveal prism shape in his left hand and blesses it with his right. He is flanked by six apostles, one of whom St. John leans forward and lies across his lap.  Five other apostles are seated around Christ on his side of the table, including another bearless figure on the left of the panel. Three apostles are seated on square cushions on a bench on the left of the panel and two similar figures are seated on the right. Note the similar medieval benches. A kneeling apostle, probably Judas, holds what appears to be a fish in his hands. The top part of this large and heavy panel is missing, although the break has been carefully trimmed round the heads of the figure of Christ and five of the apostles. There is a break across the centre of the panel. The heads of five apostles in the foreground are either missing or damaged.",
