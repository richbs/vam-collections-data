            "public_access_description": "Eduardo Paolozzi (born in 1924) is one of the most distinguished sculptors of his generation. He has also worked in other media. In this picture he has combined two techniques: gouache and collage. Paolozzi has always been fascinated by the popular culture of advertisements found in newspapers and magazines of all kinds. He often re-presents them in the context of a work of art in the form of cut-out photographs. In Mask with Motor Car he deliberately reduces the human face to an unrecognisable form and has used a navigation chart as a support. This is one of several images of a similar kind created around 1957.", 
            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.206\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Eduardo Paolozzi born 1924\n<i>British School</i> \nMASK WITH MOTOR CAR \nSigned in blue biro and dated in ink lower right <i>Eduardo</i> \n<i>Paolozzi May 1958</i> \nGouache and collage on paper (an unused shipping chart), \n47.8 X 28.4 cm \nP.31-1977\n \nWhile Alice tumbled down the rabbit hole she fell to musing on which latitude or longitude she might have reached, despite the fact that she did not know the meaning of either word, and how she might emerge: 'among people with their heads downwards - the Antipathies, I think -'. In an interview with Edward Roditi in 1959 Paolozzi despairs of the British ever taking Surrealism seriously, unless it is apocolyptic and religious as in William Blake or wonderfully nonsensical as in Edward Lear or Lewis Carroll. If he too were a Carrollean type he might be assured of serious discussion by English critics. \n\nAlice's predicament on entering a strange world full of creative opportunities and her doubts about the public world when she re-enters it could be said to allegorize the position of the artist and public reaction to him. Paolozzi has used a navigation chart as a support in this work. Its demands for information on situation (latitude and longitude), direction, speed and - just on the edge of the sheet - destination, have been satisfied by the image. It is as if the artist is saying: This is where I am, this is where I am heading. Like Alice he might not be quite sure where he will arrive, neither does he know what public reaction will be, but the journey is necessary and positive. \n\n'The intellectual prestige attached to abstract art in Britain' in the 1950s was largely ignored by Paolozzi and his friends for the sake of a more pressing need to establish the significance of anonymous commercial and industrial draughtsmanship and photography. (These interests were sanctioned by Surrealism and Art Brut.) Paolozzi has picked a few examples of such material and thrown them together. This suggests the random way in which we apparently absorb the battery of images which commerce and industry have brought to us. The shape of the painted image, a head, further underlines the artist's concern with mental assimilation. The work is without the close cohesion of parts found in earlier 'Heads' of the 1950s, neither does it have the directly Surrealist appearance of say <i>Psychological Sketchbook</i> (1949) or the film <i>A History of Nothing</i> (1960-2). The style of <i>Mask with motor car</i> appears to be moving toward the more organized agglomeration of spatially independent images which formed the basis of his early Pop screen prints of the 1960s.\n\nRosemary Miles\"",
