Edouard D. Honor\u00e9 (d.1855) headed one of the major porcelain manufactories in Paris.  His frst partnership was with P-L Dagoty and, after its dissolution, he continued independently with a saleroom at Boulevard Poissonni\u00e8re and decorating studios in Montparnasse in Paris, and a factory at Champroux, Allier.  Honor\u00e9 took out several patents for the application of high-temperature coloured grounds and for the development of lithographic techniques.  The School's interest in new techniques applied to design ensured the value of Honor\u00e9's production as examples for the students. This vase is an early example of French interest in the 'Alhambresque' style.  Its design is a loose and personal interpretation of the vases in the Alhambra, the Islamic (Moorish) castle outside Granada, Spain.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nShown in the 1844 Paris Exhibition of Industrial Art, this exotic vase coloured in bright orange and turquoise was purchased from the maker at that time, along with three of his plates. It was acquired, prior to the founding of the Museum, as a model of contemporary French design for students at the Government Schools of Design.\nE.-D. Honour\u00e9 headed one of the major porcelain manufactories, founded by his father in Paris, with a salesroom on Boulevard Poissonni\u00e8re, decorating studios in Montparnasse, and a white ware factory in Champroux. A key figure in the French porcelain industry, Honour\u00e9\u201a regularly won awards, including a silver medal at the 1844 Paris exhibition. His technical innovations were highly regarded; he patented methods for applying high-temperature coloured grounds and decorating porcelain by lithographic printing. Table services by Honour\u00e9\u201a were supplied to the court of Louis XVIII and to three American presidents - Madison, Monroe, and Polk.\nThe ceramics exhibited by Honour\u00e9\u201a at the 1844 exhibition were in the \u201cMoorish\u201d as well as the Chinese and Rococo Revival styles. This example was described in the Museum\u2019s 1846 acquisitions register as \u201cFrench modern\u201d in the \u201cMoorish Alhambra\u201d pattern. While the three Honour\u00e9\u201a plates, which had printed decoration, were of interest because of their technical features, the vase seems to have been purchased primarily because of its style. Its acquisition should therefore be understood in the context of wider interest in \u201cAlhambresque\u201d objects, including Owen Jones\u2019s illustrations of ornament from the Alhambra (cat. 15), and plaster reproductions of details from the building itself (cat. 17). In the 1850s the vase was prominently featured at Marlborough House along with ceramics on loan from the Soulages collection (see figs. 20 and 84). At some point it went into storage where it remained for many years; when it went on exhibition at Bethnal Green in 1970, it was shown in the context of nineteenth-century eclecticism as an illustration of the exotic, thus complementing examples of historicist and naturalistic works.\n\nLit.
