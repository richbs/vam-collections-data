With some decorative filling stitches. The drochel net is worked irregularly and is worked on a slightly smaller scale in the left hand half. The thread used for the pattern pieces is soft and slightly fluffy. This, together with the irregularity of the ground and the ill-drawn, slug-like leaves and scrolled roses, suggest an English rather that a Flemish origin.\n\nThe pattern is open leaving a large amount of plain ground. The lower edge is lined with leaves, flowerheads and ill-defined mounds. Loosely-drawn flowering plants with exotic leaves and flower rise diagonally from the edge to fill the central area, and with smaller sprigs between. The length of the repeat (46 inches, 117 cms) suggests the flounce was originally very long. It is cut at both ends and the left hand end has been turned and whipped over. It is attached to its original bobbin-made heading.",
