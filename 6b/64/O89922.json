It has elegant arabesque gilt handles, each set with an oval amber boss. The form of this cup parallels other mid-17th century silver vessels produced in the Baltic region.\n\nThis cup would have been a prime candidate for a Kunstkammer collection of precious objects. British cabinets of curiosity often differed from the Continental equivalents, known as Kunstkammer or Wunderkammer ('cabinet of art of wonders') in being less systematic, but their contents were similar. Natural curiosities were combined with man-made works of  art, and a particular emphasis was placed on exotic materials, such as amber, ivory and rock crystal, often elaborately worked. Cabinets such as that formed by John Tradescant (which forms the basis of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), and the Paston family at Oxnead Hall, Norfolk, contained numerous shells and mother-of-pearl carvings, as well as objects of antiquarian interest. Collections formed by the king and the nobility generally had a higher proportion of works of art.",
