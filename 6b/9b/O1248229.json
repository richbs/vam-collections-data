It was apparently based on a three day old baby she had seen in a hospital nursery.  Due to its popularity it is often called the Million Dollar Baby.  It was manufactured by a number of German and American companies such as Alt Beck &amp; Gottschalk, J D Kesner and Kling &amp; Co.  It was distributed by George Borgfeldt &amp; Co, USA.  \n\nIt has not been possible to identify which manufacturer produced this particular doll, but it has a red stamp on its chest, which reads, Bye-Lo Baby, Pat Applied for by G S Putman, and the back of the neck is marked Corp by Grace S Putman, Made in Germany.\n\nThis doll originally belonged to a young girl named Lawana June born 3 February 1921, she was born in a small coal mining town of Hinton, West Virgina, United States.  The gift includes a photograph of the girl known as June holding her doll ca 1924-25.",
