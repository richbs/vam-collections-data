            "public_access_description": "The Merrymakers was designed in the 1930s for Louis Marx, an important American manufacturer of tin toys who was in operation from 1919 to 1978. The Marx toy range included tinplate trains, cars, airplanes, guns, action figures, and character toys. A single design was often produced in different colours or with a slightly different action making the range even greater. \n\nThe Merrymakers was one of the most popular Marx products and is highly sought after today. It was first produced in 1931 and originally sold for 91 cents. The toy consists of four mice around a piano dancing and playing different musical instruments. The toy came in three versions. The mouse on top of the piano could either be a conductor or playing a violin, and some versions also included a white arch or marquee on top of the piano behind the mouse. The toy is operated using a key in the side of the piano to wind the mechanism. The mice then move their heads, arms and legs to dance and play their instruments. It has been said that Marx was cashing in on the popularity of Mickey Mouse, who was created in 1928 by Walt Disney, although at the time Marx was not licensed to produce Disney merchandise.",
