Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nThe use of ring brooches to fasten women\u2019s traditional clothing is universal across the region and dates back to late Roman times.  Most of these brooches are penannular in shape, with large decorative heads, but these are of a very basic design which could have been made at any time in the last 2,000 years.  They were worn in pairs, just below the shoulders, to hold the dress together, and were worn upside down, with the pin pointing upwards.  They were often linked together by a chain.\n\nThis design was most common in rural areas in the west of Tunisia, but they are also found across the border in Algeria.  The marks on these show that they were made in Tunisia.",
