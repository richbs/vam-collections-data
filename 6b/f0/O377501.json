Originally Swiss women used laces to hold their detachable white linen collars in place, but by the 19th century they had switched to silver chains.  They wore them in pairs, one on each side of the body.  These chains linked the lower outside corners of the collar, at the front and back, by passing under the arm.  At each end there was a decorative filigree hook, which was attached to the corners of the collar.  \n\nThese two decorative hooks were probably part of such G\u00f6llerketten.  They were described as 18th century, from Berne, when they were acquired in Lausanne in 1870.  The Bernese costume had been adopted as an unofficial Swiss national costume in the second half of the 19th century, and was very popular in the UK at that time for dressing-up.  Large quantities of Bernese-style chains and filigree were imported into the UK from around 1875, many silver-plated.  These are typical of Bernese filigree ornaments of that time, and it is unlikely that they were made much earlier than 1870.",
