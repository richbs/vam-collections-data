The dress is made from a combination of cream silk [possibly artificial] and cream silk satin, with a further panel of cream silk satin, woven with a floral pattern, inserted at the centre front of the bodice. \n\nThe left and right side of the centre front skirt is decorated with narrow vertical bands of cream satin edged with metallic gold braid, these run in vertical zigzags from the waist to hem. This centre of this central skirt panel is also decorated with 3 diamond shaped satin patches edged with gold metallic braid and decorated with further oval shapes in the same gold metallic braid. Straight satin bands trimmed with gold metallic thread also edge the neckline of the dress and the bodice front, running either side of the central woven panel.\n\nThe bodice has long, full cream silk satin sleeves, each fastening at the cuff, with two silver press studs and gathered into a band at the wrist. The neckline is slightly 'V' shaped, but squared off at the centre front . The bodice is lined with a fine cream linen [?].  \n\nA metallic silver cord tie belt runs around the waist. This is finished with one metallic tassel, the pair to which is missing. The fullness present at the hem of the outer skirt is gathered at the waist. Further body has been added to the skirt with a cotton underskirt which is attached to the interior waist and which has an additional deep flounce at the lower section, slightly above the hem.\n\nThe dress is plain at the rear. It fastens with 7 metallic hooks and eyes which run from the rear neck to the rear waist of the bodice, and with one further press stud at the base and dress waist. The underskirt is also secured with a separate hook and eye fastening which sits at the interior waist.",

            "public_access_description": "This girl's costume would most probably have been worn in the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s, in a parade of mediaeval characters during a pantomime, or in the final 'walk-down' -  the closing scene when the entire company dresses in wedding finery to celebrate the wedding of the principal girl and boy, and take their curtain-call. Children chorus members who also danced became a popular aspect of pantomime casts from the later part of the nineteenth century, but the hat  suggests that this costume would not have been used by a dancing chorus girl.\n\nThe costume is not labelled but its pantomime association comes from its provenance. The donor's aunt  Mae Rogers was for many years Wardrobe Supervisor for the British theatrical impresario Prince Littler (1901-1973). She also designed and made costumes.  Prince Littler bought his first theatres in 1931 and by 1947 was chairman of Moss Empires and a director of the Howard and Cynthia theatres chain. Spectacular pantomimes were popular and lucrative productions at all his theatres.  Mae Rogers was responsible for the costumes of upwards of six pantomime productions at a time, as well Prince Littler's touring companies of plays and musicals. She worked out of the Littler offices and West End theatres such as the Aldwych and at times the Lyceum, and having made and supervised the pantomime wardrobes would be called upon to tour the Littler circuit overseeing the productions. Prince Littler had productions running at the Coliseum Theatre, and around the country- at the Royal Opera House, Leicester, the Prince\u2019s Manchester, Streatham Hill, Brighton Hippodrome, Golders Green Hippodrome, Bristol, Cardiff and dozens of other venues. \n\nThe dress was originally trimmed with rows of silver sequins that would have sparkled beautifully on stage, but which suffered from the costume being washed after Mae Rogers gave it to her niece, the donor, as child to play 'dressing up'. Its design combines the traditional styles and techniques of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century with the new trends of the 1930s. The full skirt, gathered at the waist, departs from the sleek and slender shape which defined this era, a silhouette facilitated by bias cut fabrics which flowed around the figure and draped at the hem. Yet the neckline, full sleeves, and tie belt detail at the waist, are clearly linked to the revival of historical styles which occurred during this decade. The costumes for the 1938 film The Adventures of Robin Hood exemplify the enthusiasm for faux Medieval styles. The long, close fitting dresses worn by the heroine proved particularly suited to the bias cut silhouette, their waistlines defined, as with this costume, using plaited cord belts, and the sleeves often extending into long pointed cuffs. The full sleeves and square necklines of the dress are however more closely associated with the Renaissance styles also popular during the thirties, and which were to be revived again in the 1970s by the designer, Bill Gibb.",
