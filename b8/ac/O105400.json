As making chandeliers involved a heavy investment in patterns and moulds, styles tended to be conservative. \n\nUntil the seventeenth century when the English brass industry began to grow, most chandeliers in Britain were imported from continental Europe.  London, Bristol and Chester were early centres for chandelier making. The first recorded Birmingham maker was Joseph Waller in 1766.\n\nChandeliers were made for secular public buildings as well churches. Secular chandeliers often have plain ring finials whilst chandeliers designed for churches are decorated with cherub's heads or doves.",
