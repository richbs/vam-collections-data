He uses traditional copper-plate etching to 'reach backward in Time into that state of darkness and fear'. Through the process of etching, slow and laborious, meditative and intense, he produces detailed designs of the irrational, of secrets hidden in the ancient woodland. His dense images conjure monsters and demons from the undergrowth, from dank ferns, from lichens and mosses, with naturalism mutating into a bizarrely beautiful trompe l\u2019oeil horror. His style has been described as \u2018gothic-pastoral\u2019. He has said \u201cI find the images from the past strangely comforting. The paintings and prints that illustrate Man\u2019s enduring state of fear and terror\u2026 it seems a condition of all times, as relevant then as now. Drawing from these sources \u2013 from the orgies of the Baroque to the detail of D\u00fcrer and Bosch, my work seeks to make and re-make these themes; to give new order to a universal and timeless state of chaos and fear.\u201d",
