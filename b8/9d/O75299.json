            "public_access_description": "Benjamin Turner was one of the first, and remains one of the greatest, British amateur photographers. He began practising photography in 1849 according to the technique patented in 1841 by the British inventor W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877). Turner's photographs were 'contact' printed from paper negatives (known as calotypes) of the same size as the print. He printed them on albumen paper, which is paper that has been floated on an emulsion of egg white containing light-sensitive silver salts. Between 1852 and 1854 Turner compiled 60 of his own photographs, including this one, in what is believed to be a unique album, 'Photographic Views from Nature'. It might have been a sample book, a convenient method for presenting photographs for personal pleasure, and for showing to colleagues or potential exhibitors. It remained in the Turner family until it was bought by the Museum.\n\nThe first monastic settlement at Pershore was founded about 689. Most of the architecture that survives today dates from the 13th century. Pershore Abbey was forcibly closed in the 1530s as part of the sweeping \u2018Dissolution of the Monasteries\u2019 ordered by the Protestant monarch, King Henry VIII. Yet a substantial part of the church building remains in use by Anglicans (members of the Church of England) resident in the parish.",
