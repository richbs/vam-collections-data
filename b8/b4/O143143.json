Folio numbers are written in the lower right-hand corner of the reverse of each folio but are defective from folio 85 onwards due to insect damage. The colophon is written in red on f.92 verso (see Marks).\nThis folio recto is illustrated with the eleven chief disciples (<i>ganadharas</i>) of Mahavira with Indrabhuti in the centre.",

Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThe folio shows  the eleven chief disciples (ganadharas) of Mahavira with Indrabhuti Gautama, the most senior, in the centre. The eleven disciples founded nine schools (in two cases, two of them joined forces to found a single school). Indrabhuti became head of the Jain monastic order after Mahavira's death.",
