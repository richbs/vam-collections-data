The diagonally set front legs and the arched shape to the front rail of this chair show that it was made between 1700 and 1720. We do not know the significance of the lamb and flag carved on the top cresting. The motif is often associated with the Knights Templar and may indicate that the chair was made for use by a religious organisation. In the 1830s the chair was owned by Mr Thomas Baylis who lived at Pryor\u2019s Bank, close to Fulham church in London.

At the time it was thought to be a late 17th century ceremonial chair, possibly from the Middle Temple, which has the badge a lamb and flag, (although the lamb invariably has a halo above its head).  In 1974 Simon Jervis, of the Department of Furniture noticed a resemblance between the chair and a drawing of a chair at Pryor'sbank, Fulham, the house of the antiquary Thomas Baylis, (it was lot 496 in a sale catalogue of 1841, in the library). The house was furnished with antique furniture, but a few pieces assembled from old pieces of woodwork were supplied for the dining room by John Webb and it is now thought that he may well have supplied this piece too. Physical examination of the chair in 1993 suggested a 19th century date but this has recently been contested by Dr Adam Bowett, who suggests instead a date of 1700-1720\n\nHistorical significance: When this piece was acquired from a private donor, without provenance, it was thought to be a genuine late 17th century chair, probably ceremonial, possibly for the Middle Temple which had as its badge a  lamb and flag (which appear in the cresting). In the early 1990s was later debated as to whether it might be more likely to be an antiquarian piece made up from old pieces of woodcarving during the 1830s but Dr Adam Bowett, in the course of major work on furniture makers of the period, suggested that it dated from 1700-1720",

            "production_note": "There has been a great deal of debate about the date of this chair.  It is known to have been in the collection of Thomas Baylis in the 1830s. Thomas Baylis was known to have commissioned modern pieces from the dealer John Webb.  In 1993 Sarah Medlam, John Kitchin and Kate Hay inspected the chair and thought it likely that it dated largely from that time.  However, in 2000, Adam Bowett was firmly of the opinion that it dated from 1700-1720.  He cited the 'corner horsebone' legs and the arched front rail as evidence of this. He was not concerned about the lack of iconographic/design consistency between the front rail, top rail and the cross stretcher.",
