Earle designed to attract patrons, especially the illiterate who could ask others when the performance was to take place. The first woodcut, originally published as an engraving in <i>The Illustrated London News </i>to accompany a review, depicts the moment in Act 3 when Richard's horse White Surrey falls at the Battle of Bosworth Fields and Richard mercilessly continues setting about his enemies, two at a time.  The second shows the comic moment in the equestrian pantomime <i>Harlequin Tom Moody, or Old Towler, the Huntsman and the Goddess Diana</i> when a foxhunt and Derby Day racehorses and hounds became embroiled in the pantomime\u2019s Harlequinade, complete with shocked shopkeepers, a fainting customer, and a chatting Clown and Pantaloon.  Richard III and a comic pantomime on the same bill may seem unusual today but in the mid nineteenth century it was typical circus fare that ensured overflowing houses and repeat business for the next evening\u2019s offering.\n\nAstley's Circus at this date was an enclosed building featuring both a stage and a circus ring. The evening's entertainment was a Farewell Benefit in honour of William Cooke and featured equestrian performances in the ring by Alfred Cooke, Alice Maude Cooke, and Emily Cooke as well as William Cooke himself, as well as an appearance by the Irish comedian and comic singer George Hodgson.",
