The majority of its tapestries are large-scale coporate and public commissions, but there has also been a demand from individual clients keen to own small examples of work.  In order to make its tapestries more widely available, the workshop put together a collection of specially designed small tapestries, to be woven in limited editions.  This is a prototype, woven on a domestic wire rack and serves as a preliminary idea by the designer for a miniature tapestry which the V&A exhibited and subsequently purchased in 1992 (T.2-1995).",
