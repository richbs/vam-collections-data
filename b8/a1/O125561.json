Some, like this, were produced as spill vases, the opening behind their heads meant for storing wax tapers, or spills, used to light the fire. The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved a lucrative market and during the 1840s there were countless other royal figures issued by Staffordshire pottery firms. Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. Since they were produced in moulds, they were relatively cheap and easy to make. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThe identity of this flatback is not known, although the plaid  scarves indicate a Scottish subject, and a similar one was produced representing the poet Robert Burns, with Highland Mary.",
