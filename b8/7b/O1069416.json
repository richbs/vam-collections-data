(See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 78 (as Anon., Anglo-Netherlandish). \n\nThe miniature was listed in the Christie's valuation of the Evans Collection as 'by N Thach.' (1) In 1968, Sotheby's had sold <i>A Woman in Masque Costume</i> (Thach, Cat. No. 43), 'until recently', as Mrs Foskett observed, 'the only recorded work by this artist'. (2) Thach was thus an artist looking for an oeuvre when the Christie's valuer the next year puzzled over this anonymous miniature. Technically, it seems fairly standard for, or at least difficult to differentiate from, English practice.
