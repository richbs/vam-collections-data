More specifically it is an oil sketch in grisaille (monochrome painting), a technique often favoured by Rubens. (See for another example of the same technique by Rubens in the collection D.1399-1891). \n\nThe final version of this design was the high altarpiece installed in 1620 for the church of the R\u00e9collets in the city of Antwerp, which is now in the collection of the Museum voor schone Kunsten, Antwerp. The \u2018modello\u2019 is thought to date from the previous year.\n\nThe sketch, which presents an early stage in the development of the design of the altarpiece would have been shown to the monks to illustrate his proposed composition of the New Testament story (John 19: 31-4) in which St. Longinus, a Roman soldier, pierces Christ\u2019s side with a spear to ensure he is dead; hence the title \u2018The Coup de Lance\u2019 (in French: \u2018hitting with a spear\u2019). Clerical patrons often specified the content of altarpieces, even when not paying for them. In fact, the donor of the piece was Nicolaas Rockox, one of the most cultivated connoisseurs and collectors of the time, and a lifelong friend of the artist as well as one of his early patrons. \n\nIt is possible that this 'modello' was not the only preparatory study for the final altarpiece. Other sketches in other medium may have been involved in the process. However, this sketch may have been the first as it remained in the collection of the monastery.\n\nRubens adopted the practice of creating \u2018modelli\u2019 from 16th century Venetian artists and from Federico Barocci (1533\u20131612) whom he discovered while sojourning in Italy between 1600 and 1608 and introduced in Antwerp upon his return to the Netherlands. \n\nRubens was an influential painter in the 17th century, contributing in many ways to shape the new Baroque style. He is known to have adapted the Venetian use of intense colours to the dramatic attitudes and asymmetrical groups developed in Roman Renaissance art. The years 1620s can be considered as the pinnacle of his creative activity and the present sketch is therefore representative of both his personal artistic practice and the development of his very personal style which became the hallmark of Flemish Baroque art.",
