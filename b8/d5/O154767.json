The technique originated in the Deccan, in the city of Bidar from which it takes its name. Objects are cast from a zinc alloy which is then decorated with silver or brass, or both, and then blackened by means of the temporary application of a mud paste. When the paste is removed, the dull grey surface of the zinc alloy has changed to a deep black, by means of a process that is still not understood. By the mid-19th century other centres in India, notably Lucknow, were also producing bidri wares.",
