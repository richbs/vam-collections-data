These bowls  were chiefly used for soft foods like soup and porridge, but those made specifically for use as bleeding bowls have a series of graduated rings cut into the interior to indicate the quantity of blood to be taken. \n\nUse\nIn the past blood-letting was widely used as a universal cure for most illnesses, and even today it can prove  beneficial for certain types of heart disease.  The blood was taken from a vein in the arm.  The recommended quantity to be taken varied from two or three fluid ounces up to twenty fluid ounces in extreme cases (57 or 87 millilitres up to 114 millilitres).\n\nHistory\nMost of the pewter bleeding bowls which survive date from the 18th century.  However, they were shown in pewter manufacturers' catalogues until comparatively late.  One authority writing in the 1920s noted that 'blood porringers, cupping dishes and bleeding dishes are still made in pewter'.",
