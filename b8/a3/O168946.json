            "public_access_description": "In 2004 the designers Ed Barber and Jay Osgerby were selected to design new furniture for the restoration of the De La Warr Pavilion at Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, an iconic Modernist seaside leisure centre designed in 1935 by Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff. Perhaps the most striking feature of the new chairs was their tomato-red colour, which the designers picked up from the original plywood chairs by Alvar Aalto that had originally furnished the pavilion.  The tubular arms and pierced decoration were responses to the severe Modernist forms of the building, notably the tubular metal hand rails on doors and staircases. Barber Osgerby reasoned that the chairs would mostly be seen from behind, clustered around tables, so gave the backs a twist with floor-level stretchers, creating complete loops of metal for the rear legs. About 80 red chairs with upholstered seats were supplied for the restaurant, and the same quantity without upholstery was used on the outdoor terraces. The manufacturer, Established & Sons, subsequently mass-produced the chairs, but the only red versions like this were for the De La Warr Pavilion.",
