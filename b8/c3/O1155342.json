This game educates children on black heritage and creates pride in black history and culture. Identity Toys Inc, who were based in Milwaukee, specifically made toys for black children and these were intended to make African-American children more aware of their past and culture. The company began its promotion of black culture through toys in 1989. Other identity based games in its collection include 'Black ABC', 'Word Up\", a fast paced black history word game, and 'Black Explorers', a board game that introduced children to Black pioneers.\n\nThis game was previously owned by Bob Dixon, along with similar types of games. Robert Turnbull Dixon was a poet, author and peace activist. He grew up in County Durham and was very interested in assessing what affects and influences young people as they grow up. These types of games are valuable as we do not have anything like this within the collection, and they were an important part of his research for the books he wrote.",
