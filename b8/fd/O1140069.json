Blairman & Sons and the decorating firm of Lenygon & Morant collaborated on interior design during this period. Together, they integrated new d\u00e9cor and antiques for clients as in this interior design. It includes antique furniture, such as the wall-mounted clock and the chair which would have been supplied by H. Blairman & Sons.",
