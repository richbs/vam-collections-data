It is also very decorative. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe case is decorated with coloured and natural straw arranged in a geometric pattern. Straw-work was practised in Europe from the 17th century, and straw-covered boxes were brought to England from Holland and later France. They were usually made in pine and covered in pictures made from natural and dyed pieces of straw, assembled at different angles to  maximise the light values. Straw-work boxes are fragile and easily damaged.\n\nOwnership & Use\nAntimony cups were expensive but also toxic. The outer and inner cases would have protected the cup itself but also the users from contact with the dangerous metal.",
