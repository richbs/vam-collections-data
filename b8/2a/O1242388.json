It shows a chorus rehearsal for the pantomime &lt;i&gt;Puss in Boots&lt;/i&gt;at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1897. The sketch was drawn by the artist, Clare Atwood (1866-1962) and has been signed by her in the bottom left hand corner. \n\nBy the mid nineteenth century pantomime had become extremely popular and began to be associated with children and Christmas. Drury Lane was famous for its lavish Christmas pantomimes with their elaborate sets and costumes. By the time that Arthur Collins (1863-1932) took over the management of the theatre in 1895 Drury Lane had become known for spectacular productions which cost vast sums of money, had hundreds of performers, and lasted for up to five hours. Collins remained in post throughout the first decades of the twentieth century and is credited with the introduction an interval to his epic productions.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
