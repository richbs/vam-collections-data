            "history_note": "Historical significance: Francesco Zuccarelli started his career as an engraver and draughtsman, studying in Florence and Rome. After the move to Venice in his thirties, he devoted himself to landscape painting. This new interest led to an important friendship with the Welsh painter Richard Wilson (1713/4-1782), with whom Zuccarelli exchanged paintings. Zuccarelli's style is less precise and topographical than Canaletto's, and distant from the stormy temperament of Marco Ricci (1676-1730). His landscapes are idealised and lyrical, based on the Italian countryside. The subject-matter is often hard to define, and it remains secondary to the sentiment of the pictures.\n\nAlthough Zuccarelli received considerable support from the local Venetian nobility, his most important patron was certainly Joseph Smith (1674-1770), the English consul in Venice and an enthusiastic collector of contemporary Venetian art. This relationship led to many projects, including paintings for the decoration of Smith's villa. In 1746 the consul commissioned Zuccarelli and Antonio Visentini to paint a series of 11 English <i>Palladian</i> buildings in imaginative settings. Visentini used engravings from Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus (1715-25) to depict the buildings he had never seen. He was also partly influenced by original buildings of Palladio in Italy. Zuccarelli provided the generalised Italianate landscape settings and figures. The series includes depictions of Lindsey House (London, Buckingham Pal., Royal Col.) and Mereworth Castle, Kent (Windor Castle, Berks, Royal Col.). This group of paintings is an important document of the English enthusiasm for Italian art at the time. \n\nSmith's interest in Zuccarelli led him to travel to England, where he achieved considerable success. Unusually for his time, Zuccarelli produced landscapes for the market rather than for individual patrons.  This strategy proved effective and Zuccarelli's reputation rose enough for King George III to commission the Finding of Moses (1768; ?exh. RA 1773; Windsor Castle, Berks, Royal Col.). He became one of the founding members of the Royal Academy of Arts, where he exhibited landscapes. \n\nThe prestige he gained in England led Zuccarelli to the post of the director of the Venetian Academy. Hugely popular as an artist during his lifetime, he died in 1788 in Florence. At the time his art had gone somewhat out of fashion, criticised for the frivolity and extravagance of its Arcadian fantasies. \n\nThis drawing represents a pastoral scene set in an idealised location among the mountains. The content and style are typical of Zuccarelli's work, which was hugely popular in England during his life-time. Such pastoral and mythological scenes are set in an Italianate landscape that appears outside time. Collections in England have many landscapes by  Zuccarelli, for example: <i>Landscape with Europa and Bull</i> (Windor Castle, Berks, Royal Col.) and <i>Landscape with Cattle and Figures</i> (National Gallery, London). Although this drawing cannot be related directly to any painting, Zuccarelli's practice led him to copy motives and figural ensembles across many works. In this case, the general distribution of figures as well as the pose of the girl in the foreground can be related to a painting, currently in the Bresciani collection (Spadotto 2007, 199).\n\nThe technique of drawing in ink and black chalk with many tinted washes occurs in other drawings by Zuccarelli, for example in the British Museum (reg. no. Pp,5.147 and 1918,0309.1)\n\nReferences\nSpadotto, F.,<u>Francesco Zuccarelli</u>, Alfieri: Milan, 2007.",
