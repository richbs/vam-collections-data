They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nNormandy has the greatest variety of crosses, some so elaborate as to be almost unrecognisable.  The croix de Rouen is one of the most extreme.  It is made from a lozenge of pierced metal, strewn with small faceted crystals and set with large conical mounts containing more of the same.  It is a comparatively late design, probably derived from the croix de Saint-L\u00f4, and was only worn in the Rouen area.  It was worn with a matching circular slide.\n\nCroix de Rouen were only made of gold, or gilt metal.  They could be very large (over 15cm long), as many tourists reported in astonishment, although this one is only 10cm in length.",
