The fullness of the gown falls from the neck, and is given the effect of a high waisted bodice by the use of gauging (which is visible inside the waist centre front); the line of the waist is reinforced internally with narrow cotton tape which also provides casing for the waist drawstring.  The neck, waist and sleeve tops are embroidered with white dots.  The sleeves, which have three rows of horizontal tucking, can be caught up for decorative effect by a pair of loops of white cord inside each sleeve which connect through the sleeves with a pair of bound and embroidered buttons attached to each of the sleeve tops.  The sleeve and skirt edges are decorated throughout with shadow-work produced by making slits in the edges, folding the fabric between the slits to the wrong side in the form of triangles, and stitching them down.  The garment opens the whole length of the back, and fastens at the back of the bodice with five bound and embroidered white buttons; there are also drawstrings at neck and waist.",
