Like many other games, Dominoes was popular in both Italy and France before spreading through mainland Europe to England. \n\nThe principle behind Dominoes where cards, small bars or tiles must be arranged into sequences, was used as a foundation for various different games. Many of these were produced, particularly in the 19th century, for both children and families to play with. This is an early set and its tiles are unusual in that the spots go up to nine rather than the usual six.",
