It was purely ornamental and may have been made for display in Wedgwood's showrooms.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe bowl and foot of the vase were thrown separately on a potter's wheel and the handles were moulded. The parts were 'luted' (joined together with wet clay) before firing. The bowl is about as large as it is possible to throw in a single section, as the depth is equal to the length of a person's arm. It is the largest encaustic painted vase by Wedgwood.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe krater is a copy of a 4th-century BC Apulian (south Italian) vase from the collection of Sir William Hamilton (1730-1803). Wedgwood copied the decoration from the published catalogue of Hamilton's collection, not from the original vase. He repeated the engraver's mistake in running the wave pattern under the rim from left to right.\n\nPeople\nThe vase was formerly in the collection of the glassmaker Apsley Pellat (1791-1863), who bought it at the sale of Wegwood's warehouse in St James's, London, in 1829.",
