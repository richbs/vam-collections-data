Buddha is shown sitting in the centre, before the entrance of the cave, deeply sunk in meditation.  His sanghati covers his hands.  His face is greatly damaged.  His usnisa is scarcely stands out.  A large nimbus spreads in the cave background.  Indra is shown with his lowered right knee, with the left leg bent upright.  Indra is wrapped in along cloaklike garment covering his left shoulder and the left upper arm.  His jewellery consists of  a double bracelet, a necklace and ear pendants.  Two further figures  are seen approaching the cave.  In the foreground there stands the Gandharva Pancasika, Indra's musician who may have been sent in advance  to announce the arrival of Indra.  With his right hand he touches the chords of the harp that he lifts up with his left.   The face is damaged.  Behind Pancasika there follows  another smaller figure of a worshipper.",
