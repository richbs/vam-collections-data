Before he shared the bread and wine with his disciples (the Institution of the Eucharist), Christ announced that one of them would betray him. \n\nAfter the meal, Jesus and the Apostles, minus Judas, went to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane outside Jerusalem. Judas arrived with soldiers and identified Jesus by kissing him, so that they knew whom to arrest.\n\nAll four Gospels record the treachery of Judas. He had gone to the high priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, offering to inform them where Christ could be arrested in exchange for money. The high priests believed that some of Jesus\u2019s teachings were blasphemous and they were eager to capture him.\n\nThis small panel for private devotion was painted in enamels. In the middle of the 16th century new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as \u2018enamels\u2019 were used to paint directly onto the glass. To produce the colours, metallic oxides were added to a glass frit mixture. The resulting colour range included delicate blues, greens and reds, as we see here.",
