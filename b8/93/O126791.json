Three of his brothers, George, Edmund and Frederick James, were also artists. Chiefly known as a watercolourist, he travelled in Wales and the Lake District in 1802 and 1803, working with Comelius Varley and Joshua Cristall: founder member of the OWS 1804. Artist on Lord Amherst's embassy to China 1816, resigned, and worked as portrait painter in India and Burma 1817-25. Visited Italy 1828-9. Exhibited 103 works at the RA between 1804 and 1857, 42 at the BI 1806-56, 32 (including five watercolours) at the SBA 1828-53, and 154 at the OWS. Subjects principally landscapes in Wales, Lake District, south and west England, Italy and China. Died Kensington, London, 16 December 1857. Redgrave believed 'his oil pictures show much excellence, and though rather yellow in tone and monotonous, the effect of sun and sunshine is admirably expressed'. There are fourteen watercolours by him in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: Redgrave <i>Diet</i> and <i>Cent</i>; DNB.\n\n<b>Self-Portrait</b> \n870-1894 Neg GK1964 \nCanvas, 50.7 x 45.7 cm (20 x 18 ins) \n\nInscribed on back as below \nGiven by Mr H Allnutt (the artist's nephew) \n\nInscribed, possibly by the artist, on a piece of wood on the back of the stretcher: 'given/to/Jane/Havell/portrait/of W /Havell/January/1841/Painted in/1830 by/W. Havell'. To judge from the amount of painted canvas folded at the back, the work was reduced on every side, and particularly by several inches at the bottom, by Messrs Haines in 1895. According to the Departmental files, another portrait, similar in pose but nearly life-size, was recorded in the collection of a Miss Havell some 20 years ago. The pose is based on that devised by Raphael in his portrait of 'Bindo Altoviti' (National Gallery of Art, Washington DC) and used many times in the next 300 years, most notably by Ingres in his self-portraits; a more immediate inspiration for Havell may have been English examples such as the self-portrait by Reynolds now in the Tate Gallery (painted c1773, Tate 306).\"",
