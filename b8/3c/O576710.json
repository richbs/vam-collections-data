Julie Ribault (b.1789) was one of the victims in a sensational double murder case that took place on 31 December 1850, which was reported on by Charles Dickens in the January 1851 edition of his periodical, <i>The Household Narrative of Current Events</i>. Mlle Ribault, reported to be 61 years of age, and her companion, Mlle Lebelle (aged 72), were murdered on New Year's Eve, 1850, by M. Lafourcade, a clerk to Monsieur Thierry, who managed the magazines <i>Petit Courrier des Dames</i> and the <i>Journal des Demoiselles</i>. Mlle Ribault was paid 200 francs per month for her fashion designs for M. Thierry's publications, which was delivered at the end of each month by Lafourcade. In December 1850, Lafourcade embezzled Mlle Ribault's money, and when she drew this to the attention to M. Thierry, he sent his clerk to her with a copy of the receipt for that month, not realising that Lafourcade had forged Ribault's signature on it.\n\nOn December 31st 1850, Lafourcade attacked Mlle Ribault and her companion, Mlle Lebelle in their apartment on the Rue Bourbon le Chateau, battering and stabbing Mlle Ribault, and battering and murdering Mlle Lebelle by stuffing her mistress's cap down her throat so that she choked to death on it. Afterwards, Lafourcade returned home as normal. However, he had failed to kill Mlle Ribault outright, and when she regained consciousness several hours later, despite her extensive injuries, she used her own blood to write \"Commis de M.T...\" (The clerk of Monsieur T) on the chimney-piece.) When the bodies were found, Mlle Ribault was still alive, and was able to identify her assailant to the police commissary. Lafourcade was arrested at M. Thierry's office, where he had gone as usual, believing he had gotten away with murder. He was subsequently found guilty and sentenced to death, being executed on May 15th 1851 at the Barri\u00e8re St. Jacques.\n\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam (February 2013)",
