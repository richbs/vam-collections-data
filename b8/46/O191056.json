            "public_access_description": "This poster was issued for Rural Solidarity - the Independent Self-governing Trade Union of Individual Farmers. There were at least two versions of the poster - one of them had the name of the organization printed on it. The original independent trade union Solidarity, established in August 1980, was associated with industry workers. The government did not want to permit the establishment of a corresponding countryside union, but the farmers eventually managed to found Rural Solidarity in May 1981. The image combines the symbol of the cross and an ear of corn in reference to the farmers. The symbol of the cross is very common in Solidarity iconography. It refers to the significant role which the Catholic Church played in the struggle for democracy since the Polish Pope, John Paul II was elected in 1978 and started to actively support the anti-communist movements. The symbol of the cross also has much to do with a Polish romantic spirit going back to the 19th century when Poland was under the rule of foreign powers. This sensibility began to flourish again during the struggle against the communism. One of the most significant elements of this romantic spirit was a discourse of martyrdom and a strong belief that Poland was a \u2018Christ of the nations\u2019, which means that it suffers in order to redeem other nations.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
