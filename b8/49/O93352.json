Its embossed strapwork, pinnacles, ball feet and winged cherub heads are all secular in character. Its function however was religious. Inside, the box has a red damask silk lining and a cloth of beige silk with a colourful floral embroidery and an IHS-monogram with three nails representing Christ's Passion. Such caskets were known to contain the Eucharist or relics. Some examples of this type have a lid surmounted by a cross.",
