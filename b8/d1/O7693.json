At the front are three opening doors.\n[Tray] Moulded beige plastic forming a tray with handle on one long edge and raised sides\n[Box] Cardboard printed in colours to show both photographs and illustrations together with the titles in three languages and the maker's details.  Marked 4 years, there has been a label, printed in English, glued to the bottom indicated a minimum of 3 years.
