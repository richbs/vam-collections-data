            "public_access_description": "This sewing pattern was made in the early 1950s by Economy Designs. It includes the pieces and instructions needed to make a stuffed toy about 45 cm tall. \n\nThe character depicted on the front of the envelope is a 'golly'. This character was first featured in Florence Upton's book 'The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg' (1895) and was based on the 'Blackface' performance tradition. Towards the end of the 19th century, the character gained popularity and toy makers saw potential. Golly dolls and soft toys were mass produced, and the character was used in advertising campaigns, as well as appearing in the work of other authors. \n\nHowever, the term 'golliwog' was appropriated as a racial slur, and the character itself was recognised as promoting negative stereotypes. From the 1960s onward, the golly has gradually been withdrawn from children's culture. This figure is interesting as a historical representation of race, and can help us to understand how toys and games can actively shape identities and attitudes in children and adults alike.\n\nEconomy Design produced sewing patterns for a range of character toys including Little Red Riding Hood. The patterns, printed on recycled paper during the period of austerity after the Second World War, were designed to suit a variety of fabric types and colours to use up any scraps that were available.",
