This piece shows Samson lying horizontally, while a manservant hands over a pair of shears to Deliliah to cut off his hair. There are three pieces executed in a very similar style also with scenes from the history of Samson, in New York, Florence and Paris.\nThis pieces must have belonged to a set of tablemen with scenes from the story of Samson, opposed by pieces devoted to the legend of Hercules. The facial features of all three figures, but especially those of Delilah, should be compared with the similar figures in the historiated initials of the St Albans Psaltar of c. 1130 and other ivories of English origin, such as V&A Inv. Nos. A. 20-1961, 375-1871 and A. 27-1977. Its border decoration is not to be found on any other gaming piece.",
