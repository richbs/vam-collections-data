The school in Jaipur, Rajasthan, produced pottery in the late 19th century after one of the pupils of Bhola, who was a chief artist of Delhi fritware, introduced the technique.  As the pieces were made of a mixture of feldspar and starch they could not be thrown on a wheel but were either raised by hand or shaped in a mould.  Vessels of this kind were known locally as 'martaban' jars, after the fort on the coast of Burma through which they were imported into India/ They were first copied in Delhi and later at Jaipur, where their designs were heavily influenced by contemporary European taste.",
