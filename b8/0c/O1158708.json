These influences feed into his jewellery, which is all about form, rhythm and colour. He has explored a wide range of materials, from paper to gold, encompassing industrial materials such as acrylic, steel, aluminium and titanium. For him machine technologies and hand skills can both bestow beauty, thus traditional craft and modern technologies coexist without loss to one another. This bangle is an example of computer aided modelling linked to CNC forming and profiling. The interplay of its layered rays combine with the glow of the matt blue acrylic and the partially-obscured gold wire within (whose chemical symbol 'Au' gives it its name) to form a piece of intense visual and technical satisfaction.",
