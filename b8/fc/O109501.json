            "public_access_description": "This bag was one of a series of four that Deller designed to be given away at the first Frieze Art Fair in London, October 2003. The bag functioned as a work of public art, randomly disseminated by those who visited the Fair, but it is also as an example of art sponsorship, and a souvenir of a major art world event. \n\nCarrying a bag, especially a bag that has an brand or a logo, has become a facet of an individual\u2019s self-image and public identity The carrier bag is a portable advertisement, not only for the product but also for the person carrying it - giving the rest of us some clue to their wealth, life-style choices, and aspirations. Here Deller exploits this idea of the bag as a status symbol. It is a tool for communication, a means of transmitting coded signals to other members of our 'tribe'. The bag has become an emblem, like a badge of belonging, that connects us to those who can read the signs. But at the same time, Deller's bags, with their intriguing messages, act to tantalise or bemuse the uninitiated.",
