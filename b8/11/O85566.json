The window was dedicated to scenes from the Life of St Thomas Becket. Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered in the cathedral in 1170.\n\nThe decoration on this panel is similar to that in a medallion window now located in St Martin's Chapel in the Cathedral.\n\nMuch of the surviving medieval glass was removed from the cathedral in the mid-1800s and replaced with copies. Some of the original glass was moved to different locations within the cathedral and some panels were stored in various glaziers\u2019 workshops, and eventually sold off to private collectors. \n\nOver time, some of these panels from the cathedral have come into museum collections in Britain and in the United States.",
