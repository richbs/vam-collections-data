The woman is seated in the centre of a low stage wearing a dress patterened with the repeated image of a hand holding a heart with light emanating from it. Printed on the dress are the words 'EVERYTHING IN MY HAND I BRING'. She has her hands on her lap and her right index finger is held between the index and thumb of her left hand. She wears a necklace with a flower pendant. On her right hand side as small child presses itself against her leg looking out to the upper right hand side of the image with an upset look on its face. The child wears a floral dress and shoes. Behind them drawn curtains flank a painted backdrop depicting a wealthy colonial-style interior drawing room looking out onto a veranda and garden. The painted scene includes a rug, a small table with flowers on top, curtains, French doors, a Greco-Roman column, a tree and bushes. Below the sitters lies a vinyl mat with a repeated motif of a rose.",

            "public_access_description": "Born in 1929, Ghanaian photographer James Barnor documented the shift towards modern living as experienced by black people in both Africa and Britain. In the early 1950s, Barnor set up Ever Young studio in Accra\u2019s Jamestown district where he took photographs of the local community at key stages in their lives. Although intended as personal mementos, the Ever Young photographs also recorded the changes occurring in Ghanaian society in this period. \n\nThe modern interior depicted in Barnor\u2019s studio backdrop contrasts with the traditional clothing of the woman seated with a child beside her. Through this photograph the sitter could communicate her participation in the modern, independent aspirations of Ghana regardless of personal circumstances. The fabric of the woman\u2019s dress, patterned with open hands and the statement \u2018Everything In My Hand I Bring\u2019, highlights this sentiment. In 1957, Ghana became the first nation in Sub-Saharan Africa to gain independence from the British Empire. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired five photographs by James Barnor as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
