            "physical_description": "Three-tier court cupboard with carved stiles and mid-section, and inset marble plaques and applied wood masks on the upper section. The front stiles carved in the form of a lion with a rose (upper left), unicorn and thistle (upper right), and gryphons (lower). With a replaced bottom section and feet.\n\nThe top section is constructed from oak rails and hardwood top (8mm thick). The side rails are of oak with a thin veneer and hard-wood mouldings (these are very sharp). The masks appear to be of oak. Note that on the freize, the ornament is cut short abruptly (a suspicious sign). The rear stile figures break above the level of the middle shelf, continuing right up into the underside of the top section, whereas the front figures end abruptly under oak blocks. \n\nThe mid-section: rails of oak(?), with 6mm hardwood veneer and inlay. As on the top level, the rear stile balusters run right up into the section above, where the front figures end under an oak block. Note how uncomfortably the front carved figures are postioned in relation to the corners of the section, suggesting strongly that carved figures from another source have been set inappropriately into the structure. The mid-section retains replaced oak drawer supports suggesting that the current shelf front (which is a single length of carving with mitred ends) may have been a drawer front, presumably with the ends of the front overhanging the drawer sides (and this French? form may not be characteristic of England c1600-30.\n\nThe lower shelf and feet all V&A, c1964.\n\nThe timbers from which this cupboard is made were identified by the Forest Product Research Institution (ca.1964): \n\nupper section front carved supports; lower section front carved supports; lower section \nrear turned supports - bulletwood (Manilkara bidenntata, a tropical hardwood plentiful in S America).\nupper section rear carved supports; horizontal mid-section - Satin\u00e9 (Brosimum paraense, a tropical hardwood from the Guianas and northern Brazil)\nhorizontal base section (added by the V&A conservation dept. 1964) - Honduras Mahogany (Swietenzia macrophylla). \n\nThe materials used for the horizontal top section inset with rectangular pieces of marble surrounded by inlaid borders of contrasting woods has not been identified (9/2009).
