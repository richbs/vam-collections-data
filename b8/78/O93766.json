From 1952 to 1955 he was at the Royal College of Art, London, after which he was appointed as design consultant to J. J. Wiggin of Sheffield, manufacturers of stainless-steel tableware. Throughout his career he undertook many industrial-design commissions (he designed the stainless-steel tableware for the liner Oriana) while continuing to practise as a silversmith.",
