Adrian Lester appeared as Rosalind in both tours.\n\nHistorical significance: Cheek By Jowl's all-male production of As You Like It was one of the company's greatest successes. Founded in 1981 by the director, Declan Donnellan, and the designer, Nick Ormerod, Cheek By Jowl was one of the most innovative British theatre companies of the 1980s and 1990s, specializing in Shakespeare and the little known European classics. Its productions were notable for their simplicity of design and for their focus on the actor as storyteller and As You Like It was a perfect illustration of this style. Nick Ormerod's simple, timeless and sexless costume for Rosalind in Act I is a good example of a designer's response to the creation of  character through costume and to the challenge of dressing a man as a woman.\nAs You Like It was first staged in 1991, toured extensively, and was revived in 1994 and taken on a further world tour which ended in London at the Albery Theatre.  The freshness of the approach, and a fine Rosalind from Adrian Lester, won it critical plaudits: Nicholas de Jongh of the Evening Standard wrote that it would \"define the play for the 1990s\".",
