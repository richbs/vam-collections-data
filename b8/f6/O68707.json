            "physical_description": "This poster design uses a triangular format to link the main characters. There are two main portraits (Nutan and Amitabh Bachchan), which are of equal size, the female has her hair tied back and a bindi on her forehead to indicate her 'traditional' character.  The portait of Amitabh Bachchan is not as recognisable as in later posters in which attention is focused on his eyes and lips. This was one of his early roles  and was very different from the action hero roles that he subsequently became famous for. His portrait has been  'painted-over' which enhances his facial expression.\n\nA smaller  full figure image of Amitabh is placed in the centre, he carries pots tied with string hanging from a pole swung over his shoulder  thus indicating his occupation as a toddy-tapper and alluding to the title of the film - a small time merchant. A  smaller  female figure (Padma Khanna) forms the apex of the triangle and is distinguished from the portrait through the depiction of her loose hair and  by the way she is shown in natural colours while the rest of the poster is in shades of brown. She carries a lota/water pot. The placing of the 'toddy-tapper' figure in the centre of the other characters indicates his centrality to the narrative dilemma of the film. The English title runs across the top of the poster and the Hindi title is in much smaller lettering in the bottom right hand corner.",
