If a marker lands on the Skudo square, the player is allowed to turn the circle so that the marker may pass, and this shorten the player's route arount the board.\n\nRULES  SUPPLIED BY WADDINGTON 'S\n\n\nRules and Directions for playing the Game of Skudo for 2, 3 or 4 players.\n\nThe game can be played by 2, 3 or 4 players, each player choosin one of the four colours.  Before play commences, each of the DISCS must be set so the `Red can Pass', faces ` Red Starts' in the Red corner, `Green can pass' faces `Green Starts' in the Green Corner and so on.  Counters are placed in the spaces at each side of the `Start' spaces, 4 to each player.  The first player throws the dice and moves one counter the number of spaces scord (counting Start as 1) towards the centre of the disc, and then to the left which is the nearest way to get around the board to reach HOME the objective.  Each player follows in turn.\nWhen a 6 is scored , a player is entitled, if he so desires, to revolve any one disc to bring the sector colour to allow the passage of his own colour counter or prevent opponents from moving their counters across, also the player moves a counter 6 spaces and takes an additional throw.\nA counter reaching a space marked SKUDO entitles the player to revolve the nearest disc only.  In all cases discs must always be turned so that pathways join, but they can be turned a quarter, half or threequarters round.\nDiscs must face the correct way before counters can move across - Red can Pass for red colouters, etc.  Scores being forfeited until a 6 or SKUDO is scored, enabling the disc to be revolved to allow passage.\nA player revolving a disc may cause a counter already on the disc to be moved to the top above the centre and this counter can then only proceed by being moved around the curved path thereby being handicapped by the additional spaces to be scored, or by a player scorin a 6 or a SKUDO enabling the disc to be moved again.\nAny number of player's 4 counters can be brought into play at will.\nWhenever a counters moves on to a space occupied by an opponent, the opponent's counter returns to the starting point.  If 2 counters or more are covered all are moved back.\nCounters must move completely round the board before entering `HOME' and the correct number required to reach Home must be scored, higher score being ignored.\nThe player to get all counters Home first is the winner.  If it is desired to play a shorted game, players can each use 2 or 3 counters only.\n\nManufacturerd by John Waddington Ltd, Pat No. 562262\n\nRules placement: rules later supplied by John waddington Ltd",
