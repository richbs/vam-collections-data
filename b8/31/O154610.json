Mohr began working with the cube in the early 1970s to systematically explore the representation of multi-dimensional space in two-dimensional form. It has been the sole focus of his work for over thirty years.  \n\nThis screenprint was made after a plotter drawing produced using a bespoke computer program written by Mohr.  A plotter is a mechanical device that holds a pen or brush and is linked to a computer that controls its movements  In this image Mohr has divided the cube vertically into two parts using one of the Cartesian planes (the Cartesian planes are x [horizontal] and y [vertical] axes, onto which a point can be plotted using a set of co-ordinates).  Each one of the 64 small images consists of two halves in which a cube has been independently rotated.  Mohr's computer program contained the equations for plotting each point of the cube and its rotations.   \n\nMohr worked exclusively in monochrome from 1962, but began using colour in 1999 owing to the increasing complexity of his work.",
