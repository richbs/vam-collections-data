They were the only grand-children of Jabez Hughes (1819-84), Photographer to Queen Victoria whilst at Osborne House, and lived at Jabez\u2019s photographic studio at 60-60 \u00bd Union Street, Ryde.  Her family name was originally \u2018Hughes\u2019, added \u2018Tharle\u2019 in1921 in gratitude to her mother for the sacrifices she made bringing her up after their Father\u2019s premature death at 35.\n\nElfrida received art training at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and ateliers in Paris.  She spent two years travelling to Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, India, Burma, Thailand and Indonesia in the 1920s and had produced several drawings in watercolours, of which she donated five pictures to the V&amp;A in 1928.\n\nThe \u201cJavanese Batik Workers\u201d was finished on July 21, 1923, at Djokjakarta (Yogyakarta), Indonesia. By the courtesy of the Kunstarbeid (art work depot) there, Elfrida was permitted to sketch in their actual workshop, while the women worked.  The artist claimed that under the auspices of the Dutch Government, the best Batik in Java was done there.",
