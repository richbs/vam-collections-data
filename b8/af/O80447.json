The more lavish the textiles, the grander the bed. Most of the woodwork was plain and functional but the front posts, which were visible, were sometimes lavishly carved. \n\nTime\nThis bed post  is a very important early example of the use of classical motifs in England, at a time when the Gothic style still dominated in furniture and architecture. The profile medallion heads, candelabra motifs and drops of fruit all indicate the new interest in classical decoration. \n\n From about 1500, as conditions became more stable, rich households moved less from one property to another than they had done in the Middle Ages. This bed was probably intended to stay up in one house, rather than be moved on a regular basis. It is unlikely to be a travelling bed since there are no holes for the bolt or large peg at the base that kept the bed stable once it had been reassembled. \n\nOwners\nThe blending of classical and Gothic would have been considered the height of fashion, almost verging on the avant garde, in about 1520. It is therefore likely that the bed would have been owned by a courtier, senior cleric or rich merchant.",
