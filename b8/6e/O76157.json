It was designed by Jamie Reid (b.1947) and, although seen here in its artwork black and white, the fluorescent colours it was printed in and the title were chosen in order to be noticed and to offend. Malcolm McLaren (1946-2010), manager of the Sex Pistols, has said that, to this end, Reid's \"style subverted the spectacle and commodification of every day life by being bolder and more shocking\". In November 1977, the Nottingham Virgin record shop was taken to court for displaying the album in its window, because of its 'obscene' name. They were found not guilty when the defending counsel produced expert witnesses who were able to prove that the word 'Bollocks' was an Old English term used to refer to a priest.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic grew from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
