It was based on the work of the 16th-century Italian architect, Andrea Palladio, and of Inigo Jones, the English architect and designer who had introduced Palladio's style to Britain in the 1620s.\n\nPalladianism used a sophisticated system of proportion, derived from the four different classical styles known as the orders of architecture. The Corinthian was the richest of these four orders.\n\nPeople\nThis fragment formed part of the collection of Sir Charles  Allom (1865-1947), the founder of White Allom & Co. He was the most fashionable interior decorator in London in the years leading up to the First World War and specialised in the different styles of the 18th century. His clients included Edward VII, for whom he remodelled the ballroom of Buckingham Palace in 1907. The fragment would have served as a model for the various interiors created by White Allom & Co.",
