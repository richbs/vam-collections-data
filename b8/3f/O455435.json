Lined with green silk damask.\n\nThe pattern of the field is composed of vertical wavy foliate bands which meet at regular intervals to form compartments, each filled with a device of five celestial beings amid foliations. The bands are black and the ground of the compartments is red. Where the black bands touch is marked with the figure of a demon. Enclosing the field is a triple border formed by a broad band of devas alternating with garudas holding snakes amid leafy tendril motives between two narrow bands of mermaids and dragons. The colours are red, black, yellow and grey-green.",
