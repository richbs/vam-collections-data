            "historical_context_note": "The famous partnership and collaboration between the artist David Octavius Hill and the photographer Robert Adamson came into being originally in order to produce photographic portraits to assist Hill as a painter. The team produced a wide range of superb, valuable work and they were the first consistently  and successfully employ calotype process in Great Britain.\n\n1843 Hill was introduced to Adamson and they began to collaborate on the production of calotype portraits as reference images for the painting 'The Signing of the Deed of Demission' which represents 474 dignitaries. Essentially, Hill posed and arranged the individual sitters or groups while Adamson attended to the technical aspects of the exposure, processing, and printing.\n\nSome of their most powerful images, however, were made in Scottish seashore villages and depict fishermen and women. They also photographed  the architecture and monument of Scotland  and made calotypes of their friends posed in medieval armour or costumes.",
