In the early years of the 20th century it would have been worn as everyday dress by professional and business gentlemen, as well as for formal occasions. It was said to have been worn at the donor's wedding by her father.\n\nThe morning coat originated in the single-breasted tailcoat worn in the early 19th century. This was also known as the riding coat, or 'Newmarket'. By the 1850s the coat was shaped halfway between a riding coat and a frock coat. It was usually single-breasted and was known as the 'cutaway', as the fronts sloped away elegantly to the broad skirts behind.\n\nAfter the First World War the morning suit was gradually superseded by the lounge suit for everyday wear, though it continued to be worn by older men.",
