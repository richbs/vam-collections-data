The plain solid back is trapezoid in shape, tapering toward the cresting rail, which has an indented curved top with the date 1687 chiselled into it.  Each of the back stays, which are cut in one with the back legs, has three straight parallel grooves cut in its front, and is finished with a globular finial on a circular foot.  The seat is rectangular, with an apron front and sides immediately beneath it; the arms are squared in section but curve gently downward to the front stays, which are in the form of turned columns.  The front legs are plain and squared in section to match those at the back.\n\n[Arm-Chair for a child.  The back uprights, which slope inwards towards the top, are surmounted by knobs; they are joined above by a shaped rail incised with the date 1687, and enclose a plain panel.  The arms rest on baluster supports continuous with the front legs, which are splayed outwards.\nFrom:  H. Clifford Smith, Catalogue of English Furniture & Woodwork] \n(London 1930), cat. 539.",

On children's furniture this is often indicative of the date of birth of a child, particularly when accompanied by initials, and in England is most often found on furniture for the youngest children, such as cradles and high chairs.  The proportions of the chair suggest that it probably originated as a high chair, and has subsequently been cut down.  This may have been as a result of damage; another possibility would be continuing use by the same child, who no longer needed a high chair, but most families would consider it more thriftier to keep the high chair for future infants.",
