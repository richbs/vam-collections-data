This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in a kiln, the silver compound would turn yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown\u2013black pigment. Since the technique reduced the amount of leading required, it allowed greater freedom of composition. \n\nThis fragment may depict one of the seven angels blowing seven trumpets in the apocalyptic vision of St John the Evangelist, described in the last book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church. As a result, much of the glass from this time survives only in a fragmentary state.",
