They were also made mainly with local taste in mind rather than for large-scale export, unlike Rhineland stoneware.\n\nBunzlau is the former German name for Boles\u0142awiec, south-west Poland. The abundant clays of this area are very suitable for making pottery and an industry has existed in Bunzlau since at least the late fourteenth century. The German term 'Lehmglasur' is used to describe the iron- and titanium-rich slip-glaze characteristic of pots from this region. From about 1650, creamy-white relief-moulded pipeclay motifs were often applied to this lustrous brown coating, creating an attractive contrast. These motifs became increasingly crisp and delicate after the annexation of Lower Silesia by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 when the new regime began actively to develop the local industry, encouraging in potters from other German regions.",

Unlike Rhineland wares, they were made less for export and more for local markets and to local taste.\n\nBunzlau lies on the B\u00f3br tributary of the river Oder in Lower Silesia. This is now part of south-west Poland. It has a long-standing ceramic industry, documented from the 1380s at least, as clays from the area are both abundant and well-suited to pottery-making. The lustrous brown glaze characteristic of pots from this region is known in German as 'Lehmglasur' (slip glaze). It is iron- and titanium-rich and once applied, the wares are fired at 1180-1280\u00b0C. Applied relief-moulded pipeclay motifs were often used as decoration of Bunzlau wares post-1650 but after Lower Silesia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742, these motifs became more delicate and more crisply-moulded. This resulted from Prussian keeness to improve and develop the pottery industry in the area, breaking the guild system and encouraging in potters from other German regions.",
