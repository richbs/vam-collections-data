Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nAlthough most of these figurines represented contemporary people, some were made for their decorative qualities.  This figurine has not been identified as a particular person.  It may represent an actress in a role which called for her to play an instrument, or it may fall into the decorative but non-representational category of Staffordshire mantelpiece ornaments.",
