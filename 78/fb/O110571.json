The design is symmetrical on either side of a central circle carved to look like rope enclosing an interlaced device, roughly shield-shaped. Just below the top edge, about 15 cm from the right hand end, is a small (2.5cm sq) section which has been let into the board and re-carved roughly.  The front face is lightly stained red. The back of the board is quite plain and unstained. All the edges are rounded but there is no evidence of jointing.",

In Iceland, beds were built into the structure of the house, as in many rural communities throughout Europe.  Bedboards were loose planks that could be placed across the entrance to the bed to keep bedclothes in place.  For this reason, they only needed to be decorated on one face.  They were often carved by members of the family, or as a present from a young man to his future wife. During the day, they were hung flat on the wall, to form part of the decoration of the house.  In Iceland, the traditional carved motifs of scrolling plants and interlaced patterns continued in use until after 1850.  At that time they were given a new lease of life by the Arts and Crafts movement, led by the enthusiasm of the British designer William Morris for such traditional Icelandic folk-art. The monogram at the centre of this bedboard, which includes two S's, presumably refers to the original owner.",
