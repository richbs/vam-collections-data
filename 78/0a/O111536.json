It is the only known piece of English medieval embroidery on which the maker's name is sewn. On the reverse, it states in Latin that Sister Joan of Beverly made it.

It was reputed to have come from the collection of Lord Willoughby de Broke (sold as Lot 248 at Sotheby's sale, 28 January 1921). Originally recorded in Accession Register as 19th century embroidery in the style of the 14th century, but at time that sold at Christies in 1921 thought to be of this earlier date. In 1963, Donald King thought it dated to the late 13th or early 14th century and was merely a different category of English needlework from that which was then known. George Saville Seligman had also bought a stole (Lot 247, now T.343-1921) which the Museum coveted at this sale, and had promised to leave it to the Museum. Notes on this subject in the Registered papers indicate that the Museum had been prepared to purchase the stole from him at the price he paid, but had confidence in his promise that he would pass it on to them eventually as a gift, and he did so in November of the same year. (McKendrick, 28 February 1921 and 17 November 1921). This donor, in fact, gave various ecclesiastical items to the Museum between 1914 and 1923.  (RP 1923/3729).\n\nIn the Accession Register, Donald King noted in 1955 that in 1849, 1916 and 1921 the object was referred to as probably part of a funeral pall and dated to the 13th or 14th century.\n\nHistorical significance: This is the only known signed piece of English medieval embroidery, signed by a nun, and in design and technique is quite unlike other surviving embroideries. The fact that it is signed (the maker embroidered her name on the back) suggests an amateur worker rather than professional.",

            "historical_context_note": "'This embroidery by Johanna Beverlai, a nun, is the only signed English embroidery surviving from the Middle Ages. It is also of a unique type. The two facts are probably connected, for it is natural that the work of non-professional embroiderers should differ from that of professional workshops which constitutes the overwhelming majority of surviving embroideries. In the absence of comparative material the date of the piece is uncertain, but the green silk edging is very similar to that of seal bags of 1319 (cat. 206 ) and may well be of roughtly the same period.' These seal bags belong to the Corporation of London Records Office.\n\n<i>Heraldry</i>. \nHenry de Lacy, last Earl of Lincoln of that name, died in 1311; William de Vescy, last Baron of that name, died in 1314.
