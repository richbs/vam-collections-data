Red velvet sections joined with no regard for the direction of the pile.  All around the H-form is a line of trefoil shapes in silver-gilt metal thread linked by a scalloped stem in silver metal thread [A].\nThe two extensions are filled with a cypress tree motif in silver-gilt metal thread with green and silver-gilt thread sprouting details, flanked either side by a long-tailed confronting bird in silver, above a stylized floral motif in silver, purple and silver and olive green and silver thread emerging from an inverted trefoil shape which in turn has 2 leafy branches in green and silver-gilt thread.\nThis leads into the main rhomboid shape, the first section of which is decorated with 3 large lobed leafy lozenges in silver-gilt metal thread, formed by interconnected and inverted heart shapes around a 5-petalled central rosette in silver-gilt with a blue and silver thread centre, with the leafy elements in purple and silver-gilt or green and silver-gilt.\noccasional petal details in blue and silver, purple and silver-gilt and green and silver-gilt threads. Two upturned birds in profile are near the bottom.  Two thick leafy stems in silver metal thread frame this motif, turned upwards and downwards with birds in flight or hovering holding a flowering spray.  Thin branches hold large stylized blossoms and leaves including a bunch of grapes in silver, silver-gilt with or without the addition of coloured silk.\nAlong the branches, a small rock formation with a bird either side of the leafy stem base.\nA continuation of [A] runs three-quarters way round this lower section infilled with a generous silver stem meander bearing large exotic blossoms and leaves in similar colouring. All the outlines and some of the couching have been worked over threads which are formed from tightly rolled paper.\nMetal Threads: [1] silver-gilt strip close S-wound on white silk core; \n[2] silver-gilt strip close Z-wound on beige/yellow silk; \n[3] silver-gilt strip on a beige/yellow silk core plied with green silk; \n[4] silver strip on a white core plied with blue silk; \n[5] silver strip on a white core plied with purple silk.\n\nBacking: two different qualities of unbleached cotton.",
