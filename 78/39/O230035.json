Julien is best known as a film-maker. One of his declared aims is to break down barriers between different artistic disciplines, constructing powerful visual narratives which draw variously on film, dance, photography, music, theatre, painting and sculpture.  For this portfolio Julien contributed two prints, intended to reference his work with film, by introducing elements of time and narrative development. These two photographic digital prints, Untitled (Deja-Vu No. 2, Baltimore Series) relate directly to Julien's film Baltimore, a surrealistic exploration of that city which focused on two of its museums: The Baltimore Museum of Fine Arts (a collection of classic European art) and the Great Blacks in Wax Museum which celebrates the history of endeavour and achievement by African Americans. Using waxwork figures from the latter in one of the galleries of the former, Julien offers snapshots of an edgy ambiguous narrative in progress, perhaps a film being shot (a light is in view in the second image). The prints are bordered with a gold leaf 'frame' which gives them a precious quality, but is also an ironic comment on the way that the packaging and presentation of a work of art can influence its perceived value.",
