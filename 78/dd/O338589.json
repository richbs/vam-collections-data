Sir Arthur Steel Maitland from La Paz in 1921\" (Bolivia)\n\nHistorical significance: The Nasca style was subject to changes over seven centuries.  Many examples from the Early phase include quite simple compositions of stylised subjects from the natural world, very important to their agrarian and fishing culture. Designs include a wide range of local animals and birds naturalistic enough to identify the species, such as the hummingbirds on this bottle.\n\nThe double spout and bridge demonstrated here is one of the most distinctive and complicated Nasca vessel forms. On one level it had a very practical function as the second opening allowed for air to escape so liquid poured smoothly.",

Nasca pots were formed by coiling, drawing and shaping by direct modelling rather than the use of moulds. The decoration is characterised by skilled polychrome slip painting. Blocks of coloured slips were painted  using brushes made from Llama or Alpaca fur and then the distinctive black outlines of the image were added on top. The surface was carefully burnished before firing to produce a smooth and shiny surface.",
