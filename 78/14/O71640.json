            "public_access_description": "In northern Europe the altarpiece was the most important type of sculpture in wood. The structure of a winged altarpiece was dominated by the central panel, the corpus, and its figures. The wings carried relief carvings, figures or narrative paintings. The predella often contained busts of apostles or saints. The crowning superstructure was usually decorated with finials and small figures. On certain days and during Lent the corpus and the predella were closed from view.\n\nThe subject-matter of this series of reliefs (Museum nos 114 to 114A to F-1908) is extremely unusual. They almost certainly belonged to a larger cycle of the Legend of the True Cross.  Woodcuts published by the printer Johan Velderner in Culemborg in 1483 have helped to identify them. This one is: St Helena deposits a portion of the Cross in Jerusalem. The unusual subject-matter suggests that the altarpiece to which the reliefs belonged was specially commissioned. The theme of the decoration would have been based on the dedication of the chapel or church for which the altarpiece was intended. The size, form and construction of the reliefs suggest that they originally formed part of a large altarpiece. They were probably set into the voussoirs or hollows of the frame flanking the major scenes.",
