It is based on a print published by Hodgson in 1826 depicting Liston in nine of his best-known characters.  Pottery figures of seven of the nine characters are known to exist.\n\nDespite a naturally serious and melancholy temperament, Liston achieved his greatest successes in farce, and particularly as the inquisitive Paul Pry, a role in which he was often depicted in paintings, drawings and figuines.  Later comedians, including Toole, imitated his dress and manner in the role.  He was the first comic actor to command a salary greater than a tragedian, earning between sixty and one hundred pounds a week when he joined Madam Vestris's company at the Olympic Theatre.  He retired in 1837 after a career that spanned over thirty years.",
