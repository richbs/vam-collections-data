Oak Park was a large complex of buildings, many of which were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright between 1889 and 1909. The architectural form of this octagonal-legged table is typical of Wright's early furniture. The Fricke House and its interior are contemporary with the earliest of Wright's celebrated Prarie Houses, but in fact represent the final phase of the architect's early style rather than that of his later Prarie Houses. \n\nThe massive stained oak table combines forms derived from the Gothic Revival and Arts and Crafts movements of the later 19th century. The colour and shape of the table, and of other pieces of furniture, were echoed  in interior details throughout the house. Wright believed that wood should be cut simply and stained (never varnished) to reveal the 'nature' of the material.",
