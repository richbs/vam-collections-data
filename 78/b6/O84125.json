Careful mitring and gathering of the heavy braid allows its arrangement around the pockets and into rococo curves down the jacket front. The trim consists of three parts: a wide ribbon of silver thread woven in a geometrical pattern, and a narrow gimp of silver on either side.",

It was a great deal more comfortable and warm than other fashionable dress, and made of more robust materials.  It would have been worn with a skirt, referred to at that date as a petticoat, the generous amounts of fabric incorporated in the skirt meant that it was often recycled, assuming it survived the mud and heavy wear.  Habits could be in a full range of colours, although certain shades were specificed for the jacket and cuffs when following a particular hunt.  By the end of the 18th century, a contrasting colour for the lining was highly fashionable.",
