In the post-war period, when restrictions on materials and shifting client fortunes might have threatened his business, Dess\u00e8s found great success. He designed the wedding outfits of Princess Sophia of Greece to Prince Juan Carlos and his many other clients included wealthy Americans and the European aristocracy.\n\nThis dress illustrates Dess\u00e8s's career-long preoccupation with draping and form.  The skirt is made from twenty-one lace-trimmed squares, each suspended from a point at the waist and falling to a handkerchief hem. By stitching each square to the next, Dess\u00e8s created a design of graceful volume and movement.",

By stitching each square to the next in a carefully plotted pattern, Dess\u00e8s created a skirt of graceful volume and movement.  The criss-cross placement of lace on the bodice draws attention to the <i>d\u00e9colletage</i> of this otherwise demure dress.",
