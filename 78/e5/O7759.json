The bowl is painted in underglaze blue, the interior with four fish below a border, surrounding a central roundel, the exterior with peonies. The foot-mount rises from a tapered plain ring; an applied wire encloses an applied strip die-struck with pomegranates in foliage. Above this is a slightly concave vertical seamed band which is die-struck with egg and dart, the striking registering on the reverse. A second tapered flange has an applied die-struck strip of pomegranates partly overlaid by a profiled vertical wire. This rises to a flange to which the straps are hinged. The four straps have three-part hinges and are cast as demi-figures surmounting shaped scrollwork panels, each containing a lion mask above a swag on a textured ground. The exterior rim is shaped, pierced and wired below a profiled wire. The interior mount is plain. The tapered rim has an applied strip die-struck with pomegranates as on the foot. The two handles are cast and chased as double scrolls, attached to the central hinge lug. They are formed as genii, their wings terminating below the hinge and their tails entwined. (P.

            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nChinese porcelain was an exotic and highly valued product in 16th-century England. Porcelain was often considered in the same way as such natural curiosities as ostrich eggs, nautilus or trochus shells, serpentine (a hard green stone), coconut or gourd cups, and given expensive silver or gold mounts. This bowl is made of Jia Jing porcelain painted with underglaze blue peonies and fish. The silver-gilt mounts are of high quality, chosen to enhance the value of the piece. It would have made a handsome sideboard ornament or could have been part of a collector's 'cabinet of curiosities'.\n\nTrading\nLarge quantities of Chinese porcelain were made for export in the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province and traded through south-east Asia and by an overland route through Turkey and into Europe. In 1557 the Portuguese established a trading base in Macau, in southern China, and began to deal in porcelain. As much of this porcelain went directly to Lisbon, it was still extremely rare and highly prized in England, although the activities of English pirates did increase the supply somewhat. The founding of the Dutch East India Company in 1602 led to greater quantities of porcelain entering the market, with a consequent drop in its status and value.\n\nPeople\nBy tradition this bowl was a gift from Philip the Fair, Duke of Burgundy (1478-1506) and his wife Joanna 'the Mad' to Sir Thomas Trenchard of Wolverton, Dorset, in gratitude for his hospitality after their ship was wrecked off Weymouth in 1506. In fact, we can tell from the date of the mounts and of the porcelain that it reached England much later, during Elizabeth I's reign (1558-1603), probably as part of a load of porcelain seized from a Spanish ship.",
