The name and address of the printer who made this printing block, John Richardson, 61 Wade Lane Leeds, is carved into two sides of the block, and a label glued to the back is inscribed in ink: 'Will Judge. Comedian, in Florida Follies at The Winter Gardens Hoylake.'  This printing block was used for Will Judge's illustrated memo paper when he was living in 21. St. Chad's Road, Blackpool, ca.1920.\n\nWill Judge was a well-known comedy-variety and pantomime artist  for over thirty years in the first half of the 20th century. Although  he performed all over the British Isles and occasionally in London,  he was best known in East Anglia and the North of England. He was  born and lived in Beccles in Suffolk, but also ltoured extensively. He made his first appearance in Beccles where he started his own  repertory company in a stable at the age of 14, and began his professional career touring East Anglia and the Midlands with Cyril Getcliffe's National Ladies' Choir. He played Dame in pantomime, more as the elegant rather than the grotesque figure, and in 1912 married the soprano and Principal Boy Gertrude Orchard (1883-1947) appearing together in  the Fulham Theatre 1912/13 production of The House That Jack  Built as Miss Pippin the Village Daisy, and Jill the Squire's adopted daughter; and as Widow Twankey and the Fairy Queen in Aladdinat Cheltenham Opera House, 1915/16. Later in his career he also acted in plays, as in May 1931 in the Whitley Bay Playhouse  production of Walter Hackett's It Pays To Advertise, when he  played George McChesney.",
