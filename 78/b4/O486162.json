Tapestry-woven (kesi)  in gold and silver thread on a blue ground The decoration features five-clawed dragons pursuing sacred pearls amid clouds, bats, flowers and symbolical devices. The blue ground is covered with a fretwork fashioned so as to include within its meshes outlines of the swastika and longevity symbols (<i>wan shou</i>, i.e. 'a myriad ages').At the hem are a broad band of stripes; the standing water ( lishui), and rocks appearing from waves amid which are floating symbolic objects .On the collar and sleeves are shaped bands of brocade with a similar pattern on a smaller scale. The bottom of the flap opening has been torn up, and is now in bad condition. The brocaded band at the edge is a latter addition. The kesi is very loosely woven, medium quality. Every pattern is outlined with a black line.",

Registered File number 31783/1901.\n\nNote on register:\nImperial robe of light but rich material and brilliant colouring woven with gold and silver threads and occasional lines of coloured silks on a blue ground. The large golden five-clawed dragons are effectively displayed in the midst of scrolled clouds upon a ground of carved fretwork fashioned so as to include within its meshes outlines of the swastika and longevity symbols. The flying bats suggest all kinds of felicity, and many other symbols are represented floating in the waves which with the diagonally shifted gold and silver band from which it is separated by a line of scrolled clouds makes a singluarly effective lower border of the cloak. The collar and sleeves are fitted with shaped bands of a similar dragon brocade woven on a smaller scale with a darker ground and bound round with narrow borders of swastika fret pattern.",
