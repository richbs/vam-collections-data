            "public_access_description": "This painting is a combined effort by Frederick Richard Lee (1798-1879) and Thomas Sydney Cooper (1803-1902).  From 1847 they were regular collaborators, Lee undertaking the painting of the landscape and Cooper the painting of the animals.  In Walks Among London's Pictures published in 1910, E.B. Chancellor wrote of this picture: \"the landscape is clever and attractive, especially the glimpse of the distance, and the cows are less 'tinny' than is usual with Cooper [proving how] infinitely better his work in this direction was as an adjunct to a landscape than when the animals formed the chief motif.\"  Despite both artists exhibiting many works at the Royal Academy and elsewhere, this particular one does not appear to have been shown.",

Served in the army, retired because of ill-health, and entered RA Schools 1818. Exhibited 171 landscapes at the RA between 1824 and 1870,131 at the BI 1822-55, and 24 at the SBA 1825-37. Subjects mainly views in Devon, but also elsewhere in England, Wales and Scotland; visited, in his yacht, France, Spain and Italy. From 1847 he collaborated regularly with the animal painter T S Cooper and sometimes with Sir Edwin Landseer. Elected ARA 1834, RA 1838. According to Cooper, he saw painting 'more of a pastime than as a business, and he always gave me the impression that he considered the profession beneath him'. Retired from the RA 1871, and died at Vleeson Bank, South Africa, 5 June 1879. \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 12 July 1879, p58 (obit); Art Journal 1879, p184 (obit); T S Cooper My Life 1890, I, pp325-30 \n\nWooded Glen \n1827-1888 Neg 34013\nCanvas, 74.8 \u00d7 105.3 cm (29 \u00bd \u00d7 41\u00bd ins)\nSigned and dated 'F R Lee RA/T S Cooper ARA 1860' bl\nGiven by Mrs Charles Rivas 1888\n\nThe cattle, and presumably the sheep, were painted by Cooper. The two artists regularly collaborated from 1847; according to Cooper, 'We settled that he should paint the landscape part first, and send the picture up to me in an advanced state, the part where I was to introduce the cattle being only just coloured over (p239)'. The painting does not seem to have been exhibited.\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
