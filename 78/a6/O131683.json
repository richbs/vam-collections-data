The moulded top rail is very sharp (and therefore replaced), and the carved lunette (with the date 1574) is apparently old (16th century), but glued in place. At the back, both mid-rails, which are moulded on both sides, do not match the more conventional side rails and the back, bottom rail. Around the base of the chair, at sides and back, plain stabilizing rails have been added. Of the three plain back panels (of vertically grained oak) with a slight chamfer, the bottom appears to be original, the two above replacements. On each side there are two panels, horizontally grained, which appear to be original. The seat of trapezoidal shape, consists of two planks, grained side to side, both of them replacements and held by 3 new nailed fillets. The arms are carved and morticed to receive the front legs (held by a single peg), and with a spliced-in repair under the left handle, and are tenoned into the rear stiles (held by a single peg).  The front seat rail and bottom rail, with scratch mouldings, are held to the side rails (held by two pegs), and appear to be original. The bottom consists of two planks (of original oak, and replaced softwood).\nThe compartment under the seat is accessed by a door of frame and panel construction, double-pegged, held on two iron hinges tenoned into both the door stile and the chair stile. The handle backplate(?) is original. A groove has been cut in the left stile (as if to receive a latch, but probably to receive a modern mirror plate to secure the door shut).",
