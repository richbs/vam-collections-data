Loosely woven unbleached cotton canvas interlining through which the embroidery has been worked.\nBlue ground with a seam down the right hand side where the border design begins.  Embroidery over the seam.\nCentral star-like rosettes surrounded by 8 hearts pointing  outwards.  A border encloses the hearts and forms an 8-pointed star with a large composite blossom at each corner and a smaller one with a pair of cuving leaves midway along each side.\nTwo lines of pink silk couched with metal thread form a border between the central panel and the border design which is a meandering stem bearing 4 types of composite blossoms plus leaves:\n[1] appears in each corner\n[2] mid-way down each side\n[3] a carnation like blossom either side of [2]\n[4] an iris like flower between [3] and [1]\nTwo lines of black silk couched with metal thread form an outer border.\nEmbroidery thread: red, green, dark green and dark blue, all 2S silk; yellow and light blue silk, indeterminable twist;  light grey silk which may originally have been purple 2Z silk - the purple colouring is now only visible on the back and may not have been part of the design but have been used to attached a decorative backing.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound on white Z-twist silk\nSilver-gilt strip close S-wound on white Z twist silk.\nSelvedge down the left hand side, 1 cm wide with an outer blue stripe and other stripes in red, yellow and pink; satin weave.\nNOTE: because there is no decorative backing it is possible to see the back of the embroidery.  Unplied\norange, white and yellow silk has been used to couch the metal threads.  The choice of colour seems random.\nGlue appears to have been smeared over the reverse to keep all the threads in place.",
