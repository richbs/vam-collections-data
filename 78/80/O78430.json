They would have been brought to the table for diners to wash their hands at the end of the meal. When not in use, the basin was meant to hang vertically with the dolphins and the grotesque mask at the top. There are holes at the top, from which it could be suspended.\n\nPeople\nChristiaen van Vianen (active 1600-67) came from a famous family of Utrecht goldsmiths. He worked for Charles I and after the Restoration became 'silversmyth in ordinary' to Charles II. His work was mostly in the fantastical style developed by his father and uncle, Adam and Paul van Vianen. Although this basin is not hallmarked, it was signed by him on the reverse 'C.d. Vianen fecit 1635', just as painters signed their work.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe 'auricular' style of this piece refers to the shape of the human ear. It combines exaggerated marine and natural forms with grotesque figures in swirling patterns. The style was developed by Adam van Vianen in Utrecht  in the first two decades of the 17th century and used extensively by his son Christiaen. In this instance, the silver has been raised and embossed from a single sheet into brilliant, illusionist shapes. This demanded great skill on the part of the craftsman.\n\nThe dolphins and other marine shapes on this basin are appropriate for a vessel used for washing.",
