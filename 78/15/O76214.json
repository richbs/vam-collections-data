High-waisted with broad lapels and sometimes belts, they reached to the mid-calf for the midi and to the ankles for the maxi. The style was derived from military coats at a time when military tailoring had become fashionable. During the late 1960s there was a craze for wearing second-hand uniforms, usually Brigade of Guards red jackets and various greatcoats. It was these greatcoats that influenced the cut of the midi and maxi. This particular example was worn by Sir Roy Strong, a former Director of the Museum.",
