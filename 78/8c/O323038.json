Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces were made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  Even the largest pieces weigh only a few grams.\n\nGold necklaces and chains made of hollow beads or thin oval links were worn throughout Italy in the 19th century, either singly or in graduated rows. The design of the cross is that of a French Croix jeannette.  It may have been made in France, but the mark does not appear to be French, and it could have been made in Italy, where crosses of this kind were very popular in the 19th century.   \n\nThis necklace and cross was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
