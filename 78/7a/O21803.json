A deep greenish glaze is evenly applied to the entire cup and stand. There are traces of silica spurs on the foot of the cup and traces of fireclay and sand spurs on the foot of the stand. It is assumed that this set was made at a kiln site in Yucheon-ri, Buan, in the late 13th century.\n[Cup] Lobed wine cup. Each lobe is decorated with alternate flower sprays and insects; in the well of the cup is a single flower head. The form imitates the shape of a chrysanthemum blossom.\n\nColour: Greyish green, white and black\n[Stand] Lobed stand. Each lobe is inlaid with a chrysanthemum spray. The central receptacle for the wine cup also has a flower head, and is surrounded by bands of petals and of scrollwork.\n\nColour: Greyish green, white and black",

Around 1150, a new technique for decorating this celadon-glazed pottery was developed. Koryo Potters set coloured materials into the clay surface before the wares were glazed. After firing, the pattern inlaid in this way remained clearly visible beneath the transparent glaze.\n\nThe potter who made this wine cup and stand has combined black and white inlay materials to create a pattern of delicate floral sprays. These are set into the surface of the stand and the sides of the cup. The flowers are wild chrysanthemums, a common sight in Korea and a popular motif of this period.",
