On this hand mirror, irregularly-shaped fragments are used as a border. The mirror matches the spectacle case, Museum Number AP.96-1875. \n\nThe mirror was acquired in 1875 as part of the Museum's 'Animal Products' collection, to illustrate the use of mother-of-pearl as decoration. This collection was begun in 1853 at the suggestion of Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. He advised on the formation of the South Kensington Museum (which later became the V&A) and suggested a collection of manufactured items made from natural raw materials, divided into animal, vegetable and mineral categories. In the end the Animal Products collection was the only one of the three to be formed. It was one of the collections displayed at the branch museum in Bethnal Green, in the East End of London, when it first opened in 1872.",

Much of the material came from the Great Exhibition, and the collections continued to be added to until 1917. Less than half of the Animal Products Collection survived by 2000.  Half had been transferred to different departments and half remained at Bethnal Green. In 2000 departments at the V&A were offered suitable items.  Another quarter of the original collection was transferred, the remainder was offered to the Archive of Art and Design, at Blythe House, along with the original registers.  BGMC kept a small selection of other items for display in conjunction with the History of the Museum information panel.",
