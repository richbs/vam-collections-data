These random items have left their imprints on the book's pages, inviting the reader to touch the apparently embossed paper, but there is nothing to feel: the objects and their imprints are trompe-l\u2019oeil photographs.\n\nParker crushed each item in a press between sheets of paper and then had the results photographed, inviting the reader to share her fascination with the acts of destruction and transformation. The objects are shown pre-crushed in a table of contents, but confusingly not all of the items in the contents actually appear in the book.\n\nA squashed spoon is attached to the cover by wire, like a bookmark, and has been pressed onto the book's covering boards to create a blind relief print.\n\nNAL copy is no. 10 in a special edition of 30 signed and numbered copies.",
