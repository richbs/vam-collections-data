There are no seams on the shoulders. All the edges are rolled and stitched, including two side slits which are 15 cm long.  The long  V-neck opening [32.5 cm long] is faced with a block printed cotton.\nThe cotton fabric forming the shirt/blouse is embroidered with an overall pattern using white cotton thread to create a small-scale trellis of lozenges each containing a small 4-petalled rosette.  At the sleeve ends and along the hem back and front up to the underarm bands, this patterning is briefly interrupted by two narrow edging bands set 6 cm apart infilled again with the lozenge and rosette pattern, however in some sections the scale is markedly smaller.\nThe embroidery thread is S-spun.\nFacing: machine woven cotton printed with a small, simple repeating design of an isolated plant in offsert rows, predominantly in blue and red with some yellow forming green leaves.\nsimilar patterning to T.2-1909",
