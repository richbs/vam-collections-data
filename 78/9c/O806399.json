The text reads as follows: A female martyr, probably St Justina of Padua, bound by an executioner, whose sword lies beside him on the ground Inscribed in ink on the mount in an old hand 'Carletto' Pen and ink and wash heightened with white on light brown paper 12 7/8 x 11 (327 x 280) 8638F PROVENANCE Given by Miss Georgiana Lornlin, 1880 Formerly attributed to Gian Carlo Loth. The name Carletto on the mount, referring to Carletto Caliari, Veronese's younger son, is a clue which points in the right direction. The drawing is obviously by a follower of Veronese, though not necessarily by Carletto. It does not appear to be by the same hand as the few other drawings by Carletto which have been published. It has a certain affinity with a drawing of Esther and Ahasuerus in the British Museum which is inscribed in an old hand with the name of Marco Agnolo del Moro (illustrated in Hadeln, Spiitrenaissance, pl, 18). Note the hard outlines of the figures in the foreground in both drawings, and the softly drawn background figures, sketched with the point of the brush.",
