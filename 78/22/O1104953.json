Sketch for oil painting \u2018A \ngrand procession of Dignitaries painted in \nthe Semi-Egyptian Style\u2019, 1961 \nSigned and dated <i>DH. \u201861</i> \nCharcoal and orange chalk on ochre paper. \n60.7 x 45.6 cm \nVAM circ. 536-1968 \n \nThe subject of the painting was indirectly \ninspired by a poem by the Greek poet \nConstantine Cavafy, \u2018Waiting for the \nBarbarians\u2019. By 1961 Hockney was already \ninterested in the style of Egyptian painting, \nand the way it was governed by a rigid set of \nrules which allowed the artist little \nindividualism of expression, and he created \nthis work in a \u2018semi-Eyptian style\u2019. Thus the \nthree dignitaries are shown in their most \ncharacteristic Eyptian fashion with different \nparts of their bodies viewed from set angles \n(the legs in profile and the torso from the \nfront, for example), highly stylised and two- \ndimensional but Hockney makes a double- \nentendre by investing each of them with a \nsecond, inner figure. The sketch, although it is \nnot very close to the final version of the 2nd \nDignitary, shows clearly the artist\u2019s intention \nto play on the ambiguity of inner and outer\nself. \n(The painting repr. Whitechapel Gallery, \n<i>David Hockney, Paintings, Prints and Draw- \nings, 1960-1970</i>, 1970 no. 61, 10)\u2019",
