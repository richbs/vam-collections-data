In his Seventeenth-century English Miniatures in the Collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum (1997), John Murdoch notes that the miniatures were probably painted by Edmund Ashfield (worked 1669-90). He thought this because of the signature \u2018E.A\u2019 that is found at the lower centre right on another miniature from this group. This is of Charles North, 5th Baron North de Kirtling (catalogue number 131 in Murdoch\u2019s book; Museum number P.42-1987).\n\nEdmund Ashfield was a painter in oil and \u2018crayon\u2019 (what is called today \u2018pastel\u2019), but it was long thought that he had also painted miniatures. This group apparently supports this belief.",

No. 131; inscribed in ink on an old label attached to the paper cover of the backing: <i>Miss Catherine/North</i>, in the same hand as on Cat. No. 131. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> As for Cat. No. 131. \n\nCatherine, whose date of birth is not recorded, was the elder surviving daughter of Charles, 5th Baron North (see Cat. No. 131). According to Roger North (1) she 'died at sea, coming from Barbadoes', which implies that she may have gone there with her mother after the death of her father in 1690. Her mother, by that time married to Colonel Russell, died in 1695. Catherine had no children. \n\n1 North 1890, vol. I (author's preface), p. vii. See also Jessop's expanded but somewhat unreliable account of the orphaned children in vol. III, pp. 292, 294-5, in which Dudleya (Cat. No. 135) is stated to be the elder daughter.\u201d\n",
