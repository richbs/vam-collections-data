He was particularly fond of representing children. The combination of his fine technique and the pathos of the subject in this painting appealed to a wide public, connoisseurs and amateurs alike. This version is a replica of a painting commissioned by a Mr Holden and exhibited in London at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1833. The print subsequently made after this painting was very popular, combining as it does a pretty rural setting with a sentimental subject. An appreciative biography of Collins (published in 1848) was written by his son, the novelist Wilkie Collins.",

In 1807 he entered the RA schools, and exhibited his first painting there. Made his name with 'The Disposal of a Favourite Lamb' in 1813; elected ARA 1814, RA 1820. Achieved great popularity with his landscapes and, particularly, rustic genre scenes in the 1820s; Ruskin highly praised his works in the 1840s. Married in 1822 the sister of the portrait painter Margaret Carpenter. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, especially in Italy 1836-38; these visits are reflected in the subjects he painted.
