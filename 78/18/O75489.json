The dress was inspired by the abstract paintings of the Dutch De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian (1872-1944). Yves St Laurent designed a group of bold dresses based on intersecting black stripes and blocks of primary colours. It became known as the Mondrian Collection and was featured on the front of  French Vogue in September 1965 and in many other fashion magazines. The designs were immediately taken up by mass manufacturers who made cheap copies.\n\nThis dress forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. With great energy and determination Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980) contacted designers and the well-dressed elite of Europe and America to create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
