Fenton.  Manchester, Published by T. Agnew &amp; Sons, Nov 19th 1855, London, P. &amp; D. Colnaghi &amp; Co. Paris, Moulin 23 Rue Richer. New York, Williams &amp; Co.'</i>\n\nThis albumen print by Fenton is so lightly coated that on superficial examination it might pass for a salted paper print.  However, the faint but discernable sheen on the paper surface, and the yellowed highlights, reveal its true nature.  The reddish-brown image shows no obvious sign of gold toning, which although widely used for albumen prints was not universally employed, contrary to the impression given in some recent writings.  All the early negative processes were sensitive only to blue light, and white clouds and blue sky recorded much more strongly on the plate than did the landscape.  In prints from early negatives, the skies tend to be featureless, unless specially prepared cloud negatives were used in a double printing operation to add an attractive sky.  To facilitate this, and to remove coating imperfections which would be all too apparent in a large area free of detail, it was often the practice to paint out the sky area on the negative with opaque medium.  There are clear signs along the skyline of this photograph that it was done in this case.\nLike Gustave Le Gray, Roger Fenton trained as a painter in the studio of Delaroche, and like his French contemporary, Fenton represents the highest aspirations of the art of photography in his time.  Neither adapted to the era of mass production in which photography developed from about 1860.  Fenton excelled in all of the medium's fields but his documentation of the Crimean War, commissioned by Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons and assisted by Royal patronage, remains his most-published work.  His photographs are the first convincing document of a theatre of war.  He worked in the Crimea with a mobile darkroom (a specially designed horse-drawn van) and two assistants.  The glass negatives were sensitised with collodion solution in the van and exposed when still wet, then immediately developed in the van.  This view successfully delineates the anchorage at Balaklava and the surrounding terrain, complete with the aerial perspective intrinsic to photography.  Unlike most of Fenton's photographs there are minor technical flaws (fogging of the negative in three places - not to be confused with the smoke or steam rising from one of the ships) but these do not seriously affect the value of the view.",
