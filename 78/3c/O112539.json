This was then covered in a white glaze and fired.\n \nThe maker has left clearly visible fingerprints on the surface. These marks would have been made as the flask was handled after applying the glaze, and were not smoothed over before it was fired. As this vessel was meant for every day use, perfection was not necessarily sought by its maker.",
