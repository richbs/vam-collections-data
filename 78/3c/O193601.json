P\u00e9ter P\u00f3cs designed it as a series of three posters promoting different SZDSZ party candidates forming an original and witty triptych.  In his book \u2018United Colors of Hungary\u2019 P\u00f3cs recalls his concept for the posters:  \u201cAt that time you could already see billboards in the streets of Budapest with giant photos of jovially smiling politicians. The faces of the leaders of every party were radiating the same expression of endless, obligatory optimism. The posters did not give the viewer proper direction. Besides the expected positive portrayal, I tried to smuggle some amusement, humour and a drop of content into the poster. The three figures (they were always posted together) were visualizing the slogan \u2018we know it, we dare it, we do it\u2019 analogous to the words of the proverbial three monkeys \u2018I do not see, I do not listen, I do not talk.\u2019",
