            "public_access_description": "Etiquette in the eighteenth century required a lady's hands to be covered at all times when outdoors and with mixed company indoors. This was in part a consequence of female reticence but also reflected the preoccupation with inactivity and social status. No working hand would be gloved in silk and furthermore they protected the hand and arms from sunshine, bronzed skin being an attribute of those who worked outdoors. Mittens were popular as they covered the backs of hands, but left the thumb and fingers free to do needlework or play cards. As an inexpensive alternative to leather, many gloves and mittens were made of silk in a variety of colours to complement gowns and other accessories.\n\nThis pair of mittens in pink silk, are typical in shape and construction. They have a separate thumb and come to an elegant point at the back of the hand which was folded back when worn. The gloves are not lined and all the seams have been embroidered with herring bone stitch. A curved line of embroidery, known as 'faggoting' joins a seam down the inside of the arm, providing decoration and greater freedom of movement. Hand embroidery in contrasting cream silk thread provides floral decoration where the sleeve meets the arm and three lines of 'pointing' along the backs of the hands, imitates a feature of leather glove construction.",
