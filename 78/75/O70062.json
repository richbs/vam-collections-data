He is enthroned and wears a gown and a cloak, with his hands (missing) presumably raised in blessing. Between his knees is the cross bearing the bearded Christ, wearing the torse and a loincloth, his head inclined to the left. The Holy Spirit is not represented, although there is a small dowel hole at the top of the cross by which the Dove was probably attached.\n\nThe hands of God the Father are missing. Traces of darkened green and red paint remain on the cross. There is red in the folds of God the Father's robes and on his crown. There are traces of green paint on the throne. Gilding remains on the hair and beard of God the Father and Christ. Traces of gesso squares remain on the cross. \n\nAlmost the whole of the back of the figure has been scooped away. The bottom has been particularly cut away. There are no holes or plugs.",

He is enthroned and wears a gown and a cloak with his hands presumably raised in blessing. Between his knees there is a cross bearing the bearded Christ, wearing the torse and a loincloth with his head inclined to the left. The Holy Spirit is not represented, although there is a small dowel hole at the top of the cross by which the Dove was probably attached. There are traces of darkened green and red paint. \n\nThere are important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London and England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During the fourteenth and fifteenth century carved alabasters such as this example were exported in very large numbers to Europe.",
