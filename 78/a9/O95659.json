One was E.H.Baily, a sculptor, who had formerly modelled for the Royal Goldsmiths of the Regency, Rundell, Bridge & Rundell.  Paul Storr, who had persuaded him to leave, had also relinquished his direction of one of Rundell\u2019s workshops & gone into partnership with John Mortimer in 1823.  Storr\u2019s firm was eventually styled Hunt & Roskell one of the richest & best known silversmithing concerns of the Victorian era.  They employed several Frenchmen (including the great artist-craftsman Antoine Vechte) and the presence of these designers in their studio probably explains the structural use of wing forms, which was copied from contemporary French sources.",

One was E.H.Baily, a sculptor, who had formerly modelled for the Royal Goldsmiths of the Regency, Rundell, Bridge & Rundell.  Paul Storr, who had persuaded him to leave, had also relinquished his direction of one of Rundell\u2019s workshops & gone into partnership with John Mortimer in 1823.  Storr\u2019s firm was eventually styled Hunt & Roskell one of the richest & best known silversmithing concerns of the Victorian era.  They employed several Frenchmen (including the great artist-craftsman Antoine Vechte) and the presence of these designers in their studio probably explains the structural use of wing forms, which was copied from contemporary French sources.",
