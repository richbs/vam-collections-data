The snakes were the vices for which the players were punished by having to move backwards. The game is generally considered to be a version of the Indian Moksha-Patamu religious instruction game. This version was made in Germany for the British market. Its design follows the more usual pattern of 100 playing spaces. Very moral themes and characters are used as illustrations. For example, Punctuality leads up a ladder to Opulence while Robbery leads down a snake to a beating. The games ends with a scroll of names of people well-known for their hard work and virtue.",
