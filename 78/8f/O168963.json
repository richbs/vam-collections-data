            "physical_description": "Hanging of woven silk and metal thread bordered with panels of voided cut silk velvet with metal thread and woven silk and metal thread braid, backed with block printed cotton, faced with woven cotton and trimmed with metal thread buttons.\nThe main fabric has been pieced down the right hand side.  Silver-gilt strip has been used as an additional weft; in some places this appears to be silver, but the gilt may simply have worn away. The ground is gold and red and is divided into an ogival lattice by pairs of serrated white leaves with a small white flowerhead above and below each segment.  Each segment contains a spray of 3 mauve and white irises in which a red and white bird is sitting.  The birds face left in one row and right in alternate rows. See also 730-1884 for similar fabric.\nButtons: along the upper border, two diagonal seams and the central seam. There is a line of 60 small and 6 large buttons.  Probably made with a core of cotton fibres over which gold wire has been embroidered in an interlacing pattern.\nBraid: bias cut stripe.  Gold ground [silver-gilt strip close S-wound on a yellow silk core] with a fine dark brown meander linking red and pink blossoms, a white bird, a light blue and blue flower and a light grey or dull blue flower.\nVelvet: voided ground which has a silver stripe woven as weft. The design is stripes: very dark blue meander [which has been replaced in the upper corners with green where another piece has been sewn in] with leaves and flowerheads; brown velvet with voided pattern of a chain-like pattern, central stripe of green elongated stars, brown ground with a voided pattern of a leafy straight stem [replaced down the right hand side with voided elongated rosettes] and a repeat of the dark blue.\nBacking: white ground cotton printed with a design of fine curving stems, delicate blue and red flowers and sprays of flowerheads.\nFacing: bias cut, stripes: blue ground with an angular meander in green with red flowers and white ground with less angular meander of green leaves and green flowers with red details.",
