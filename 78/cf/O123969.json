His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nRossini\u2019s opera Le Comte Ory is set in medieval rural France. Countess Ad\u00e8le is alone with her ladies at Castle Formoutiers while the men are away on a Crusade.  Count Ory disguises himself as a hermit and nun to penetrate the Castle so that he can court the Countess.   Appropriately, Messel designed medieval costumes and sets for the production at Glyndebourne in 1954, inspired by fifteenth century French and Netherlandish decorative art and paintings.\n\nMessel designed a dark purple costume for Isolier, Count Ory\u2019s page, who is in love with Countess Ad\u00e8le.  He disguises himself as the Countess in Act II, deceiving the Count into courting him.   Messel\u2019s notes for this scene stipulate \u2018disguise as Countess with chiffon veil\u2019.

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed at the Edinburgh International Festival by the Glyndebourne Festival Society on 23 August, 1954.  It was directed by Carl Ebert; choreography by Pauline Grant and featured Bruscantini as Raimbaud and Oncina as Count Ory.  It was revived in 1955, 1957 and 1958 at Glyndebourne and in 1958 in Paris.  Roger Pinkham has said of this production that \u201cMessel concentrated on such designs as are found in the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries, and in Flemish and Netherlandish painting.\u201d (Pinkham, ed., 1983)\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His work for Glyndebourne in this period is regarded as some of his best designs.",
