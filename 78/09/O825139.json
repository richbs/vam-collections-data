The text is as follows: SCHOOL UNKNOWN: mid 16th century 525 Fragment of a cartoon: a horse's head, bridled: beneath the mouth a clenched hand, presumably holding a rein, and on the right, scarcely distinguishable, one or two human heads Inscribed on the back in a modern hand 'Gaudenza Ferrari'; in another hand 'Da Vinci Leonardo'; and in a third hand 'Richardson's sale/Dr. Wellesly sale/Lord Spencer's sale' Black chalk and wash 23 3/8 x 17 \u00bc (594 x 438) E.4029-1919 PROVENANCE]. Richardson, Sr (Lugt 2184 and, on the back, 2984); Lord Spencer (Lugt 1531); Dr H. Wellesley; Sir ]. Knowles (sale, Christie, 28 May 1908, lot 206, as RaphaeI, bought by Webb, \u00a32-5-0); Bernard Webb Bequest 1919 The old attribution to RaphaeI, recorded in the catalogue of the Knowles sale, had lapsed when the cartoon entered the Museum, and the name of Gaudenzio Ferrari was adopted instead. The attribution to RaphaeI was presumably founded on the resemblance to the head of the Pope's horse in RaphaeI's fresco of the meeting between Leo I and Attila (in the Vatican). The correspondence, though close enough to suggest a connection with RaphaeI's fresco, is not exact in every detail. The two horses' heads are set at slightly different angles; the hand of the man leading the Pope's horse in the fresco is not in the same position as the hand in the cartoon; and the two heads on the right of the cartoon (if they arc heads, for this part of the sheet is very rubbed and indistinct) correspond with nothing in the fresco: ' indeed, the presence of these two human heads on the same level as the horse's head would entail a radical change in the design of the fresco. The drawing is inferior to the fragment of a cartoon in the Ashmolean Museum which shows the head of the horse in the Heliodorus freseo (Parker, Ashmolean Catalogue, p. 300, no. 556; pi. 135; illustrated in The Burlington Magazine, II, 1907, p. 385).",
