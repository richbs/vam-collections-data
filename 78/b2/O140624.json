He began to exhibit independently from about 1901 and developed an interest in stoneware a year or two later, experimenting with more demanding glazes such as high temperature flamm\u00e9es. He opened his own studio-workshop at Fontenay-aux-Roses (Seine) in 1907, moving into porcelain - as did several of his contemporaries. Towards the end of his life he worked at S\u00e8vres from 1939-42 and remained as consultant to the factory until 1948. Over a long career, Decoeur played an important part in French artistic and studio ceramics, specialising in thick, matt glazes in creamy greys, greens, blues and pinks. From around 1910, he introduced a variety of ornamental techniques like incising or carving, as well as painting in thick slip (liquid clay) as on this vase.  Changing his decorative style to match the fashions of the times, this vase suggests 1920s Art Deco.",
