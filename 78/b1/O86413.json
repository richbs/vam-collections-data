She stands on  a grassy foreground with flowering plants on either side of her.  Below her is a stretch of water  with lily pads and flowers similar to that in the opposite page (IS.48:21/B-1956) which may have been added later as it is painted in a cruder style. She is set against a pale green background which rises up behind her to a notional sky indicated  by streaks of mauve and clouds at the top painted in washes of orange, yellow and dark blue heightened with white. Skeins of birds are seen flying in the clouds with a few lower down in the sky below.\n   The lady is dressed in a red skirt with a banded hem in green and gold dots over which she wears a diaphanous overskirt decorated with dots and stylised floral motifs in gold with a gold hem and a yellow central panel. Her red-heeled feet have red and gold slippers on them.  Over her upper body and across the back of her head she wears a transparent yellow <i>odhani</i> (veil) with gold dots and edging, one end of which falls over her left shoulder and hangs down her back while the other end is clasped in her right hand. Under this she wears a tight, short sleeved red <i>choli</i> (blouse) edged in green with a golden ruffle on its lower edge under her breasts.  She is richly adorned with jewellery including bangles, arm bracelets, anklets, finger rings, a pearl choker and necklaces, pearl earring and attached head ornament and a crossed pearl body ornament with a green gem clasp in the middle.\n   The painting has an inner mount of a pinky-brown colour decorated with a scrolling floral pattern outlined in gold, black and white with an outer line in blue.  The outer border is ivory-coloured and decorated with a row of pink lilies and red poppies outlined in gold. The outer edges of the page have strips of blue paper collaged onto them with an inner white outline, while the inner left hand margin has a strip of grey paper stuck to it acting as a gutter for the album binding.",
