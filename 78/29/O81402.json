Pins were used to attach clothing as well as for hair. Pin cushions are often stuffed with an abrasive such as emery powder to clean the pins.\n\n\n\nPeople\n\nA silver toilet service was often a gift to a bride from a wealthy groom. This pin cushion is part of a service (Museum nos. 240&A to M-1879) that was bought for Julia Blackett, the eldest daughter of Sir William Blackett, by her intended husband Sir Walter Calverley. This is recorded in his diary: 'On Tuesday, the 17th of January, 1706-7 I was married to Miss Julia Blackett...I and my mother were at the cost of a fine set of dressing plate for my wife, came to 116l. odd money...'.\n\n\n\nRecent research has identified the silversmith, whose mark 'WF' is found on this service, as William Fowle (1658-1684). He was apprenticed to the well-known silversmith, Arthur Manwaring, and went into business independently in 1681. He specialised in making toilet services.\n\n\n\nSocial Class\n\nMatching sets of toilet silver originated in 17th-century France in conjunction with the custom of the lev\u00e9e. This was a practice popular among the upper classes, in which friends and family would be invited to witness the dressing and adornment of noble ladies.",
