Women of all classes of society would have made such needlecases; only the materials used would have varied. Both practical and decorative needlework played an important part in women's lives, in the management of households and in the making, mending and decoration of clothes.  Steel needles were essential equipment, and were carefully stored in such decorated needle cases.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe needle case has been constructed as a folder with leaves and pockets inside. The outside is covered in a silk and linen fabric closely striped with metal strip. One side has a pear shape in semi-relief, with green velvet appliqu\u00e9 leaves. The other side has a pocket containing scissors. On the inside is a mirror, bound with gilt braid; two leaves of red felted wool, scalloped and edged with twisted gilt thread, attached to the case by being sewn onto a piece of pink ribbon; and two pockets covered in a fragment of rich dress silk brocaded with strips of silver thread. Other fabrics which appear in the linings are plain-woven green and pink silks, and unpatterned silver tissue.",
