It also bears the date 1601, when new legislation relating to capacity came into effect. The rim is stamped with a crowned 'I', indicating that the gallon capacity was verified by an inspector.\n\nOwnership & Use\nMeasures of capacity have a long history. The gallon is first mentioned in England in about 1266 and the pint was established before 1474. One way to avoid fraudulent measure was to have a standard measure with an exact capacity that could be verified and stamped. Standard measures were made in a heavy, durable material such as bronze and kept safe by the local council. When a dispute over measurement of wine or beer arose, a standard measure was used to establish the true capacity of a particular vessel.\n\nHistory\nThe gallon standard issued in 1601 under Elizabeth I was based on standards set by Henry VII in 1496. After 1300 two types of gallon measure are found. One was based on dry measure, which was eight pounds of wheat, and the other was a liquid measure equivalent to eight pounds of wine. Gallons were used to measure corn, wheat, ale and wine.\n\n",
