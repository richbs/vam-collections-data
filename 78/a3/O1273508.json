These were not elaborate  pieces but well made and well used. Glass production in the  mid-19th century expanded rapidly with glass making  centres old and new increasing their output to meet rising  consumer demand for smart, functional, clear-glass  tableware.  This particular glass is of a shape in production  from c.1860, a type not well represented in museum  collections, including the V&amp;A, having not being considered  fine art objects at the time of production. \nGoblets of the period, like this example, often have thick  bowl walls. This was not because the glass makers could not  make the finer wares, but due to the preference for solid  styles and also for the consumption of hot drinks. Such was  the fashion for hot alcoholic drinks in the mid- to late-19th  century these glasses would need to withstand the constant  use and change of temperature, particularly when hot  pokers were sometimes thrust into the liquid. The addition of the inscription by or for the owner  demonstrates the popularity and use of this shape into the  1870s. It is unusual to find examples inscribed and dated in  this way, possibly intended as a gift or for personal use by  \u2018G. B Clegg\u2019. Generally dated engravings match quite closely with the attributed date of the glass, as is the case  with this piece.",
