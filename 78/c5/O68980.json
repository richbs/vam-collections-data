The head of Thetis is represented in profile to the right.  She holds up a fold of drapery in her raised left hand.  A second piece of drapery is threaded between her thighs and held in place by her right arm.  The bun in Thetis's hair has been carved separately and pinned in place.\nThe head of Triton is sliced across the right temple and her right shoulder is partially cut off.  The base is not finished at the back.  Missing areas on the left suggest it was once juxtaposed with a moulding on the left side.  The upper part of the drapery held in the right hand and the lower part of the drapery held in the left hand have been broken off.",
