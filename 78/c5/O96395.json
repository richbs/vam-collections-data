With its heavy stock and long barrel it required a gun-rest for accuracy. Firearms were not universally welcomed as hunting weapons as it was feared the traditional skills of close pursuit might be lost.\n\nMatch lock petronels of this type were produced in quantity in Western Europe and in the absence of internal evidence, it is difficult to attribute one to a particular region. The barrels very often bear the mark of the Thuringian town of Suhl. Petronels of this type with strongly hooked butts are shown in woodcuts by J\u00f6st Amman of N\u00fcrnberg and his contemporaries. The tentative French attribution is based on the similarity of the inlay work to that of French wheel lock pistols of the period.",

With its heavy stock and long barrel it required a gun-rest for accuracy. Firearms were not universally welcomed as hunting weapons as it was feared the traditional skills of close pursuit might be lost.\n\nMatch lock petronels of this type were produced in quantity in Western Europre and in the absence of internal evidence, it is difficult to attribute one to a particular region. The barrels very often bear the mark of the Thuringian town of Suhl. Petronels of this type with strongly hooked butts are shown in woodcuts by J\u00f6st Amman of N\u00fcrnberg and his contemporaries. The tentative French attribution is based on the similarity of the inlay work to that of French wheel lock pistols of the period.",
