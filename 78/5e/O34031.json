It hangs from the waist, at the rear of an ensemble worn either for ancestral ritual, or for making morning obeisance to the king.  Its design consists of two columns of four embroidered flying cranes of blues and whites. Above the cranes is a decorative border including a pair of gold-coloured rings, and below it blue silk netting and a fringe are attached. Most husu are made of silk satin, so this woollen example is unusual. It is made of wool, embroidered with silk thread, lined with silk plain weave fabric and interlined with two layers of Korean paper.",
