The taste for using illusionistic painted figures as a form of house decoration probably originated in the trompe l\u2019oeil, or life-like interior scenes painted by Dutch artists in the early 17th century. Dummy boards continued to be produced into the 19th century. They were placed in corners and on stairways to surprise visitors, or in front of empty fireplaces in the summer. Most were made by professional sign-painters, who also produced the hanging street signs prevalent until the late 18th century.\n\nThis example has the proportions of a child and probably shows a boy, to judge by his boyish face, close-cropped hair and the feather in his right hand which might be an arrow. He also holds something in his left hand, possibly a bow. His clothes indicate a date of 1610 to 1625, when aristocratic boys frequently wore dresses beyond infancy.",

Aristocratic boys were dressed in skirts beyond infancy in the early 17th century. Once they started wearing breeches they passed from their mother's exclusive care.  Boys in portraits were usually given male attributes such as bows and arrows.  This boy holds a feather in his right hand, possibly an arrow, and an indistinguishable object in his left, possibly a bow.  His hair is short and his face boyish.  Girls in portraits, in contrast, had more elaborate hairstyles, often wore jewellery and held female attributes such as flowers or birds.",
