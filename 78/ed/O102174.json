It was worn by Barker\u2019s wife, Lillah McCarthy, who was playing Helena.\n\nWilkinson designed a flattering silk dress, based on Greek sources, but given a contemporary spin. The under-dress is silk, the skirt stencilled with a stylised floral spray in pink, and the matching tunic has silver lame infill to the neck and a deep macrame fringe. Both the tunic and dress are weighted with a fringe of tiny silver balls. The costume shows imagination and simplicity in contrast to 19th century literal realism. This is \u2018realistic\u2019 but pared to essentials and given a very English decorative twist.\n\nwww.peopleplayuk.org"

            "public_access_description": "Harley Granville Barker (1877-1946) was an established director and promoter of contemporary drama when he directed three of Shakespeare's plays at the Savoy Theatre. His productions of The Winter's Tale, Twelfth Night (both 1912) and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1914) have passed into theatre history. At a time when West End audiences were accustomed to the pictorial Shakespeare staged by Beerbohm Tree, Barker's approach came as something of a shock. He did away with painted 'realistic' scenery and elaborately reconstructed historical costume. Instead he and his designer, Norman Wilkinson (1882-1934), indicated location by using simple stylised scenery and painted curtains, and the costumes, by Wilkinson or Albert Rothenstein, suggested period dress but did not attempt to imitate it.  \n\nBarker's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream became famous for its presentation of the fairies as otherworldly beings with gilded faces. The play's mortal characters wore costumes loosely based on Grecian dress. Norman Wilkinson designed two outfits for Helena, who was played by Barker's then wife, Lillah McCarthy. For her first scene, and later in the wood near Athens, she appeared in a dress of white cr\u00eape-de-chine with a stencilled border. There were two cloaks, one in grey, the other in green lined with white. The costume described here is her second dress, also of white cr\u00eape-de-chine, worn for the wedding celebrations in the final scene. Its cut and shape are based on classical sources but Wilkinson used pink stencilled flowers to create a look that was modern and English. The costume was completed with mauve shoes and red beads, and Helena's long blonde tresses were decorated with a wreath of flowers. The Savoy Theatre account book, also in the V&A Theatre Collections, gives the total price of both costumes and the accessories as \u00a323 6s 9\u00bd d.",
