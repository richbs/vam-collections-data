            "public_access_description": "Tea caddies are small boxes used to store loose tea leaves.  Originally called 'canisters', the term changed to caddy after about 1800 and this word is thought to derive from the Malay word 'kati' which means a measure of wieight equivalent to about half a kilogram.  Tea-drinking was introduced into Britain in the late seventeenth century and by the end of the eighteenth century it was widespread.  \n\nDrinking tea was a social activity and domestic tea caddies were often elaborately decorated.  They were available in many different shapes, sizes and colours and were often embellished with painted scenes and motifs, or veneers and inlays in all manner of  materials such as ivory, mother-of-pearl or exotic wood.  This example has been veneered with satinwood, inlaid with ebony stringing and then painted.  Although the foliate bands around the base and lid have been painted straight onto the wood, each of the medallions has been painted on paper and then stuck onto the front of the caddy with glue.  The Grecian-style robes and pastoral settings depicted in the medallions are typical of the fashion for classical antiquity which was at its height at the end of the eighteenth century.  Similar motifs can also be found on ceramics and in paintings of the same period.",
