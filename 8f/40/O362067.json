            "physical_description": "Carpet of knotted pile and flat-weave. Narrow border along all four sides. Knotted pile in the form of zigzags. The field is made up of 15 main bands. \nNumbering them from the bottom they are:\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 - a band of cream plain weave with three stepped triangles in coloured pile.\n2, 4, 10, 14 - a band of dark brown plain weave with three stepped triangles in coloured pile.\n4 and 12 - a band of coloured pile which is divided into five squares each of which contains two opposed hooked triangles. Those of band 4 are worked in mid-brown and those of band 12 in dark brown. These two bands lie between narrower bands, one of weft-faced patterning and one of pile on each side.\n8 - a broad band of coloured pile which contains five stepped lozenges. There is a narrow band of pile and one of weft-faced patterning on either side of this.\n\nWARP: 2ZS wool, brown and cream twisted together. 12 threads per inch (5 per cm).\nWEFT: Cream wool and dark brown wool. 56 wefts per inch (20 per cm); 16 shoots of weft between each row of knots.\nKNOT: Symmetrical tied around two warp threads. 24 knots per square inch (252 per d.cm). Wool pile. Red, green, yellow, white, blue, mid-brown and dark brown colours.\nSIDE FINISH: Two cords woven around separately with the weft.\nBOTTOM FINISH: Warp threads looped around a brown weft. Then 1 cm plain weave in cream, 1 cm cream and brown chevrons and 1 cm cream plain weave.\nTOP FINISH: 1 cm band with thick brown weft, one pass of brown twinned weft and one of cream, 1 cm band with thick brown weft. This has been turned along the line of the twinning and stitched in place. Brown wool has been sewn along the fold to form a single-knot fringe, the ends of which have not been cut but have been looped into the knot.\nAlthough the bands of weft-faced patterning continue across the entire width, the designs have been simplified in the border area to make it easier to knot the border design.",
