It was known in the trade as a 'closed tab shoe' because the eyelet tabs (the sections of leather with holes for the laces) were stitched under the front section of the shoe, or vamp,  rather than on top of it.  Shoes where the eyelet tabs were stitched on top of the vamp were known as 'open-tab' shoes and this was the case for 'Derby', 'Blucher' and 'Gibson' styles.\n\nUsually Oxfords were made up in plain black or brown leather for everyday wear.  British men's footwear fashions were conservative during the 1930s with strict rules dictating what shoe could be worn with which outfit.  Brown shoes with a dinner suit were frowned upon and any kind of flamboyance was considered distasteful.  These elegant two-tone shoes would have been considered somewhat daring compared to more traditional single colour styles.",
