Cap and container each in portions joined by raised seams.  Shut-over cap consisting of one pair of layers, the outer decorated partly in the romanesque style, and fitted at the ends with round eyes, corresponding with Eyes on the container, for a thong, long wanting.\n\nEmbushment container consisting of one pair of layers (the outer decorated in relief in the romanesque style) and of three inner layers.\n\nTop and ends decorated with a hatched pattern.\n\nOn the front of the cap, 2 panels containing a hare pursued by a hound.  On the front of the container four square panels containing one the upper tier (1) the Agnus Dei and (2) a horse passant (?) and in the lower tier (3-4), confronting quadrupeds.  On the rear of the case a semee [sem\u00e9e, powdered] of branched roundels, six by six, each containing a bird (dove for grace?)\n\nNo lining\n\nITALIAN; about 14th century\n\nGiven by Dr W.L. Hildburgh F.S.A.\n\nGeneral Remarks\n\nIron hinges of date about the 15th century affixed to the cap at a pristine date probably to replace the wanting thong and to prevent loss of the cap.  Acquired by donor in Italy.\n\nNo negative (1956)",
