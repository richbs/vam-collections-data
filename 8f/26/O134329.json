Edmond De Schampheleer (1824-1899) was a Belgian Realist painter of landscapes. He was a student of Eug\u00e8ne De Block in Antwerp and also spent time in Barbizon and Munich. His time in Barbizon encouraged a 'plein air' approach, that is, direct observation and recording of nature and transitory effects of light or at least the impression of such and of having been painted out of doors. De Schampheleer also painted in Gelderland, Holland where he developed a style which looked back to the  17th century Dutch landscape tradition. In 1869, De Schampeleer became knight in the Order of King Leopold. He contributed to several exhibitions and obtained gold medals at the Munich Salon of 1864, Brussels in 1866, Berlin in 1872 and Paris in 1877.",

He was a student of Eug\u00e8ne De Block in Antwerp and also spent time in Barbizon and Munich. His time in Barbizon encouraged a 'plein air' approach, that is, direct observation and recording of nature and transitory effects of light or at least the impression of such and of having been painted out of doors. De Schampheleer also painted in Gelderland, Holland where he developed a style which looked back to the  17th century Dutch landscape tradition. In 1869, De Schampeleer became knight in the Order of King Leopold. He contributed to several exhibitions and obtained gold medals at the Munich Salon of 1864, Brussels in 1866, Berlin in 1872 and Paris in 1877.",

            "historical_context_note": "Landscape paintings were extremely popular during the 17th century and increasingly encompassed a variety of forms and genres. Dutch painters in particular were inspired to paint nature, both their familiar surroundings as well as more exotic locales, the most popular being Italy. In the early 1600s, innovative contributions to landscape paintings were made, especially by the marine painters who concentrated on the changing effects of light according to atmospheric conditions and perspective and had a considerable impact on the appearance of landscape painting. Towards the end of the 17th century, a shift in taste is detected in favour of more academic and classical landscapes inspired by Italianate paintings and often employed as settings for mythological or historical subjects. By the end of the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries, Dutch artists returned to the tradition of 17th century landscape and genre painting and imitated the great painters of the Golden Age. This trend flourished in particular with the Hague school (1870-90) before coming to an end with the beginning of Impressionism.",
