The carving has straight edges along the top and bottom but is carved along the form of the figure in her setting on the sides. She is seated on a rounded stool decorated with a studded diaper pattern. She turns her head towards the small animal seated in the crook of her left elbow. Her right hand is held up holding what appears to be a fruit, possibly a jackfruit, with its textured skin carved in segmented lines. Her head is set against a background of further carved lines possibly denoting fruits and foliage. She wears a large hooped earrring in her right ear with bangles on her wrists and a long segmented necklace which falls between her breasts. Her garment is shown falling off her right shoulder and is caught up under her breasts and at her waist before falling to the ground in folds over her legs.  She sits with her left leg slanting back from her knee while the right one is turned outwards with the bare foot resting against the stool, just touching the ground with her toes. The features of her face appear largely rubbed away. leaving her with a vestigal right eye above a flattened nose and a smiling mouth.",
