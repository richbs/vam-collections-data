            "public_access_description": "This poster is a colour lithograph.  A lithograph is a picture made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance like chalk. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper.  To make a colour lithograph, a separate printing surface is required for each colour. \n\nDudley Hardy made his name originally as a painter and illustrator. His bold venture into poster design in the 1890s gave him scope for all sorts of unconventional ideas.  Although he was influenced by designers of  the French 'artistic' poster, such as Jules Ch\u00e9ret, he developed a characteristically English approach with his simplified style and integrated lettering. After his initial success with a poster nicknamed 'The Yellow Girl', advertising the To-Day magazine, many of his earliest posters were commissioned  for theatrical productions by the well-known firm of publishers Waterlow & Sons.",
