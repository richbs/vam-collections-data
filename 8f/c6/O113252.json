They conducted a great deal of research into finding suitable toys for each stage of a child's development. They opened a child-friendly shop designed by architect and friend Erno Goldfinger at 94 Wimpole Street London in 1936 in response to a huge demand for their products. This dolls' house is important in that it was one of very few designed, at this time, in such a way that more than one child could play with it. This made it suitable for nursery school, as well as home, play. The Abbatts also supplied furniture by Dol-Toi Ltd. to equip the house in the latest style.",
