            "physical_description": "Coverlet and two panels of green satin decorated with applied motifs of linen embroidered with silver thread in laid and couched work, and with red and black floss silk and metal thread in couched work.\n\nThe standard of the couched work on the motifs is extremely high with very subtle shading effects indicating plumage on the birds and detail on the faces of the female figures. The quality of this work, combined with the design of the motifs, particularly the female figures and the dragons, suggest that the linen-backed motifs were embroidered in China.\n\nHowever, the tree, cloud and rock details which support the applied motifs and which are couched directly on to the ground fabric, are not as finely worked; the metal thread is of lesser quality and the floss silk embroidery has been used in many places to distort the pure Chinese style of the motifs.\n[Panel] Coverlet made from two pieces of satin joined horizontally, 17 ins from the bottom. Below the join, the satin is mounted on its side and, although the motifs have been symmetrically arranged as for a valance, they have been completely re-couched through the satin and the canvas lining. Above the join, only the details of trees and rocks are worked through both layers and the motifs have been applied haphazardly, as though the original design was not completed and the pieces used were added at a later date. Lined with silk.\n\nThe motifs include dragons, female figures, phoenix, pheasant, peacock, cranes and singing birds. A quilted border, 4 ins wide, made from the same green satin has been added round the edges, cutting across the top row of motifs. \n[Panel] Panel of two joined lengths of satin, both wedge shaped with straight inner edges along the seam and outer edges which flare out towards the bottom. The seam is undone for the top 31 ins (approx. 79cm). Framing tapes are attached to the top edges and the two motifs  applied to the upper part of the panel are paired, symmetrically applied and worked well; the lower part of the panel is decorated with haphazardly applied motifs, less well applied and in many places distorted by the silk embroidery. Two of the female figures on this panel have hair worked in black silk, and there is one representation of 'The Queen Mother of the Western World,' mounted on a phoenix. The panel is not lined.\n[Panel] Straight length of satin with framing tapes attached to one end where three motifs; two ladies and a pair of birds, have been carefully applied and decorated with rocaille details, directly on to the satin ground. The remainder of the panel is unworked except for a tiny fragment of embroidery, which has been cut through on the lower edge. The panel is unlined.",
