The brim is wide with a raised lip and banded ornamentation. The first band (closest to the lip) consists of a frieze of stylised straight-sided four-leaved flowers. Band two is a simple incised line. Band 3 is a wide band of stylised fans. The central medallion is attached to the wide brim with shellac. On the reverse of the dish there are markings done in ink with incised lines that seem to indicate join marks between the brim and medallion. The ink markings appear to be different border types and are marked numerically.",
