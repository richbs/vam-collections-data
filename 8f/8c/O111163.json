Paul McCartney (b.1942) was the bass guitar player and one of its two major song-writers.  Famous for his songs including Yesterday and She Loves You, Paul McCartney went on to form the group Wings, and to continue as a successful solo artist.  In 2004 he and his backing band headlined at the Glastonbury Festival, forty years after The Beatles originally shot to success.\n\nThe earliest examples of Beatles' merchandising were produced in the United States, after the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein sold licensing rights to Seltaeb, the American company whose name spelt Beatles backwards. After a flood of successful Beatles items from stockings to talcum powder, Epstein realised the lucrative potential of the market and kept firm control of all future licensing. This tile is one of a set of five produced in England, one representing each individual band member and one showing the group.",
