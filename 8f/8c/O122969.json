            "public_access_description": "This vase is by the French ceramicist Ernest Chaplet (1835-1909). From the age of 12, Chaplet began his training at S\u00e8vres in decoration, design and ceramic techniques.  He later worked at Choisy-le-Roi, for the Laurin pottery at Bourg-la-Reine and then for the Limoges company Charles Haviland & co. in a pottery established in Auteuil, Paris. In 1885 Haviland set him up in rue Blomet, Vaugirard, a workshop that was ceded to him in 1886. From then on Chaplet worked independently, moving back to Choisy-le-Roi in 1887 where he became increasingly preoccupied with porcelain and the high temperature glazes in which he specialised, experimenting endlessly. \n\nThe distinctive colouring of this vase demonstrates Chaplet's interest in glaze effects and is inspired by Chinese ceramics. The high-temperature copper-red flamm\u00e9e glazes of 18th century Chinese porcelain became the subject of intensive research and experiment in the years around 1900, both by factories and individual makers. Their re-creation depended entirely on the potter's knowledge of chemistry as well as his skill at firing these dramatic and unpredictable glazes. The technique produced a range of colours from a deep bright red through a spectrum of violet, blue, green, purple and combinations of all of these. Chaplet kept his own recipes a closely guarded secret. Towards the end of his life, when blindness brought his career as a potter to its end, Chaplet destroyed all his notebooks. His ceramics were highly prized by his contemporaries and many were set with silver mounts, emphasising their precious quality.",

He became a highly skilled ceramicist working in potteries at Choisy-le-Roi and Bourg-la-Reine and then for the Limoges manufacturers, the Haviland brothers at a new workshop in Auteuil. In 1881 Haviland provided him with a studio at rue Blomet, Vaugirard, Paris.  There he developed high temperature glazes on porcelain, and on stoneware. In 1886 he bought the workshop and concentrated on these glazes, as an independent potter, keeping his glazes recipes and firing temperatures a closely-guarded secret.  He was regarded by his contemporaries as the consummate ceramicist. Chaplet sold the workshop to August Delaherche in 1887 and moved back to Choisy-le-Roi where he specialised in porcelain.",

He began to experiment at a workshop in Rue Vaugirard in Paris ceded to him by Haviland's. He exhibited his first successful pieces at L'Union Centrale in 1887 when he moved to Choisy-le-Roi. Expert interest was aroused and his reputation as a master of flamb\u00e9 glazes grew. He was awarded a Grand Prix at the Paris 1900 Exhibition.",
