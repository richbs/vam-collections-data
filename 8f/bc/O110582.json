            "physical_description": "The doublet is made of leather with a suede finish, embroidered with black silk.  It bears a high collar, shoulder wings and long narrow-fitting sleeves. The waist is several inches above the natural level at the back and sides, curving to a low point at the centre front.  There are eight waist tabs.  The doublet is embroidered all over in a design of small flowers and leaves arranged in panels running the length of the garment.  The embroidery is worked in raised satin stitch, French knots, couching and stem stitch with black silk twist.  Originally the doublet was lined with salmon pink taffeta but has been later relined with brown silk.  Belly pieces reinforcing the lower front edges are stiffened, probably with whalebone and layers of linen.  The doublet is fastened down the centre front with 30 buttonholes and three on the collar.  All 33 buttons are now missing.  Nine buttonholes on each sleeve fastened at the wrist; all 18 buttons are missing.  Four modern hooks and eyes have been attached to the belly piece for display purposes.   An interior lacing band at the waist of silk-covered linen bears 46 eyelets reinforced with stitching.",

The compact design of stylised floral and leaf shapes incorporates raised satin stitch, French knots, couching and stem stitch. Black silk twist has been embroidered over understitching in brown linen for a raised effect.\nThe use of leather for a doublet usually indicates an informal garment for outdoor wear, for example hunting or travelling. The very fine embroidery and fashionable style of this example, however implies that it was worn by a member of the aristocracy. The black dye of the embroidery may not have been colourfast, so it is possible the doublet was meant for informal day wear. A high waistline, close-fitting sleeves and the size of the waist tabs are characteristic of the period.",
