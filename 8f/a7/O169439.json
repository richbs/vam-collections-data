Using elaborate staging and dramatic lighting, he elevates everyday occurrences beyond the realm of banality, heightening our awareness of the psychology and emotion contained in real-life situations. This photograph is from a series made between 1990 and 1992 (during the height of awareness of the AIDS epidemic) in an area of Santa Monica frequented by male prostitutes and drug addicts. In this series, having selected and set up the scene in advance, diCorcia would find a man on the street and offer to pay him to appear in the photograph: the sitter\u2019s name, place of birth and the amount paid forms the title of each photograph. However, despite the implication of this transaction and the apparently factual information supplied by each caption, diCorcia \u2013 and therefore the viewer \u2013 is never quite sure whether or not the men are prostitutes. Each carefully-planned image is a deliberate fiction, albeit one that refers to an actual encounter. The resulting images are ambiguous, uncertain and as a result imbued with tension.",
