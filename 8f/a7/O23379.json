The kimono is of the usual construction but without the addition of extra material at either side of the front opening. The straight neckband extends to the hem and there is a short overcollar of wavy cr\u00eape material. The sleeves are open all the way up at the wrist side although on the right side there is an oversewn stitch halfway along the edge. At the body side the sleeves are left open until they join the main garment body.\nThe entire kimono is made up of different patchwork pieces, mostly rectangular in shape. Most of them either self-patterned or printed in imitation of resist-dyed designs or other motifs. A few pieces are of woven checks. The predominant colours are turquoise, grey, black and yellow with some pinky-beige and purple. There are few reds.\nThe lining, although not patchwork as such, is made up of several different materials and trimmings. The main garment body down to knee level and the sleeves are lined with cream plain weave silk. Below knee level, the lining is of black plain weave material. Both the cream and black material have lines of machine stitching on them, some of which serve to repair holes. The inside hem is trimmed with a blue self-patterned ribbon with a scalloped edge. The same ribbon in grey trims the upper inside edge of the cuffs, and in addition the sleeves have a deeper inside cuff lining of patterned grey material. The sleeve opening towards the body is faced on the inside with a red plain weave silk, while the seam opening opposite the sleeve is faced with mauve plain weave silk.",
