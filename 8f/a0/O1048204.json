Inscription (verso): No 37 135 x 103 mm PH 457-1968:524 Series 51 Literature:  Microfilm: 3.19.487 Lord and Lady Hawarden's mutual commitment is evident in her photographs. They married without his parents' approval, and, as her uncle observed, their 'marriage when they were very ill off was a proof of their attachment at the time & [ ... ] the difficulties they have gone through together [have] only tended to strengthen the tie.' [Mountstuart Elphinstone to Catalina Paulina Katon, 4 October 1850. Polwarth collection.] The 'difficulties' were financial, and ended when Lord Hawarden came into his inheritance in 1856. An important aspect of their devotion to each other appears to have been his interest in her photography. Lady Hawarden photographed her husband posing with cameras several times. The camera in this photograph appears to be a Horne & Thornethwaite folding model, with lens and plate-holder removed. However, as Lewis Carroll observed after a visit to the Hawardens' home in July 1864, Lord Hawarden was 'not a photographer himself.' [C.L. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), 'Private Journal ( \u2022\u2022\u2022 ) \" diary entry, 24 July 1864 (manuscript). British Museum Add. 54343.] Evidently though, he actively supported his wife in her work. His interest in photography may be gauged by his heavy investment in a short-lived venture, the United Association of Photography, in 1864. [See 'Memorandum of Association of the United Association of Photography Limited'. Public Record Office, Kew, BT 31/997/1537c.] He was elected to the Photographic Society of London after Lady Hawarden's death, in 1865. ['Minutes of General Meetings' (manuscript), 212.
