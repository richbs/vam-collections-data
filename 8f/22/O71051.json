So-called cabaret sets or d\u00e9jeuners  consisted of  complete services on a tray for just one or two people. The S\u00e8vres factory gave  them the most luxurious treatment, since its patrons were the wealthiest  members of French society. The service was orginally owned by a German  aristocrat, Christian IV, Duke of Zweibr\u00fccken (1722-1775).\n\nRosalind Savill has researched this interesting service and discovered that  Christian IV, known as the duc des Deux-Ponts  in France, actually bought four  d\u00e9jeuners  on 14th June 1775, costing an exorbitant 840 livres each.  They all had  the most expensive type of decoration, a richly gilded ground colour and  decoration of miniature painted scenes.  The Duke was a great francophile and we  know he also loved porcelain.  He actually had his own porcelain factory in  Zweibr\u00fccken, whose mark was his PZ monogram.  It operated from 1767 until the  Duke's death in 1775.  Two of the other three services have been traced in  auction house records and are presumably in private hands today.  They were  identified by their distinctive PN monogram - it appears the S\u00e8vres gilder mistook  the Duke's PZ  monogram for PN .",
