Japanese bronze casting techniques were enhanced by the introduction of western technology brought in by the Italian bronze sculptor Vincenzo Ragusa who was employed by the Tokyo Art School from 1876-1882.\n\nIn 1907 the government instituted and sponsored the \u2018Bunten\u2019 painting and sculpture competition and the work of western-style sculptors began to be officially recognised. A group of artists began to develop away from the more academic style of European sculpture towards the romantic realism of Rodin. Many Japanese artists travelled to Europe to study firsthand at the ateliers of Western artists and Fujikawa Yuzo (1882-1935) studied under Rodin for a period.  \n\nNaturalistic human figures in bronze were rare in Japan prior to the 19th century although portrait figures in wood (and occasionally bronze) were produced from around the 9th century. However, the idea of a sculpture of the naked female form as art object would have been totally alien to the Japanese prior to the Meiji period (1868-1912). The sculpture has the chiselled signature of \u2018Hiroaki\u2019 and a cast monogram of an intersected \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019 which may be the foundry mark. Neither have yet been positively identified and it is even conceivable that a Japanese artist could have made the piece in Europe. A scrap of Japanese newspaper with a date of 1915 was found inside the base of the sculpture so we do know that the piece has spent at least some time in Japan.",
