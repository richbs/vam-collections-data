During the 1950s he designed for the major Italian theatre and opera companies and in 1960 joined director Franco Enriquez and actors, Valeria Moriconi and Glauco Mauri, to found La Compagnia dei Quattro (The Company of Four) which became famous for its productions of Absurdist drama. Luzzati frequently collaborated with Enriquez and when Enriquez was invited to direct The Magic Flute for Glyndebourne in 1963, Luzzati provided the sets and brightly coloured costumes. His fairy tale style delighted reviewers and brought him international attention. Luzzati remained fascinated by The Magic Flute.  In 1971 he produced an illustrated storybook which re-told the opera for children and in 1978 designed a 55-minute animated film version.",
