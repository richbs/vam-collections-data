According to Heike Monogatari (Tales of the Heike), and the Genpei Seisuiki (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and Taira clans), Minamoto no Yoshitsune's army appeared so formidable to the Heike that they took to the sea to escape and here Yoshitsune is shown on the beach preparing to advance to the sea. This is probably one of the earliest depictions of a scene which became a common theme in ukiyo-e.\nLimited colour woodblock print: Benizuri-e. Large hosoban size. Signature: Gako Torii Kiyohiro.

This scene depicts an event just before the battle of Yashima in 1185, which preceded the final battle between the Taira and Minamoto clans at Dannoura.\n\nMinamoto no Yoshitsune  was one of the major figures in the Taira-Minamoto Wars of 1180-1185. He has been immortalized in legend as Japan's foremost tragic hero. Although Japan was growing more stable during his lifetime, allegiances changed rapidly and eventually Yoshitsune was forced to commit suicide by his brother Yoritomo. Allegedly a handsome young man, Yoshitsune\u2019s tragic life history appealed to the Japanese and many stories and legends developed around him.",
