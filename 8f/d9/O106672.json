They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. This is a cast from an antique gem. The same composition occurs in an engraving by Enea Vico, who recorded many gems and cameos from classical antiquity.",
