As living spaces got smaller, the pressure on furniture to have more than one function and to justify its very existence were the issues challenging designers. In solving this problem, Tomoko Azumi wanted to design furniture that would make home-living easier and enjoyable. These preliminary sketches for 'Table=Chest', taken from Azumi's sketchook in her final year of Furniture Design at the Royal College of Art, London, show how she developed the idea that the piece would involve some sort of movement which transformed its function and form. The result is neat and elegant, whilst also being very practical.",
