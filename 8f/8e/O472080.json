University, Baroda, he was inspired by the creativity that surrounded him to make his own prints. His images have a simple and direct quality which conveys the vibrant nature of life in Baroda with a naivety and freshness that makes them distinct. It is quality which was immediately recognised and respected by distinguished artists such as K.G. Subramanyan and which earned him many awards in his short life.\n\nThe linocut depicts a busy village scene. The artist has used the entire space of the print to represent several moments of the lives of the rural inhabitants of the village. In the centre of the print for example, we see a little boy climbing a tree whilst below him, we observe a mother playing with her child on the ground. On the left, we see monkeys dangling from a tree and a cage with a huge singing bird. To the right, we see two horses, a snake and some other animals.

University, Baroda, he was inspired by the creativity that surrounded him to make his own prints. His images have a simple and direct quality which conveys the vibrant nature of life in Baroda with a naivety and freshness that makes them distinct. It is quality which was immediately recognised and respected by distinguished artists such as K.G. Subramanyan and which earned him many awards in his short life.",
