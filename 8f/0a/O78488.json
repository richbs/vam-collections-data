Snuff-taking was popular in Britain from the late 17th century with both men and women. These small portable boxes were carried everywhere and freely used. Larger containers would be passed around the table after dinner. Early snuff boxes contained a grater to grate the blocks of compressed powdered snuff and spices, such as cloves and cinnamon, imported from the West Indies. By 1730 ready-grated snuff had dispensed with the need for a grater, but compartments were sometimes retained in order to carry two or more sorts of snuff.\n\nCommemoration\nMilitary and naval heroes  were commemorated on snuff boxes from the mid 18th century. This snuff box was one of the earliest examples of the growing market for souvenirs of Admiral Lord Nelson.\n\nDesign\nCircular snuff boxes, like this one, came into fashion towards the end of the 18th century.",
