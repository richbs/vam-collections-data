            "public_access_description": "This work was commissioned by London Printworks Trust, a fabric-printing studio that also organises exhibitions of work by artists and designers using printed textiles. It was included in the 1998 exhibition \u2018Masquerade\u2019, an installation of clothing that imitated fashionable, commercially produced garments, with the intention of investigating the way clothes can transform our sense of self, break taboos and question stereotypes. \n\nThe coat  that Ken McDonald used for this work was found in a gutter, apparently cast off by a homeless person. He decided to line the coat with a reproduction in satin of The Madonna and Child with Saints Julian and Lawrence by Gentile da Fabriano (1370\u20131427). St Lawrence is especially revered for his care of the poor. The re-worked coat, shabby and dirty but with a sumptuous lining, suggests that outward appearances should not be taken as a measure of character. By choosing a religious image for the lining McDonald also suggests that the modest and self-effacing may be more spiritual than those who make a show of their wealth.",
