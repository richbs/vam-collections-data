It is believed that the panel was part of a large scheme of heraldic and figurative painted and stained glass he had commissioned for his Chateau at Ecouen which was built in the middle of the 16th century. \n\nThe sword in the centre of the panel was a emblem adopted by Montmorency because in his role of Constable he was permitted to carry an unsheathed sword before the king on ceremonial occasions.\n\nArmorial shields begin to appear in church windows in the 13th century and in the 14th century they begin to be incorporated into the glazing schemes of aristocratic households.\n\nA new range of decorative motifs starts to appear during the Renaissance. The armorial devices in this panel are surrounded by elaborate strapwork, grotesques, birds and cornucopiae. This style is associated with the court school of painters based at Fontainebleau.",

Hampp, Norwich dealer.\n\nAt some point after the closure of the Mus\u00e9e National in 1814, it is probable that it was in the possession of William Beckford at Fonthill Abbey in England. If so, in 1823 it was one of \u2018three large panels, very fine and curious, the arms and device of the Montmorency family\u2019 included in the Fonthill Abbey sale, lot no.346.\n\nIn the 1840s Thomas Willement drew this panel when it was in Davington Priory in Kent. It was then in the possession of Mr. Gibbs who sold this panel shortly before he disposed of Davington Priory where he had lived for a number of years.",

            "historical_context_note": "Anne de Montmorency (1493-1567) was appointed Constable of France by King Francois I in 1538. As Constable, Montemorency was entitled to carry a naked sword before the King on ceremonial occasions. He built the Chateau of Ecouen for his own use between about 1538 and the 1550s. It stands just outside Paris and was elaborately decorated by artists and craftsmen of the School of Fontainebleau. A prominent feature of the these decorations were the painted windows which were inserted over a number of years between about 1541 and 1559. None survive in their original setting but there are a number in existence, similar to the Museum's panel as well as a famous set showing the story of Cupid and Psyche, now in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly. The glazing scheme at the chateau was quite extensive. The Cupid and Psyche windows were composed of 44 panels and where inserted into the structure of the west wing. A description of the chateau dating from 1678 describes the windows in the east wing as grisaille panels with grotesques. From this description it is thought that this panel came from the east wing windows. \n\nThe surviving panels from the Chateau indicate that a number of different painters were involved in their execution. They probably worked from cartoons supplied by the artists at the school of Fontainebleau. \n\nThere are other panels with the device of Montmorency: one in St. Mark's, Bristol (Lord Mayor's Chapel); one in the Museum of the Renaissance at the Chateau d'\u00c9couen (formerly in the Cluny Museum), one in the parish church at \u00c9couen and one known only from a 19th century illustration.",
