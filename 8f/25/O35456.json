Head of pink cotton painted to show rosy cheeks, a red smiling mouth, eyes glancing to the right, grey wool hair black felt wide brimmed hat. Hands are formed from the wire framework bound with pink fine wool. Body padded and covered with coloured felts to represent clothing of dark brown frock jacket, gold coloured waistcoat with 12 brown beads, white breeches, black leather cloth boots with beige felt around their tops. Feet are flat and moulded from lead, painted black. Around the neck is tied a red woollen scarf. \n*Margarete Cohn registered her trademark GRECON in Germany in 1920 and in 1940 in England having moved to London in 1937 from Berlin. From premises in Streatham High Road she made the cloth dolls, also using outworkers.  Many of the dolls were sold in Hamleys, Harrods and Liberty's and both a dolls' house size was produced as well as a larger group which were often used by child guidance clinics to enable children to express themselves about their fears and resentments. Miss Cohn exhibited for many years at the British Industries Fairs and others and continued working until the 1980s. She died aged 96 in 1991.",
