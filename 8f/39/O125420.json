In the 18th century a vivandi\u00e8re was a woman who sold food and drink to soldiers and was often a soldier's wife.  Susannah Cibber played Sigismunda to the Tancred of David Garrick at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1756.  Garrick played Tancred in the original production in 1845 and he frequently revived the play at Drury Lane.\n\nThe figurine was produced by the Derby factory as a pair to the figurine of Garrick as Tancred.  The Derby porcelain factory was established in about 1750 by the Huguenot, Andrew Planche.  In partnership with William Duesbury they produced figures of extremely high quality.  By 1770, Duesbury acquired the famous Chelsea China Works and the Bow moulds which resulted in the transfer of a number of extremely skilled craftsmen from London to Derby.  They opened a London showroom in 1773, and in 1775 King George III  granted the factory the honour of being able to incorporate a crown into the backstamp.",
