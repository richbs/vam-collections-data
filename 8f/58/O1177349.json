            "public_access_description": "The 'Sheena' doll was made by Palitoy, who joined in with the race for the teenage doll in the 1960s. Her main feature was that she could grow her hair by turning a key in her back which adjusted the length. She was introduced in the early 1970s. This doll is wearing her original outfit; a pale mauve two-piece trouser suit. \n\nTeenage dolls were first introduced to the market in the late 1950s and they were made of vinyl, a softer plastic, allowing for them to be manufactured cheaply and to accommodate rooted hair (essential for the Sheena doll and her growing hair). By the 1960s and 1970s, teenage dolls were often advertised on television by their names rather than manufacturer, as was previously done in the 1950s. As a consequence the dolls became household names and they had fantastic wardrobes of clothes and family members to complete the set. As well as the Sheena doll, these include dolls such as Sindy, Tressy, Daisy and Pippa.\n\nSheena, the girl, who owned Sheena, the doll, was actually a bit of a tomboy and her recollection of having the doll was that it was of limited appeal, despite (or perhaps because of) the hairdressing element.",
