All the pieces are taken from the same fabric. The pieces down the right hand side are upside down. Diagonal stripes running from the lower left to the upper right. There are narrow stripes with either a white ground or a yellow ground and with the same pattern of a meander with predominantly pink flowers and what might be a bird with a bushy tail in pink, facing right. The wider stripe has a green ground with four diamond-shaped motifs:\n[1] a cone shape edged with small red buds;\n[2] a spray of three blue flowers;\n[3] four red flowers;\n[4] a central red flower with small blue flowerheads. There is an integral border along the top with lines of yellow, green and pink either side of red and blue zigzags and green leaves forming an ogival lattice, each segment containing a pink flower on a yellow ground.",
