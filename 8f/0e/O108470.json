With his cousin, Rosario, he made his debut in Liege in 1928 and they subsequently danced with enormkous success all over the world.  He made his American debut in 1940 and his British debut at the Edinburgh Festival in 1950, followed by a season at the Cambridge Theatre, London, in 1951. In 1953 he formed a ballet company with Rosita Segovia and Carmen Rojas; Rosario re-joined him in 1964 for the London and New York seasons.  \nCyril Beaumont wrote: Antonio's rendering of the \"Zapateado\" is staggering in its virtuosity.  It is impossible to convey in words the infinite variety of is foorwork, which passes through all the gradations of a faint purring to a dynamic throbbing which sets the stage quaking.\"",
