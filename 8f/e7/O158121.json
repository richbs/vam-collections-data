            "public_access_description": "Works of art within a Schatzkammer were prized for their high intrinsic value, as well as for the artistic skill involved in their creation. Prior to executing a piece, an artist would often present their patron with a design, in order to guarantee the commission. In Italy it was most common for the design to take the form of a model, and in his autobiography Benvenuto Cellini makes reference to several models of wax, none of which sadly survives. This modello is an extremely rare survival and the representation of precious stones suggests that the finished product was intended to be made of gold.\n\nThe Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Schatzkammer is one of the few collections of its kind formed in the late 20th century. The Schatzkammer, or treasury, was a new concept in the 16th century. It referred to a special chamber in which the most precious artefacts of a princely collection were housed.  Gold and jewelled objects were mounted alongside exotic natural curiosities, including rock crystal, nautilus shells and ostrich eggs. Together they demonstrated not only the wonders of nature and the technical achievements of the artist, but also the intellect and culture of the patron. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
