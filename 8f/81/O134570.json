            "public_access_description": "Alphonse Legros (1837-1911) was born in Dijon where he entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts before attending the 'Petite Ecole' of Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897) in Paris and then Ecole des Beaux-Arts. he started exhibited at the Salon in 1857. In 1863, Legros visited London where he found admirers and patrons, notably the Ionides family, and was ardently promoted by the brothers Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. An etcher, a painter and a sculptor, he succeeded Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) at the Slade School in 1876 and was naturalized as a British citizen in 1880.\n\nThis work is a fine example of Legros' landscape paintings, which shows the influence of the Realist movement inaugurated in France by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877). It was probably inspired by the countryside around Dijon where he spent his youth. This work is a good example of Legros' late period in which landscape paintings became a dominant thematic reminiscent of the French countryside.",

Long, <u>Catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection.Vol. 1, Paintings in oil, tempera and water-colour, together with certain of the drawings,</u> London : Printed under the authority of the Board of Education, 1925.\nC. Monkhouse, 'The Constantine Ionides Collection' in <u>Magazine of Art,</u> vii, 1884, pp. 36-44, 208-214.\n\nThe collection formed by Constantine Ionides includes works of a wide variety of schools, periods and artists. His collection includes Old Masters, 17th century works, contemporary British works and French 19th century works. Constantine formed friendships with artists of the day, especially Legros, who, having spent 17 years in Britain, became a naturalise British citizen. Constantine proved a stable and generous buyer of Legros work, while Legros, in turn, became an advisor in the matters of art to the attentive Constantine. Under the influence of Legros Constantine developed a keen interest in French 19th century paintings purchasing works by Delacroix, Degas, Millet and Rousseau.\n\nConstantine's plans concerning his collection conformed to a more 'public-welfare' vein of thought than his father or brother. He decided to donate his collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum, instead of privately distributing it or disposing of it in a Sales room.\n\nHis will states:\n\n'All my pictures both in oil and water colors and crayon or colored chalks (but subject as to my family portraits to the interest herein before given to my said Wife) and all my etchings drawings and engravings to the South Kensington Museum for the benefit of the nation to be kept there as one separate collection to be called \"The Constantine Alexander Ionides Collection\" and not distributed over the Museum or lent for exhibition. And I desire that the said Etchings Drawings and Engravings shall be framed and glazed by and at the expense of the authorities of the Museum so that Students there can easily see them.'\n\nThe collection bequeathed to the museum in 1901 comprises 1138 pictures, drawing and prints, to which a further 20 items were added on the death of his widow in 1920. The works are listed in the V&A catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Legros' landscape paintings. It shows a landscape surrounding Dijon, where Legros spent much of his childhood, with its low hills, rivers and patches of woodland. <i>Landscape, with Stream and Hills</i> is an oil sketch on paper, possibly a pair to <i>Landscape, with Road over a Hill</i> (CAI 28). \nDespite moving permanently to England in 1863, Legros largely continued to paint French themes throughout his career: scenes of provincial French life or unidentified landscape scenes without figures are reminiscent of his early reliance on Courbet. Such paintings were either based on undocumented visits to France in the 1880s, or, more likely, recreate memories of the landscape surrounding Dijon, a method which can be traced to the teaching Legros received from Boisbaudran.\nLandscape features especially strongly in his lithographs and engravings in the last 20 years of his life, when he generally preferred drawing, etching and watercolour to oil painting. \nWith CAI 28, the present work forms part of the extensive collection of works by Legros which entered the museum as part of the Ionides bequest in 1900. Legros formed a close friendship with Ionides in London, and also became a firm adviser to the collector between 1878 and 1884. He encouraged the development of Ionides's taste for 19th-century French painting and his acquisition of works by Jean-Francois Millet, Ingres, Delacroix, Courbet, Th\u00e9odore Rousseau and Degas. Ionides was also Legros's most important patron, buying many of his paintings, watercolours and etchings and assembling the largest collection of the artist's work in his lifetime. Landscape, with Stream and Hills and CAI 28 were some of the last works by Legros to enter the Ionides collection, as Ionides acquired no new works from Legros after 1882.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
