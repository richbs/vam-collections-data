            "public_access_description": "On the 9th of April 1989 the independent trade union Solidarity gained permission to take part in parliamentary elections to be held on the 4th of June of the same year. This left very little time to prepare an election campaign. Despite its popularity, Solidarity had no professional staff to take charge of the campaign and no funds for it. Solidarity was allowed to put candidates up for 161 mandates (35%) in the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament) and for all 100 mandates in Senate (the upper house of the Polish parliament). In this situation it was impossible to conduct a sophisticated poster campaign for all of the candidates. It was decided to publish a series of simple posters \u2013 one design for each candidate \u2013 which were based on the Solidarity logo and a picture of the candidate in the company of Lech Walesa, who was already an icon of Solidarity. His support, expressed through this image scheme, served as a guarantee of the candidate. The low budget and haste of the campaign meant that the posters were printed on a poor quality paper using only two colours (black and red) and the simplest printing technique. \n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
