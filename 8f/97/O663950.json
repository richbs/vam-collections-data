It has two holes in the supporting mount to enable it to be hung up as a visual aid. \n\nOwnership & Use\nDuring the 19th century a number of studies were made on the relationship of colour and light, by  both scientists and artists. Generally these took the form of colour wheels of primary colours. This diagram was published as an aid for a students of design on courses run by the Department of Practical Art. Itwas meant to be used in conjunction with Richard Redgrave's Elementary Manual of Colourfirst published in 1853 by Chapman and Hall.\n\nPeople\nPainter and designer Richard Redgrave (1804-1888) drew up the first curriculum of the National Schools of Art when they were established in 1852. The curriculum focussed on drawing from ornamental forms from models and examples. The National Schools of Art replaced the Government School of Design which were first set up in 1837 to teach artisans principles of good design. Redgrave had taught botany at the schools in 1847. He became Art Superintendant in 1852 and Inspector-General in 1857. A number of his paintings, and objects designed by him, are in the V&amp;A collections.",
