The lines on the plate were  filled with ink which was then printed onto paper.\n\n\n\nPeople\n\nMary II was one of Europe's leading collectors of ceramics. This print may echo the type of scheme the designer, and artist of this print, Daniel Marot, first developed for the display of her collection at the palace of Het Loo in The Netherlands.\n\n\n\nTime\n\nHet Loo was built for William and Mary in the 1680s.  The Queen continued her interest in ceramics after returning to England in 1688. An inventory of Kensington Palace records 787 pieces of ceramics arranged on tiered stands and multiple shelves.  Daniel Defoe writing in his Tour of the Whole Island of Great Britain (1724-1727) described the Hampton Court display as a 'Vast stock of fine China ware, the like wherof was not then to be seen in England.'\n\n\n\nOne hundred and ten pieces of ceramics, mostly Chinese blue and white wares, which perhaps date back to William and Mary's reign (1689-1702) now survive at Hampton Court. They date from the late Ming or early Qing periods (about 1620-1683). Among them is a pair of lidded jars with a design of lions among scrolling peonies. They are  similar in shape to the pair standing at the front of the fireplace in this print. These two jars certainly date back to the  William and Mary's reign since their coat of arms is stuck to the base of each jar in red sealing wax.",
