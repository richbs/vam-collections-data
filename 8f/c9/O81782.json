            "public_access_description": "This painting is a portrait of Nadir Shah Afshar, one of the most important figures in Iranian history of the last 300 years. Nadir Shah began as a tribal leader. He tried to used his forces to restore order after the Afghan invasion of his country in 1722. At first, he worked in the name of members of the previous dynasty, the Safavids. In 1736, however, he declared himself shah, and he ruled with some success until his assassination in 1747. \n\nOne of Nadir Shah's most famous achievements was the invasion of the Mughal empire in what is now Pakistan and northern India. He defeated the Mughal army in 1739 and seized the capital, Delhi. Among the loot he acquired was the Mughal emperor's jewels, which are still kept in the Central Bank of Iran in Tehran. \n\nThis is one of only two portraits of Nadir Shah in oils that survive. The Shah is shown wearing jewelled armbands, which are thought to be from the Mughal treasure. The carpet on which he sits is also Mughal. The painting is therefore attributed to the period after his invasion of the Mughal empire in 1739. There are some resemblances between this painting and watercolour portraits of Nadir Shah and a young man, probably Nadir Shah's son, by the painter Muhammad Riza Hindi.",

            "history_note": "\"There are two portraits of Nadir in London, one being at the India Office, and the other at the India Museum, South Kensington; although it is known that they are both by XVIIIth century Persian artists, it is impossible to say whether they are really contemporary. Mr. Henry Vansittart, who was Governor of Fort William from 1760 to 1767, acquired the portrait that is now in the India Office; it was reputed, in his time, to be an original. His son, the Rt. Hon. Nicholas Vansittart, presented this picture to the East India Company in February, 1822.[1] The history of the India Museum portrait (No. I.M.20-1919) cannot be traced as far back; it is said to have been brought from India in 1800 or possibly a little earlier; it was for a long time in the possession of the Willoughby family, and was presented to the India Museum by G. F. Welsford, M.D., in 1919. The head in this portrait is similar in every detail to that in the India Office picture. Mr. C. Stanley Clarke, of the Victoria and Albert Museum, in a letter to Mr. (now Sir) W. Foster dated the 3rd June 1919, stated that \"Both paintings are Persian of bad period---strongly European influenced.\"\n\n1.
