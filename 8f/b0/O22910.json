On each side are depicted, under pine trees and surrounded by rocks, a group of men in scholarly pursuits, some writing, some playing chess, some drinking, some about to play the lute (qin).  The scenes are painted in overglaze famille verte enamels of green, yellow, aubergine purple, red and black colours.  The mark Mushi Ju (Lodge of Wood and Rock) in seal script within a double square is written in white reserve against a black ground on the base.\n\nTerms like mushi (wood and rock) or zhushi (bamboo and rock) were favourite studio names of Qing scholars.  It has been reported that the mark Mushi Ju can be found on a large number of porcelains, some of them dated, the dates ranging from 1690 to 1712.  It was not customary for an individual to place orders for porcelain over a period of twenty years, therefore Mushi Ju was probably a private kiln.  Its products included underglaze blue and famille verte wares.\n\nQing dynasty, Kangxi period, about 1690-1722",
