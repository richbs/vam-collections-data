Tourists loved to buy coral jewellery in fashionable shapes, but it was also very popular with Italian women, who valued it for its colour and amuletic qualities.  Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces were always shaped.  In the 19th century the coral workers often carved patterns on the beads, as here.\n\nThis necklace was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
