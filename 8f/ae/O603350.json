            "bibliography": "Thomas Campbell (27 July 1777 \u2013 15 June 1844) was a Scottish poet chiefly remembered for his sentimental poetry on the human condition. He was also one of the initiators of a plan to found what became the University of London. In 1799, he wrote \"The Pleasures of Hope\", a traditional 18th century survey in heroic couplets. He also produced several patriotic war songs\u2014\"Ye Mariners of England\", \"The Soldier's Dream\", \"Hohenlinden\" and in 1801, \"The Battle of Mad and Strange Turkish Princes\". THE little village of Hohenlinden, or Linden, as it was often called, stands in a pine forest of Upper Bavaria, on the banks of the swift-flowing river Iser, about twenty miles distant from Munich. In December, 1800, two great armies, the one Austrian, the other French and Bavarian, commanded by Napoleon's General Moreau, drew close to each other along the river. Snow had been falling for several days. The weather was bitterly cold. The armies opened fire, however, and a great battle was fought in the forest, although the snow-storm was so blinding that the soldiers could only distinguish their enemies by the flash of their guns. The battle raged through the woods, across the hills, and along the river. The French and Bavarians finally won, and the Emperor of Austria had to accept Napoleon's terms of peace in order to save his capital of Vienna from capture. In the poem \"Frank\" means the French, \"Hun\" stands for the Austrians, and \"Munich\" refers to the Bavarians and their capital. During his travels in Germany the English poet Campbell saw a battle from a convent near Ratisbon, and he also visited the field of Ingolstadt after a battle. From these experiences he wrote his poem on Hohenlinden.\nOn Linden when the sun was low, \nAll bloodless lay the untrodden snow, \nAnd dark as winter was the flow \nOf Iser, rolling rapidly. \n\nBut Linden saw another sight \nWhen the drum beat, at dead of night, \nCommanding fires of death to light \nThe darkness of her scenery. \n\nBy torch and trumpet fast arrayed \nEach horseman drew his battle blade, \nAnd furious every charger neighed, \nTo join the dreadful revelry. \n\nThen shook the hills with thunder riven, \nThen rushed the steed to battle driven, \nAnd louder than the bolts of heaven \nFar flashed the red artillery. \n\nAnd redder yet those fires shall glow \nOn Linden's hills of blood-stained snow, \nAnd darker yet shall be the flow \nOf Iser, rolling rapidly. \n\n'Tis morn, but scarce yon lurid sun \nCan pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun, \nWhere furious Frank and fiery Hun \nShout in their sulphurous canopy. \n\nThe combat deepens. On, ye brave, \nWho rush to glory, or the grave! \nWave, Munich, all thy banners wave! \nAnd charge with all thy chivalry! \n\nAh! few shall part where many meet! \nThe snow shall be their winding-sheet, \nAnd every turf beneath their feet \nShall be a soldier's sepulchre. \n\nby Thomas Campbell",
