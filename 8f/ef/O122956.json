ISBN 1851770712.\n'The \u2018Hejrestellet\u2019 was first shown at the Scandinavian Exhibition of Agriculture, Art and Industry, held at the Industrial Association in Copenhagen in 1888. It was much acclaimed for its adventurous conception, the skilful execution of the modelling and, particularly, the use of underglaze blue. By the 1880s this method of decoration had become the most basic and traditional technique and Krohn\u2019s use of it on this elaborate and expensive service was regarded as daring and revolutionary. The service was awarded an honourable mention when it was shown in the international exhibition held in Paris in 1889. Krohn was a member of the jury on that occasion and consequently the company was not eligible to compete for medals.\n\nThe original and complete service was made for 24 people. A few services were made between 1888 and 1900, and then a few more around 1915. At least on pink version was made.'",
