Miniature painting developed as a separate art in the 16th century and in Britain it became predominantly a portrait art.\n\nThis miniature is one of a group of five portraits of members of the North family attributed to Edmund Ashfield (worked 1669\u201390) by John Murdoch in Seventeenth-century English Miniatures in the Collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum (1997). The attribution to Ashfield is based on the signature \u2018E. A.\u2019 found lower centre right on one of the miniature of \u2018Charles North, 5th Baron North de Kirtling\u2019. Edmunch Ashfield was a painter in oil and \u2018crayon\u2019 (what is today called pastel), but it was long thought that he had also painted miniatures. This group apparently supports this idea.",

No. 131 [Until 1690, Charles, 5th Baron North de Kirtling; until 1734, William, 6th Baron; his wife, Maria Margareta (born \u2018de  jonge van Ellemete\u2019). who married secondly in 1735 Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank; his illegitimate son Patrick Murray of Simprim,  Forfarshire (d.c.1854); his daughter Maria Margaretta (d.1873) who married in 1842 James, Baron Talbot de Malahide; her eldest  daughter Susan-Ann, who married in 1864 Cecil St John Ives, subsequently Major-General; their second daughter Marion who  married her third husband in 1923, Godfrey Waiter, 2nd Baron Phillimore; she died in 1950; the miniatures sold to the Museum by  private treaty with two of her heirs, 1987]. \n\nCharles was the second son of the 5th Baron North (see Cat. No. 131) and was a soldier like his elder brother William (see Cat. No. 132 [P.40-1987]). Both boys matriculated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 22 October 1691. Roger North 1 records that Charles' a major in the late wars with France, died there of a calenture' - presumably a high fever rather than the form of delirium to which sailors were susceptible in the tropics. Burke's Peerage adds that he died at the 'siege of Lisle' , that is Lille, which fell to Marlborough in 1708. He had no children. \n\n1 North 1890, vol. I, p. vii.\u201d",
