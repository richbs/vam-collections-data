These are chevron lines in green and dark green. There are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark green ground with pink flowers either pointing down or to the right; green, yellow, blue and white striped leaves.\n[2] wider stripes with two designs: [a] diamonds edged with small striped leaves.  Green vase decorated with a flower with a pink flower and three pale coloured flowers with four blue dots in the centre.  A pair of small birds outlined in blue are at the base of the vase.  They have small round heads near the vase and are upside down.  Similar arrangements but with a long pale flower in the centre and three pink flowers and the same pair of birds. [b] similar designs with vase and birds: one pattern has three closely-packed pink flowers and one has spaced out pink flowers. \nThere is a narrow border down the lower part of each side and also above and below the bottom border: tiny pink and yellow flowers with green leaves.  \nThe bottom border has an indistinct pattern of pink blossoms and small green and yellow striped leaves.\nThreads: 2S silk: dark green, green, light green, yellow, light blue, blue, red, pink, white, faded mauve [?].",
