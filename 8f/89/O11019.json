It is stamped with an image of King Charles II.\n\nPeople\nA group of Martha Edlin's (1660-1725) possessions from her childhood, including this medallion, were kept in the casket, cherished by her descendants and passed down through the female line in her family for over three hundred years. We know little about her life, except that she married a man called Richard Richmond and appears to have been a prosperous widow, with daughters and grandchildren, living in Pinner in Greater London at the time she drew up her will.",
