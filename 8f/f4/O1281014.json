It toured the UK during the spring and summer of 2012 and the programme continued until May 2013 before moving permanently online.\n\nThe Big Grin was launched in public on Saturday May 12th with the The Greatest Punch and Judy Show on Earth: a birthday celebration in Covent Garden Piazza in central London. The largest ever mass gathering of UK \u2018Professors\u2019 was joined by performers and  guests from around the world - including Japan, Australia, South Africa, America, the Netherlands, Slovakia - plus very special guest Pulcinella from Naples. It was followed on Sunday May 13th by a special edition of the traditional Punch &amp; Judy May Fayre organised by Alternative Arts in the churchyard of St. Paul\u2019s Covent Garden - the Actors\u2019 Church.",
