It is decorated with two bands of animal friezes, in low relief at top and bottom.  \n\nThe animal frieze around the base features thirteen pairs of confronted lions.  These are depicted seated on their hind legs, their heads turned sideways facing the viewer.  In the upper frieze twenty six birds are shown with their bodies in profile, looking out at the viewer.  Their heads are each pierced laterally with a single hole, forming eyes when seen from the side.\n\nThe friezes are separated from the central band by two large, grooved mouldings.  These are engraved with four epigraphic cartouches each, the inscriptions spaced withn roundels enclosing moon crecents and split palmettes.  \n\nThe central band  is formed of three rows of imbricating hexagons, also moulded in low relief and numbering thirty one in total.  Each is engraved with seven tangent discs.\n\nThe epigraphic border on the shoulder has thirteen sections, placed in horizontal cartouches with incurving sides, spaced by the motif of six tangent discs and a lotus bud.\n\nAt some point the candlestick was converted into a bucket. Brass hinge-plates of uneven shape were riveted on the inner face of the sides, with copper rivets. A band of beaten copper was riveted on the remaining part of the flat rim of the shoulder with 31 worked copper rivets to serve as a base. Remains of two traceried openwork legs riveted on the 'base' and the copper rivets of a third leg show that the 'bucket' had three legs, regularly spaced.\n\nPatina: brassy yellow with dirt incrustations in the grooves of the animal figures.",
