His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s feel for grand occasions and fantastic, imaginative approach meant that he was also in demand as a designer of temporary decorations for balls, marriage receptions and parties.  Prestigious commissions included decorations for royal boxes for gala performances on state occasions at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and temporary decorations for the exterior of the Dorchester Hotel, London, on the occasion of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth I in 1953.  \n\nAn unrealised project for the Festival of Britain in 1951, an event intended to celebrate the nation's achievements in the arts, industry and science.  Messel wanted to recreate the atmosphere and look of Vauxhall pleasure gardens in the eighteenth century.  He designed supper boxes, a tea pavilion and a stage.",
