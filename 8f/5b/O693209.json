Supported by his son William, and his son-in-law, Lord Mahon, and against the advice of his physicians, Pitt delivered an impassioned speech against the withdrawal from the rebellious American colonies, and poured scorn on fears of French invasion.  He then collapsed, and died a few later.  In the artist's diary, where his visits to England are detailed, there is no mention of this composition.  Since, however, the entries for 1851-54 are missing, it is possible that it was painted during his visit to the Great Exhibition, in an attempt to find commissions in London.\"",
