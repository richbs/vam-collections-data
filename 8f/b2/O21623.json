The key is L-shaped and made of chromium plated steel/\n[Cushion] Seat cushion for a 'Tripp Trapp' high chair.  The cushion is covered in white, blue and green striped cotton fabric, and is rectangular apart from one of the long edges which is curved to match the back of the seat.  The underside of the cushion has a pocket of self fabric on each long edge to hold it to the seat; the front edge has a stitched slit through which the leather strap of the chair's baby rail passes.\n[Cushion] Back cushion for a 'Tripp Trapp' high chair.  The cushion is covered in white, blue and green striped cotton fabric, and is shaped with a rounded central panel and two side pieces to fit the high back and baby rail of the chair.  The back of the cushion has a pocket of self fabric (with velcro strips) to hold it to the back of the chair, and the side pieces (also with velcro strips) fold over the baby rail.\n[Child's high chair] The adjustable high chair is of beech wood stained to a cherry wood finish, and is held together with steel screws and plates.  The chair consists of two vertical side pieces, each in the shape of an inverted 7, with grooved inner surfaces to accommodate the horizontal elements: two back rails (the upper one with a high centre to support a baby's head), a seat, a footrest and a stretcher bar, all of wood, and two steel stretcher rods.  There is a slot on each of the two side pieces to hold the baby rail (which is also anchored to the chair with a broad leather strap through the seat) and there is a ring at each side to which a safety harness may be clipped.  The high-centred back rail and the baby rail and its strap (with the cushions if used) should be removed and the depth and height of the seat and footrest should be repositioned as the child grows; when the chair is occupied by a full-sized person, the lower stretcher rod and original seat are also removed, and the footrest becomes the seat.",

The manufacturer believes that the form an item takes should develop from its usage.\n\nThe two vertical side pieces, each in the shape of an inverted 7, have grooved inner surfaces to accommodate various horizontal elements, such as a baby rail, back rails (the upper one with a high centre to support a baby\u2019s head), a seat, a footrest and stretcher rods. As the child grows, the high back rail and baby rail can be removed and the depth and height of the seat and footrest changed. For a full-sized person, the lower stretcher rod and original seat are also removed, and the footrest becomes the seat.",

He adds \"I am delighted that \"Tripp Trapp\" is always listed under \"Want to Purchase\" in the classified ads - this is hopefully a sign that it is a product with a long life\".\nThe chair can also be used by adults: Stokke's leaflet for the product shows an elderly man and a baby each in a 'Tripp Trapp' configured suitably for their age and size.",
