This used black paint on a light-coloured wood to create a reserve pattern, imitating furniture imported from India and China, veneered with ivory which was engraved with black ornament.  \n\nThe donor believed that the decoration was the work of three of her great-great-aunts, Mary Ann, Maria and Emma Jones of Great Russell Street.  Research shows that Emma Jones was in fact the great-great-grandmother of the donor on her mother's side, and it is likely that the cabinet once belonged to her.  It is impossible to say, however, whether the cabinet is indeed an example of her work.  Although pen-work was promoted as a lady-like pastime, the technique was also practised by professional furniture decorators.  Whether the work of amateur of professional, the decoration of this cabinet combines a wide range of motifs to form a sophisticated composition covering all visible wooden surfaces and turning corners without compromising the design.",
