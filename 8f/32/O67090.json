            "history_note": "This set design by Maise Meiklejohn is part of an extensive collection of designs by the artist purchased by the Theatre Museum in 1990.  The design was executed for a production of Georg Buchner's play \"Leonce and Lena\" performed at the Arts Theatre, February 2nd 1945.  The production was directed by Judith Furse, the text was translated by Geoffrey Dunlop, the music was arranged by Leonard Salzedo, and the dances were choreographed by Pauline Grant.  The cast included Laurence Payne as Prince Leonce and Wenda Rogerson as Princess Lena.\n\nHistorical significance: This set design was executed for a production by the actor/producer Alec Clunes, whose greatest achievement was his direction of eight seasons of plays at the Arts Theatre during a period when money and actors were scarce and scenery hard to get.  He introduced an ambitious and intellectually demanding repertory of unearthed English classics and promoted the staging of foreign plays, as an alternative to the usual West End fare of \"leg shows\" and average drawing room pieces, which earned him the status, according to one critic of \"pocket national theatre\". \nLeela Meinertas, 1990.",
