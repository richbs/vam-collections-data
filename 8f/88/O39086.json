NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative. Ripple Reed has been produced using the technique most often used to weave lightweight summer kimono (yukata) and sashes.  The reeds (osa) of the loom are typically flat, however Nuno has used a loom with rippled reeds, which gives the resultant fabric a beautiful natural horizontal wave pattern.  Today only a handful of craftspeople can produce this finely detailed work, and fewer still can craft the rippled reeds for the loom.",
