Vishnu stands straight in his usual samabhanga pose, holding a conch and chakra in his upper hands, his lower right hand in varada mudra and the lower left posed as if to rest on his mace (which was never included).  He is flanked by slightly smaller standing figures of the two consorts associated with him in South India, Sri (Lakshmi) to his right and Bhu (the Earth goddess) to his left.  Each has only tow arms, is posed in the graceful tribhanga (thrice-bent) pose and holds a lotus flower in her inner hand.  The base and arch are also typical of South Indian shrines.  The base has lotus petals incised on the lowest tier and simple incised panels on its front.  The arch is topped by a typical kirtimukha mask and has a five-headed naga above Vishnu.  The modelling is not best quality, a little heavy, with copper colour and little wear..",
