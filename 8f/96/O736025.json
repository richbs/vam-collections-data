Bourges Cathedral. The Annunciation and the Adoration of the Three Kings. 12th century.\n<i>Signed</i> John Trinick del. MCMXXXIV.<i>\nWater-colour.\n</i>E.591-1936\n<i>Note by the Artist:-</i> This is the only surviving fragment of the XII cent glazing preserved in the Cathedral itself ; though there are two or three smaller fragments at present in the colection of the Trocadero, at Paris.\n\n\"The panel has suffered much from haphazard assemblage, and appears to have been indiscriminately patched at all sorts of periods. XIV and XV century 'yellow stain' is patent at a glance, but pieces like the blue crown and the large piece of diapered blue in the right-hand subject appear to be quite modern.\n\n\"The treatment of the heads, however, is highly interesting.  So far from showing any commencement of the conventional method common to late XII and XIII century flesh-painting, they have almost a 'Coptic' flavour - particularly noticeable in the left-hand subject. The whole style of the panels and the treatment of the subjects is in the full Byzantine tradition; but the special 'flavour' above-mentioned might indicate some particular provenance for the XII century glazing of this Cathedral. Alternatively - and more likely, perhaps - the glass might have been the work of local schools working from MS, originals of mixed provenance, one or two of which might easily shew such peculiarities. Moreover, there is about this flesh-painting just that appearance of 'tentativeness' which suggests close adherence to an existing 'copy' - such adherence probably having been insisted upon.\"'",
