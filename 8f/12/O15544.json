The gown consists of a flared front panel attached to an open, flowing robe which falls from pleats at the back. The front panel has a patch pocket on the right side which is hidden by the deep plush edging.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe puffed sleeves, wide cuffs and velvet edgings are inspired by plain, loose 16th century gowns. The sunflower and pomegranate motif on the fabric was a recurring design on objects associated with the Aesthetic Movement. The subtle gold and brown tones were popular 'artistic' colours used in both dress and furnishing fabrics during the 1890s.\n\nPeople\nPre-Raphaelite painters had clothed their models in plain, loose dresses based on the forms of 'early Medieval art'. The opening of Liberty's dress department in 1884 helped popularise the taste for aesthetic dress.  The Liberty designs which ranged from aesthetic gowns and children's artistic dresses to more conventional 'tea-gowns' had a wide international appeal among the social elite.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis type of dress was seen as the healthy and aesthetic alternative to the corseted and constrictive fashions in conventional dress. Before long it was not only those with artistic leanings who chose to wear garments which fit more loosely. By the early 20th century many fashionable dresses had a softer shoulder line and a more natural silhouette.",
