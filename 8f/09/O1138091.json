The films captured the public's imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis figure of Yoda is from Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith.  There is a picture on the left hand side of the package of the character from the film. The voice of Yoda was done by Frank Oz.",
