The Kaaba, a cube-shaped building, is considered the most sacred site in Islam. The kiswah is embroidered or brocaded with inscriptions from the Qu'ran, the Islamic holy book.\n\nEach year, many Muslims make pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca and the Kaaba. The hajj takes place during Dhu al-Hijah, the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar. At this time, the kiswah is replaced with a fresh cloth, and the old kiswah cut up. The pieces of the removed kiswah are currently distributed amongst visiting foreign Muslim dignitaries and organisations. Earlier kiswah pieces were distributed amongst the hajj pilgrims, some eventually being sold to tourists. This piece was given by the King of Hedjadz to Colonel Cyril Wilson during the First World War.",
