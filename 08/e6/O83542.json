Rich, black silk velvet is cut and sewn into a perfect full-length backless sheath suspended from a pearl and diamant\u00e9 yoke. Both the clinging gown and the Art Deco style jewelled collar were inspired by 1930s evening fashion, but the design is brought wholly up-to-date for 1994 with a dramatic diamant\u00e9 pendant down the bared back.\n\nThis combination of regal elegance and unexpected sparkle clearly shows why Diana, Princess of Wales, favoured dresses by Catherine Walker for nearly fifteen years. The V&A collection also includes the famous pearl-encrusted 'Elvis' dress that Catherine Walker made for the Princess in 1989. (see T.1:1&2.2006)",
