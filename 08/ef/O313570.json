            "public_access_description": "This medal depicting Tommaso Rangone of Ravenna is made by Alessandro Vittoria.\n\nRangone (1493-1577) was one of the intellectual figures of his time, Professor of Philosophy and Astronomy at Padua, later a Physician in Venice, and a leading patron of artists. This medal is considered a masterpiece by Vittoria and is arguably the most beautiful medal ever made by a Venetian sculptor. The great bronze statue of the subject on the fa\u00e7ade of S. Giuliano, Venice, was modelled by Vittoria to Sansovino's design in 1555 and delivered in 1557.\nThe reverse appears to represent an allegory of Virtue, perhaps referring to Rangone's public role.\n\nVittoria (1525-1608) was an Italian sculptor, stuccoist and architect. In the second half of the 16th century he became one of the most important sculptors active in Venice. On his arrival in Venice in 1543 he worked for Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570). He left Venice for Vicenza for a period of around 6 years. Apart from that and another short stay in 1576-77 when he worked in Brescia and Vicenca again to avoid the plaque, he remained in Venice until his death. He is buried in the church of S. Zaccaria, where there is also a marble self-portrait bust as part of the monument. Portrait busts form a large part of his oevre.",
