The bench is divided into two equal sections which have lifting lids attached by iron hinges, and forming coffers. The right hand section is also fitted with a large iron lock, and has a shaped escutcheon at the front fitted with a wrought iron key. \nCondition at acquisition: worm-eaten. The base chipped and repaired left-hand corner.\n\nBoard thicknesses: ends 25-9mm, front 33mm, back 26mm\n\nA double-ended bench-chest of boarded construction, with raised end-pieces, the carcase divided into two equal parts, each with a hinged lid, divided by a partition. The front and plain back fastened to the ends using 3 hand-made nails. The single base board held in grooves cut into the front and back boards and ends; the partition resting in a groove cut (front to back) down the centre of the base board. Note that the front board is cut with a dovetail 20mm (ie not full depth) where it meets the end boards.\n\nThe front with a shaped and moulded lower edge, both ends with a shaped forward edge and M shaped foot, with a cleat along the top edge, held on three pegs onto a long tenon. The seat formed by two lifting lids with three nailed battens, and with an ovolo moulded front edge. The left hand lid fitted with a lock (locked) and early escutcheon with double-ended trefoil ornament, fastened on two round-headed nails. The right lid (without lock) held on two iron strap hinges, each fed through a slot cut into the back board and held on hand-made nails (apparently original, allowing for some shrinkage of the lid) and a single square nut and threaded bolt (of early date). Matching square metal, countersunk caps fit over the bolts, and over a fitting next to the lock.\n\nRepairs\nWorm and some losses particularly on the lower edge of the front and right end. The PL front corner repaired with a scarfed-in piece, and some additional nails added. Otherwise wear, movement and bruising is consistent with an early date.",
