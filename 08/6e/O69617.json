ISBN 1851773088.\nAn influential figure in the Art Nouveau movement in both Europe and America, Colonna was born near Cologne and trained as an architect in Brussels. Immigrating to the United States in 1882, he designed for Tiffany's in New York and later moved to the Midwest where he designed railroad cars. From 1898 to 1903 Colonna lived in Paris and designed jewellery, furniture, porcelain, and textiles for Samuel Bing, the influential dealer whose shop, L'Art Nouveau, gave its name to the art style just then assuming prominence. Colonna produced Bing's L'Art Nouveau pavilion at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. The pattern of this silk is very similar to Colonna's Les Orchid\u00e9es which was part of that display, and it is assumed from the high quality of their manufacture that both examples were woven by one of the leading French silk weavers, Cornille Fr\u00e8res of Lyon. The V&A's example reflects the stylized organicity of Art Nouveau, and its watered-style ground has parallels in the subpatterning seen in Colonna's designs in other mediums, for example, the opalescence in his glass and the wood inlays of his furniture.\nAlthough the Museum concentrated at the end of the nineteenth century on building up its early textiles collection, it did not acquire examples of the two most fashionable contemporary styles - Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau. Examples such as this curtain by Colonna have been purchased only retrospectively.\n\nLINDA PARRY/ BRENDA RICHARDSON\nGreenhalgh, Paul, ed. <u>Art Nouveau: 1890-1914</u>.
