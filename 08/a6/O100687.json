They depict naive scenes of people and animals, combined with enormous insects and flowers. In their compositions, and in the total absence of scale between the various elements, they resemble the sort of needlework done by young girls in the late 17th century; and it seems likely that the painting is also \u2018homemade\u2019 rather than professional. If so this is the case, it is the only record we have that leather-painting was ever undertaken as a female endeavour. The chairs themselves presumably perished long ago, together with the seat covers which would have suffered much more in use. The fact that the back covers have been carefully preserved suggests that they may have been handed down through the family of the unusually accomplished ancestor.",

This resemblance suggests that the painting may be amateur work. If so, the covers represent the only known instance of painted leather as a domestic accomplishment. The appearance of the folded edges suggests that the covers were painted before being fixed to the frames: that is, they were painted by design for their chairs (and then passed to an upholsterer for fixing), rather than being painted on the chairs, as an afterthought.\nThe fact that the covers have been preserved, even though the chair-frames themselves perished (presumably), suggests that they were treasured by their subsequent owners, perhaps because of a family tradition as to who had painted them. The seat covers, which would have been much more dirtied and abraded in use, were presumably discarded with the frames themselves.",
