This fragment is likely to have been cut from a mattress cover in modern times. The decoration is composed of repeating bands with a complex chequer design taking the place of the simple motifs in contrasting colours that are more typical of this weave. Certain technical characteristics, in particular the fact that the compound structure continues on through the plain cherry-red bands, set this textile aside from the majority of finds in this weave. Although discovered in Egypt, it may have been made elsewhere.",
