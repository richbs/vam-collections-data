During the 14th century they developed a freer form in design, moving away from the confining circles and other shapes which had previously been used to frame real or imaginary animals and birds. These luxury textiles, which often included metal threads, silver-gilt in this case, were highly desirable and traded throughout Europe. They were used for both dress and furnishings in ecclesiastical and secular contexts.",
