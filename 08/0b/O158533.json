These cartouches are not symmetrically placed.  The ground between is embroidered with pointed bands of geometric patterns which meet to form two triangles, one above the other. In each corner is a square of embroidery with small lozenges forming a grid. In the middle of the piece is an octagon of cutwork, needlewoven bars and pinwheels. This is edged with narrow borders of embroidery and needleweaving.\n\nNote: cannot do needleweaving on the diagonal, so embroidery has been used along diagonal sides.\n\nFrom the centre of each side are three inward pointing trees, the middle one in cutwork and the outer two in pulled thread work.  From each corner there is a pointed diagonal band of embroidery and pulled thread within a very pointed corner unit of cutwork.  All this creates an irregularly shaped field which is embroidered with lozenges to form a grid. There are two rolled hems.\n\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
