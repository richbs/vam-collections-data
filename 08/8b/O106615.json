One result of this near-global pattern of commerce was that the artists and craftsmen of the Islamic Middle East had to compete with the best in the world, as in the case of Chinese ceramics.  On many occasions they met the challenge with considerable success, and the new wares they created were exported to other regions, where they were sometimes replicated by local craftsmen.  In other words, artistic ideas circulated in an International system that existed in parallel to, and in dependence on, the system of trade.
