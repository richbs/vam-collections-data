It was taken up by Stansilav Libensky in the 1940s when he taught in the Dept. of Painted and Stained Glass at the Novy Bor glass school. He made a large number of designs based on biblical themes, but also many others which were more fantastic and impressionistic using motifs from prehistoric cave paintings to fairy tales and dreams. The decoration was applied by technicians using acid-etching, which was then painted in by the students as part of their training.",
