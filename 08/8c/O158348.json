            "public_access_description": "Mrs Bartley (n\u00e9e Smith), the distinguished late Georgian actress, was considered to be second only to Mrs Siddons in her portrayal of tragic heroines on stage. Described by fellow actor Walter Donaldson, in his Recollections of an Actor, \u201cshe had a noble and expressive face, full, strong and melodious voices, capable of any intonation, and an original conception of her author\u201d. She toured the regional theatres of Britain, with her husband George Bartley, and subsequently toured America. \n\nThis production of Fazio, written by the Rev. Henry Milman, toured the regions after being performed at the Surrey Theatre in 1816 and Covent Garden in 1818. Mrs Bartley played the role of Bianca, wife of Fazio. Bianca woos Fazio, a dabbler in alchemy, away from a rich courtesan, Aldabella. The tragedy begins when his desperation for riches is sated by the death of his miser neighbour. He takes the neighbour\u2019s money, setting himself up as a lord, with Bianca the only sharer of his secret. Reverting to the pursuit of Aldabella, Bianca, in jealousy, reports her treacherous husband\u2019s deception. Fazio is sentenced; he may not have killed his neighbour, but robbery in Florence is punishable by death. Bianca repents and dies of a broken heart, and Aldabella is sent to a convent.",
