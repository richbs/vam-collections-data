The following is the full text of the entry: GUARDI, FRANCESCO (1712-93) 1028 Recto A Venetian villa terminating an avenue, with figures Pen and ink and wash 11 x 15 5/8 (280 x 397) Verso A rough sketch of a regatta Pen and ink CAI.413 PROVENANCE]. F. Gigoux (Lugt 1164); Ionides Bequest 1901 (Lugt 488) LITERATURE <i>Ionides Catalogue</i>, p. 12 (as by Guardi); Reitlinger, p. 18, no. 39; G. A. Simonson in <i>OMD</i>, 3, September 1928, p. and pl. 25; J. Byam Shaw in <i>OMD</i>, 12, September 1937, p. 21, n. 2; Pallucchini, p. 50; Byam Shaw, p. 64; Morassi, <i>Tutti i disegn</i><i>i</i>, no. 436, pl. 435 (recto), no. 296, pl. 303 (verso) This is doubtless the drawing attributed to Guardi which was sold in the Gigoux sale, 1882, under the following description: 'Chemin borde d'arbres conduisant a une maison venitienne.' (See Mireur, <i>Dictionnaire des Ventes d'Art</i>, 3, 1911, p. 377). Simonson doubted the attribution to Guardi, suggestii that both recto and verso were by a clever imitator, possibly French. Byam Shaw, Pallucchini and Morassi accept the drawings as by Guardi. Byam Shaw, seeing the drawing again in 1970, said it was possible that some of the darker washes were added later, perhaps to counteract fading. The verso is stamped twice with the initials F.H.N\u00b0., and the number 303 has been inserted once, in ink, into the appropriate space. No such collector's mark is recorded. There is a mistake in Morassi's illustrations: his pl. 435 shows the verso, on its side, instead of the recto; while his pl. 303 shows the verso again, the right way up: so the recto is not shown at all.",
