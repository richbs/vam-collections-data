The embroidery \u2013 which shows sprays of flowers (such as peonies and prunus), pomegranates and birds \u2013 is in Pekin knots, satin, stem and long and short stitch.\n\nThe jacket has wide, elbow-length sleeves with straight cuffs. The main part of the embroidery is located on the back side of the sleeves. The sleeve bands are of green silk satin with flowers and butterflies embroidered in bright shades of blue and purple silk in satin stitches. However, large parts of this embroidery have been worn away leaving only the inked outlines visible.\n\nThe garment fastens at the front with hooks and eyes, a gilt metal fastening at the neck and two embroidered satin tapes. It has a small standing collar. There are slits at the sides with <i>ruyitou</i> scroll shape trimmings just above these openings. There is a continuous double black satin band along the edges at the neck and front opening. The hem and side slits are embroidered in three shades of blue silk in satin stitch. \n\nThe jacket is lined with blue cotton.",

The entire robe is framed with several different trims, which cohere visually because they are confined to shades of blue, black and white.  The part of the garment pictured is the trimming for the side slit, always the site of the densest decoration on Chinese women's clothing of this type.  It accentuated the sway of the hips as the wearer walked along, often on bound feet.  The wide band, densely covered with blue embroidery, goes along the hem, turns the corner with a neat mitre, and then blossoms out into a curlicue shape just above the side-slit opening.  The curl is stretched over, and stuck down onto, a cotton base cut to shape and covered with paste.  The paste also helps to bond the underside of this now stiffened scroll to the ground material and it is sewn down as well.  This band is sandwiched between narrow bias-cut satin lengths in blue and slightly wider ones in black.  The tiny blue edgings are folded and tucked under the wider bands and manipulated skilfully so that the blue always retains an even width throughout.  A similar, though narrower, embroidered band is applied inside the broad band and is itself flanked in blue.",
