The first one, Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) became the most successful film in history and grossed over $290 million.  It was not only the film that became a success but also the mechandising that was produced along side the film. The films captured the public's imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis toy spaceship is the Millennium Falcon, which is captained by Han Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca the Wookie.  It is the most iconic of all the vehicles in the Star Wars films. It was produced by Hasbro under the Kenner name after they took over the company in 1991.  As the toys had sold so well after the first films it was decided to re-release a new range which was known as Power of the Force 2.",
