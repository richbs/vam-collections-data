Posters such as this sought to reassure society that women would not lose their femininity by putting on a uniform. They maintained some stylistic continuity with familiar commerical images of women. This reinforced the government's stance that wartime occupations were temporary and would not fundamentally change women's traditional roles. In this poster, the female Waves recruit is seen actively benefitting the war effort in her role as an air traffic controller. This image would have helped to send the message that women had valuable skills to contribute and would be given important responsibilities.",
