To the right is the garden of Eden enclosed in walls with a turretted gate from which four rivers flow. Adam and Eve stand on either side of an apple tree, each holding an apple, and also covering the lower private parts with a fig leaf. A snake wraps around the trunk of the tree. In the garden are palm trees and a stone well. To the left is a wall and iron arched gate with door ajar, and in front of this Adam and Eve, still covering themselves with fig leaves, are sent on their way by St Michael with his sword aloft. The page is whole and text and decorative initials are still intact. This is Folio VII.",

It was removed from a book entitled Liber Chronicarum, or 'Nuremberg Chronicle', published in 1493 by printer Anton Koberger. One of the most ambitious books produced in the 15th century with over 1000 woodcut illustrations, the 'Nuremberg Chronicle' was also one of the earliest books with illustrations designed by artists rather than blockcutters. Koberger commissioned Michael Wolgemut, who ran a large art workshop, to design the illustrations and layout between 1487 and 1491. Wolgemut was helped by his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff\n\nWoodcut images could be printed on the same page as text because the type used to print the words and the woodcut image were both in relief, so they could be set together in the same frame (called a \u2018forme\u2019) and printed simultaneously. \n\nIn common with practice at the time, not all of the images in the Chronicle were original designs, some being copies after artists like Martin Schongauer, and some being used more than once in the same book. But where earlier woodcut book illustrations were simple outlines the use of light and tone shows how differently an artist responded to the potential of the woodcut medium. Books like this led to artists such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer  considering the potential of the woodcut as a medium of expression. D\u00fcrer trained under Wolgemut between 1486 and 1489 at around the time when Wolgemut received the commission for this book.",
