Fine arts and scientific inventions and discoveries remained central display themes but each exhibition presented different aspects of manufacture. In 1872 one emphasis was on jewellery, including \u2018peasant jewellery\u2019. The Exhibition Commissioners arranged with the South Kensington Museum (later V&A) to make a collection of peasant jewellery from \u2018all parts of the world, which should become public property, for exhibition in the Museum after the close of the Exhibition\u2019. A letter was sent by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to British representatives overseas asking for their help in securing pieces of jewellery, particularly examples with \u2018a direct connection with the native instinctive art, which has been handed down by a long tradition\u2019. The outcome was considered to be \u2018most satisfactory \u2026 a collection of characteristic ornaments never before equalled was obtained\u2019. \n\nThis silver amulet case is part of this collection. It was made in Egypt. The cap at one end can be removed to allow a rolled written script to be inserted.  Cylindrical amulet cases, like this, were common throughout the Middle East.  They are called khiyar, meaning cucumber, from their shape.",
