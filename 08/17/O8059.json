            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nFor more than a century before this piece was made genuine ancient classical sculpture in white marble had been one of the most expensive and superior forms of collectable art. It implied the continental European travel, an expensive education and aristocratic taste. It also suggested an intimate knowledge of   Rome and the ancient world. Ownership of statuary porcelain, otherwise known as Parian ware, suggested a peripheral association with this highly exclusive world.  When the statues   became available as prizes in the Art Union lottery they became even more popular and accessible to the new middle classes. The Minton ceramic factory produced over 500 Parian figures between 1845 and 1910.\n\nMaterials & Making\nParian ware is a highly vitrified ceramic closer to European hard porcelains than English bone china. The basic materials for its manufacture are feldspar, Cornish clay and Cornish stone. 'Parian ware' was Minton's trade name for the material. It is largely impervious to damp and dirt and easily cleanable. Each part of a Parian figure was made in a separate mould. The smooth appearance of the finished figure was admired as much for the technical skill in its manufacture as for its aesthetic qualities. \n\nTrading\nAt the Great Exhibition in London of 1851 more than ten manufacturers, including all the leading names in the British ceramic industry, included Parian in their displays. It was enthusiastically received both by critics and the Royal Family.  One commentator wrote that Parian 'was becoming one of the most generally admired and gold-productive of all the achievements of ceramic art'. All the manufacturers charged high prices for their Parian wares from the outset. Even a popular figure such as Minton's Dorothea, registered in 1847, was sold for 2 guineas at time when many people were still earning \u01531 per week or less. Parian was offered as a prize through the Art Union and other lotteries, which charged \u01531 for a ticket in their annual ballots.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe original life-sized marble figure of this piece was originally made for Felix Summerly's Art Manufactures. It was commissioned from John Bell (1811-1895) in 1838 by Lord Lansdowne. The subject is from the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes' novel Don Quixote, part 1: 'They espied a youth dressed like a peasant stooping to bathe his lovely feet in a rivulet...the lovely maiden looked up...'",
