Shortly thereafter, in 936, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Rahman III founded a palace complex near the city of C\u00f3rdoba called Madinat al-Zahra. The walls of Madinat al-Zahra were decorated with plant designs, including this fragment of limestone ornament. Court poetry of the period shows that abundant plants symbolised the realm\u2019s fertility, which was ensured by the caliph\u2019s just rule.\n\nPatterns based on plants had been used long before the coming of Islam, and they continued to be popular throughout the Islamic period. Over time, the use of elements with recognisable plant forms (like the leaves seen here) gave way to more heavily stylised vegetal patterns. As time passed, the stylised element became dominant.",
