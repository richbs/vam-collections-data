Pupil of his father and John Varley, and joined the circle of Dr Monro. Principally known as a watercolour painter of land and seascapes and as a drawing master. In a long and prolific career, exhibited 17 works at the RA between 1811 and 1842, 100 at the BI 1812-55, but principally at the OWS where from 1810 he showed about 1700 paintings (elected Associate 1810, Member 1813, Treasurer 1817, Secretary 1818, and President 1831). Won gold medal at the Paris Salon 1824, and influenced French painters including Delacroix. Died Worthing, Sussex, 3 March 1855. There are many watercolours in the V&A collections.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, p108 (obit); Redgrave <i>Cent</i>, p509-13; Redgrave <i>Diet</i>; J Sherer <i>A Gallery of British Artists</i> 11, 1880, pp57-8; S Kaines Smith 'Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding' (and list of works) <i>OWS</i> III, 1925, pp8-30; M Hardie <i>Watercolour Painting in Britain, II The Romantic Period</i> 1967, pp43 etc, <i>III The Victorian Period</i> 1968, pp36, etc \n\n<b>Yanwath Hall, on the Eamont, Westmorland</b> \n545-1882 Neg 81261 \nCanvas, 19.4 x 26.1 cm (7 5/8 x 10\u00bc ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nPreviously catalogued as 'Brougham Castle' (except in the <i>Summary Catalogue of British Paintings</i> (in the V&A), 1973) the work has a MS label on the back inscribed 'No.4 Copley Fielding/View ofYanwath Hall/on the River Eamont near/Ullswater Cumberland/Liverp'. The last word suggests the work may have been exhibited in Liverpool. \n\nYanwath Hall, described by Pevsner as 'splendidly preserved', is some 20 miles south of Penrith, and dates from the 14th and 15th centuries. The battlemented tower is most clearly visible in the painting. The work does not seem to have been exhibited in London; Fielding showed several other Westmorland and Cumberland subjects, at the BI 1815-6 and 1837, and at the RA in 1818. He also exhibited three paintings of Naworth Castle, some 25 miles north of Yanwath, at the BI in 1839, 1846, and 1847. \n\nPROV: W Shand, sold Christie's 17 June 1871 (109, as 'The River Emont, near Ullswater'}, bought the dealer Vokins \u00a336 15s, who presumably sold it to John Jones, by whom bequeathed to the museum 1882\"",
