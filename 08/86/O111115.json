            "physical_description": "Basic description yet to be done.  The following are observations by Lucy Wood and Emma Luker (April 2005 for <i>Materials and Techniques</i>):\n\n<u>Construction</u> \nThe interior of the upper section looks completely remade.  The side doors are panelled in a mitred frame constructed with mitred tenon joints that are double pegged - the rails are tenonned into the stiles. The door on the front is the same.  The doors must have been made as doors at the same time.  The left door has been repaired later with a new bottom rail and hinge-end stile (has no pegs).  This repair is evident all the way through to the front of the left door.  It seems likely that the three doors either all come from another object or were made up as doors from scratch particularly for this cabinet.  However, the frames of the doors on the sides do not relate in terms of frame or marquetry with the door on the front.  The top of the cabinet is of a mitred tenon construction with pegs - the top has been veneered which is very unusual/suspect.\n\n<u>Marquetry</u> \nThis consists of a German panel (combined with French carving). The ground of the marquetry is horizontally grained; this is most evident in the section of sky, whereas the support, as seen on the back of the door, is vertically grained.  As such, the marquetry must be in total veneer.\n\n<u>Carving</u> \nBackboard of base looks newer.\n\nIt is possible that the cabinet comprises an old top and bottom on the right side and a very skilful copy on the left side.  This can be seen by comparing like with like.  Some examples, moving from the top to the bottom, are:\n\nTOP:\n1.The fluting of the tail of the uppermost bird is more defined on the left.\n2.The ribbon swag from which the torso is suspended is treated totally differently on the left \u2013 it has no lambrequins.\n3.The musculature of the torso is more articulated on the left.\n4.On the cartouche, Neptune\u2019s trident is more symmetrical on the left\n5.The dragon below is more vital in e.g. feathers on the right than the left \u2013 it is almost on fire on the right and appears far more naturalistic.\n6.The feathers on the arrows in the quiver at the bottom of this section are far more like feathers on the right than the left.\n\nThe flanking terms were not examined closely but the forehead of the man on the outside is more articulated on the left than the right.  Is it normal to have such exactly paired male and female figures?  Would it be more normal to have four slightly different ones?  \n\nThe apron to the frieze drawer has a more \u2018nicely\u2019 carved bracket on the right side than the bracket and face on the left.  There appears to be a join to the right of the face (half lapped).\n\nBOTTOM:\n1.Frieze \u2013 the treatment of the features and hair of the faces are different on the left and right. Those on the right appear more naturalistic.  The lambrequins at the bottom of the frieze are much bigger and more tooled on the left than the right  - those on the right are more delicate.\n2.Foliage under the arch on each side - in places it looks like on the right side the basic shape of the foliage was carved out and then the veining was tooled.  On the left it looks like it was the other way round.\n3.The figurative elements on the right columns, e.g. eagles, appear to have far more movement than the ones on the left \u2013 they almost look like they have the wind in their faces.  Again, the leaves on the left columns are more articulated than those on the right.",
