The judges were impressed by its clean, neat appearance, and by the use of colours not usually seen on this type of cookware (making it attractive enough to take straight from oven to table). \n\nIn terms of practical use, it scored well because the machined base which distributed the heat evenly, could be used on either gas or electric hobs. One of the judges expressed reservations about how easy it would be to remove the lid without the traditional knob, but it was felt that the advantage gained in saving oven space compensated for this.",

The judges were impressed by its clean, neat appearance, and by the use of colours not usually seen on this type of cookware (making it attractive enough to take straight from oven to table). In terms of practical use, it scored well because the machined base which distributed the heat evenly, could be used on either gas or electric hobs. One of the judges expressed reservations about the ease of removing the lid without the traditional knob, but it was felt that the advantage gained in saving oven space compensated.\n\nHistorical significance: Won Design Council Award in 1960.",
