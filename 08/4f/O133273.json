He spent three years in Italy and specialised in landscape paintings. He enjoyed quickly a great success but the turning-point of his career, however, came with the accession to power of Louis-Napol\u00e9on who praised his art with the consequence that collectors and dealers began to be interested in his work.\n\nThis painting is considered as a imitation of Corot late period when he painted landscapes only vaguely reminiscent of places. It imitates Corot loose brushwork and sketchy figures almost overwhelmed by nature. The signature in the lower right hand-side is considered as false.",

He worked out of doors in Fontainebleau and elsewhere until his visit to Italy in 1825-28, which transformed his style. He visited Italy again in 1834 and 1843 but most of the rest of his life was spent in Paris and its environs and at Fontainebleau, where, from the turn of the mid-century, he frequently met the artists of the Barbizon group. His style remained a mixture of Italian classicism and Barbizon realism. He exhibited in the Salon from 1827, gradually achieved recognition, receiving official commissions from the 1840s and being made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1846. \nLit. A. Robaut and E.

Florence, 1916\n\nHistorical significance: Although this painting is signed 'Corot' lower right and is reminiscent of such work by the artist as <i>Souvenir d'Italie, un p\u00e2tre dans une gorge</i>, formerly Galleries Georges Petit, Paris (Schoeller, 1956, no. 15), it appears to be an imitation. The painting's attribution is however still subject to debate. \nIt was painted on a mahogany panel, a rare support for painting because of the price of this timber. Corot however painted either on canvas or panel. On the back of the panel is a printed trade label of Thomas McLean, dealer in works of art, 7 Haymarket, W.\nThis painting is reminiscent of Corot late style when he departed from representing the warm countryside of Italy to focus on the rendering of lights with strong areas of contrast. \nCorot was famous for his direct observation of nature he nevertheless often re-elaborated in his studio. This artistic practice derived from his master's dictum, Michallon, to paint out of doors directly from the motif but was also inspired by the landscapes of Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) and 17th-century Dutch masters.\nThe museum owns two authentic paintings by Corot from his late period: CAI.65 and CAI.66.",

            "historical_context_note": "Although France and England became the new centres of landscape art in the 18th century, the Italian and Dutch traditions retained their authority. However the Arcadian vision of Italy increasingly tended towards a more precise observation of nature. Some of the most exciting developments took place in Venice, in the soft scenes of Francesco Zuccarelli (1702-1788), inspired by Claude Lorrain (1604-1682), and the fresh, spontaneous landscapes of Marco Ricci (1676-1730). Wealthy patrons, often accompanied by artists, on The Grand Tour, created a market for veduta and capriccio paintings, respectively topographical and fantasist landscape paintings. Landscape conventions were further enriched by foreign artists working in Italy, responding both to the beauty of Italian light and scenery celebrated by the Latin poets and vividly captured in the most popular landscapes of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Gaspard Dughet (1615-1675).",
