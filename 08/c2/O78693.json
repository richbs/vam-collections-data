They each formed the back of one `arbour' or supper box, an ornate wooden shelter formed of two side walls and a roof, framing picturesque views through the Gardens, where guests could take supper. At a certain moment in the evening's entertainment, the paintings were `let fall' to enclose the diners at the back. The front was left permanently open for the fashionable occupants to view and be viewed.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nOne of the May Day customs that Francis Hayman illustrated was dancing round the May Pole. This custom still persists, although the days when it was a welcome sight on most village greens have long gone. The Puritans perceived it as an immoral activity and literally tried to cut down May Poles in many places. Nowadays May Pole dancing is regarded as a harmless activity for children, in the same tradition as Morris dancing. The painting's theme of pleasure was in keeping with the spirit of carnival at Spring Gardens in Vauxhall. Here, however, it is depicted with an emphasis on refinement rather than bawdiness.\n\nPeople\nFrancis Hayman began as a scene painter, then turned to portraiture. His first major decorative commission consisted of these large paintings at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. The commission came from Hayman's patron, the entrepreneur Jonathan Tyers (died 1767), who held the lease on Spring Gardens and was responsible for opening them to the public in 1732.",

Much retouched; in the present state of the picture only a few of the heads, notably those in the shadow at the back of the group, are recognisable as by Hayman himself. The landscape-representing the ancient village church and not, as appears at first sight, a dissenter's chapel - is clearly the work of an assistant.\"",
