The sleeves, consisting of two widths of material, are secured to the garment body for only 20 cm at the back. The cuff ends of the sleeves are threaded with parti-coloured silk braid in white and purple. One width of material forms the back of the garment and this extends over the shoulders to partly form both the front and the underlapping section. Extra pieces of silk have, however, been seamed to both front and underflap to widen them.\nThe robe is browny-green sil gauze weave having the warps funcioning in groups of threes (possibly one fixed end and two doup ends). The gauze ground is self-patterned with bird roundels achieved by changing the binding system from a gauze to a non-gauze weave. The patterned areas still have the warps functioning in threes but they do not cross over. One warp interlaces in a plainweave while the other two form a 1/3 twill weave.\nThere is a plain weave white silk lining across the shoulder section.\nThe robe is of the <i>kariginu</i> type (hunting tunic) also used in No drama and it would have been worn over other garments. This gauze robe was for summer wear.\n[Belt] The robe has a sash of matching browny-green material, stiffened in the middle. The front of the robe would be drawn up over the belt leaving a short front section, with the bcak falling to its full length.",

Those with small openings at the wrist are known as kosode, while robes such as this, with a wide wrist opening that extends along the entire width of the sleeve, are called osode.  This kind of large, loose sleeve allows for a layered look as the edges of the garments worn underneath are revealed at the sleeve opening of the upper garment.  Voluminous osode, made of stiff woven fabrics, are worn at the imperial court.  This garment is a kariginu or 'hunting cloth'.  To allow for maximum ease of movement when drawing a bow on horseback, the double width sleeves are attached to the body of the garment only at the upper back and the cords threaded along the cuffs allow the sleeve to be gathered up.  This example was made in the second half of the nineteenth century, by which time kariginu were no longer worn for hunting, but as part of the everyday costume of court nobles.  It is a summer garment, the open structure of the gauze making it perfect for hot, humid weather.  Worn over other robes, the transparency of the cloth would have created a shimmering effect.",
