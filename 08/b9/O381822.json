The piece was probably always a decorative item, and never functioned as a shoe-horn, a term which may indeed be a later, even mistaken discription.\nAmsterdam was the principal European port, and much ivory arrived there from Africa from the sixteenth century onwards. Many devotional ivories, whose authorship was unrecorded, were produced in the Netherlands during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly crucifix figures and statuettes of the Christ Child. Nothing is known about the artist.",
