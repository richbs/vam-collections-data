Drum-shaped table clocks also served as time-keepers whilst travelling. Such clocks were made in Southern Germany, in Augsburg and Nuremberg, and exported accross Europe. They were cherished possessions and often shown in portraits of European kings and princes. The portrait of the French king Henri II by Primaticcio show a similar table clock on the table beside the sitter.",
