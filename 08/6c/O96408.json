It was on Wilson's advice that he took up metalwork in 1897 and he was primarily responsible for reviving the use of shagreen.  Shagreen was originally a species of untanned leather; from the mid 18th century nurse shark skin or the less expensive dog fish skin was used.  It was traditionally used to cover a vast variety of containers from boxes for tea caddies, knife boxes, canteens, small pocket or presentation cases and spectacle cases.\nPurchased from the British Institute of Industrial Art out of the Spielmann Memorial Fund.\n\nNeg._No: 72691",
