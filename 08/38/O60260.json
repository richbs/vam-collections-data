This ballet was one of several planned by Cyril Beaumont in the 1920s, when he was active with two small dance groups, Beaucraske (himself and the noted Cecchetti teacher Margaret Craske) and Cremorne Ballet with Fiona Fairbairn, who ran the Mayfair School of Dancing.  1789 was inspired by the French Revolution, with music composed by Felix White and designs possibly by Beaumont himself.  The ballet was to feature several pas de deux for the Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette and Beaumont approached Bronislava Nijinska to choreograph these episodes; she refused payment, but accepted in lieu a first edition of Noverre's Letttres sur la danse.   As the ballet was never produced, these dances were lost.  \nA note in Beaumont's hand on a torn envelope accompanying the designs reads \"Designs for my ballet 1789\".  The Colnaghi private view invitations, on the reverse of which S.379-2001 and S.380-2001 are drawn, date the designs to after February 1925.\n\nHistorical significance: Although never produced, the designs are interesting in being an indication of dance activity in Britain in the wake of the renewed interest in ballet created by the Diaghilev Ballet and in the period before the foundation of permanent ballet companies.",
