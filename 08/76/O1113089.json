He was born in Hereford and came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but made his London debut as an actor in 1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre as Richard III. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted during his lifetime in many of his most famous roles, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810). Richard III was a role with which he was especially associated, both from his London debut and his first appearance as Richard at Drury Lane Theatre on 11 May 1742. \n\nThis image of Garrick as Richard III was engraved by John Dixon (1740-1811) and published in 1772 after a painting by Nathaniel Dance which was exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1771. By this date Nathaniel Dance (1735-1811) was an extremely fashionable and well-connected portrait painter living in Covent Garden, where he was ideally placed to see theatre and get to know the leading actors of his day. He was a foundation member of the Royal Academy.",
