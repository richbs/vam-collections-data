Hot or cold milk was mixed with water, wine, beer, floral infusions, beef or mutton broth, chicken or veal stock, and cereals such as barley, rice or sago. The deep saucer could be used for bread or as a bowl for cooling the drink. \n\nCups and saucers of this type were made at Vincennes/S\u00e8vres factory from 1752 until the 1780s.  King Louis XV, his mistress Mme. de Pompadour and many members of the court are listed in the sales records as purchasing them.  We know from the inventory taken on her death in 1764 that Mme. de Pompadour kept examples of this shape in her garde-robe, the room used in the same way as a plumbed-in bathroom today.\n\nThe painter Etienne Evans was one of many fan painters who were employed by the factory, starting at Vincennes in 1752 and only finally retiring from S\u00e8vres nearly fifty years later in 1800.  He specialised in bird decoration.",
