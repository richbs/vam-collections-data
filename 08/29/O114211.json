According to legend, they determine the course of human life, symbolised by the thread that they spin, measure and cut. Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos are usually portrayed as old and unattractive, but here they are young and fashionably dressed. This print shows a good example of the female costume of the period: wide, long skirts, brooches and pearl necklaces and lace hanging off the sleeves. Clotho holds the distaff, Lachesis holds the spindle and Atropos cuts the thread. The Three Fates are often shown alongside other symbols of death.",
