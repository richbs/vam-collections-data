Studied medicine and theology at Marischal College, and for a few months at the RA Schools in 1825, before making his first visit to Rome, where he presumably made contact with the 'Nazarene' painters. Exhibited 41 works at the RA between 1827 and 1861, four at the BI 1828-41, and 58 at the RSA. Specialised in mythological, historical and biblical subjects, also portraits and landscapes. Elected ARA 1844, RA 1848. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, notably in 'Pegwell Bay' (1858, Tate Gallery). Involved in reorganisation of art education; appointed Superintendent of the School of Design 1837, resigned 1843. Active as ecclesiologist and musicologist. Several fresco paintings for Prince Albert and the Palace of Westminster. Died 15 February 1864 Streatham, London; studio sale at Christie's 5 May 1865. A typed transcript of selected correspondence is in the Dyce Papers, Aberdeen Art Gallery.\n \nLIT: M Pointon <i>William Dyce</i> Oxford 1979 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>Life Study (head of Christ)</b> \n156-1865 Neg HF4876 \nCanvas, 50.7 x 36.8 cm (20 x 14\u00bd  ins) \nPurchased 1865 \n\nThe model for this life study seems to be that used by Dyce for 'St Joseph' (1846-7, Royal Collection), and is similar to the head of Christ in both 'The Man of Sorrows' (RS 1860, private collection) and 'Christ and the Woman of Samaria' (1860, Birmingham City Art Gallery). The head of the Christ in glory in the design for All Saints, Margaret Street, also shares this resemblance (see 164-1894, below).\n \nPROV: Artist's studio sale, Christie's 5 May 1865 (135 'head of a man with a beard, bought de Tocte \u00a35 15s 6d, or 138 'head of Christ', bought Chaffers \u00a31 11s 6d).\"",
