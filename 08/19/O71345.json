This particular print portrays the actor Nakamura Utaemon III as the master swordsman Kyogoku Takumi, one of four roles he played in his farewell performance at the Kado-za Theatre in March 1825. The story relates how Kyogoku Takumi murders Yoshioka Ichimisai after the latter defeats him in a test of swordsmanship, and how Yoshioka's daughter Osono sets out to avenge her father's death. Utaemon gave this farewell performance because he was ill. He recovered, however, and resumed his theatrical career until 1838.",
