Celadon wares made at Longquan in southern China were the most popular type of porcelain imported into the Middle East in the 14th and 15th centuries. The characteristic green glaze of celadon ware can vary in tone and includes the greyish-green shown here.\n\nThe body of this dish is fritware. Fritware was also known as stone paste or quartz paste. It was developed by Middle Eastern potters as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain. The main ingredient was fine quartz powder made by grinding sand or pebbles. Small quantities of white clay and a glassy substance known as frit were added. The clay gave plasticity. The frit helped to bind the body after firing.",
