ISBN 1851771026\nParkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 31\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"CLINT, George ARA (1770-1854)\n\nBorn Brownlow Street, Drury Lane, London, 12 April 1770, son of a hairdresser. After school in Yorkshire, worked in turn for a fishmonger, attorney, housepainter, and bookseller. Trained first as a miniature painter; acquaintance with John Bell (see FA253, p31) and his nephew Edward Bell led him to produce mezzotints; also made coloured copies from prints after George Morland and others. First oil painting was a portrait of his wife, which resulted in an introduction to Sir William Beechey RA. Exhibited 99 works at the RA between 1802 and 1845, nine at the BI 1815-42, and 15 at the SBA 1831-47. Almost all were portraits, and after 1816 many were of actors and theatrical scenes in the tradition of Zoffany and Samuel de Wilde. His studio in Gower Street became a rendezvous for the leading actors and actresses of the day. Elected ARA 1821; repeated failure to be elected RA resulted in his resignation 1836. Died Kensington, London, 10 May 1854.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss) \n\nWilliam Charles Macready as Macbeth \n074 Neg H1608 \nPanel, 29.2 X 24.1 cm (11\u00bd x 9\u00bd ins) \nDyce Bequest 1869 \n\nWhen received with the remainder of the Dyce Bequest in 1869, it was catalogued as by an unknown artist; the 1893 catalogue tentatively suggested an attribution to George Clint. An engraving by W Coutts, published in 1821 as after Clint, corresponds in detail with this painting, and there seems no reason to doubt that it is by Clint.\n \nWilliam Charles Macready (1793-1873) from his London debut in 1816 became the leading tragic actor of the day. In the Covent Garden season of 1819-20, which made his reputation, he played Richard Ill, Coriolanus, King Lear, and for the first time, at his benefit performance on 9 June 1820, Macbeth. In his <i>Reminiscences</i>, Macready quotes the critic of the <i>Morning Herald</i> (10 June 1820): 'The pathos which he infused into Macbeth was a principal merit in its delineation'. Clint is only mentioned once in the <i>Reminiscences</i>, as introducing Macready to John Forster at Edmund Kean's funeral in 1833. Macready was painted several times by other artists (for a full iconography, see Ormond), including John Jackson, who also painted him in the role of Macbeth (Royal Shakespeare Company collection, repr in <i>Reminiscences</i> II, facing p224), and as Henry IV in 1821 (NPG). In the V&A collections there is a portrait of him as Werner by Daniel Maclise, as well as a sepia study by Maclise for his 1836 painting of Macready as Macbeth with the witches (whereabouts unknown). \n\nENGR: W Coutts (1821) \n\nLIT: ed Sir F Pollock <i>Macready's Reminiscences</i>, and selections from his\nDiaries and letters, 2 vols, 1875, I, pp213-4; W Archer <i>William Charles\nMacready</i> 1890 pp49-55; ed W Toynbee <i>The Diaries of W C Macready</i>\n1833-1851 2 vols, 1912, I, p36; R Ormond <i>Early Victorian Portraits</i> 2 vols,\n1973, I, pp296-9\"",
