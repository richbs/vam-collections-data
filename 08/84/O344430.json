Ipsen, widow (P.Ipsens Enke) established at 33 Bredgade, Copenhagen, Denmark in 1843, was one of many factories in the area specialising in wares, often with neo-classical styling, as here. Classical themes remained popular in Denmark throughout much of the 19th century as they did in Germany.  This tazza, given to the Museum by Prince Albert, presumably caught his interest for its simple, classical shape.  In 1878,  the London Art Journal remarked on the company's 'copies of the antique' at the international exhibition held in Paris, adding 'the clay is remarkably fine, found we understand, in Denmark'. This fine clay is evident in the very smooth surface of this unglazed tazza.",
