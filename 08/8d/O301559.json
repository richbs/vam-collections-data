The mantelpiece was therefore most likely made between 1804 when Napoleon became Emperor and 1809 when he divorced Josephine.  The imagery of the Imperial regime was characterised by strong Neo-classical styles, drawing parallels with Napoleon\u2019s rule and the power of ancient Rome. This can be seen here in the jambs in the form of caryatids standing on eagles, lions either side under the mantle, the Imperial eagles, laurel wreaths and oak leaves of the central scene and the use of cameo style relief decoration. \n\nThe mantelpiece was made by one of the many Paris porcelain factories which were established in the late-18th to early-19th century. The Empire period (1804-15) was a revived and lucrative period for the arts industries in France, although the export trade was reduced, due to political conflict, a wealthy French bourgeoisie society emerged which expanded the domestic market for manufacturers of Paris porcelain. Luxury was once again acceptable and Napoleon and Josephine commissioned works of art and complete interiors for their Imperial palaces. Josephine is known to have patronised the porcelain factories of Honor\u00e9 and Dagoty for the smaller rooms at the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison.",
