            "public_access_description": "By the 1970s, American photographer Al Vandenberg (1932-2012) had abandoned his commercial career to take street photographs. Having studied photography in New York alongside Alexey Brodovitch, Richard Avedon and Bruce Davidson, Vandenberg became a successful commercial photographer and art director working in both New York and London during the 1960s. After a period of travelling, he settled in London in 1974 with the aim of using his photographic skills to create portraits of city life without a commercial agenda.\n\nVandenberg\u2019s series On a Good Day documents a wide variety of Londoners. Although made on the street, the photographs are carefully posed and the subjects present themselves head-on to the camera with ease and confidence. Shopfronts and window displays serve as the backdrops in many of the photographs. The posters in the background of this photograph indicate the political climate in the mid-1980s, as The Greater London Council (GLC) faced abolition from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government. Ken Livingstone held Labour leadership of the GLC at the time and had taken measures to improve representation of the city\u2019s minorities. Despite significant opposition from the public, the council was dissolved through the passing of The Local Government Act of 1985.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired fifteen photographs from Al Vandenberg\u2019s On a Good Day series as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
