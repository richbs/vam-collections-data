On this plaque, however, she participates in the scene as a central figure, with her hands in the 'orans' (prayer) position. The inclusion of Mary reflects her great importance in Byzantine spiritual life.\nThe plaque originally formed part of a triptych. The upper and lower borders have the two holes commonly seen on the central panels of Byzantine triptychs. These would have held ivory pegs securing two separate strips of ivory to the front of the plaque, which in turn held the wings in place. The triptych to which it belonged would have been a modest product of a workshop producing such objects in good numbers, and is likely to have been made some decades after the best works of the second half of the tenth century.",

The upper and lower borders have the two holes commonly seen on the central panels of Byzantine triptychs. These would have held ivory pegs securing two separate strips of ivory to the front of the plaque, which in turn held the wings in place. The triptych to which it belonged would have been a modest product of a workshop producing such objects in good numbers, and is likely to have been made some decades after the best works of the second half of the tenth century.",

The scale and the four holes which perforate the border suggest that it was originally used as a book cover.  The Ascension, in which Christ rises to heaven above the heads of the Apostles and the Virgin Mary, was often used to decorate books and is here depicted in a conventional manner.\nCutler notes the present ivory as demonstrative of the careful planning required to execute feet which project beyond (as well as sink into) the groundline. Feet that extend in to space had to be planned when the craftsman blocked out his schema of discrete mass.",
