The back uprights with inward scroll finials and nail head ornament, and each with a split baluster turning applied to the front face. With a panel seat, sunken 20mm below the level of the rails, formed by 3 oak planks (grained front to back) held in grooves in the rails; with a  cushion (40 x 34 x 3cm) covered by red velvet over board, and four webbing  straps that fit into holes in the board seat.  The front and side rails with a simple scratch  moulding along their lower edges. With a dark stain overall.\n\nThe frame with a single front stretcher (at mid-height), turned with baluster and rings and meeting the front legs in a square block, which matches the turning on the front legs, two plain, rectangular stretchers on each side, and one low, plain rectangular stretcher at the back. \nA knotty oak has been used.\n\nModifications\nThe front right leg with extensive wood-worm losses (partly filled with epoxy).

This chair would have been used with a separate seat  cushion on the solid seat board. The carved back-pieces, board seat and single, turned front stretcher are distinctive features found on many chairs  linked to south Yorkshire. Several workshops must have produced large  quantities, to judge by the numbers of such chairs that have survived. \n\nThe carved back-pieces on this chair display a stylised bearded head of tear-drop  form, that has been thought to represent Charles I, and to indicate royalist  sympathies around the time of the Restoration of the monarchy. For this  reason this type of chair has been traditionally dated to about 1660. However,  no such chairs can be firmly dated so early, and their arched back-pieces may  have been influenced by high-backed caned-chairs of the early eighteenth- century.",

He suggests that early specimens may date from a little before 1650,  while later examples were produced up to 1700 and a little later. Wells-Cole  (1971) suggests that large numbers 'exist throughout the West and North  Ridings. They probably all belong  to the second half of the 17th century  although only one dated example (1686) has been traced. The decoration of  the back rails indicates that channelled spiral motifs combined with deep cross  hatching, stamped enrichment and foliate carving was widely popular in the  county. Since this stylised pattern is not repeated on other kinds of furniture its  value as a feature for identifying companion pieces of local origin is limited  although it obviously expresses a vigorous tradition.' (p.10) Knell notes that  anonymous human faces (often bearded) are a recurring theme on everyday  artefacts of the period and it is difficult to find conclusive proof of a specific  person being intended, such as Charles I, in a predominantly Royalist region  such as Yorkshire (p.266).\n\nSee KNELL, David: English Country Furniture, 1500 - 1900.
