His latest work reflects his love of the city, and he has made several prints exploring the contrasting surfaces, patterns and perspectives of buildings within their environment.\n\nThis print depicts urban architecture in all its steel-structured, mirror-walled glory. The medium of digital printing produces vivid colours, which gives it this work a surreal, dream-like feel. The large scale of the print suggests the human experience of the urban cityscape, where looking upward at skyscrapers makes the viewer feel miniaturised. This print is an ode to the steel monoliths that dominate the contemporary skyline. \n\nEverything about this image is underpinned by evidence of technological progress; the medium of digital print, the subject matter of building and development, and the skyscraper itself, a symbol of modernity. The V&A Print Collection also includes another print by Turnbull with a similar theme (Museum no. E.516-2005).",
