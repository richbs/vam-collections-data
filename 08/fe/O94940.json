It also features distinct elements of Islamic design, then known as \"Moorish\" which was considered particularly suitable for smoking rooms and implements, and (unsuprisingly) for Turkish Baths. The pattern was popular for many years. It was first shown by Barbedienne at the 1855 Paris Exhibition, where he won a Grand Medal of Honour, and from where the Museum bought this example for \u00a348. The incense burner is made of metal plated in silver and oxidised. Oxidisation involved darkening the silver. This was done with a sulphide (such as ammonium sulphide), rather than with oxygen, and was thought to be beneficial because sculptural contrasts stood out much more clearly.",
