For Marran 'Rapunzel' suggests a realm which is simultaneously idealised, fantastical, chaotic and quite depressing, in which women are cut off from the wider world through the demands of child- and home- care. The imagery, which suggests a contemporary Japanese aesthetic of the kind found in comic books, toys and video games, combines the abstract with vague evocations of children's toys and domestic objects. The writer Diana Gaston describes Elizabeth Marran's ability to \"reveal the potential of a circle or an oval to become something much more fantastic. She assembles circular forms in a regular pattern, only to disrupt them, seemingly through some kind of mathematical  formula, setting up slight disruptions or fractiousness among otherwise playful shapes.\" The reference to 'blue' in the title may reflect the dominance of the colour in the series which, as Gaston also points out, \"vacillates between despair and transcendence.\"",
