The coif is turned and hemmed at the bottom to form a casing for a narrow linen tape.  There are cheek pieces, but no widow's peak and the whole front edge is bordered with silver bobbin lace with silver spangles.  The embroidery is unfinished at the top and around the edges, with pen and ink lines still visible and some motifs worked only in outline.  The top seam and crown appear to have been sewn up later.",

            "public_access_description": "This coif is embroidered in coloured silks, embellished with precious metal threads and spangles (sequins).  The pattern of scrolling stems bearing flowers and fruits is typical of embroidery design in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  As an unfinished piece, it is particularly interesting, because it shows the process of embroidery.  The pattern was first drawn with ink and a very fine brush, which can still be seen in the unworked areas.  Each motif was embroidered around the edges in stem stitch, before being filled in.  \n\nUntil the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.",
