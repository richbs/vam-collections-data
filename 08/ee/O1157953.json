Following comments that any number of other people could have found their way to the New World and that Columbus's feat was unremarkable because of its simplicity. Columbus replied that it was only easy now that he had demonstrated how it was done.To demonstrate this, he challenged those present to stand an egg on its end. After they all admitted defeat, Columbus demonstrated the simplicity of the challenge by crushing one end of the egg against the table which allowed it to remain upright.\n\nThe British Museum has a number of copies of the subscription ticket, made out to various subscribers.",
