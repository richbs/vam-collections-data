He may have made this frame, and its pair (Museum no. W.2-1960),  which is decorated with birds and flowers.  The frame has a wooden base which is completely covered with sheepskin. The decorative motifs were made separately, some on a wooden core, and then glued down to the base.",

'We engrave two Frames, of very graceful design and refined character, the production of Mr. W.E. Sanders, of Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square. They are specimens of leather carving; the leather - tanned sheepskin- is cut and raised by a penknife and a few small tools. It is difficult by engraving to convey an idea of the elegance of these objects; the designs, as well as the execution, are by Mr Sanders.'\n\nOne of the frames exhibited by Sanders at the London 1862 Exhibition was illustrated by J.B. Waring in <i>Masterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture</i>, 1862, pl. 173.\n\nTools and materials for cutting, modelling and moulding leather were available from shops such as that of James Revell, 272 Oxford Street, London, who also supplied complete kits for leather work. He published a book of instruction, <i>A completed guide to the ornamental leather work</i> in about 1855. He recommended the technique for furniture, including pole screens and music stands, as well as for smaller pieces such as hand screens, card plates and racks, watch stands, vases and brackets, as well as for frames. The leather, modelled when damp, was wound around wire for stems of flowers or leaves. Larger pieces such as flowers, leaves or birds might be made of wood and then covered with leather. Pins and glue were used for securing the leather.",
