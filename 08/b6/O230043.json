This mixed media collage print is representative of his characteristic practice in which he uses found or throwaway materials for sculptural constructions.  This piece, which he titled The Prize is a complex and fragile work of cut and woven paper parts, involving photography, screen-printing, and digital and manual cutting and pasting, constructed like a 3-D jigsaw. The form is based on a chalice he saw in the V&A but transformed into something flimsy and flashy with plastic 'gold' beads, and plastic flowers, intended to allude to the hollowness of trophies and their devalued status in our society. It also alludes, obliquely, to ideas of looting, the forcible taking of 'trophies' which accompanied much of the enterprise of Imperialism and filled Britain's museums with treasures from other cultures. The words 'get well soon' are repeated in the pattern of the print with satiric intent; this sentiment is taken from mass-produced greetings cards, themselves as kitsch as the faux glitz of the baubles adorning the chalice, expresses the hope that the debilitating lust for power and wealth might itself be cured.",
