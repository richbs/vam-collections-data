They were replaced by toys made from paper and cardboard. Many toys made during the war were military themed and instilled a strong sense of patriotism in American children. The American Government reinforced this message by using toy packaging to advertise war bonds. This Young Patriot set carried the message Build for Victory, buy US War Stamps. Children could collect war stamps from boxes which could be saved up and exchanged for a war bond.",
