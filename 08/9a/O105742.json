            "public_access_description": "The brothers Frederick William Alexander de Fabeck (1830-1912) and William Frederick de Fabeck (1834-1906) were both employed in the Indian Medical Service. Frederick William was born on 15 September 1830 and studied in Paris. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, in 1858, the year in which he was appointed Assistant Surgeon in the Bengal Service. He died in Alassio, Italy, on 5 May 1912. William Frederick became Assistant Surgeon in the Madras Service in 1857, Surgeon in 1869, Surgeon Major in 1873, and Brigade Surgeon in 1882. His sketches, mainly of architectural details, were probably made when he was posted to Jaipur as a teacher at the School of Art (1869-7?); he later became Director. He also prepared plans for the 1883 Jaipur Exhibition. He served in the Crimea (1954-5) and was at the siege and capture of Sebastopol. He died in London on 18 January 1906. This painting is by the elder brother, Frederick William, and shows the Pushkar Lake, near Ajmer in Rajasthan, with bathing ghats on the left and mountains in the background.",
