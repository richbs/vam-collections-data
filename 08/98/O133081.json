It is like a two-dimensional drawing of a chair, rendered into three dimensions. The angular, graphic aesthetic, like a wire-frame drawing, was quite new in the early 2000s and in part arose from the use of CAD (computer aided design).  With Chair One the designer Konstantin Grcic introduced a new paradigm into the design vocabulary of contemporary furniture, that of the crystal or fractal, and influenced many other designers.  Chair One was originally intended primarily as public outdoor seating and spawned a whole family of variants including beam seating and outdoor chairs on concrete cone bases.",
