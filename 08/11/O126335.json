This fan is large with a dramatic design to complement the striking silhouettes of late 19th century fashionable dress. The scene painted onto the black silk fan leaf shows two lovers in late 18th century dress by a lake. Romantic scenes of the past were a popular subject on fan leaves. It is painted predominately in shades of white and grey giving an almost moonlit effect that is picked up in  gleam of the mother of pearl on the fan guards.",
