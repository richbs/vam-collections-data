Patterns were carved or pressed into tiles and then filled with coloured liquid clay creating a crisp pattern. After 1850, the inlay technique was adopted again by English potters. Designs were carved into leather hard pots and filled with contrasting clays. \n\nThe potter who created this lidded jar used metal printers' type to impress an inscription onto the body of the jar. The use of type to create patterns was particularly common in the Sussex area. The decorative inscription is crisply visible against the body of the vessel.",
