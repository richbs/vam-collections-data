Won the first prize medal at the RA for painting 1834, and the gold medal of the Society of Arts 1835. Exhibited portraits, historical and biblical subjects: 32 at the RA between 1832 and 1876, 31 at the BI 1833-67, and 26 at the SBA 1832-76. Entered cartoon competitions for the Palace of Westminster decorations in 1843 (winning a \u00a3100 prize), 1844 and 1847. Visited Rome 1837, Australia 1850, where he organised one of the first exhibitions of works of art, and India and Egypt. He received a commission from Queen Victoria for a 'General View of the Harbour and City of Sidney'. Returned to England 1858. Died Maida Vale, London, 28 July 1881. His two daughters were both artists. Florence Claxton's watercolour parody of the PRB, the 'Judgement of Paris', was acquired by the V&A in 1989.\n \nLIT: \t<i>Athenaeum</i> 13 August 1881, p216 (obit).\n\n<b>The Evening Star (Child's head)</b> \n905-1875 NegHF960 \nCanvas, 52.1 x 41.9 cm (20\u00bd x 16\u00bd ins) \nPurchased 1875 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1833. On the back of the relined canvas is written: <i>'Copy of inscription on Original Canvas/\"The Evening Star\"/The first Picture Exhibited by me,/at Somerset House 1833/Marshall Claxton'</i>. In fact he had already exhibited a portrait, 'Rev Marshall Claxton', presumably his father the Methodist minister, at the RA in 1832 (46). The source of Claxton's image derives in the 16th-century work of Correggio, and Maratta in the 17th century, but a more immediate influence was probably Reynold's 'portrait' of Frances Ker Gordon, the 'Angels' Heads' of 1787 (now in the Tate Gallery). Claxton's interest in Reynolds is demonstrated by his imaginary group portrait 'Sir Joshua Reynolds and His Friends' exhibited at the RA in 1843 (315). \n\nThe subject of the 'evening star', that is the planet Venus - the first light in the sky after sunset - was celebrated in Virgil's <i>Georgics</i>, Turner's painting (and draft verses) of about 1830 (see M Butlin and E Joll <i>The Paintings of J M W Turner</i> I, 1977, p255, cat no 453), and William Etty's 1828 RA exhibit 'Venus, the Evening Star'. \n\nEXH: RA 1833 (302)\"",
