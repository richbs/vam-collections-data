Her hair is severely dressed, and is pulled back into a bun surrounded by a yellow frill at the back.  Her black bodice joins straight onto the short sleeves, is cut very low at the front and continues into a point at centre front; down the centre front is a 'gold' strip and the neckline and sleeves are trimmed with black lace.  Her knee-length, bell-shaped palest pink skirt is trimmed above the hem with a deep flounce of black lace. On her feet she wears black ballet slippers with no ribbons.  The print is cut across on the top corners.",

Spain was especially popular and national dances, like the Cachucha and Bolero, were often featured in dance programmes in London in the mid 19th century.  Marie Guy-St\u00e9phan was particularly famous for her Spanish dances; appropriately, she later became prima ballerina in Madrid.  \nHer traditional Spanish dance costume shares the bell-shaped skirt and off-the-shoulder neckline with mid-19th century fashionable dress, but the deep flounce of black lace on the skirt, black bodice with short frilled sleeves and the hair drawn back into a cone tipped with a frill are characteristically Spanish - as are the give-away castanets that she holds in her hands.",

Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched.  The British lithographs are notable for capturing individual performers and their style, often clearly in a theatrical setting.  They enshrine dance and its interpreters at one of its greatest periods.",
