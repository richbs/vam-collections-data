Beyond this is a circle of eight lobed palmettes, each containing a red and white blossom and blue leaves on a red ground.  These lead into eight larger, more elaborate trefoil palmettes, each framing a large speckled flower head in red and white, surrounded by three 6-petalled flowers.  These palmettes on the longitudinal axis are extended in size to enclose additional large blossoms and terminate in a repeat of flower head pattern [a].  Between each of the 8 trefoil palmettes is a lobed lozenge form containing a repeat of flower head [a].  These lozenges extend out in a line of three blossoms in red and white with blue stems and leaves. Each of the four corners of the central panel has an inward pointing boteh with three large blossoms, a repeat of the speckled flower head and of a type [a]. To either side of the boteh is a half-palmette similar in decoration to  the trefoil motif. The rest of the  yellow ground is patterned with a thin-stemmed floral spray.  All main motifs are outlined in blue.\nThis panel is framed with a narrow border with a white ground with separate outward pointing red leaves [in two shades of red].  This leads into a wider band with a white ground with a delicate, densely packed flower heads and boteh leaves forming a meander in blue, black and two shades of red [b].\nThe main border has a black painted ground with a series of four inscriptions in white, some more elongated than others.  Some of the letters are infilled with floral motifs in two shades of red and are extended to create large, fan-like compartments each containing a floral stem, larger along the top and bottom ends of the cover, in blue and red alternately pointing inwards and outwards.  Some have red details on the blue leaves.  This zone is framed by a repeat of border [b] and the outermost band in a chevron design in two shades of red.\nVery poor block registration in places.",
