The <i>Art Journal</i>described him as 'an artist of considerable talent, and might have acquired a good reputation had he studied quality rather than quantity'. According to Redgrave 'He had talent and might have acquired reputation, but he fell into the hands of unscrupulous dealers ... and his art became degraded. ' He died 30 November 1868. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1869, p29; Redgrave Diet \n\n<b>A Garden Scene, in the Manner of Watteau</b> \n354-1886 NegHF134 \nCanvas, 61.6 x 73.7 cm (24 1/4 X 29 ins) \nSigned and dated 'H Andrews [?pxt]/1849' on base of fountain bl \nPurchased 1886 \n\nThis is not certainly identifiable with any of the artist's exhibited works, although he exhibited similar subjects such as 'Garden Scene' (RA 1838) and 'F\u00eate Champ\u00e8tre, Si\u00e8cle de Louis XIV' (BI 1847). Although the inspiration of Watteau is evident both in the subject and the landscaped park setting, Andrews's figure groups are less lively and more decorous; the work is not a copy after Watteau. A companion painting was recorded in a London private collection in 1910; similar works were sold at Sotheby's Belgravia 20 November 1973 (58), Sotheby's 18 February 1987 (265) and Christie's New York 25 February 1988 (311, 312). \n\nPROV: \tEdward Harrison of Shortlands (according to printed label on back); his sale, Christie's 8 May 1886 (93, as 'A F\u00eate Champ\u00e8tre'), bought Parsons \u00a317 17s; bought by the museum 1886 \u00a325\"",
