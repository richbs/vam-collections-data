It is a geographical game and played in a similar way to Happy Families, the idea being to collect as many sets as possible. Each set is made up of a lead card giving the name of a county and two to four other cards of places within that county, each with a relevant fact. \n\nJaques introduced the game in 1866 and it continued to be published well into the 20th century. The original price of each set was 1 s. 6 d. They were made by printing wood engravings on a large sheet of paper. This was then pasted on card and cut.

Each picture card bears the number of the county to which it belongs.\nAny number above three can play.  The cards to be shuffled and dealt round.  The player next to the dealer (or the winner of a previous round) begins the game by asking for a card of any county of which he holds either a town or the county card.  If he gets it, he continues asking for what he wants till he is refused.  Then the privelege of asking devolves upon the player who refused him; he in his turn asks for any card he requires to complete his set, until he is refused, and so the game goes on.\nWhen a player has the County card in his hand he knows how many towns he requires to make up a set.  Every set made up is proclaimed and laid down on the table.\nThe player who has made up most sets is winner when the cards are all played out, and has the privilege of the first question at the next round.\nAny player withholding a card asked for, forfeits a set.  Disputes to be settled by reference to the key.\n\nOR THE GAME MAY BE PLAYED THUS:-\n1.  One player to be chosen as President.\n2.  The president to retain the county cards, and deal the picture cards round.\n3.  Six counters to be given to each player and some put in the pool.\n4.  The president to ask each player in turn for a card of the town belonging to the country which he mentions.\n5.  If a card of another county is offered, the person forfeits one to the pool; but if the right one is offered, he takes one from the pool.\n6.  Any person relating a fact or describing scenery, manufactures, etc. connected with his card, receives an additional counter from the pool.\n7.
