Llama wool, although not used much for clothing today, was fashionable post Second World War following its use as lightweight and warm, military clothing. The wool is coarse and hardwearing making it perfect practical material for outdoor wear. This design, although simple, is very chic and unusually for llama wool the material has been dyed a fashionable duck egg blue colour. A silk label in the lining tell us it was made by Ormdale, one of several garment/knitwear factories in the Redruth area of Cornwall in the late 1940's - 60's",
