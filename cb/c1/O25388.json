Nickel silver or 'German silver' resembles paktong, the Chinese 'white copper' alloy of copper, nickel and zinc, imported into Britain since at least the 17th-century. In Germany a similar metal was used from the 18th-century for gun furniture. Gutike, a Berlin metalworker, demonstrated its properties in England in 1830. Its hardness made it ideal for frequently used items such as cutlery, but made engraving difficult. Experimentation with alloys meant nickel-silver became an imitation silver, sold under names including Argentan and Argentine, and a suitable base metal for electroplate. Nickel silver tarnishes slightly yellow.\nBox that came to Museum in now in SS, 10, 12\n\n(post WW1)",

It was developed in Europe in the 1820s, soon after the successful refining of nickel, which was crucial to the development of  the new alloy. The commercial manufacture of nickel silver probably began in Berlin or Leipzig but quickly spread to England. After about 1830 English nickel alloy pieces are more likely to have been made of the new metal rather than Chinese white copper or Paktong. The new alloys proved to be cheaper, more readily available and more predictable to work with than Paktong.",
