When Nell Gwyn was rebuked by Charles for referring to their six year old son as a bastard, she replied: \"Your majesty has given me no other name by which to call him.\". In consequence, the King gave him the name Beauclerk and created him Baron Heddington and Earl of Burford. Subsequently, on 10 January 1684, he was created Duke of St Albans. He was married on 17 April 1694 to Diana, second daughter and eventually sole heiress of Aubrey, 20th and last Duke of Oxford. He died around 10 May 1726 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe flask is engraved with scrolling foliage in the style of the artist Blaise Gentot and is ingeniously constructed with a removable base serving as a cup and a top which can be inverted and used to unscrew the internal stopper.",

            "history_note": "The arms and monogram engraved on either side of this flask indicate it was made for Charles Beauclerk, Baron Heddington, Earl of Burford and first Duke of St Albans. Beauclerk, born around 8th May 1670, was the eldest of two illegitimate sons of Charles II by his mistress, the actress Nell Gwyn. An eighteenth-century account of English history explains that Beauclerk received his titles because the King once heard Nell Gwyn call to the child, 'Come hither, you little bastard'. Rebuked by the King, she apparently replied: 'Your majesty has given me no other name by which I may call him'. In December 1676, Charles II gave the six-year old child the name of Beauclerk and made him baron Heddington and earl of Burford. On 10 January 1684 he was created duke of St Albans (see Hunt: 2008; <u>The Complete Peerage</u> (2000), vol. 5).\n\nAround 1690, when this flask was made, Beauclerk was soon to take his seat in the House of Lords (1691) and embark on military campaigns in Flanders (1693), fighting for the protestant cause of William of Orange (who had recently siezed the English throne [1688-89] to becomeWilliam II of England). It may be the flask accompanied Beauclerk on campaign, not simply as a practical object but as an accoutrement appropriate to his noble status. Beauclerk, who aged 34 apparently bore a striking resemblance to his namesake Charles II, married Diana, daughter of the last Earl of Oxford in 1694, thereby consolidating his position. He enjoyed the favour of successive monarchs throughout his lifetime and died around 10 May 1726.\n\nHistorical significance: Late-seventeenth-century examples of travelling flasks to hold spirits are rare, and this example is particularly interesting both for its construction and ownership. Apart from its detachable base to form a cup, the outer stopper of the flask, when removed, is designed to unscrew the inner stopper.",

            "production_note": "", 
            "historical_context_note": "At a time when drinking was a highly social activity, and cups could still be shared, this flask, with its detachable lower half for use as a cup, is designed for individual use. It is an elegant and expensive alternative to the larger leather bottles used by the poorer classes to transport ale or wine (Shirley: 2007, p.92; Heywood: 1635, cited in Brown: 1996, pp.64-5). Small flasks to hold distilled spirits were useful travelling accoutrements during a period when water was unsafe to drink and wine, ale and beer spoiled quickly. Spirits were also considered to have medicinal properties and were often flavoured. An eighteenth-century collection of household recipes provides four recipes for flavoured brandy, including 'carraway brandy', described as 'a good cordial' (Smith: 1790, p.264). According the the <u>Oxford English Dictionary</u>, the term 'spirit flask' appears to have been coined in 1829 and it is more likely that Charles Beauclerk would have referred to his flask according to the type of spirit it held. The records of the Wakelin silver workshop for 1758 and 1771 refer to 'brandy flasks' supplied to customers (Clayton: 1985, p.190). \nThe unusually early date of this example, around 1690, may reflect the growing popularity of spirit-drinking in England. During the1690s, the price of spirits (particularly gin) fell below that of the traditional English drink, beer, thanks to financial incentives initiated by the Crown. William of Orange, at war with France and anxious to deprive his rival Louis XIV of revenue, banned imports of French brandy and further encouraged the fledgling English distilling industry by increasing tax on beer (Brown: 1996, p.18; Clayton: 1985, p.190).",
