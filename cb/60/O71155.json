In his left hand he holds a long vertical scroll which presumably originally bore those words of the Apostles' Creed attributed to him. From his right arm hangs his own skin, which includes his hands and his face, the eyes being shown as mere slits. He wears a robe, and a cloak draped from his right shoulder.\n\nThe blade of the flaying knife is broken off. There are traces of red paint in the folds of his cloak and gilding and brownish-red paint in his hair and beard. Dark green paint remains on the ground, with the usual daisy pattern. The back of the panel is marked with eight incisions close together. There are two lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

In his left hand he holds a long verticle scroll which presumably originally bore the words of the Apostles Creed attributed to him. From his right arms hangs his own skin, which includes his hands and face, the eyes being shown as mere slits. He wears a robe and a cloak draped from his right shoulder. \n\nThere are traces of red paint in the folds of his cloak and gilding and brownish red paint in his hair and beard.",
