London: Sotheby Publications, in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1982.\nThe relevant text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>1065</b> \nTwo pattern books, containing patterns (25 and 27, on 168 sheets, including different colourways): each inscribed on the back in ink with title, number and price\n1862-96\n68.5 x 53.3 cm (size of each volume)\nGiven by Morris & Co.\nE.441-608-1919\n\nThese are the original patterns as kept together by William Morris.

FC, no 27.'\n\nNB: Within this book there is a handwritten comment that it would be \u2018unlikely\u2019that these patterns would have been kept together specifically by William Morris.\n\n'FC' refers to; Clark, Fiona. <u>William Morris Wallpapers and Chintzes</u>. New York. 1973.\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.17</b> <i>Pink and Poppy</i> wallpaper \n\n<b>a</b> Original design \nWilliam Morris, April 1880 \nPen, pencil and watercolour, 94.0 x 48.2 cm \nInscribed at top: \u201821\u201d\u2019, \u2018April 1880 \nMachine Wall paper\u2019 \nWilliam Morris Society, Kelmscott House, London (D.6) \n\n<b>b</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Poppy</i> \n(also known as <i>Pink and Popppy</i>), <i>123</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, 1880 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for William Morris & Co. \nBlock-printed in silver paint and lacquer, \n67.8 x 52.2 cm \nV&A (E.521-1919) Given by Morris & Co. \n\nVeining and dotting (printed by pins hammered into the blocks) give movement to wallpaper patterns. Speaking about designing paperhangings in his 1882 lecture \u2018The Lesser Arts of Life\u2019, Morris said \u2018Here is the place, if anywhere, for dots and lines and hatchings: mechanical enrichment is the first necessity in it\u2019. \n\nThere is another version of this design, also held at the William Morris Society. Both are inscribed \u2018April 1880\u2019 and both are marked \u2018Machine Wallpaper\u2019. In the event, however, the published paper was block-printed and the ways that used gold or silver were both expensive (21s. a roll) and rich looking. Ten colourways were issued between 1880 and 1882. A Morris & Co. bill of October 1888 for 1, Holland Park (cat.no.I.17) refers to \u2018providing and hanging Gold Poppy Paper\u2019 (fig.87).'",
