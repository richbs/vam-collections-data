The style is characerised by soft, organic forms - highly stylised but often inspired by plants - in hand-beaten silver, with cabochon stones adding colour and contrast. This necklace is set with moonstone and labradorite in a subtle harmony of grey, but other versions would have been made and one has survived set with coral to very different effect. The design dates from around 1912 and would have been in production for some years. The marks on the reverse indicate that this variant was made a little later, probably around 1915 although possibly as late as the 1920s. The marks also indicate that it was imported into France rather than sold in Denmark.",
