The famous writer Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) wanted Gothic style furniture for his new house at Abbotsford, near Melrose in Scotland. He was an antiquarian (a person who studies and collects things of the past) and wrote historical novels. So although he wanted the furniture to be new, it also had to appeal to his historical imagination. He commissioned the well known cabinetmaker George Bullock to provide it. Bridgens and Atkinson, designers associated with Bullock, provided a series of drawings. The furniture was imitated for the rest of the 19th century. Its solid construction and simple yet sophisticated design set a popular pattern.",
