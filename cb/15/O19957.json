The stickers could also be used to decorate furniture. The design, of characters from nursery rhymes, is very similar to the kinds of printed wallpaper borders and friezes which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. This is an incomplete set (containing only 3 of the original 8 stickers). There is a full set of unused stickers in the Museum of Childhood. The packet illustrates the manufacturer's range of similar decorations for nurseries.",
