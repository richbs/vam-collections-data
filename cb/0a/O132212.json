Taught first by his mother, a painter of flowers on porcelain, then worked as a flower painter at Davenport's. Moved to London 1819, gradually turned to landscape painting. Exhibited 32 works at the RA between 1824 and 1865, 91 at the BI 1829-67, and 106 at the SBA 1828-48 (elected member 1842). Travelled abroad several times, in France, Holland, Switzerland, Portugal, and Italy; specialised later in views of Venice. Also painted extensively in watercolours; elected ARWS 1835, RWS 1857. Made drawings for periodical publications. Died London 12 February 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 26 May 1870. There is an 1828 watercolour portrait of him by W H Hunt also in the V&A collections (451-1887; repr T S R Boase <i>English Art</i> 1800-1870 1959, pl 21b).\n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 19 February 1870, p267 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1870, p104 (obit); H Stokes 'James Holland' <i>Walker's Quarterly</i> XXIII, 1927; R Davies 'James Holland' <i>OWS</i> VII, 1929-30, pp37-54; M Tonkin 'The Life of James Holland of the Old Society' <i>OWS</i> XLII, 1967, pp35-50 \n\n<b>Near Blackheath: Blackwall Reach from Charlton Fields</b> \nFA79 \nCanvas, 49.5 x 80 cm (19\u00bd x 31\u00bd ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nHolland lived at 3 Union Place, Blackheath Road, in south-east London, between 1831 and 1845; he exhibited Blackheath and Greenwich views between 1831 and 1834. The present work is possibly 'A Sketch of Blackwall Reach' exhibited at the SBA in 1834 (43), or 'London from Blackheath' at the BI 1834 (465), of which the size was given in the catalogue as 31 by 44 inches (including the frame, as was usual).\"",
