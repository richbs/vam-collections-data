            "public_access_description": "Charles Voysey was one of the most original and influential architects and designers of all forms of decorative art working at the end of the 19th century. In 1882 he set up his own architecture practice and from the late 1880s started to design repeating patterns for wallpaper, woven and printed textiles and carpets. \n\nVoysey's most interesting designs date from this time and show the influence of William Morris's principles of pattern design and use of plant forms and animals as standard motifs. Voysey's textiles are dominated by flowing patterns incorporating birds, deer, hearts, flowers and trees in silhouette. He sold his work to manufacturers such as G. P. & J. Baker, Thomas Wardle and Alexander Morton, and many of his designs were sold through Liberty in London. Voysey's work was well known in continental Europe, and though popular with French Art Nouveau designers, his influence was felt more dramatically by the founders of the Modern movement.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nAlthough the designer C. F. A. Voysey epitomises the Arts and Crafts movement at its most British, and he was enormously influential abroad, the Museum began to collect objects designed by Voysey only in the second half of the twentieth century. Exhibited at the Museum in 1952, this fabric composition of stylized owls was acquired with a number of other items from the designer's family shortly afterward. Trained as an architect, Voysey was one of the most original, versatile, and commercial of freelance designers. He produced an enormous number of designs for wallpapers, textiles, metalwork, and woodwork, and his repeating patterns were frequently duplicated in a number of different forms. This pattern was used for both wallpaper and woven fabric. Voysey was a shrewd businessman, adapting his work to fashion, and was under contract to the notable Scottish manufacturer Alexander Morton to produce a certain number of patterns each year.\n\nLit.
