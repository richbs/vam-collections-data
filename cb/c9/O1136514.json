It can be played by anyone over the age of five and you don't necessarily have to have read any books in order to play. The game is a cross between a race game and a question and answer game. The questions can be about anything from what pencil someone used to write with to the name of an author's cat. Each question has a clue attached to it to assist players unfamiliar with the world of books. Players have to collect six books and get them home to their own library.\nArt Meets Matter is a design company best known for their mugs and deckchairs featuring the Penguin Books logo and has designed a version of this game based solely on books published by Penguin.",
