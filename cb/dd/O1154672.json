This label was created to promote reggae artists and signings were chosen by Richard Branson and Johnny Rotten. It was designed for a compilation album featuring artists from the label, The Front Line II, released in 1978. The design subverted fly poster campaigns by the British National Party of the time, with the same image and slogan \"Your last chance...\" but with the Union Flag converted to the Rastafarian colours of red, gold and green.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this poster, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
