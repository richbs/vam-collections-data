Terry acted the role opposite Henry Irving (1838-1905),  who played Doricourt, in Irving\u2019s 1881 production.\n\nEllen Terry was born into a theatrical family and many of her sisters and brothers took up acting as a profession as well.  In 1878 she joined the company at the Lyceum Theatre, as the actor-manager Henry Irving\u2019s leading lady.  They jointly attained star-status, working together until 1902.",
