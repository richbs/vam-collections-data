The donor was usually a prominent member of the community, which in country parishes often meant the local landowner. But gifts came from other sources too. Many were given by women, showing their active involvement with the church. Churchwardens also took pride in commissioning new silver and often contributed to the cost. Occasionally, gifts like Lord Hertford's chalice and flagon were made to win support for a political cause. \n\nNot all of these gifts were new. Old-fashioned domestic plate, often richly decorated with secular ornament, was welcomed and used for the service of communion or the collection of alms.\n\nChurch Plate from The Hague\nThis impressively austere service was given to the English Reformed Church in The Hague between 1673 and 1711 by different members of the congregation. It was made by four different local goldsmiths. The provision of stands for the vessels is most unusual. The church closed in 1822, and the plate was later used in the chapel of the British Embassy in The Hague.\n\nThe flagon, one of a pair, was given in 1682 by Mary Thorrowgood, the widow of Robert Rockwood, former Envoy Extraordinary from the Elector Palatine to the United Provinces",
