This collaboration has resulted in modern, innovative design in a medium that the British have tended to view in traditional terms.\n\nBoth Lella and Massimo Vignelli (born 1931) studied architecture. In 1960 they formed a husband and wife partnership. They have worked in graphic design, packaging design, corporate identity programmes, transport, furniture and exhibition design. In the late 1960s they moved from Milan to the United States. They founded Vignelli Associates in New York in 1971. Their work has been widely published and is represented in several major museums, including ones in New York, Montreal and Munich. They have been awarded several prestigious design awards, such as the Industrial Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects (1973) and the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (1983).",
