Though best known as a topographical watercolour artist, whose skill led to her contribution to Pilgrim Trust\u2019s \u2018Recording Britain\u2019 project, Ginger's first ambition was to become an illustrator. Her style often includes distinctive and lively sketches of people and street scenes, and can be seen in book cover for publishers such as Puffin, JM Dent and the magazine Harper's Bazaar, as well as pictorial adverisements. Ginger followed the same circus theme in 1943, when she was commissioned to write and illustrate a children's story by Puffin; \u2018Alexander, the Circus Pony\u2019 was published in 1943 and reprinted many times.",
