Diners still used their fingers for many dishes, but spoons were essential for eating soft, wet foods such as sauces and pottages (soup-like dishes). Only the wealthiest households would own silver spoons; less affluent homes might use spoons made from wood, bone or base metals. Inventories from noble residences record huge quantities of spoons. In a list drawn up in 1306 of plate and jewels owned by the Dukes of Brittany, three of groups of 17, 54 and 58 silver spoons were noted alongside the huge quantities of other dining plate.  The majority of guests provided their own cutlery when eating away from home and many spoons bear marks of ownership.",

            "history_note": "The spoon forms part of the so-called 'Rouen Treasure' hoard, said to have been found in an iron box when pulling down a house in Rouen in 1864. Four silver bowls (106 to 109-1865), three further silver spoons (110 to 112-1865) and a gold \u00e9cu of Philip VI of Valois (ruled 1328-50) from this hoard are also in the V&A. In 1961 Charles Oman suggested that they originally belonged to a larger hoard of silver, whose origin is unknown but was possibly near Gaillon in Normandy. This hoard also included pieces now found in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny (traditionally thought to have been excavated in 1851 at the Ch\u00e2teau of Gaillon, once the country palace of the archbishops of Rouen), in the Basilewsky Collection now in the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg and in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris.\n\nHistorical significance: French domestic silver from the medieval period is extremely rare.",

Diners still used their fingers for many dishes, but spoons were essential for eating soft, wet foods such as sauces and pottages (soup-like dishes). Only the wealthiest households would own silver spoons; less affluent homes might use spoons made from wood, bone or base metals. Inventories from noble residences record huge quantities of spoons. In a list drawn up in 1306 of plate and jewels owned by the dukes of Brittany, three of groups of 17, 54 and 58 silver spoons were noted alongside the huge quantities of other dining plate [see Lightbown, <font -u>Secular Goldsmiths' Work in Medieval France</font>, 1978, p. 34]. The majority of guests provided their own cutlery when eating away from home and many spoons bear marks of ownership.",
