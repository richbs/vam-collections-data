This dress was worn by Pamela Talmey, a former Vogue editor, when she married William David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech, in 1969. The fine white wool dress has a high mandarin collar, puffed sleeves, and an empire waist. The sole trimming is an applied Celtic design in braid on the bodice. At the wedding, the bride wore strips of braid in her hair to match the dress braid.\n\nMany fashionable late 1960s and 1970s brides bought outfits by current designers, rather than from a specialist wedding boutique. This cream wool dress looks appropriately bridal, but was versatile enough to be worn afterwards as an evening dress.",
