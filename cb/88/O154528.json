Each boteh is formed by two floral stems emerging from a root, infilled by a second smaller boteh facing in the opposite direction formed by a toothed border, around a bird sitting on a blossom with a floral spray behind. From the boteh root two floral stems emerge to frame the boteh motif, both merging with those of the next boteh, that at the top has a small spray curving to echo the line of the previous boteh root. The botehs appear to be worked in metal thread with details in pink. Along the upper end is evidence of this being the end of a loom piece: one and a half rows of small lozenges in metal thread and red silk edging a wider band of blue cartouches on a metal ground with an infill of a flattened central lozenge framed by floral elements all in metal thread.\n\nWarp: dark blue silk, Z-twist.\nWeft: light blue, pink silk.\nMetal thread: silver strip open S-wound  on light yellow silk.\nFacing: red bias cut woollen twill. Red and white stripes separated by a narrow edging of white, blue and red. Each stripe contains small floral sprigs in four colourways, two pointing left and two pointing right.\n\n[a] white ground with red flowers, black centre and stem, green leaves; facing left.\n[b] red ground with white flowers, black centre and yellow stem, green leaves; facing left.\n[c] white ground with black flowers, yellow centre and red stem, blue leaves; facing right.\n[d] red ground with blue flowers, black centre and yellow stem, green leaves; facing right.\n\nBacking: unpatterned purple plain weave silk and red plain weave silk; pieced.",
