The popularity of scenes such as episodes from the life of St. Louis (1215-1270) reflect both the enthusiasm of the French from about 1830 for their national past and the romantic taste for medieval subject matter.\n\nThis relief and its companion are characteristic of the small scale decorative sculpture shown at the 1851 Great Exhibition. Such a composition would from the start be intended for replication in considerable numbers; the relief could be reproduced from a mould in different materials, the surface of which would then have a layer of silver deposited on it by the newly developed process of electrolysis.
