Full-length, loose-fitting and without sleeves. The back is formed of two breadths of material, each front made from a single breadth. At the bottom of each side seam is set a triangular gore and there is a smaller gore inset at the hem. The low square neck is faced with maroon floral figured silk through which is threaded a draw tape to tie at the centre back where the seam is open. The facing continues at the front but since the neckline has been cut away, the original shape is in doubt. The armholes, though sweat-stained, are either cut away or were unfinished. An extra piece of material has been joined in on the left to match up the openings.\n\nAt the sides and back are pleat marks. When joined they form the shape of the back pleats of a sack. Inside are two pieces of silk attached at one end only which would have held then in position.",
