It is outlined with a narrow red line and red/brown tree-motifs alternating with green/blue sprigs.\nThere is a border along four sides.  It consists of a line of small red-bordered compartments containing either a blue or brown/green flowerhead and decorated above and below by a line of floral motifs, blue alternating with brown/green.  There is an inner line of similar but incomplete compartments and long, slender lines extend between the two.\nThe field is decorated with five narrow bands of white compartments, each containing a brown/orange motif.  Between each of these bands are four floral sprays; four similar sprays occur along each border.\nThe fringe is formed by warp threads.",
