The part between the two reliefs is a hemispherical socle for the figure with the incised signature and date.

It combines free-standing figures with low reliefs, pierced panels and architectural elements. \nBy the early 20th century the art of ivory-carving was held in low esteem. The Studio magazine in 1906 considered ivory suitable only for 'billiard balls, false teeth and cutlery'. Garbe was instrumental in reviving the use of the material for both decorative objects and independent sculptures. From around 1924 his ivory sculptures were regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy: Primavera being shown there in 1926. These works contributed to the gradual acceptance in establishment circles of direct carving and truth to materials, aims associated with the Modern Movement.\nGarbe taught at the Central School of Art, in London, between 1901 and 1929 and at the Royal College of Art from 1929 to 1946. His versatile style and technique were influential on many younger sculptors.",
