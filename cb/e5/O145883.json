            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nTreasure contains an element of surprise or secrecy. True to this is the cast made by Johanna Dahm, who studied the traditional lost-wax technique in Ghana with an Asante royal goldsmith. The design of her silver pendant is only revealed when the customer breaks the cast with a hammer.\n\nDahm was trained at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung und Kunst in Zurich under Max Fr\u00f6hlich (formerly Kunstgewerbeschule). In 1990 she became professor at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung in Pforzheim, a post she has held until recently.\n\nAs an artist jeweller Johanna Dahm has experimented with a number of media for jewellery. Her early work was made of aluminium with coloured resins as well-designed, affordable jewellery. She moved on to explore the interaction of jewellery with body and space, resulting in amazing sculptural jewellery to installations of light on the body. For years Dahm has been fascinated by African goldwork, especially of the Asante, and in particular the technique of lost-wax casting.",
