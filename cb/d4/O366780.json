From a central band of small motifs enclosed in a strip of diamond lattice, the two halves of the pattern are identical.\n\nThe most striking feature of this pattern is a huge double-headed eagle, mainly in pink, and on each side smaller single-headed birds in front view and in profile, together with female figures, four-footed animals and plant forms, still with pink predominating. In a narrower band below is another large double-headed eagle, but with its head cut off, flanked by large stags, mainly in fawn, with smaller animal and bird forms tucked into any spaces.\n\nAt the ends of the cover are three narrower bands of decoration. The first band consists of alternate plant forms and beasts in profile, mainly fawn in colour. The second band contains a line of dancing peasants, alternate male and female, holding hands, with plants between them, mainly pink in colour. The third band contains birds in profile to the right, mainly pink in colour. In the mainly pink and fawn bands the other colours are dark and pale blue, pale green and white. There is a very little metal thread used in the bodies of the women in the central areas.\n\nThe cover has a short attached fringe of thick strands of red and pale blue wool.",
