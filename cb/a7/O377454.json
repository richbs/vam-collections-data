In Russia in the 16th and 17th centuries both men and women wore them, and some silversmiths worked exclusively as earring makers.  By the 19th century they were only worn by women.  \n\nFrom the early 18th century the design of Russian earrings followed two paths.  The Russian aristocracy increasingly wore earrings of international design, but the rural population kept to the old traditional patterns.  These traditional earrings were made, usually in silver or silver-plate, by local silversmiths, who rarely marked their work.  As a result, it is very difficult to tell the difference between old earrings and traditional earrings in the old style.\n\nThese earrings were described as the kind traditionally worn by Russian peasants when they were acquired by the museum in 1883, but they are not a typical design.   They are more similar to the fashionable earrings worn everywhere in Europe in the 19th century.  They were bought from the Russian Commissioner at the Fisheries Exhibition, London, 1883.",
