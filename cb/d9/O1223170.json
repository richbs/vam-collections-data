He was a massive success, bringing people into the cinema to see his new short cartoons, which were released every two weeks. The owner of the film studio, and copyright of the characters created by his animators, Pat Sullivan, made $100,000 from licensing the Felix character in 1923. His image was made into soft toys, such as this one, and graced objects such as ceramics, toy figures and postcards.\nFelix's popularity began to wane with the coming of sound to cartoons, in the late 1920s. Mickey Mouse's sound films made the silent offerings of Sullivan, and animator Mesmer, seem outdated. He has had several comebacks over the years and remains an icon of popular culture.",
