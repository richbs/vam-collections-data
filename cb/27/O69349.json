ISBN 1851773088.\nWhen this large painting was bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum in 1894, it joined nineteen other oil paintings by Landseer, including sixteen alone from the 1857 John Sheepshanks gift. But Lion was the most impressive acquisition, not least because of its sheer size. The painting was commissioned in 1824 by the dog's owner, W. H. de Merle, for fifty pounds. As a teenager Landseer had established himself as a precocious and prodigious talent, specialising in Scottish domestic subjects and animals, especially dogs. This is Landseer's earliest treatment of the Newfoundland breed, famous for its lifesaving abilities; a variety of the breed was even named after the painter. Landseer is even better known through his engravings of certain others of his Newfoundland paintings, including A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society of 1838 and Saved! of 1856. The subject appealed greatly to nineteenth-century taste, with its combination of animal magnificence and canine heroism. There is a story - unsupported by evidence - that this painting was dispatched in a large case to Paris during the Revolution (either of 1830 or 1848) and narrowly escaped being used as a barricade.\n\nLit.

Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n\n\n<b>Lion - A Newfoundland Dog</b> \n852-1894 \nCanvas, 149.8 X 195.6 cm (59 X 77 ins) \nBequeathed by Mrs Ann de Merle 1894 \n\nAccording to Graves, Landseer painted the present work in 1824 for the dog's owner, W H de Merle, for \u00a350. The artist delayed painting the background until after his visit to Scotland in the autumn of 1824 (see C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections </u>1860, I, p83). Graves also states that the picture was 'sent to Paris in a large case at the time of the breaking out of the Revolution [1830 or 1848?] and narrowly escaped being used for a barricade'. \nThe shaggy coat of the Newfoundland was a texture particularly suited to Landseer's technique of painting, and it is interesting to compare the present work with his two most famous pictures of the same breed - 'A Distinguished Member of the Royal Humane Society' (RA 1838, now Tate Gallery) and 'Saved!' (RA 1856). For a sculptural treatment of a Newfoundland see M D Wyatt's 'Bashaw, the Faithful Friend of Man Trampling Underfoot His most Insidious Enemy' (also in the V&A collections); Landseer had painted the same dog, 'Bashaw, the Property of the Right Honourable Earl of Dudley' (1827, now private collection). Graves lists a study called 'Lion' under the year 1822, in the studio sale at Christie's 8 May 1874 (127, bought Cox \u00a3661 10s). However the sale catalogue titled the work 'A Lion', so - if the catalogue is correct - the work is not related to the present painting. \n\nEXH: <I>The Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</i> RA RA 1874 (251, as 'never before exhibited'). \n\nENGR: Charles G Lewis 1856; A C Alais 1887, as pl 69 of <i>Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</i> (second series) \n\nLIT: Mann IV, p45 (repr photograph of Lewis engr}; Graves no 80; J Manson <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1902, pp53-4 \n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
