The Cantoria (1435-38) provides a point of reference for the present relief, but the advanced illusionistic scheme suggests that it was made after 1443, when Donatello transferred his studio to Padua. While there can be little doubt of Donatello's responsibility for the design, which is recorded in other reliefs in marble, terracotta, stucco and cartapesta, his personal intervention is likely to have been limited to the heads of the Virgin and Child, which are of higher quality than the subsidiary figures."

            "public_access_description": "This Virgin and Child group is made by the workshop of Donatello in Florence in the middle of the 15th century.\n\nThe background of the relief is perforated, and is now stopped with plaster. The perforations may originally have been filled with mosaic tesserae, like those used on the Cantoria (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo Florence) and on the external pulpit of Prato Cathedral. The Cantoria (1435-38) provides a point of reference for the present relief, but the advanced illusionistic scheme suggests that it was made after 1443, when Donatello transferred his studio to Padua. While there can be little doubt of Donatello's responsibility for the design, which is recorded in other reliefs in marble, terracotta, stucco and cartapesta, his personal intervention is likely to have been limited to the heads of the Virgin and Child, which are of higher quality than the subsidiary figures.\n\nDonatello (1386-1466)was an early Renaissance sculptor and artist from Florence, who became well known for his bas-relief  works, which already incorporated perspective illusionism. He was the most imaginative and versatile of the early Renaissance artists, famous for his rendering of human character and for his dramatic narratives.",
