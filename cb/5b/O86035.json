The motif recalled the mihrab niche in a mosque that indicated the position of the Ka\u2019bah shrine in Mecca. It indicated that the deceased had been buried in accordance with Islamic law in alignment with the Ka\u2019bah.\n\nThe inscription in lustre along the profile of the arch is the first surah (chapter) of the Qur\u2019an, called \u2018al-Fatihah\u2019 (\u2018The Opening\u2019). The text in blue below is from the second surah (verse 285). It begins, \u2018The Messenger believes what has been sent down to him from his Lord, as do the faithful. They all believe in God, His angels, His scriptures, and His messengers.\u2019",

            "history_note": "Throughout the nineteenth century works of art from tombs and other religious buildings were removed and traded on the art market in Iran. Lustre tilework was regarded as of exceptional quality and was particularly attractive to dealers and collectors. As a result, a good deal of it has ended up in museums in Iran and abroad. \n\nRobert Murdoch Smith bought this tile for the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) in Tehran in 1888, more than ten years after he had begun such acquisitions. In 1875 he had paid \u00a350 for the three tiles that make up 1821 to B-1876, which was a relatively high price at the time, but for this single tile he paid \u00a375, showing how prices had increased. The vendor was a private collector called Jules Richard, who was employed at the court of Nasir al-Din Shah. Richard had been active as a collector for over 40 years and had displayed many of his acquisitions in his Tehran home. The tombs of descendants of the Prophet, and even sites that descendants of the Prophet were thought to have visited, were refurbished in a grand manner after the Mongol occupation of Iran in the 1250s, but they usually had only local significance in later centuries. Their consequent poverty may explain why the tiles were sold off.",
