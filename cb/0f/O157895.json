De Lamerie (1688-1751) was the son of French Huguenot parents and came to London in the 1690s as a small child, before going on to become the most successful Huguenot smith in the city.\n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the religiously tolerant Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauceboat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
