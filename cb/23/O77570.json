It was the custom for godparents to make gifts of silver mugs or spoons to a child being christened or baptised.\n\nHistorical Context\nThe prototype of this mug was made for the Felix Summerly Art Manufactures by Harry Emanuel from a design by the well known Victorian artist Richard Redgrave.  Henry Cole, the first Director of the V&A, adopted the name of Felix Summerly in 1843 when he began to write and produce children's books, having been dissatisfied with the quality of those available for his own family. The Felix Summerly Art Manufactures were set up to produce well designed everyday objects to allow the public to buy items designed by the best artists and made by the best manufacturers at affordable prices. The design for this mug was mentioned in the first catalogue from 1847 but the object pictured here was made specifically for the Museum in 1865 after the failure of the Art Manufactures.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe decorative theme is clearly relevant to the mug's function as advocated by Henry Cole and other design reformers. However, the embossed ornament contradicts the views later held by Redgrave that ornament should be part of the construction of the object rather than an addition to it. The heavily embossed angels also go against design principles by making it difficult to drink from the mug, thus allowing the decoration to interfere with the function.",
