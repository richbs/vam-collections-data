They fought criminals and alien invaders from their home in the New York sewer system.  Although they fought many different enemies throughout the series, their consistent archenemy was Shredder, a villainous ninja master.\nThey originated in an American comic book published by Mirage Studios in 1984, but became extremely popular after the TV series launched in 1987.  By the early 1990s Ninja Turtles merchandise was everywhere and they became part of pop culture history.  The merchandise was made by Playmates Toys and began production in 1988.  This figure is of Leatherhead, a mutated crocodile that was part of the Foot Clan.",
