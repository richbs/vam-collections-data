The face is rather crudely painted and some areas of the fabric around the eyes and nose have worn away, revealing areas of the cotton case of the padding below.  She has tightly- curled brown wool hair and wears a red woollen fabric hooded cape with a lace-trimmed bonnet beneath the hood.  She wears a mint green floor length dress patterned with magenta dots and a stylised repeating butterfly design.  She has an embroidered pink brushed cotton underskirt and a stained cream apron, edged at the lower hem with lace.",
