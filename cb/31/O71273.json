It would have been used as an under-plate when a soup was served, and for eating the first two courses of a meal. According to a late-18th-century dining manual, 'the first course should consist of soups, boiled poultry, fish and boiled meats, and the second of different kinds of game, high seasoned dishes, tarts, jellies etc.' A servant would have replaced the plate with a clean one of a different design for the dessert.\n\nPeople\nThe plate was made for Robert Crowther, a silk merchant of Stockport, Cheshire. He was a relative of John Crowther, one of the partners in the Bow factory. John Crowther was also a partner in a wholesale pottery business in the City of London and partner in a London glassworks.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Bow factory manufactured a type of porcelain strengthened with ashes from animal bones. The result was a comparatively durable ceramic material, one that would have been suitable for drinking utensils and other utilitarian wares. The factory made large quantities of blue and white porcelain, which was relatively cheap and aimed at the middle-ranges of the market.",
