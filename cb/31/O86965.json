It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe comedy Call It a Day by C.L. Anthony opened at London's Globe Theatre in October 1935 and ran for fifteen months.  The part of Robert Hilton became one of Owen Nares's most famous roles, and by 1937 he had appeared in numerous productions in the West End and on tour. He made his first stage appearance in 1908 and become one of the most popular matin\u00e9e idols of the day.  Other parts with which he was associated included Maxim de Winter in Rebecca and Robert Carson in Robert's Wife in which he played opposite Edith Evans.",
