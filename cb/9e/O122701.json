The original style of this pot was produced as export ware in China during the Ming dynasty. The Persian potter reproduced this standard shape for a short while. According to Crowe, the Persian production of 'Kendis' can be placed safely in the second quarter of the 17th century.",

Iranian potters were almost exclusively preoccupied with making wares in the styles of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain some close copies and some more fanciful. Echoes of earlier traditions remained, in particular in the black-under-turquoise colour scheme that dates back in Iran to the end of the 12th century. Towards the end of the 16th century there was a widening of interest that blossomed in the 17th century to a wide range of styles and techniques in which blue and white plays a dominant but not exclusive role.",
