The fine white cambric front of the shirt is hand-embroidered with a regularly repeating motif of trefoils. It was worn with a cream silk satin waistcoat embroidered with a design of lilies of the valley and forget-me-nots. These flowers were popular for weddings, as forget-me-nots symbolise true love and lily of the valley represents purity of heart and happiness.",
