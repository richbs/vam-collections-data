Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland Advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis illustration in pen and ink employs geometric forms to depict two chicks hatching out of eggs. The chick in the foreground faces to the left while that in the background faces to the right. Ink has been applied to give the outline of the form before Addey has scratched lines and crosshatching to create the form of the chicks and eggs. This geometric style and use of monochrome palette is typical of advertising illustration of the second quarter of the twentieth century.",
