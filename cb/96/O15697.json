Short, cap sleeves are cut in one with the dress, and have small, diamond shaped underarm gussets to allow ease of movement and comfort. Attached to the sleeves are matching cuffs of bias cut fabric.\n\nThe designer opened one of the first couture houses in Ireland and was well known for her use of indigenous Irish textiles such as linens and tweeds, and for her use of subtle, natural colours. Vogue illustrated a similar dress to that shown here in March 1957; \u2018The look is linen \u2013 wonderful Irish linen \u2013 a myriad of tiny, tiny pleats. Yet crumple it into a suitcase and it will emerge, uncrushed, uncrushable, to sweep grandly through a season of gaiety\u2019.",
