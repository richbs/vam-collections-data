The remains of the locket fitted within a ribbon-and-laurel-leaf diamante surround, set in silvered copper; a small loop of copper wire soldered to the back. Engraved on the back: <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> S S Joseph; given to the Museum by his widow, Mrs Emma Joseph, May 1941. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 16; Murdoch 1981 , p. 155, fig. 167. \n\nIn the early lists of the Joseph Collection this miniature appears Simply as 'An Unknown Woman wearing a lace head-dress by Dixon'. Although the inner part of the case seems genuinely seventeenth-century, it cannot have been the original frame for this miniature and ought to have contained at one time something more plausibly of Mary Queen of Scots. \n\nThe damages and possibly cut state of the miniature suggest that it had lost its original setting and was fitted to this locket, possibly in the late nineteenth century when the outer case also was added. Joseph on the whole seems to have had a preservationist approach to old frames, and the gold inner part of this assemblage is roughly right for the miniature: it could have been chosen for it in spite of the inappropriate inscription.\" \n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1941</u>, London: HMSO, 1954.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'DIXON, Nicholas (worked 1667-1708)\n</b>\nMiniature portrait of a lady wearing a lace head-dress.<i>\nSigned with monogram</i> ND.<i>\nOn parchment on card.
