Standing bowls often came in sets of six or more, and were generally used for wine. The shallowness of the bowl would have made drinking quite difficult.\n\nDesign\nElizabethan standing bowls are usually gilt with covers, bands of engraved scrolling leaves and a circular motif in the centre of the bowl. From 1550, this central boss was often a helmeted head, or the head of the Roman god Mars. In this case, the head is that of a bearded warrior in a curiously shaped helmet. \n\nOwnership & Use\nDrinking bowls of this type were found all over Europe. In England they often survive in the collections of churches, converted into patens (or dishes) for the communion bread.\n\nPaintings by the Flemish artists Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) and Jan Breughel II (1601-1678) show these drinking bowls clasped by drinkers or arranged on sideboards. Their shape was copied in glass and Limoges enamels as well as in pewter, which was cheaper. The silver-gilt versions were, of course, used by fairly wealthy people. Their popularity can be seen by the frequent contemporary references, as well as by the fact that they appear in advertisements as prizes for 16th-century lotteries.",
