            "public_access_description": "The Festival of Britain held in 1951 provided new opportunities for textile design and manufacture.  Two very distinct types of pattern emerged at this event: one was inspired by scientific, crystal-structure diagrams drawn to record arrangements of atoms in matter; the other based on abstract forms and organic shape, the so-called 'Contemporary' style. The design for this furnishing fabric, made in limited production by the Old Bleach Linen Company of Randalstown, Northern Ireland, derived from the crystal structure for Orthoclase 8.29. It was submitted by the crystallographer W.H. Taylor. The fabric was shown at the British Industries Fair.\n\nThe Festival Pattern Group was the brainchild of Mark Harland Thomas of the Council of Industrial Design. He built on the idea first put forward in 1946 by crystallographer Dr Helen Megaw that the patterns made available by X-ray crystallography were particularly appropriate for textile design because of their repetitive symmetry and natural beauty. In 1949 he brought together the group of manufacturers who produced textiles, china, carpets, linoleum and wallpaper decorated with these patterns for the Festival. The project combined science and design and was perfect for the theme of the festival, which was to be a platform for British achievement in science, technology and the arts.",
