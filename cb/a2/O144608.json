The Spanish-born couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), regarded by his peers as \u2018the Master\u2019, had moved to Paris from Spain in 1937. By 1952 he had 232 employees there and was producing 356 new designs per year. His clients, admitted to his salon only after a personal introduction, included many cosmopolitan women of different nationalities.   \nBalenciaga was a perfectionist in cutting, sewing and finishing garments, and was renowned for his exacting standards. This suit is a fine example of his tailoring skills, acquired during apprenticeship in San Sebastian. He was meticulous in making sure that the sleeves sat perfectly on the shoulders. Tweed was a favourite fabric because of the optical illusions created in its flecked or textured pattern.",
