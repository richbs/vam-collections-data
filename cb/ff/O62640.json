Courtiers sit atop the fence, under pavilions, to watch. To the right sit a dancer and musician (with drums and gong) - mediums who would have made prayers to the spirits and offerings, before the commencement of proceedings.\n\n2. A temple with lion gates, 4 poles with banners and with a Karaweik on top of each, a well and a bell in the foreground with a lotus pond. Grill doors \"conceal\" a supposed Buddha image. Worshippers sit and bring offerings.\n\n3. A monk within his own pavilion, with adjacent well and sacred tank in the background in gardens. Sitting cross legged in/on a rocky outcrop is an ascetic.\n\n4. Market scene: women sell cloth (acheik-luntaya), fish, fruit. Men and women sit. A couple, each with an umbrella, walk in the foreground. Further to the left are three Shans, with tattooed legs, one carrying two panniers.\n\n5. The palace at Mandalay. The palace is shown inside substantial brick walls with two main entrances. Outside the walls are small structures for the guardian spirits of the city. In an inner courtyard are soldiers with cannon and guns. Behind a white wall are the King, Queen, attendant ladies and two male supplicants: a watchtower with spiral structure dominating the palace was constructed in the reign of Thibaw Min (r.1858-78). It is surmounted with white umbrellas - the symbols of royalty.\n\n6. A barge in which a girl stands and sings and war canoes on the Irrawady River. The Sagaing River behind.",
