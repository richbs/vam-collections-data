Sent three works to the Society of Arts and won a gold medal for a study of a boy's head. Practised as a portrait painter from 1812. Moved to London 1814, and in 1817 married William Hookham Carpenter (1792-1866) bookseller, publisher, artist, and from 1845 Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. She seems to have had some connection with Sir Thomas Lawrence; she finished one of his portraits after his death in 1830 ('Mrs Brandling', exhibited SBA 1832, 164), and at least one of her portraits has been attributed to him ('Major-General John Fremantle', exhibited 'The Portrait Surveyed', Agnew's 1980, 17). She exhibited 147 portraits at the RA between 1818 and 1866 (nine as Miss Geddes 1814-17),50 works at the BI 1819-53 (11 as Miss Geddes 1814-17) - mostly 'fancy' pictures, and 19 at the SBA 1831-6. Several of her works were engraved. Died London 13 November 1872. Her sister married William Collins RA, and two of her children, William and Henrietta Carpenter, were also painters. There may also be a family connection with Andrew Geddes ARA. Three of her portraits are in the NPG; two watercolours are in the V&A collections. Clayton believed her 'one of the most distinguished portrait painters in England', and her husband's obituarist wrote that she 'would certainly have been a Royal Academician but for her sex' (<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> September 1866, p410). \n\nLIT: \t<i>Art Journal</i> 1873, p6 (obit); E C Clayton <i>English Female Artists</i> 2 vols, 1876, I, pp386-8; <i>List of Pictures and Drawings by Margaret Carpenter from the year 1812 to 1864 with the prices paid for them</i>, MS transcript made 1899 for NPG (referred to below as <i>List</i>); C Yeldham <i>Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France and England</i> 1984, I, pp254-7; P Gerrish Nunn <i>Victorian Women Artists</i> 1987, p36 etc.\n\n<b>Ockham Church, Surrey</b> \nFA19 Neg HF3974 \nPanel, 25.4 x 20.3 cm (10 x 8 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nThis sketch showing the 13th-century tower of Ockham Church among trees is somewhat reminiscent of Constable's work, a few of which were owned by the artist's husband.
