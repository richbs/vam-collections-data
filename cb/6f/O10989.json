Painted miniatures were common in England and royal personages sometimes gave them to favoured courtiers. Producing silver medallions such as these was a contemporary Dutch practice that was adopted in England. This plaque is approximately the same size as the portraits of Anne of Denmark and the Infanta Maria and may have been made as part of a set.\n\nPeople\nCharles (1600-1649) was the son of James I (ruled 1603-1625) and Anne of Denmark (1574-1619). He was crowned in 1625 but his reign was turbulent.  He was tried after the Civil War of 1642-1646 and executed in 1649. In this medallion however, he is shown whilst still Prince of Wales.\n\nSimon de Passe (possibly born in 1595, died 1647) was born in Cologne and worked as an engraver in Utrecht in The Netherlands. He spent some time in Copenhagen working for Anne of Denmark's brother Christian IV, King of Denmark-Norway (ruled 1588-1648). In England he received orders from James I to produce a series of portrait medallions in silver, perhaps as gifts for favoured courtiers.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThere is some discussion as to how these medals were made. The fact that a number of copies exist has led some scholars to suggest that they were cast from a mould. Close examination shows, however, that there are small differences between them. One possibility is that they were partly cast and then engraved. It is impossible to determine exactly how they were made without analysing the structure of the metal, which would risk damaging them.",
