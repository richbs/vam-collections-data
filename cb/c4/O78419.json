They were designed to fit round the heel of a boot and were held by a strap and buckle which passed over the foot. The revolving spiked wheel that pressed into the flanks of a horse was known as a rowel. It  was first developed in the late Middle Ages.\n\nManufacture\nThe manufacture of spurs was a specialist craft, the makers being known as 'spurriers'. This example, which has been carefully cut and shaped, is typical of the best English work of around 1600-1625.  Its mouldings would have been cut with a saw and files.\n\nPlace\nA spur of this high quality would have been made in one of the major spur-making centres, such as Ripon, North Yorkshire,  which was  famous for its spurs, especially in the 17th century.  A spur is included in the town coat of arms.",
