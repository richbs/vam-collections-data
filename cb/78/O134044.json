Articled to a legal attorney; taught himself painting. Exhibited seven works at the RA between 1836 and 1855, 28 at the BI 1828-63, and 194 at the SBA 1833-70 (elected Member 1842, and later Vice-President). Subjects principally landscapes, mainly river and lake scenes; his style was much influenced by J M W Turner. Travelled in Switzerland and Italy 1846, and Germany and Italy 1851. Published 'Windsor, With Its Surrounding Scenery' nd [1838-40], 'The English Lake District' (Manchester 1853), and 'The Lake Scenery of England' (1859). There are also several drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. Died 29 July 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 25 February 1871. \n\nLIT: MS <u>Picture Memoranda</u> 1840-1868 National Art Library collection, V&A; <u>Art Journal</u> 1856, pp205-8; 1870, p276 (obit); <u>Athenaeum</u> 13 August 1870, pp217-8 (obit); \n\n\n<b>Venice </b>\n1022-1886 Neg 57765 \nCanvas, 67 X 92.7 cm (26 3/8 X 36\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'JBPYNE 1860 No 547' bl \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nThe number inscribed on the work refers to the artist's manuscript <u>Memorand</u>a; the artist also notes that the work was painted in August 1860, commissioned by the dealers Agnew and Sons for \u00a380, and is described as painted on 'drawing-paper-ground in Brilliant White' and 'commenced in full colour without preparation'. \nThe view is from the direction of the Fondamenta Nuove towards the island of Murano, on the left, and, on the right, the cemetery island of San Michele, prominently showing the church described by Paolo Delfin in the 16th century as 'something great and singular' and 'a temple which not only evokes antiquity but actually surpassed it'. The work is reminiscent of similar views of the Venetian lagoon by J M W Turner. There are engravings after Clarkson Stanfield by R Wall is also in the V&A collections (E627-1935, E5243-1910) which depict the island of Murano from different views. \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
