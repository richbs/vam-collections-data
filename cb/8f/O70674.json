The front blocks are chamfered across the right-angle, to meet a reciprocal chamfer at the top of the leg; on an 18th-century chair one would expect the chamfer to be bled away beneath the seat rails, so that the leg was of full section at the joints.\nThe front and side seat rails are pegged to the front legs and back stiles with single small round pegs; on an 18th-century chair one would expect the pegs to be less evenly shaped, usually larger, and usually double on rails of this depth.\nThe C-scroll brackets underneath the seat are screwed to the rails and legs; these look very rusted in and likely to be original. [See if one can be extracted to assess date of manufacture.]\nThe top face of the stretchers is barely convex, almost flat\nThe back rail is made with a separate shoe glued on top, but both are in mahogany, so there is no obvious point to this -- unless the maker was unable to obtain large enough blocks of mahogany.\nThe mahogany also seems to be of rather poor quality; on one chair [?Circ.4-1919] a large piece has sheared off the back of one leg.",
