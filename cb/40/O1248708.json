Positioned at either side of the drinker's mouth, these help to prevent excessive spilling of the content while drinking from it.\nThis vessel was made in four different parts, joined together by the glassmaker with molten glass 'glue-bits'. The parts are: the foot with hollow lower stem; the solid glass branch above it, with two flowers; the two joined animal flasks; and the drinking bowl. Each of these parts has a separate pontil mark.",

When the glass is picked up and tilted towards the user, the mouths of the two animals pour the liquids into the shallow bowl at the top. The user needs to drink from the bowl very quickly to keep up with the flow of the liquids and spilling is almost inevitable. However, if the drinker knows how to operate the glass, he can regulate the flow by covering and gently un-covering the two spouts on the backs of the animals. The vacuum created will ensure that the liquids flows much slower. \nIt is likely that the two flasks were filled with red wine and water, as red wine was rarely drunk without diluting it.",

When the glass is picked up and tilted towards the user, the mouths of the two animals pour the liquids into the shallow bowl at the top. The user needs to drink from the bowl very quickly to keep up with the flow of the liquids and spilling is almost inevitable. However, if the drinker knows how to operate the glass, he can regulate the flow by covering and gently un-covering the two spouts on the backs of the animals. The vacuum created will ensure that the liquids flows much slower. \nIt is likely that the two flasks were filled with red wine and water, as red wine was rarely drunk without diluting it.",
