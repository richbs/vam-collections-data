This garment has been cut from a rectangle of a single narrow width of fabric, with the minimum amount of cutting and stitching.  The only area where any fabric was discarded was in the cutting out of the neck; because of the use of selvage edges, the only stitching is the continuous seam under the sleeves and across the chest, the attaching of the cuffs (probably made of recycled fabric), and the binding of the neck with tape.  The garment could easily be cut in bigger sizes as the child grew, or even extended by the use of inserted bands of fabric.",
