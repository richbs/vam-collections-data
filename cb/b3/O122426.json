            "history_note": "Historical significance: Geometric compostions and flowers with the occasional birds in flight tend to decorate most of the large Safavid ceramic dishes. Such painted motifs are one aspect of a balanced composition based on patterns incised or molded. The original Persian contribution to the Chinese style consists of the combination of various geometric patterns, some more successful than others, with incised contours emphasised in blue. Incised repeats include segmented waves, dotted or plain overlapping scales, bracketed pairs of leaves and gadrooned lines. A plain coloured glaze in shades of blue or celadon usually covers the outside of the dish, and this treatment may indicate a connection with plain-glazed vessels, both Chinese and Persian, of the same period. This dish is one of a series of large dishes that is possibly the most sophisticated group of Persian ceramics of Safavid times.",

Iranian potters were almost exclusively preoccupied with making wares in the styles of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain some close copies and some more fanciful. Echoes of earlier traditions remained, in particular in the black-under-turquoise colour scheme that dates back in Iran to the end of the 12th century. Towards the end of the 16th century there was a widening of interest that blossomed in the 17th century to a wide range of styles and techniques in which blue and white plays a dominant but not exclusive role.",
