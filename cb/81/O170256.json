The bowl was made, then covered with a white slip, decoration was incised through this slip and it was fired in a kiln. This is known as the biscuit firing. It was at this stage that the bowl was damaged and then discarded.\n\nImages of hares or rabbits on a grassy field are common in Italian Renaissance ceramics. This bowl was given to the Victoria & Albert Museum by its founder, Maria Fiorini. The large number of kiln wasters discovered at Legnago suggests the presence of several ceramic workshops in the area in the 15th and 16th centuries. \n\nThe dotted background on this fragment was executed with a rouletted wheel. The main image was incised first and then the background was dotted. The decorator of this object accidentally scored over part of the hare's back with his wheel.",
