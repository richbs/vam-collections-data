He published 'David Bailey's box of pin-ups' in 1965 as a loose portfolio of 36 portraits of the mainly-male fashionable elite that, as the cover description states, 'belong to Bailey's own world of fashion, pop music and the Ad Lib [nightclub]'. Each portrait is accompanied by notes by Francis Wyndham. \nSurprisingly, only four of the pin-ups are women, all of whom are models; as the notes explain, 'in the age of Mick Jagger, it is the boys who are the pin-ups'. Cecil Beaton was one of the most influential British portrait photographers of the 20th century. He was one of the first to raise the profile of the portrait photographer in the public eye and  was almost as much photographed himself as he photographed others. Indeed, his social mobility was such that during the 1960s he was as likely to be found photographing the Rolling Stones as the Royal family.\nThe portraits constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture of the Sixties, and many of them have become the definitive images of key figures of cultural life in London during the Swinging Sixties.",
