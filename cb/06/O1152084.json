This letterpress printed notice details the events that were held 75 years later in Stratford upon Avon on  23 April 1846, to commemorate Shakespeare's Birthday. It advertises the 22nd meeting of The Royal Shakespearean Club at 10am in Shakespeare's Hall, details the music and the performers in the concert that followed at 12 o'clock in the Collegiate Church of Stratford upon Avon, and the dinner for members and Friends of the Royal Shakespearean Club at 5pm in Shakespeare's Hall. It notes the ticket prices and arrangements for concert and the dinner tickets, giving the names of the Stewards of the Dinner including Edward Flower, the wealthy local brewer who was a driving force behind the Shakespeare celebrations in the town, and who went on to become mayor of Stratford in 1866 and 1867. It was through his son Charles Edward Fordham's efforts that the first Stratford Memorial Theatre was built in 1864 to celebrate the 300th anniversay of Shakespeare's birth.\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Club was formed as the Shakespeare Club in 1824 by about a dozen local townsmen. By 1830 the club had as many as 400 members, including the established actors William Macready and Charles Matthews.  The club invited King George IV to attend their 1830 Gala Festival in Stratford, an invitation he initially accepted although later declined due to an 'indisposition'. Nevertheless the King became the patron of the organisation in 1830, after which the name of the club was elevated to The Royal Shakespearean Club.",
