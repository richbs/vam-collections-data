Robinson was Curator of Sculpture at the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) and acquired many important works for the collection in the 1850s and 1860s. On the reverse of the actual medal the artist has used as inspiration the hands from the carved figures in the Annunciation by Arnolfo di Cambio of about 1300. Robinson bought this work for the Museum in 1861 (see inv.no.7563-1861). During the design process the artist explores and reworks various ideas. This is a model from which Powell made trial versions in plaster before the design was finalised. It replicates the handwriting of John Charles Robinson taken from his letter, dated 6 September 1886, Madrid to the Museum, 'Now Is the Time'. For further entries relating to the processes involved in the making of the medal, see inv. nos. A.5-2002, A.7 to A.9-2002, and A.10 to A.11-2004.",
