She typically includes in her work objects found in museums and antique shops. \n\nThis illustration is characteristic of Emily Sutton's style and technique with the street scenes all imaginatively condensed into a single artistic space. The interest in everyday life and close observation of London's city life was typical of the 20th century British artist Eric Ravilious. It is possible that his series of 24 exquisite lithographs of pre-war shops reproduced in 1938 children's book <i>The Story of High Street</i>, one of the most highly-prized of its time, served as an inspiration for this drawing by E. Sutton.",
