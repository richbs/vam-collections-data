Cheaply made, in pressed glass, such elaborate sets became widely available. This vase would have been used to serve cut celery stalks. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of press-moulding glass with the aid of a hand-operated machine was first perfected in the United States of America in the early 1820s. It took only two people to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. By simply depressing a lever, a metal plunger was lowered into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Europe and Britain, giving rise to stylistic changes and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid- to late 19th century the first period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved quality while cutting costs even further.\n\nDesign\nThe pattern is made in imitation of expensively cut lead glass.  Pressed glass never rivalled the prismatic brilliance and precision of real cutting, but it provided a cheap substitute, affordable to all but the poorest.\n\nPeople\nThis celery vase was made by 'George Davidson & Co., Teams Glass Works' at Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. Founded in 1867, they soon became one of the most famous and prolific manufacturers of pressed glass in Britain.",
