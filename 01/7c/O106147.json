The fine quality of the box and its fittings is a mark of the status that Randall reached as a performer, but  it was the only personal possession of Harry Randall's that was preserved by his family. \n\nRandall's first professional appearance was in 1884 at Deacon's Music Hall in Islington. Like his good friend Dan Leno, Randall became known for his comedy character songs and his pantomime dames, several of which he performed in pantomimes with Leno. His songs were full of topical jokes and satire, and his characters frequently broke off from singing to launch into a stream of comic patter. He wrote several songs in the form of 'advice' to the audience, such as the one he wrote about the dangers of drinking.  Harry Randall was in the first Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre in 1912, and he became so well known that his name was used in the rhyming slang for 'candles' which became known as 'Harry Randalls', or simply 'Harrys!'",

She had everything belonging to Harry Randall, his make-up box, his scrap book, his chair and his sheet music.\n\nAfter my Great Aunt Nancy died everything of Harry's was thrown out, except his make-up box which my father's sister kept.  At this time it still had his original make in on the jars but when my father's sister died and I became the new owner of the box, all the make-up had been washed out by my aunt, unfortunately.\"",
