This type of glaze was called chuiqing or 'blown blue' in China, and known as bleu souffl\u00e9 or fouett\u00e9 in Europe. The name derives from the particular technique required to apply the glaze on the surface: the powdered cobalt was blown through a bamboo cane that had a fine gauze at one of the extremities.\n\nObjects with powder-blue glaze were produced since the late 17th century, and by the early 18th century fine gilded decorations of flowers, landscapes and symbolic motifs were added on the surface. They were particularly favoured in the Middle East but also widely exported in Europe, where they were used as tableware in the residences of aristocrats and wealthy people, or exhibited on the walls and in the niches of the so-called 'porcelain rooms'.",
