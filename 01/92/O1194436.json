They lived in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The children wrote poems which were put into books and presented to their father as Christmas and Easter presents. The daughters lived into their nineties, but Pakenham died in 1944.\n\nThe poems in this book are credited to Oona, Packenham, Kathleen and Leslie McCorkell. The poems included in the book are entitled 'The Glorious Twelfth', 'Early Summer Sunset', 'Just a June Night', 'On Love', 'The Blossoms', 'Days End', 'Limericks', 'Tis But a Term', 'To Rhyl and Other Such Towns', 'All That is Beautiful Dies', and 'Just Things that I Love'.",
