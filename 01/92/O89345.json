Medicinal and indeed magical qualities were thought to be inherent in the substance from earliest times. Jet is found in different parts of Europe (as well as North America), but the two richest regions are the Asturias in northern Spain, and Whitby, Yorkshire, in North East England.\nThis may have served as a decorative pendant, more closely allied to jewellery than the other jets of the V&A collection.",
