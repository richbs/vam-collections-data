The baluster stem is similarly decorated and supports an encrusted vase-shaped nozzle and decorated drip-pan. The stem has a threaded screw fixed to the base by a square nut. The socket is friction-fitted to the stem.\n\nXRF Analysis carried out by the Museum in August 2010 focussed on the centre of the base and two worn areas on the stem. The base was golden in colour, while on parts of the stem the golden colour had disappeared and a silvery surface was visible instead. Copper and zinc proved to be the main elements, suggesting a bulk made of brass. Gold and silver were also seen, but their relative quantity in the spectra does not relate to the visual appearance of the spots analysed, i.e. to the more silvery spots does NOT correspond a higher percentage of silver and a lower one of gold. The naked eye examination of the object suggests that the brass candlestick was first silvered and then gilt.\n\nAnalysis of the gilding did not reveal any mercury suggesting the candlestick may have been electo-gilt later in its life.",

It may have been intended as a model for export given the full address given in the inscription '7 & 23 King Street, Soho, London'. It was probably intended for use in producing moulds for silver candlesticks and possibly for export to North America. This model candlestick may originally have been silvered and later gilded for marketing purposes.\n\nHistorical significance: This is an interesting example of the use of copyright under the terms of  the 1798 Act brought forward by the sculptor George Garrard (1760-1826). This was the first occasion on which British copyright law provided protection for a medium other than print. The legislation conferred exclusive rights lasting 14 years on persons who created new models or casts of human or animal figures. The Act paved the way for the emergence of the modern image of copyright as concerned with the promotion of 'art and literature'.\nAn artist could claim copyright provided he had his name put on the object with the date of publication before offering it for sale. The inscription with its clear geographical location 'Soho, London' provides a clear distinction from Matthew Boulton's manufactory at Soho, Birmingham.",

            "historical_context_note": "Thomas Dudley is listed in the London directories from 1813 to 1816 as Dudley and Son, Furnishing Ironmongers, 34 King Street, Soho. In Underhill's Biennial Directory, 1816, he appears as a bell hanger and metal ornament manufacturer in the category 'Iron, Brass, Copper and Metal Trades, Class 3'. By 1822 Robson's Commercial Directory lists him under 'Bronze and Ormolu Works'. at 36 King Street, Soho.  In that year Pigot & Co's Directory lists Dudley under 'Bronzists'. By 1827 he is also listed as at 5 William Street, Regent's Park and Duck Lane, Soho as a patent horse-shoe and forge maker. He is still listed in 1828-9 as a bronzist and ormolu manufacturere at 36 King Street, Soho.\n\nThomas Dudley features in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey on 12th January 1822 as a witness to the theft of a coat, gloves and handkerchief in King Street, Soho. He advertized in The Morning Post 9 May 1821 'illustrations of Mr. Goodwin's System of Shoeing Horses' as a Bronze Manufacturer, at 36 King Street, Soho and claimed the patronage of 'His Royal Highness Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg, the Nobility, Gentry and many of the most eminent Architects and Builders for his newly invented system of Bell-hanging' describing himself as a 'Bronze Metal Ornament Manufacturer' at the same address.",
