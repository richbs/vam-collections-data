This smart (for a dame) costume is in the style of a sailor suit in the British colours of red, white and blue; under the crisp white pleated skirt are worn traditional dame bloomers, in a stylish red with white spots. The outfit is crowned with the blonde curly wig, fixed to the smart sailor cap.  Worn by someone as expert as Billy Dainty, it could get a laugh on its own. However, the real joke is delayed; Sarah the Cook is caught in the storm at sea and the destruction wrought upon this smart outfit (see S.288-1989) creates another, bigger, laugh.\n\nBilly Dainty was one of the last dames to have his own costumes - today most costumes are provided by the production management.",
