The curfew, from the French couvre-feu (fire cover) enabled the embers to be kept smouldering at night so that the fire could be re-lit easily the following morning with a puff of the bellows. Some curfews had ventiliation holes to allow small amounts of air to enter so that the fire was not completely starved of oxygen. This example is typical of those produced in the Netherlands and England during the second half of the 17th century. \n\nCurfews were usually made in sheet brass or copper. This example is a fine quality example that would have furnished a wealthy middle class home. It is decorated in repouss\u00e9, a type of embossed decoration on metal, which is hammered from the back to create a design in relief. This fireguard has a mixture of embossed and engraved decoration to create areas of high contrast and reflection. The decoration features three male heads within wreaths and floral scrollwork. The curfew is expressive of a long tradition of embossed brasswork in the Netherlands and similar decotation can also be found on brass buffet dishes and warming pan lids. Surviving curfews are rare.",

            "history_note": "A <i>curfew</i> is a metal cover designed to enclose the embers of a fire at the end of the day. To have a fire burning all night was both extravagant and dangerous. The curfew, from the French <i>couvre-feu (fire cover) </i>enabled the embers to be kept smouldering at night so that the fire could be re-lit easily the following morning with a puff of the bellows. Some curfews had ventiliation holes to allow small amounts of air to enter so that the fire was not completely starved of oxygen.\n\nThe fireplaces was the focal point of the room. It was not only the primary source of heat but also of light after the sun had set. Fireplace furniture, including firedogs, curfews, and firetools, was often produced in brass to take advantage of its highly reflective qualities.\n\nCurfews were usually made in sheet brass or copper. This example is a fine quality example that would have furnished a wealthy middle class home. It is decorated in repouss\u00e9, a type of embossed decoration on metal, which is hammered from the back to create a design in relief. This fireguard has a mixture of embossed and engraved decoration to create areas of high contrast and reflection. The decoration features three male heads within wreaths and floral scrollwork. The curfew is expressive of a long tradition of embossed brasswork in the Netherlands and similar decotation can also be found on brass buffet dishes and warming pan lids. Surviving curfews are rare.\n\nContemporary depictions of curfews at or near the fireplace are extremely rare, suggesting they may have been kept out of the room when not in use. One example of a Dutch interior showing the family of a wealthy burgher in a bedchamber shows the curfew in the fireplace with a linen cloth draped over it for insulation, from which it may be inferred that the painting shows an early morning scene before the fire had been raked and re-stoked.  (Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva: see Peter Thornton, &lt;u&gt;Authentic Decor: The Domestic Interior 1620-1920&lt;/u&gt;, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, 1984, p. 27, cat. 16). The bright curfew draws the viewer's eye into the painting and its presence emphasises the vulnerability of the expensive carpets and hangings decorating the bed, mantelpiece and table.\n\nThe Museum bought the curfew from the Hailstone Collection in 1891 for \u00a316.",
