Certainly \ntheir flattened simplified images and  \nreinforced outlines are suggestive of the two- \ndimensional effect of an object viewed by a  \nsingle eye. This drawing, with its cut corners, \nmay have been part of the Windsor group and \nshares their qualities, but its handling, notably \nin the drapery, is uneven, and it was not \nincluded by Paul Ganz in his catalogue \nraisonn\u00e9 of Holbein\u2019s drawings.  The pink \nground, characteristic of Holbein\u2019s Windsor \ndrawings, not only assists in the rendering of \nflesh tones but also allows the use of metal- \npoint. \n(K. T.
