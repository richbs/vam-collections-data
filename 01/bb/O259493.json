The fragments join to make a full width of material at the point where the bottom of one repeat joins the top of another. At the top of this panel are the hulls of three launches with the dead and dying falling into the sea. The combatants include Captain Curtis whose legs can just be seen in the launch to the right. To the left is a rocky ground with three mounted horsemen. In the sea to the right is a winged female figure symbolising Fame who sinks into the waves holding a medal with the profiles of Prince Nassau and the Duc de Crillon, and bearing a banner with an inscription on her trumpet. In the centre two sea nymphs, one reclining on a sea monster, support a medallion with a bust of Captain Curtis. Below comes the upper register of the print, with the top of the Rock of Gibraltar, cannon balls bursting on it, and red hot shot being fired from its batteries. Two birds of prey hover in the air to the right. To the left flies Fame, blowing a trumpet and holding a medallion with the bust of General Elliot, surmounted by the crest of a snake biting its tail. Two putti fly nearby, one with a torch, and one holding a streamer. Of the tiny fragments stuck on the net in place of the missing right hand corner, two repeat the banner of Fame, with the date 1782.",
