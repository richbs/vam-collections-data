Ewer-shaped vases were sold as part of three- and five-piece sets of vases at auctions of Derby porcelain held in 1779 and 1782. At least one pair was made to accompany a large snake-handled vase. Sets of three, five, seven or even nine vases were known as 'suites of vases' in the 18th and early 19th centuries. They were commonly set out on mantelpieces, with the largest one in the middle, much as today.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) manufactured similar ewer-shaped vases during the 1770s, and Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) made pairs of similar vases in ormolu-mounted blue-john at his Birmingham factory around 1772. All may derive from a Greek pottery prototype.\n\nTrading\nThe Derby factory aimed at the top end of the market and sold much of its output from factory showrooms in Covent Garden, London. The factory also held auctions in London and had agents elsewhere, notably Bath. One London auction held in 1782 included a set of three vases accompanied by two ewers similar to this one. The ewers were described as '1 pair ewer shape vases enamel'd with figures'. The set of five realized \u00a315 15s.  At that time Derby modellers earned around \u00a32 11s. per week.",
