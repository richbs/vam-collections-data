            "history_note": "Historical significance: The <I>Via Crucis</I> consists of title page, dedication, and 14 plates showing the Stations of the Cross. These are based on a series of paintings by Domenico Tiepolo in the Oratorio del Crucifies (Oratory of the Crucifix) in the Church of S. Polo, Venice. The artist completed the painting in 1747. Plate IX from the series of prints is dated 1748. The title page bears the date 1749, implying that the project was finished in this year. The canvases of the Stations of the Cross are amongst the earliest works by Domenico Tiepolo. They are close in style and composition to paintings by his father, the celebrated artist Giambattista Tiepolo, with whom he had trained and continued to work throughout his life. The fact that prints were made  soon after completion of the canvases, demonstrates the potential it was felt they had for reproduction. The fourteen scenes of the stations of the cross are presented following the Venetian tradition for this subject. Such prints would have been a popular series of devotional images. They were produced in six states. The series in the V&A collection (inventory numbers: E.1287-1907 to E.1301-1907) are second states of the series,  recognised by the inscription <I>In Venezia</I> written at the bottom of the title page.\n\nThis is the sixth station of the cross, in which Christ meets St. Veronica. According to Christian legend, St. Veronica wiped the face of Christ with a sudarium as he was bearing the cross on the way to Calvary. Miraculously the image of the Lord's face appeared on the sudarium following her act of kindness. In this print St Veronica is placed in the right foreground of the composition. Her back towards us, she turns, kneeling, to Christ. In her arms is the sudarium, with which she will wipe Christ's brow. The grouping of figures and variety of costume shows the young artist looking to the works of his father, Giambattista Tiepolo. For example, the figure of St. Veronica wears a wide skirted dress which echoes that of women in the work of the sixteenth century artist Paolo Veronese. There is also an interest in different costumes, such as the soldier leading Christ, who appears in a combination of Roman and sixteenth century dress, and also the figures in the background who wear oriental robes and turbans. This is very much in the style of Domenico's father.",
