The back of the plaque shows that it was carved from a Late Antique diptych leaf: the raised borders typical of such pieces remain at the left and at the top, but the right side has been reduced from its original width.\nThe present plaque clearly belongs to three others of the same format and style and all four must have come from the same object. Two of the plaques - one with a bust of Christ, the other with a bust of an angel - are in the Museo Nazional in Ravenna. The fourth carries the symbol of Saint Luke (the bull). The London and Ravenna plaques have been in Ravenna by the 13th or 14th century, when the reverses were inscribed. It is not known when the diptych was dismembered to make the surviving plaques. \nThe plaque can be dated aroud 800 and was made by a group of artists with close links to Charlemagne' court at Aachen. It shows an awareness of space and three-dimensional form closer to the antique than other Court School works.",

The back of the plaque shows that it was carved from a Late Antique diptych leaf: the raised borders typical of such pieces remain at the left and at the top, but the right side has been reduced from its original width.\nThe present plaque clearly belongs to three others of the same format and style and all four must have come from the same object. Two of the plaques - one with a bust of Christ, the other with a bust of an angel - are in the Museo Nazional in Ravenna. The fourth carries the symbol of Saint Luke (the bull). The London and Ravenna plaques have been in Ravenna by the 13th or 14th century, when the reverses were inscribed. It is not known when the diptych was dismembered to make the surviving plaques.",
