They were made especially for export to the West, where Japanese lacquer had been admired since the end of the 16th century. The coloured mother-of-pearl design of birds and foliage is typical of early 19th-century lacquer objects made for foreign customers.\n\nTime\nDuring the late 17th century Dutch merchants were the only Europeans allowed to trade in Japan. Rising prices meant that no Japanese  lacquer was officially exported after 1693. As a substitute, merchants turned to cheaper and inferior products made in China. However, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Dutch merchants were able to use their privileged position to place private orders for objects like this box.\n\nPlaces\nJapanese export wares were shipped abroad from Deshima, a small island in Nagasaki harbour. By the late 18th century a new type of export work, called 'Nagasaki lacquer', had developed there. It is characterised by extremely thin and strikingly coloured pieces of pearl shell inlaid into black lacquer. The main parts of the design were also often underpainted.",
