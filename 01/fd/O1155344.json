            "public_access_description": "'L'Attaque' is a role-playing game of military tactics, the object of the game being to capture the enemy's flag. Playing pieces represent individual officers and soldiers within an army. This game is exactly the same as Stratego, which was a later adaptation. 'L'Attaque' was the first game of a series of strategy board games released by H.P.Gibson & Sons in the 1930's. The other games in the series were 'Tri-Tactics', 'Dover Patrol' and 'Aviation'.\n\nThis game was previously owned by Bob Dixon, along with similar types of games. Robert Turnbull Dixon was a poet, author and peace activist. He grew up in County Durham and was very interested in assessing what affects and influences young people as they grow up. He acquired a collection of games when researching for his book, Playing Them False, published in 1977.",
