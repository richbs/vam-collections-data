Gomme & Sons, High Wycombe</b>\nPencil, watercolour and bodycolour\nV&amp;A: E.334-1978\n\nThis is an earlier version of the 'G-Plan' furniture range seen in the sitting room suite in plate 18. The restrained, lightweight forms and emphasis on storage were particularly suited to small rooms such as bed-sits, where space was at a minimum. This bed-sit is well balanced, both in arrangement and the use of colours - the tones of the furnishings are subtle, but with contemporary patterns - and the whole effect is discreetly modern. 'G-Plan' furniture, which was first brought onto the market in 1953, was a conscious reaction against the exaggerated forms and embellishments of traditional period styles which were being produced at this time. Influenced by the slender forms of Scandinavian design, it was the first major commercial attempt in Britain to mass-produce well-designed furniture that was modern in concept. It provided a new approach to home furnishing, with interchangeable pieces of matching furniture making it possible (pocket allowing) to build up a unified interior, as also seen in the living room furniture suite shown earlier in the book. During the 1950s, one-room living for single people, usually professionals (many who had recently left the forces), was on the increase. It catered for a post-war group which was increasingly mobile, as well as single people who didn't wish to be committed to home ownership.\"\n",
