She has specialised in colour mezzotints and her work has been exhibited internationally in many biennales and triennales. An example of her work was used by print curator and historian Pat Gilmour in her book \u2018Understanding Contemporary Prints\u2019 to illustrate the mezzotint process. \n\nThis is one of four examples by Wight in the V&A collection; each is a colour mezzotint and each takes the form of a view of a landscape through a window, but her real subject is light and the way it changes with the seasons, the time of day, and the framing of the view (by curtains, blind, window frames etc).",
