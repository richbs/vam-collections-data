Cut across the top. There is a border along the bottom: downward facing large pink blossom alternating with a spray of 3 white flowers.  There is a narrow border of four sides extending part way up the sides of the panel - this has tiny white and yellow or pink and yellow flowers with a pair of green leaves, all outward facing.  Originally edged with thick black lines, much of which has corroded.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and dark green.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with angled striped stem with downward pointing composite blossom, yellow centre, blue and pink flowers and green edges alternating with straight striped stem with pink flowerhead bending to the lower right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] green ground with a diamond shape design and a more rectangular shape design.  The first contains a downward pointing straight striped stem with circular pink blossom with pointed green outline and small white blossoms filling the diamond segment alternating with a more squashed group of three pink carnations and 2 small blue striped leaves.\n[b] Green ground with 2 designs: yellow vase outlined in black with 2 leaves outlined in light blue, a pink flower and 3 groups of white and light blue flowers alternating with yellow vase outlined in light blue with an elaborate arrangement of flowers including a section of straight striped stem in the middle.\nThere is evidence of an applied woven braid [and fringe?] along the right hand side and along the bottom.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; dark green, green, light green, white, light blue, dark blue, yellow, red, pink, dark mauve, light mauve, orange, black.",
