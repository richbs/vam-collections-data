            "physical_description": "Embroidered altar frontal of linen canvas embroidered with wool, linen and silk in long-armed cross stitch. The stitches are worked both horizontally and vertically to suit the pattern. \n\nThe frontal is made up of five vertically-joined strips of linen only two of which are the full selvedge width of 18.5 inches (47 cms). The five panels were worked separately and then joined.\n\nThe frontal is lined with a single piece of coarse heavy linen with three tabs of linen down each side. The remains of tapes are used to fix the frontal to its frame. These tabs were concealed when the lining was let out due to shrinking during washing.\n\nThe central panel has a roughly three-inch wide (7.5 cms) border all round containing an angular 'coiling' stem of stylised leaves enclosing Tudor roses. The centre is divided by a lattice-work of small linked squares to form a central vertical line of three and half compartments containing, from top to bottom, The Lamb of God; IHS within a heart; IHS and MERCI (?) in Gothic letters; IHS above a small heart pierced with three nails. The compartments on either side contain, from top to bottom, a Lombardic cross surmounted by a flower and the date 1586; the monogram IHS with a tablet inscribed INRI; a repeat of the same motif; and a cross composed of three linked triangles.\n\nThe panels to either side of the central panel have borders on three sides only. The centres are divided by a smaller-scale lattice work than on the central panel to form three vertical rows, each of six compartments. The central rows contain, from top to bottom, a crowned M; IHS within a heart; pierced heart; the host and chalice; a heart; and a heart. The two outer rows on each panel contain, from top to bottom, the host and chalice; the initials SF (on the left hand panel) and IN (on the right hand panel); the Lamb of God; the initials R (?) K or H? (on left) and RI (on right); the Lamb of God; the date 1587 (on the left) and 1588 (on the right).  Within the half compartments down the sides of the panels are not very clearly defined emblems of the Passion and the remains of inscriptions.\n\nThe two outer panels have borders on the three sides only and have three vertical rows of compartments which look larger than those on the middle panels because they are less heavily outlined. Those in the central row contain IHS; in the two outer rows IHS alternates with the Lamb of God. The half compartments down the sides contain crowned Gothic Ms.\n\nThe borders are mainly grounded in red alternating with yellow or orange, and white roses alternate with red or orange roses. In some places the wrong colours seem to have been used.\n\nThe central panel is predominantly beige with red and green compartments. The motifs are mainly in white and dark brown.\n\nThe panels to either side are predominantly beige with yellow and beige compartments outlined in white, green and brown.\n\nThe outer panels are green, orange and red.",
