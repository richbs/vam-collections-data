The needle lace is of a type often considered English, but there is no English association with the provenance of this piece, which is likely to have come from a continental ecclesiastical source, since it is from the Bock collection.\n\nHistorical significance: The design of this linen damask relates closely to fashionable woven silks from the second half of the sixteenth century, for example 906-1899 in the museum's collection, a red silk damask. Before the seventeenth century, there was not a distinction in pattern between dress and furnishing silks (although  scale might dictate this, if a pattern repeat was exceptionally long) and this pomegranate pattern would have been suitable for a variety of purposes, including men's and women's dress, and table linen. \nAlthough linen damask from the sixteenth century is frequently recorded in inventories, its survival is relatively rare, largely because of  its suitablilty for re-use over long periods, until it was worn out, and the need, by its nature, to launder it frequently.",
