The interlacing encloses animals and flowers and there is a pair of birds in the centre.  There are quarter medallions in the corners of the field which have a dark blue ground and contain three angels, two of which hold animals or birds. The red field is decorated with animals in combat; these include chilins, tigers, wolves, cheetahs and gazelles.  There are also human faces within the larger blossoms.",
