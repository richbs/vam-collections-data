It is called a \u2018b\u00f4zukappa\u2019, from the Japanese word for priest (b\u00f4zu) and the transliteration of the Portuguese for cape (kappa). Their use was initially restricted to members of the military (samurai) class, but by the 18th century other sections of society were wearing them for travel along the expanding network of roads that linked Japan\u2019s towns and cities. The cape is reversible and is patterned on one side using the kasuri technique, whereby yarns are selectively dyed prior to weaving, and on the other with fabric striped in blue, black and orange. The design on the patterned side is the face of Okame, the goddess of mirth, which was no doubt chosen to cheer the traveller on his journey.",
