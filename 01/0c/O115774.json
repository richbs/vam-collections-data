A herald\u2019s original function was a courtly one, making royal proclamations and bearing ceremonial messages between monarchs. By the 18th century, they were also responsible for organising state ceremonies and processions such as weddings and funerals. The Herald also regulated and granted the use of coats-of-arms and other heraldic imagery.\n\nThis tabard belonged to John Anstis the Elder, who was Garter King of Arms from 1719\u201344. The front, back and arms bear the royal arms in use between 1714 and 1801, representing England, Scotland, France, Ireland and Brunswick. The tabard was probably worn by Anstis\u2019 son, John the Younger, also Garter King of Arms who held the office jointly with his father between 1727 and 1744 and until 1754.",
