Simplicity is a characteristic which allows for the pattern to be followed in another medium. The pattern had to be worked out in pencil, pen and ink on paper first, where mistakes could easily be corrected before the design was worked in the less adaptable craft of embroidery.  The pattern could then be copied by the embroiderer onto the material that was to be embroidered.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe drawing is on tracing paper because the pattern had to be flexible enough to be stitched into position.  There are numerous pinholes in the tracing paper.  The pinholes are concentrated around the circumference of the circular border, with a few in the pattern itself.  The pinholes are evidence that the pattern was used.  They are likely to be pinholes made by a needle. The pattern was probably stitched, using tacking stitches, to the under-surface of a thin, transparent material, such as muslin.  The stitches would hold the tracing paper in position while keeping it flexible.  The pattern could then be traced by painting it onto the surface of the material ready to be embroidered.  \n\nSocial Class\nIt was a sign of social status that a middle- or upper-class woman should be seen to have nothing to do.  It was acceptable for such women to use patterns in preparation for embroidery.",
