            "public_access_description": "This mug was probably made in Iznik, in north-west Anatolia. By the 1530s, small sprays of tulips and other recognisable flowers were a common motif on Iznik ceramics. From the 1550s these were replaced by compositions on a larger scale, such as this design.",
