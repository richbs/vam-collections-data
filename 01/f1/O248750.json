He was a cousin of Sir Gilbert Heathcote, 4th Bart., of Normanton Hall, whose wife Katherine Sophia Manners was later a patroness of Constable. She was connected with the Dysart family, with which Constable had relations from an early stage of his career. It is therefore possible that he was staying at Hursley House as the guest of Sir William Heathcote when he made this drawing, but nothing else is recorded of the visit.\n\nLot 33 in the sale of the property of Eustace Constable held at Messrs. Christie's, 16 April 1896 (described in the catalogue as \"Thursley\" [sic], Hants, 1804\") was evidently made on the same visit and Lot 198 in the sale at Messrs. Christie's, 17 June 1982, of the property of Miss Isabel Constable (also described as \" Thursley, Hants\") may also have been made then.'\n\nG Reynolds",
