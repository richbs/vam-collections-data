Palmer 1825</i>  \n \nLit: Lister 52  \n \nLondon, Victoria and Albert Museum, \n1303-1925 \n \nThis study comes from a time when \nPalmer was working hard to develop his \nskills as a figurative artist in order to \nproduce biblical paintings, such as the \n<i>Holy Family</i> (see cat. 28). The flatness \nof the form and the regularity of the \nhatching suggest that it may have been  \ntaken from an engraving. Copying \nengravings was standard practice for \nstudents of the period, as well as an \nactivity much recommended by Blake.\u2019\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.
