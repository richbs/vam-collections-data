Very fine work.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The Museum Number is on the front in the top left hand corner. There is a border along the top: red ground with a 5-petalled flower alternating in blues and beige with green leaves. There is a deeper border along the bottom with a group of small flowers alternating with a large blossom - all on straight stems facing to the lower right.  The blossom alternates in pink and yellow.  The group of flowers are all white and yellow.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and yellow.  These also surround the lower border and extend part way up the sides and are above and below the upper border.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: green ground with an iris with 2 blue petals on a curved striped stem pointing to the lower left or the upper right alternating with a rosette edged with blue and outlined with yellow pointing up or down.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] green ground with diamond segments: small vase with as central flower with a blue trefoil edged along its top with small pale buds; blue striped stem with a line of 2 blue flowers.  Small, intricate flowers form the edges of the diamonds.\n[b] 4 designs: angled stem with downward pointing diamond shaped flower with small white and yellow flowers along its upper edges; pink vase outlined in dark blue with spray of small flowers pointing to the right; similar design pointing down; angled stem pointing right with a large blossom and 3 small blue flowers with pointed leaves.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, dark blue, light blue, dark green, green, yellow, light yellow, beige, light pink, light green, white.",
