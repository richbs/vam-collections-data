It may represent the members of a lay confraternity dedicated to the Holy Ghost. The flowered border is similar to that on a famous roundel of the Virgin and Child, known as the Foulc Madonna, by Andrea della Robbia (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, N\u00eemes), and also to that on the roundel of The Adoration of the Shepherds (Mus.No 7752-1862).\n\nThe Della Robbia family was an Italian family of sculptors and potters. They were active in Florence from the early 15th century and elsewhere in Italy and France well into the 16th. \nLuca della Robbia founded the family sculpture workshop in Florence and was regarded by contemporaries as a leading artistic innovator, comparable to Donatello and Masaccio. He is credited with the invention of the tin-glazed terracotta sculpture for which the family became well known. \n\nHis nephew Andrea della Robbia, who inherited the workshop, tended to use more complex compositions and polychrome glazing rather than the simple blue-and-white schemes favoured by his uncle.\nTrained as a marble sculptor in the studio of his uncle Luca, Andrea della Robbia also became an excellent modeller, unrivalled in his ability to capture the life of his subjects in glazed clay.",
