It has been suggested that the drawing is for a shield, with the central reserve intended for a spike or boss, although there are no shields known to resemble this design. An alternative suggestion was that this was a design for maiolica (ceramic). However, the figures in the design are placed all round the border and are not focused in one area, to allow appreciation from a fixed viewpoint, as is usual with maiolica designs. \n\nThe drawing represents four figures of 'Victory' with vanquished prisoners, their legs bound, in between. Two of the 'Victory' figures hold a victor's wreath, and one holds an olive branch which is symbolic of peace.  Trophies of victory are also shown; captured armour and the crowns of defeated powers.",
