            "public_access_description": "This is John Liston (1776-1846), one of the leading comic actors of his day, as the busybody Paul Pry. Several different figurines of Liston as Pry were produced, based on contemporary engravings, after his huge success in John Poole's play Paul Pry at London's Haymarket Theatre where it opened on 13 September 1825. The play was enormously popular throughout the 19th century; Paul Pry's catch-phrases 'I hope I don't intrude', 'Just dropped in' and 'It's nothing me to' were quoted everywhere, and the name Paul Pry became a well-known term for a busybody. The character regularly carried an umbrella, but this is missing from this figurine although evident in another example of the piece, S.947-1996.\n\nListon achieved his greatest successes in farce, particularly as Paul Pry, but was also well known for several other r\u00f4les which were also seen in drawings, painting, engravings and figurines. An expert dancer, Liston became the higest-paid comedian on the stage, earning  between sixty and a hundred pounds a week at the Olympic Theatre, a huge salary for his day. He retired in 1837 after a career that spanned over thirty years.",
