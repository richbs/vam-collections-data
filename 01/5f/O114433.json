The bodice has a V-neck opening on the front, with a wide collar made of 4 layers of frilled black organza. The sleeves are long and tight.\nThe wide skirt is flounced at the waist. The waist is decorated with a wide sash. Two rows of  flounces decorate the hem of the skirt, echoing the ruched collar of the bodice.\n\nHubert de Givenchy was born in France in 1926. After working for Jacques Fath and Elsa Schiaparelli, he opened his own business in 1952 and went on producing elegant clothes and high-style ball gowns and evening dresses.\nThe 1970s saw the replacement of the rigid, triangular shape of the mini, by the long, svelte lines of the midi and maxi dresses. Society became increasingly multicultural and designers turned to non-Western clothing or traditional dress for inspiration. \nThis stunning evening ensemble shows a sophisticated version of the gypsy dress from which Givenchy retained only the lines and discarded the typical embroideries and excessive use of colours.",
