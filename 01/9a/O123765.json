The firm was founded in 1780 and specialised in architectural plasterwork.  Jacksons had large workshops in Hammersmith, London, which closed in 1989 when the firm became part of Clark and Fenn Ltd. This panel may have been used for making a mould for plaster casting.\n\nThe plant is possibly Tutsan, or Hypericum androstaemum, a member of the St. John's Wort family, which is found in woods and shady banks in the west of England.    The name, Tutsan, is an Anglicisation of the Norman name Toute Sainte, or 'All Heal', and the plant was used for healing.  When the leaves are dried they have an attractive scent and were commonly used as bookmarks, particularly in bibles. The alternative name in Devon and Somerset was 'Bible leaves'",
