The Green Man is found in very many cultures around the world and is often an embodiment of local gods associated with plant-life. Primarily it is interpreted as a symbol of rebirth, representing the cycle of growth being reborn anew each spring.  Much pagan symbolism was absorbed into Christian tradition, and the Green Man is frequently found as a decorative motif in church architecture in Britain. In the later 19th century, during the Gothic Revival and the Arts and Crafts movement, the motif enjoyed a revival in both religious and secular buildings. \n\nOn the reverse is stamped J.E. KNOX 1910.  Knox was presumably the carver, but we know nothing more about him, nor about the history of this Green Man.",
