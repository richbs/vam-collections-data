He later entered the workshop of the genre and decorative painter Claude Gillot (1673-1722), who had been Watteau\u2019s master (1684-1721). He specialised in the genre of the f\u00eates galantes inaugurated by Watteau and decorative works for which enjoyed a considerable success. \n\nThis painting is a typical pastoral scene which developed under the influence of Antoine Watteau in the first half of the 18th century. It depicts a couple of lovers resting by a fountain, a common theme in the gallant genre. The pastel palette, disposition of the trees and overall landscape are reminiscent of Lancret\u2019s compositions but are not as refined as the master\u2019s. The figures however, despite a broad resemblance to Lancret\u2019s characters, appear rather clumsy.",

London, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p.119, cat. no. 133\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nFrench School, mid-18th century \n\n133 \nLADY SEATED BY A FOUNTAIN, ATTENDED BY A GALLANT \nCanvas \n26 \u00bc  x 33 \u00bd  (66.7 x 85) \n508-1870 \n\nAcquired as by Francois de Troy (1645-173\u00b0) (1893 Catalogue, p. 187), this picture has a rustic quality which suggests, rather, a provincial French or possibly German origin. The subject seems to be an anecdote or episode from a romance, and the whole is reminiscent of French book-illustration of the period (cf. O. Holloway, <i>French rococo book-illustration</i>, 1969, figs. 68 ff., 121-22), though the compositions of the illustrators - for example, of C. N. Cochin - are more taut than that of 508-1870. \n\nProv. John Parsons; bequeathed to the Museum in 1870.",

Parsons, 1870.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting was acquired as by the Baroque Fran\u00e7ois de Troy (1645-1730) but bears in fact many similarities with the oeuvre of Nicolas Lancret. It depicts a pastoral scene, typical of the first half of the 18th century, with two lovers set in an idyllic landscape. The rest by a fountain was a popular subject among artists of the first half of the 18th century. \nThis work is similar to such compositions as <i>The Sleeping Sheperdess</i>, c. 1730, National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, and <i>Le Ma\u00eetre galant</i>, a print made after N. Lancret by Jacques Philippe Le Bas in 1748 (The British Museum, London -1876,0708.2452). The print presents a similar fountain with a grotesque mask from which flows the water and a classical statue which recalls the terminal stone figure in the present composition. \nThe pastel palette, broad-leaved trees silhouetted against a pale blue sky while the background hills are vanishing in blue hues are characteristic of Lancret's style although the design does not do justice to Lancret's skilful draughtsmanship and may therefore have been executed by one of his close followers.",

            "historical_context_note": "Pastoral is a genre of painting whose subject is the idealized life of shepherds and shepherdesses set in an ideally beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century, Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had become an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.",
