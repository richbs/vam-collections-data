Each player must have a Pyramid and four counters of the same colour.\nII. Spin for first player; the highest number to begin the game, when he or she is required to read to the Company `The Caution'  on page V of this book, before the game is opened.\nIII.  Let the first player spin, and place his or her pyramid on the Game, according to the number turned up.  The others, in turn, are to do the same; referring to the Explanation for a Description of the Plates.\nIV.  At each following spin, add the number turned up to that on which the Pyramid stands; and proceed accordingly, till some one arrive at No. 20, who wins the Game.\nV,  Whoever goes beyond No. 20, must go back as many as he exceeds it; and try again when his turn comes.\nVI. When directed to stop one or more turns, the player is to place so many counters on his number, and take one up each time, instead of spinning, till all be redeemed.\nVII.  When the spinner reads an article which has a note, he or she must refer to the page of Notes for an explanation and read the same aloud.\n\nTHE CAUTION OR FRIENDLY HINT\n\nBefore in this Game we proceed,\nPermit me a few words to say;\nI will not five minutes exceed,\nor detain you, good folk, from your play.\nI trust all around me are friends,\nAnd will take what I say in good part;\nShould a word of my CAUTION offend,\nIt would grieve me indeed to the heart.\nBut I wish to put all on their guard\nAgainst certain tricks I have seen;\nAnd think not my censure too hard,\nWhen I call them both cunning and mean.\nI observe even those whom I love,\nIf they like not the number they spin,\nWill the counter, or tee-totum move,\nIn hope by such cheating to win.\nBut even in trifles like these,\nSuch conduct should never take place;\nMean actions get on by degrees,\nTill they end in our total disgrace.\nBesides, though we call this a Game,\nWe cannot but quickly discern\nIt's only a sport as to name-\nIn the Play, there is something to learn:\nImprovement with Mirth is design'd;\nAnd the least we can do for such care,\nWhile the moral sinks deep in the mind,\nIs to play its rules open and fair,\nThe gambler all hate and despise;\nFor he plays but to cheat and to gain:\nBut we, to be better and wise;\nAnd neither to cause or feel pain.\nWell, now I have finish'd my Task;\nAnd should any be tempted to wrong,\nI have only one favour to ask,\nThat-they pause, and reflect on my song.\n\nThe stages of the game are:\n1.  Penitentiary\n2.  Trial by Jury\n3.  Domiciliary Visit to the Indigent\n4.  Students at the Royal Academy\n5.  Exhibition at the Royal Academy\n6.  An Infirmary\n7.  An Alms House\n8.  A Lecture in Chemistry\n9.  A Blue-Coat Boy\n10.  A National School\n11.  Cinfirmation\n12.  A Bazaar\n13.  Greenwich Pensioners\n14.  Female Benevolent Society\n15.  School for the Blind\n16.  Chelsea Pensioners\n1.7.  Matrimony\n18.  Harvest Home\n19.  A Bible Society\n20.
