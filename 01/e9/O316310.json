Made of loosely woven light wool printed 'en disposition' with a deep border of cone patterns on a black ground. The hood is lined with plain black silk and has two tucks at the peak of the hood, which is weighted front and back with tassels of black silk.\n\nThe hood is printed with a narrow border of small cones fitted sideways and with a wide border of flower-bearing fronds which penetrate the black ground of the hood. The shoulders are left black, and a band of similar fronds to those on the hood separate the black area from a narrow one of bright red. Below this, on an almost hidden maroon ground, is printed a deep pattern of cones, fairly squat, but with elongated curving ends and with fronds and stems penetrating their structure. A very narrow single flower meander border runs down both sides, and a border with a cusped inner edge and divided into panels of different colours, curves round the bottom edge of the cloak. The colours are red, pink, blue, green, orange, yellow and maroon, and all shaded with short black diagonal stripes.",
