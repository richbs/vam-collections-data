The lip was sometimes formed  as a mask, as in this example,  or the jug could have a plain cylindrical neck. \n\nPlace\nThe jugs were first made at the Worcester porcelain factory, and then at Lowestoft (Suffolk), Caughley and several of the Liverpool factories. The design was also copied in Chinese porcelain for export to the West.\n\nMarketing\nThe Caughley factory was one of the few British porcelain factories to have a significant local market. The factory had a warehouse nearby in Bridgenorth, where 'country' dealers could buy wares. London dealers, however, had to obtain their stock from the factory's manager, Thomas Turner. The painted monogram on this piece would have been specially commissioned, possibly through the Bridgenorth shop or from the factory itself. \n\nOther large porcelain factories, such as Worcester, sold much of their output through wholesale china dealers in London. A Worcester wholesale price list of about 1755-1756 describes these jugs as 'Dutch Jugs', and gives their wholesale price as three shillings and six pence, or eight shillings, apparently per dozen, according to their size.",
