Pooh also featured in verse in Milne's books When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927). All four of these books were illustrated by E H Shepard (1879-1976).\n\nThe hyphens in the character's name were dropped when Walt Disney adapted the Pooh stories into a series of animated short films that became one of the company's most successful franchises worldwide.
