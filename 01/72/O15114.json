Copied works by George Morland, and studied watercolour painting with John Varley. Entered RA Schools 1805. Associated with William Henry Hunt, William Mulready, Dr Thomas Monro, and later William Blake. In a long and prolific career, he exhibited 176 works at the RA between 1807 and 1881, 91 at the BI 1808-59, and 52 watercolours at the OWS (Member 1812, Treasurer 1817). Subjects mainly portraits up to the late 1840s, then landscapes. Worked also in engraving, etching and mezzotint. Surprisingly, he submitted his name unsuccessfully for election to ARA 1821, and withdrew 1842; the RA later offered him membership, which he refused. Died Redhill, Surrey, 20 January 1882; a memorial exhibition was held at the RA 1882-3. Three of his sons (James Thomas, William, and John junior) were also artists, and his daughter married Samuel Palmer. \nLIT: \tRedgrave Cent; Art]oumal1882, p262 (obit); A T Story Life ofJohn Linnell 2  vols, 1892 \n\nThe Harvest Moon \n554-1882  Neg 22217 \nCanvas, 66 \u00d7 99 cm (26 \u00d7 39 ins) \nSigned and dated 'J Linnell f 1855' br of centre\nJones Bequest 1882 \nLinnell's journal records work on this picture in 1852 and 1853; in September 1853 he was retouching it for the dealer William Wethered, who collected it on 6 October. He sold it to the collector Louis Huth, who had the figures retouched in November and the picture varnished 17 December. It seems that Linnell worked on the painting on at least one further occasion, and this presumably accounts for the date of 1855 that it bears. \nStory lists the work as 'Painted for Mr. Weathered. Sold by Rought [also a dealer] to Mr. Louis Huth for 400 guineas [\u00a3420]'. Huth presumably sold the work directly to John J ones. \nThere is a small (37.8 \u00d7 46.1 cm/14 7/8 \u00d7 18 1/8 ins) version on panel dated 1858 in the Tate Gallery; a letter from Huth to Linnell 27 May 1856 indicates he might like to have 'the repetition of the subject on the smaller size as mentioned by you with one or two alterations which constitute my only objection to the bigger one'. The Tate version differs principally in the poses of the foreground figure and his dog and the nearest figure working in the field above the dog is omitted. A note in Linnell's journal for 30 September 1856 records that 'Mr. Colls [a dealer] came to see Harvest Moon'; this could be either the present work or the Tate version. \nMary-Anne Stevens, in the 1972 Paris exhibition catalogue, commented on the importance of the quality of light and the work of the gleaners which recall Samuel Palmer's Shoreham period. \nEXH: La Peinture Romantique Anglaise \u2026 Petit Palais, Paris, 1972 (165) \nLIT: \tStory II, p273 \nREPR: Victorian Paintings V&A small picture book 10, 1963, pl 27 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
