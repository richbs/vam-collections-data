The design of this mass-produced printed cover, with its compartments of flowers, is similar to French carpets in the nineteenth century.\n\nPrinted wool table covers were popular with the middle classes from the 1840s, when several London manufacturers registered designs. Technically, the printing of the table cover is impressive, being block-printed with sixteen bright colours. It is possible that some of these are from aniline dyes, which were invented in the 1850s.\n\nDaguerrotypes of the 1840s and 1850s often show family groups seated around a table with a printed table cover in a studio, showing their function as decorative objects with a degree of status. In the home, while protecting the surface of the family dining table, they also disguised the table when not in use, creating a focal point for display in the middle class home.",
