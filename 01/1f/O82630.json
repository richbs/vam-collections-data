The last figure of the date is not absolutely clear; it has been read as <i>8</i> in the <i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>; as <i>0</i> by Holmes, p. 241; and as <i>2</i>.  This last reading is almost certainly correct, and is supported by considerations of style.  Constable was in the habit of dating the oil sketches of this year (see Nos. 115 [121-1888] and 116 [146-1888]).\n\nNotes on Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], 119 [324-1888], and 120 [127-1888]\n\nAnother oil sketch of the same type, \u2018Dedham Vale\u2019 in the Ashmolean Museum, is dated 13 July 1812; and an oil sketch dated 12 July 1812 was in the Staats Forbes Collection.  J. G. B\u00f6hler, <i>Constable and Rubens</i>, pp. 36 ff. discusses Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], and 120 [127-1888], and suggests that the influence of Rubens to be found in them may have been mediated through Lord Radnor\u2019s \u2018Escurial\u2019.  Constable is known to have seen this painting at some time between May and November, 1812.",
