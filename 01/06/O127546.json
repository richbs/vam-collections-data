The oval motif is known as a patera, after a dish or wine holder of similar form used by the Romans in religious ceremonies.  \n\nDifferent mixtures of whiting, glue and gum arabic, known as 'composition', were pressed into the boxwood mould to make crisp, detailed mouldings that were light and easy to apply to a ceiling or wall.  For larger mouldings paper pulp or some kind of textile were added to provide body. The development of moulded composition ornament brought about a decline in the number of professional woodcarvers needed for decorating interiors.  Skilled carvers, however, were still very much in demand for the production of perfect moulds. \n\nThis piece is part of a large collection of moulds and carvings once owned by George Jackson & Sons, a London firm specialising in decorative plasterwork.  Established in 1780, Jackson's are reputed to have produced neo-classical mouldings for interiors designed by the Adam brothers, such as those at Croome Court in Worcestershire.  Later projects included work on the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, Buckingham Palace and several Cunard liners.",
