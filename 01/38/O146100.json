Each square contains a blue lozenge from which emerge four red leaves [a pin-wheel effect].  There is a border which is missing along one side; coloured diamonds and geometric motifs on a light brown ground. The missing border was not cut, it simply was never there. If a grid was initially marked onto the ground fabric, it was not accurately followed by the embroiderer because the lines of the motifs are not straight.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; white, red, brown, light brown, green, red faded to pink, yellow, black, dark blue, light blue, dark red [at one end of the cover - this might be a repair?]\nFacing: gold coloured silk plain weave [faded from a deeper gold].\nBacking: green silk plain weave",
