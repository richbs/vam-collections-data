He went on to become one of the most popular of all British watercolourists, admired by both collectors and critics.\nHe often depicted scenes of rain and strong winds. In this watercolour Cox attacks the sheet with his brush to achieve an aggressive and threatening effect.",

It is probably the painting exhibited in 1856 at the Society of Painters in Water-colours as <i>On the Moors near Bettws-y-Coed.</i>Cox visited the Welsh village of Bettws-y-Coed annually from 1844, probably because the open spaces of the Welsh hills and moors provided him with the right subject matter for the particular style of painting that he had developed. Throughout his long working career he was a consistent exponent of the principles of water-colour painting that had guided landscape painters in his youth: that landscape water-colours could provoke a strong emotional response in the spectator, especially if the natural associations of the subject were enhanced by the manipulation of the medium to suggest effects of atmosphere and space. \n\n<i>The Challenge</i> is one of his last and most powerful works and represents his technique at its most extreme. He was particularly famous for representing the wind and the rain by means of short dashing brush-strokes laid on to one another on coarse rough-textured paper. By this means the turbulence of the elements was suggested by the roughness of the paint surface. In <i>The Challenge</i> the downpour of rain is clearly suggested by the broad diagonal brush-strokes with which the whole picture is painted. The Welsh hills are relegated to a distant position in the landscape and the only inhabitant in this desolate landscape is a solitary bull, a symbol of animal power at its crudest and most basic. The whole picture is an almost impressionistic rendering of nature at her roughest and wildest, in both atmospheric and animal form. \n\nThe bull thus takes the place of any human inhabitant in the scene and faces the force of the elements by himself. In this respect <i>The Challenge</i> is a more evocative title than the original topographical one. The colours are dark and sombre and suggestive of approaching night and an oncoming storm. The atmosphere as a whole is threatening and full of menace and foreboding. We can feel the bull's discomfort in the scene and share with him his apprehension of what the night will bring.  \n\nHoward Coutts\"\nScott Wilcox <u>Sun, Wind, and Rain.
