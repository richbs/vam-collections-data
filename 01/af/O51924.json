It contains two identical scenes of astronauts in a dinghy next to the rocket in which they have splashed down - the main colours are red, purple and white.  In between these is a jungle scene with a tracking station and launch pad with rocket - the main colours are yellow, brown and black.\nThe lower band is linked to the central one by two rockets with flaming trails and by yellow stars.",
