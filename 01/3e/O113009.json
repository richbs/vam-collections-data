Engravers regularly produced images of the most popular performers and the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear in reverse. This image of Mrs.Wrighten was originally drawn on vellum by James Roberts, engraved by Thornthwaite, and printed in a famous book of portraits of actors called Bell's British Theatre, published in 1771.\n\nMrs. Wrighten was a leading singing actress at Drury Lane where she was engaged for a wide variety of roles by  David Garrick, every season from 1770 until 1787.  She became a popular favourite at London's Vauxhall Gardens where she was a regular fixture almost every summer from 1777 to1786, singing songs by leading composers and songs she wrote herself.  She retired from the stage in 1786 but renewed her stage career in the United States after 1792 where she appeared as Mrs. Pownell.",
