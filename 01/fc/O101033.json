A quilting or tufting pattern is visible in the creases on the top and bottom panels with remnants of tufting twine, a thicker plied thread which may be linen or hemp.\n\nThe underside is in poor condition with areas of torn and missing linen.",

The firm of Morel & Hughes supplied the furniture and upholstery, including the set of six chairs, with cushions covered in patterned grey silk and trimmed with silk gimp, for the ante-room to the crimson drawing room. Although the silk cover does not survive, this is a typical example of a squab cushion, constructed like a mattress, with a top and bottom joined by borders, the sides stitched to give a firm, upright, edge. Squab cushions were supplied in different sizes for chairs, couches and sofas and were usually tufted, a predecessor of buttoning and a method used to hold the horsehair stuffing in place. This cushion had tufts, made of thread, on the top and bottom, joined by twine through the stuffing.\n\nAlthough the linen covering the underside is not in good condition, this squab shows the methods and materials used by upholsterers to provide firm and comfortable seat cushions for Regency furniture.",

The cases, or top covers, for the cushions were made of grey silk with a design of stripes and rosettes, lined in white calico, and trimmed with silk gimp and cord, and the backs of the chairs covered in the same silk, at a cost of \u00a38 16s.\n\nSix of the side chairs and two berg\u00e8res, or low upholstered chairs, from the suite were sold from the collection of David Style at Wateringbury Place by Christie's, 1 June 1978. One of these berg\u00e8res  is also in the Museum's collection (Museum No.W. 48-1979). The second berg\u00e8re, and two of the side chairs, were acquired by Towneley Hall Art Gallery, Burnley.\n\nOther pieces from the suite, including two side chairs and eight stools, remain in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland.",
