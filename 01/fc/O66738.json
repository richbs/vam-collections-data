The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. Work probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\n\nThis illustration depicts the murder of Hamza's second son, Qubad. Hamza's father-in-law, Anushirvan, had ordered one of his servants to kill a particular prince. The servant tragically misunderstood his instructions and, entering Qubad's encampment at night, murdered the prince as he slept.",
