A wealthy boy on his way to school - indeed, Mulready subtitled the picture 'creeping like a snail unwillingly to school' (Shakespeare, As You Like It) - wistfully gazes at a group of poor children who attempt to blow their toy boat along with a roughly improvised roll of paper as he is led away from temptation by his mother or nurse.  Such pictorial analogies have their root in the moralising genre scenes of 17th-century Dutch painting.",

Heleniak, <i>William Mulready</i>, 1980, pp. 129 and 137\nCites related works to this painting in the V&A (a cartoon and an outline drawing, 6322-6323).\n\nThe following is the full text of the entry: \n\n\"MULREADY, William, RA (1786-1863) \n\nBorn Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, 1 April (not 30 as is sometimes recorded) 1786, son of a leather breeches maker and amateur draughtsman. Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as \u2018Story, Character, Expression, Beauty\u2019. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \nA Sailing Match\nFA147 Neg 5890 \n'Creeping like snail unwillingly to school' (Shakespeare As You Like It Act Il, scene 7) Panel, 35.3 X 32.1 cm (14 X 12314 ins) Sheepshanks Gift, 1857 \nHeleniak (137), a smaller reduced replica of a painting exhibited in 1831 (location unknown). Heleniak (129) cites related works to both paintings - a cartoon and an outline drawing at the V&A (6322-23), a pen and ink drawing, Auckland Art Gallery; pen and ink drawing, Henry E Huntingdon Art Gallery, California; pencil and chalk drawing, Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester. \nA classic example of Mulready's interest in contrasting the values of formal education with the process of learning through play. The poor idle boys who attempt to blow their boat along with a roughly improvised roll of paper have sent one of their number to fetch a bellows. A wealthy boy who would like to join in the game is being 'led from temptation' by his mother or nurse. Such pictorial analogies have their origin in Dutch 17th-century painting. \nEXH: \tWilliam Mulready South Kensington Museum 1864 (72); William Mulready V&A 1986 (111) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 206",
