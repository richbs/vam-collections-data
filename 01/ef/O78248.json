Norfolk was Elizabeth I's lieutenant in the north of England in 1559-1560.  In 1569 he was arrested for his part in the Northern Rebellion, a rising initially inspired by his resentment at the influence at court of the Protestant Cecil family.  Subsequently released, he was implicated in 1571 in another intrigue - the Ridolfi Plot. This was a Roman Catholic conspiracy to murder Elizabeth and put Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne.Norfolk was executed for treason in 1572.\n\nWithin the ornamental surround, engraved  by Hubert-Fran\u00e7ois Gravelot (1699-1773), sits a weeping cherub with its left hand resting on a crown.  This possibly alludes to the Duke of Norfolk's involvement in the fortunes of the throne of England.\n\nTrading\nThis print is the earliest dated one in a series of 80 portraits published by J. and P. Knapton to illustrate Nicholas Tindal's Continuation of Mr Rapin Thoyras's History of England.  The subscription for this series opened in 1736.  The prints, announced in 1737, could also be bought separately.",
