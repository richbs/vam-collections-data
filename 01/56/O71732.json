At the  centre the most prominent image is that of a woman in a western style bikini, she is kneeling in a slightly suggestive pose. Surrounding her are much smaller images, from the bottom left hand corner:  a portrait of a middle-aged man holding a bottle of alcohol, above him is an image of the woman dancing in a long flowing western style evening dress and hat, above her is a face of a young man with a slightly angry look. On the right hand side of the leaflet there is a young couple in western clothing embracing, below them are two more men's faces, one middle-aged and one young. The titles are in the centre below the woman and in yellow.\n\nThis leaflet opens up into a single page. On the inside is a synopsis of the film and song lyrics written in Hindi and interspersed with black and white stills which have been printed over in a vibrant orange colour. The inside back page has a synopsis in English and black and white stills printed over in yellow.  The back page lists the film credits. \n\nThe very modern feel of this leaflet reflects the theme of modernity in the film.",
