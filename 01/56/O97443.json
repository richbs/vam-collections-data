Its hinged visor allows only limited visibility as the helmet was designed for jousting in which one only need to move forwards in a straight line.\n\nJousting was a dangerous sport that formed an essential part of a Renaissance nobleman's training. Separated by a barrier, opposing knights charged each other on horseback and through limited vision amid the sound of thundering hooves, aimed to break each other\u2019s lance. The helmet\u2019s narrow eye-slits reduced the risk of facial injury. \n\nThe helmet is decorated with ridges that imitate contemporary headwear and the pleating of cloth as well as add strength. It would have been worn as part of a matching armour. Jousting armour was extremely heavy to protect specific target areas. The vertical \u2018fluting\u2019 decoration was popular during the reign of the Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519).",
