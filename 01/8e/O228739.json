Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of oni (demon) on a rock.\nThis is probably a parody on the iconography of the Buddha's disciple Handaka Sonja, who is frequently shown seated similarly on a rock. The highly exaggerate muscularity of the figure is reminiscent of the hyperrealistic manner of the wood carvers of the Kamakura period (1185-1392).",
