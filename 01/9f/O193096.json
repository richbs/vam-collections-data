Barnum when Stratton was four years old.  Barnum trained him to sing and dance, exhibited him at his American Museum in New York and marketed him successfully throughout America and Europe until his death in 1883. The date of his birth (11 Jan 1832) on this print is incorrect, but P.T. Barnum always claimed Tom Thumb to be older than he was, so that his stature seemed all the more remarkable. The date of his birth is generally agreed to be 4 January 1838. \n\nTom Thumb appeared twice before Queen Victoria in 1844, the year this lithograph was made by Baugniet, a Belgian artist who was appointed painter to the Belgian court in 1841. He moved to London in 1843 where he became a leading society portrait painter, creating a portrait of Prince Albert in 1851. He often returned to London to do portraits of celebrities such as Charles Dickens and the French composer Hector Berlioz. Baugniet also designed the first Belgian postage stamp, brought into circulation on 1 July 1849.",
