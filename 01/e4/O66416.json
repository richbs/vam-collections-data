But in a more decorative, human approach to industrial and interior design.  The key to Creative Salvage's success is not in the expensive research and development costs of modern day products, but in the recycling of scrap to form stylish and functional artefacts for the home and office.'  Untrained and underground, Creative Salvage was the furniture equivalent of punk, throwing together jarring objects rather than discordant music, out of the detritus of the urban landscape around it. They made objects that were both celebratory in their inventiveness, and funerary in their bleakness and exhibited them on the emerging underground club and gallery scene. \n\nThese snapshots, assembled by Mark Brazier-Jones, show him at work and play with Tom Dixon and Nick Jones.",
