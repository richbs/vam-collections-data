It also includes a sly pun on the idea of the hunt, showing men pursuing women with sexual intent.  The tapestry evokes the pastoral idyll with its abundantly floral background, distant windmill and scenes of peasants courting.  These peasants, however, are very well-dressed, and it seems likely that they are really nobles playing at rural life.",
