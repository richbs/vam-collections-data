The whole is lithographed to represent a brown horse with white; black; green; red; yellow and blue trim. The ears are black cloth attached to the head. The horse is in a galloping stance and under its legs are pictured scenes of skies; cacti and hills. The whole is a bridge shape; containing the mechanism and mounted on four small black wheels; one by each leg. The top half of the rider and the horse's head and neck are separate from the main body and linked by a beige braid rein. As the horse moves along the rider and the head go back and forth in unison. \n*It is marked T.T in a diamond on the lower right side behind the rear leg. \n*This is the same model as B.146-1994 except that a soldier; US Cavalry sergeant; is shown rather than a cowboy. The figure is dressed in a light blue uniform.",
