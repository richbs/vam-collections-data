It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nToo True To Be Good opened in London at the New Theatre in September 1932 with Donald Wolfit as the Doctor and Cedric Hardwicke as the Burglar/Parson 'Pops', the role Wolfit played on tour. The London run was shorter than anticipated and Wolfit was the only one of the London cast who did the tour. \n\nWolfit founded his own Shakespearean Company in 1937, in the great British tradition of the actor-manager, and the central character of 'Sir' in the play The Dresser, filmed in 1983, was based on his career.",
