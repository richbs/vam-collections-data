The Hague was noted for its fashionable and sophisticated court taste with a strong Parisian accent, set by the Stadholders from the 1630s. Furniture was ordered from Paris, but the wealthy inhabitants of the city also supported artists and craftsmen. \n\nThe use of ivory and turtle-shell marquetry was influenced by furniture made in Paris and possibly northern Germany from the 1640s. The technique of two-material marquetry, sawn from clamped sheets at the same time later came to be known as Boulle marquetry, after its famous proponent Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle.\n\nWilhelm Rots (c.1616-) was Princess Amalia's <i>concierge</i> or <i>kastelein</i>, responsible for the moveable goods in her palaces, from at least the early 1650s and is recorded in the Hague from 1649 when he associated with ebony workers. He may have been of German origin.  Another box with ivory and turtle-shell marquetry, with the HAVO monogram and therefore probably made for Amalia survives in the collection of the Landgrave of Hesse at Schloss Fasanerie. Baarsen suggests that Rots probably worked exclusively for the court. If this box is by Rots, it represents a simpler type of work from his documented and extremely elaborate cabinet for Amalia, and might have been a modest commission from a visitor to court. \n\nFor Wilhelm de Rots, see Reinier Baarsen: Furniture in Holland\u2019s Golden Age.
