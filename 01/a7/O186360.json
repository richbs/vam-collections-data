E.1053-1962\n\nGambetta, a lawyer by profession, is portrayed as a great General towering over General Trochu, represented as a feeble lawyer with strong religious leanings. In the Provinces the inexperienced Gambetta showed the attacking spirit the Parisian mob longed to find in their own leader. Trochu, in whose hands lay all the plans for the liberation of the city, was inclined to use the oratorical tools of the lawyer's trade, with none of Gambetta's eloquence. Unfortunately Gambetta's enthusiasm was not matched by a knowledge of strategy equal to Trochu's.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
