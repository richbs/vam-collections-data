            "public_access_description": "These brass snuffers were used to extinguish the flame and trim the wick of a candle. Candles were expensive and required a lot of maintenence so an accessory like a pair of snuffers was a costly luxury item.\n\nThis pair of snuffers is from a distinct group of 17th-century cast and enamelled brasswares that include stirrups, mirror-frames, fire-dogs, sconces, badges and sword-hilts. The colours used for the enamelling were limited to matt black, white, blue, green, yellow and red and the cast work is usually roughly finished. Some have Royalist associations including badges decorated with the Royal arms.\n\nThe items in the group are distinguished by their method of production: the fields to be enamelled were cast in the original moulds and not, as was more common, engraved (champl\u00e9v\u00e9) or enclosed (cloisonn\u00e9). They were for a long time referred to as Surrey Enamels after the author Charles R. Beard ascribed their manufacture to a factory in Esher, Surrey, but documentary evidence makes a strong case for their reattribution to the London workshops of Anthony Hatch and Stephen Pilcherd.\n\nHatch, a prominent member of the Armourers and Braziers Company, supplied an enamelled brass chimney piece to the Company, which was placed in the Court Room. This was presumably similar in style to the other enamelled wares from this group, which of course included other wares associated with fireplaces. Hatch worked with Pilchard, another member of the Armourers and Braziers Company. \n\nThe comparatively small output of work and the repeated use of identical moulds for the stems of candlesticks, firedogs and cups suggests these objects are the products of one workshop or partnership. Even domestic wares decorated with enamel would have been expensive, which implies that the workshop that produced them would have had a small but comparatively wealthy clientele.",

            "history_note": "The snuffers are from a group of rare cast and enamelled brasswares that date from ca. 1645 to ca. 1685. Othet types include stirrups, mirror-frames, fire-dogs, sconces, badges, spurs and sword-hilts. The colours used for the enamelling were limited to matt black, white, blue, green, yellow and red and the cast work is usually roughly finished. Some have Royalist associations including badges decorated with the Royal arms.  All appear to originate from a single workshop, that of Anthony Hatch and Stephen Pilchard of London.\n\nThe brasswares are distinguished by their method of construction which involves casting the fields for enamelling in the mould, and not, as was more common, engraved (champl\u00e9v\u00e9) or enclosed (cloisonn\u00e9). The borders between the fields are quite thick and form part of the design. The enamels have a rough and ready feel to them but the market was overwhemingly aristocratic. Their aesthetic qualities  might be compared with contemporary needlework on bedhangings, the borders of slipware and the wrigglework engraving on silver and pewter.\n\nThese brasswares were for a long time referred to as <i>Surrey Enamels</i> after the author Charles R. Beard ascribed their manufacture to a factory in Esher, Surrey, but documentary evidence makes a strong case for their reattribution to the London workshops of Anthony Hatch and Stephen Pilcherd. Hatch, a prominent member of the London livery company, The Worshipful Company of Armourers and Braziers, supplied an enamelled brass chimney piece to the Company, which was placed in the Court Room. This was presumably similar in style to the other enamelled wares from this group, which of course included other wares associated with fireplaces. Hatch worked with Stephen Pilchard, another member of the Armourers and Braziers Company. \n\nAmong this group of enamelled brasswares, the snuffers are extremely rare. \"'Surrey' Enamels Reattributed Part 2: An Illustrated Listing of Known Types\" published by Claude Blair and Angus Patterson in <u>The Journal of the Antique Metalware Society</u>, Vol. 14, in 2006, lists only two other pairs known. One was illustrated by Charles Beard in <u>Connoisseur</u> in 1931, and is in the British Museum (Museum no. 1885, 0508,20). The other was illustrated in the catalogue of the sale of furniture and other works of art belonging to Colonel H.H. Mulliner in 1924 and is in the Museum of London (ID 48. 3/2).\n\nFew examples of these enamelled wares survive and along with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the V&A has the largest holding in the world at around a 18 examples. The comparatively small output of work and the repeated use of identical moulds for the stems of candlesticks, firedogs and cups suggests these objects are the products one workshop. Even domestic wares decorated with enamel would have been expensive, which implies that the workshop that produced them would have had a small but comparatively wealthy clientele.",
