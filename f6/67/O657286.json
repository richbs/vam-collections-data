A couple leave via steps to the right of the background. Through a square opening on the left is an archway, statue, tree and two obelisks. Colours are pale brown, two shades of dark brown and black lines.\n\nThis print differs from Raphael's Cartoon of the subject in the top left and right corners. The landscape seen through the opening of the original has here been replaced by buildings, and the staircase leads directly outside while in the original it is next to a wall with a window.",

The so-called Raphael Cartoons are seven full size designs for tapestries by the great Italian Renaissance artist Raphael (1483-1520). They illustrate passages from the Bible concerning the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. None of them is smaller than ten feet high by thirteen feet wide. They belong to Her Majesty the Queen and have been on loan to this museum since 1865. The earliest print relating to the Raphael Cartoons dates from 1516, the year in which Raphael received final payment for the commission. It inaugurates an extraordinary case study in the history of printmaking, stretching over more than four hundred and fifty years and across a wide range of printmaking techniques.\n\nAlthough Ugo da Carpi was a contemporary of Raphael's he was not in the same situation as Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano who worked directly with the artist. Early impressions of this print carry a warning that \"anyone printing these images without the permission of the author will incur the excommunication of Pope Leo X\". Ugo da Carpi's efforts to protect his artistic property seem rather ironical given that it is now thought that this chiaroscuro woodcut is a direct copy of Agostino Veneziano's engraving of the same subject.",
