Each section is cut from two layers of the same white cotton fabric and is quilted using white cotton and also some white silk.  Sections of the quilting have been stuffed with indigo dyed cotton thread, creating corded quilting in a series of broken longitudinal lines, zigzags and intersecting reciprocal curved elongated lozenges on each section.  A composite band of decorative stitching in black silk delineates the contours of each section in a series of triangles, stepped and interlaced lozenges.\n\nLining: red cotton printed with an offset pattern of rows of a tri-stemmed flowering plant in yellow and white outlined in black.\nFacing: pieced; bias-cut wool, possibly twill tapestry, in alternate wide toothed stripes of pink, red, pale blue and white; possibly not from one but from two or more fabrics. The stripes contain stylized floral or stemmed motifs in pink, white, dark blue, green, yellow and red.\nEmbroidery Thread: black silk; 2S.",
