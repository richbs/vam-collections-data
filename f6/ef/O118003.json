The design dates from the late Middle Ages, but a silversmith working at that time would have cast it.  This clasp is made from stamped sheet silver and is therefore more likely to date from the 18th or 19th century.  Clasps like this continued in use with traditional dress in many places in Norway until the 19th century.   It may have been made in Bergen, as this technique was common among Bergen silversmiths in the 19th century.  It is almost certainly Norwegian, as it features St Olav, the patron saint of Norway, over the hook.",
