Early work was in the Italianate style of Nevers but, by the end of the century, it had responded to the fashion for blue and white, and developed a formal style of radiating decoration. Tin-glazed pottery gained acceptability following Louis XIV's command to melt down all silver plate to pay for a series of expensive wars, after which demand from the nobility for  grand pieces to replace their lost silver. Plates such as this would have been displayed on a large sideboard or buffet.\nThe factory is particularly associated with its radiating patterns in underglaze blue.\n\nThe plate is decorated with the arms of Asselin de Villequier (1669-1728), who was couselor to the Parliament of Normandy in 1695 and created baron in 1712. The coat of arms is stamped with an earl's coronet to honour the family, although it did not bear the corresponding title.",
