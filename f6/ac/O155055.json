In the late 1960s the artist worked with California Computer Products Inc., a company that produced plotters.  A pen plotter is a mechanical drawing \u2018arm\u2019 linked to a computer.  A computer program, written by the artist or programmer, drives the pen across the drawing surface and dictates its route.  Plotter drawings are always linear, although close cross-hatching can enable plotter drawings to simulate an expanse of block colour.   \n\nStrand's artwork is also reproduced in the book published to accompany Cybernetic Serendipity, an exhibition held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. The catalogue includes images of a number of works created using Calcomp equipment (p.91).",
