The decoration is unfinished and the technique that Mackintosh uses to build up the design can be clearly seen: the circular plan is in pencil with a light wash used for shading and defining the three-dimensional form of the plate and a radial line, hatching marks to indicate the \"dip\" in the centre of the plate and finally watercolour for the decoration. The pattern radiates from and echoes the wavy form of the shamrock in the centre point which is contained in a quatrefoil. Around the rim, however, is a frieze of the small neat squares typical of Mackintosh's work. \nThe plate design is similar to those displayed on the shelves on the left-hand side of the 'Art Lover's Dining Room' and was probably for a decorative, rather than a practical purpose.
