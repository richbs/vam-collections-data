To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took time and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. \nThis box is decorated in hiramaki-e (low sprinkled picture) but without the final protective coat of lacquer to prevent the box from becoming worn at the edges. The sweeping willow branches have been formed by the removal of the gold-sprinkled lacquer whilst it is still wet to reveal the black background underneath.",
