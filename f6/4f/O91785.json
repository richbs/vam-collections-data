The enamel plaques are distinctly Spanish, although similar pieces have also been noted in Germany. \n\nThis object, which is one of a pair (M.288&B-1956), offers a glimpse of the collecting activities of Walter Leo Hildburgh. The Museum\u2019s early acquisitions of European silver in the 19th century relied heavily on important sales of private collections. During the early 20th century, however, the Museum was able to shape the collections more deliberately by influencing Hildburgh\u2019s prolific collecting. Hildburgh travelled widely on buying expeditions, usually recording when and where he bought something, but not (frustratingly for posterity) from whom. He added more than 500 objects to the collection, either as gifts to the Museum or as part of his bequest.",
