It is gold at the top and silver towards the bottom.\n[Geometry set] A long gold pole with a hole in one end and a thinner bit at the other end.\n[Geometry set] Two sharp metal points attached at the top on a pivot. The top half is gold and the bottom half is silver.\n[Geometry set] An attachment for part of a geometry set. It is gold at the top and silver at the bottom. It has a screw in the bottom section to adjust the width.\n[Geometry set] Two long pieces of metal held together at the top by a pivot. One side goes into a point whilst the other side holds a small brown pencil. The compass is mainly gold with a silver section on the point.\n[Geometry set] A rectangular, reddish brown wooden box with two metal hooks which open to reveal a purple lining and a set of eight geometry tools. Each tool has an inset into the lining. The words 'E. Woodhams' is written in pencil on the inside of the box.",

The tools are made out of metal and are held in a lining in a wooden box. Children's geometry sets today and usually made out of plastic and contain a wider range of tools such as a compass, protractor, pencil, ruler, and several set squares. They are used in Mathematics classes to help with measuring things like angles.",

William was the son of James Norman and Ruth nee Kingman born c. 1883. William was born in Westminster but brought up in Newington, Surrey. The set was passed to the donor, his godchild, in 1948. Enid Locke was born 6.9.1937, an only child, and the family lived in rooms in Mr. Norman's house until an incendiary bomb landed on the Anderson shelter when they were all in it.  That was in Lorrimore Square, opposite St. Paul's church which was badly bombed. Her mother and Mrs. Norman had done their cleaning rota duty the day before so weren't best pleased.  They all moved to Balham (separate addresses)  in mid-1941 and Mrs. Norman died in January 1942. Mr. Norman came to live with Enid's parents, William Henry Woodhams and Maud Mary nee Post.  She went to Hearnville Road School, where classes officially contained 44 children but were allowed to increase that to 48 as it was wartime.  The headmistress was Edith B. Cox, a wonderful woman who achieved splendid results with virtually no resources other than dedicated teachers.  In particular Miss Cox was proud of the number of \"her\" children who gained L.C.C. scholarships to Christ's Hospital and in 1948 five pupils, including Enid created a new record number for her.  It was getting the scholarship that led Mr. Norman to give her the geometry set and it went off to school with her each term for the next five years; sadly he was unaware of that as he died during her first term away.",
