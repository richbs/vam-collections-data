The company was named after the imminent Festival of Britain, but was renamed in 1989 as the English National Ballet. \nDolin's idea was for the company to tour nationally and internationally, educate through outreach programmes and bring ballet to the nation at an affordable price.\n\nThis hanging card illustrates the scope of the Festival Ballet's output. The programme includes popular classics such as The Nutcracker and Swan Lake, but also more unusual pieces less frequently performed. The card itself is designed in an abstract manner, with the wild black brush strokes on the red background suggesting the shadow and movement of the illustrated dancers in the foreground.\n\nThe Bristol Hippodrome, opened in 1912, is known for featuring large shows such as touring West End Musicals, due to its having one of the largest stages outside of London. It is also notable for having featured several important British stage premieres, including a return for the English National Ballet with their 2002 newly choreographed production of The Nutcracker.",
