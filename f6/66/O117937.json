It is decorated with horizontal bands of cutwork with needle lace fillings, and edged with small triangular needle lace motifs, each one finished off with a tiny trefoil.\n\nNothing is known about how the coif was preserved before it entered the Museum's collection in the 1960s, and the survival of such a fragile object, intended to be functional even though it is so decorative, is rare. The needle lace which decorates it is Italian in style, and similar to designs published in Venetian pattern books of the 1590s. The overall shape of the coif, however, with its long lappets, is Flemish. Italian pattern books for lace circulated in Flanders, and the coif may well have been made there.",

The overall shape of the coif, however, with its long lappets, is Flemish. Italian pattern books for lace circulated in Flanders, and the coif may well have been made there. Comparable examples can be seen in 16th century Dutch and Flemish  paintings, for example the Family Portrait by Maerten van Heemskerck (b.1498 Heemskerck, d.1574 Haarlem) in the Staatliche Museen, Kassel, Germany.",
