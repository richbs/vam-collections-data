Details along the side and bottom are picked out in yellow ochre.  The central light showing a vision of the saint's mother appearing with a halo and looking like the Virgin Mary is the most coloured of the three lights.  It is painted all over in watercolour.  The right-hand light shows St. Edmund standing high above kneeling or seated soldiers in armour, he raises a crucifix high above his head.   The tracery above is painted in watercolours as in the light in the far left.  Details along the side and bottom are picked out in yellow ochre.  The design is drawn onto a piece of cream-coloured paper shaped like a single lancet window.",
