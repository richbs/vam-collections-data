            "public_access_description": "This is the cover of  a tiny, pocket-sized volume entitled Vereinigte Stickmuster -Verlage, (United Embroidery Pattern Publishing House), volume number 246,  printed by Heinrich Kuehn after 1879. It is printed with the manufacturer's name, medallions decorated with heads of state, names of international exhibitions held in named cities and their dates. It is the cover for a volume of design prints for Berlin wool work that unfold like a concertina {E.236.2-20-2010].\n\nThe exhibitions named include the international ones of  the Great Exhibition of 1851, the London International Exhibition held in 1862, the Welt Ausstellung (World Exhibition) held in Vienna in 1873, the Philadelphia International Exhibition and that in Sydney both held in 1879. The inclusion of their names on the cover suggests that Kuehn exhibited designs at the exhibitions. \n\nThe pattern book is from an archive of patterns belonging to embroiderers, including Miss Trevor, who was awarded certificates for first class work shown at the Festival Handicrafts Exhibition held by the Berkshire Federation of Women's Institutes held in September 1951 at Reading Town Hall and for having work chosen for the Exhibition of Handicrafts held at the Victoria and Albert Museum the following year.",
