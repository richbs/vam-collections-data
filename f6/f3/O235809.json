            "public_access_description": "Fedot Ivanovich Shubin (1740-1805), n\u00e9 Shubnoi, the sculptor of this bust of Catherine the Great, was the son of a fisherman from the White Sea coast, Russia. Having produced carvings in bone and mother-of-pearl as a child, he went to St. Petersburg in 1759 and studied there at the Imperial Academy 1761-67 under Nicholas-Fran\u00e7ois Gillet (1712-91). He then moved to Paris where, thanks to a recommendation from Diderot, a friend of Dmitry Golitsyn, Russian Ambassador, he studied under the famous sculptor Pigalle, 1767-70. He worked in Rome 1770-72, and briefly with Nollekens in London in 1773. \n\nShubin was the pre-eminent Russian Neoclassical sculptor and this portrait bust is similar in style to Neoclassical portrait busts created elsewhere, and particularly in France. He executed free-standing sculptures, architectural decoration, and most notably portrait busts of Russia's aristocracy including members of the Golitzyn family who are reputed to have owned this bust. Shubin also carved a celebrated full-length marble of Catherine the Legislator, 1789, now in the Russian Museum, St Petersburg. \n\nThis highly finished bust, of 1771, with its combination of formality with a lively smile, has been copied in bronze and biscuit porcelain. It remains an iconic image of Catherine the Great, who embraced the style of Neoclassicism in major building projects as well as collecting.",

It was subsequently sold by his valet to a Frenchman in one of the 'torgsin' or shops which appeared in Moscow after the revolution, where all manner of treasures and possessions of former aristocrats were sold off to foreigners in exchange for foreign currency.\nIts early history is unknown, but according to one account it was commissioned by Count Andrew Shuvalov and according to another it was given to Catherine II by Shuvalov. It passed to the Galitzine collection at Petrovskoye. After the Russian Revolution it was owned by Voldemar Wehrlin, who bought it from the Galitzine family in Paris (who believed the bust was presented by Shubin to Catherine II, who subsequently gave it to Shuvalov). It was purchased from Wehrlin by the Victoria and Albert Museum with contributions from the friends of the late Mrs Syrie Maugham, 1964.\n\nHistorical significance: The bust is the earliest known work by Shubin.
