            "public_access_description": "Francesco di Giorgio Martini (bapt 1439-1501) was a Sienese architect, engineer, painter, illuminator, sculptor, medallist, theorist and writer.  He and members of his workshop produced numerous cassoni or wedding chests from the end of the 1460s which reveal Francesco\u2019s interest in narrative and taste for the classically inspired representation of architecture and cities. He worked closely with Neroccio de\u2019 Landi from around 1469 until 1474. This cassone appears to have been painted using designs by the master in his workshop during his period of collaboration with Neroccio. It can be compared for example with two similar cassoni also containing triumphal chariots at the Museo Stibbert, Florence.\nThis work was previously described as representing Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. However, the youthful uncrowned youth who sits with the queen is not convincingly identified with the King who is generally represented as older, bearded and crowned. The scene may tentatively be identified as representing Dido, the founder and first Queen of Carthage and her love, the Trojan hero Aeneas. The scene on the left may illustrate Dido's procession to the Temple of Juno and at right, the meeting of Aeneas and Dido and an allusion to the subsequent Banquet with the Trojans, all recounted in Book I of Virgil's Aeneid. Further, the attention to architecture may also allude to Dido\u2019s role as the \u2018builder\u2019 of Carthage.  The subject remains however a subject of debate and is described more generally as 'A Triumph of Love' as suggested by the triumphal chariot at left and 'Two Lovers.' \nOn the sides are coats of arms that have not yet been identified. On the back is a sketch of a reclining female nude. With the cassone placed against the wall, this would have remained mostly unseen, and was no doubt painted for the artist\u2019s own amusement. Although the earlier whereabouts of this cassone  is unknown, it was given as a wedding present to Princess Louise (1848\u20131939), Queen Victoria\u2019s artistically gifted daughter, when she married the Marquis of Lorne (later 9th Duke of Argyll) in 1871.",

            "bibliography": "Ellen Callman, <u>Apollonio di Giovanni.</u> (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1974), p.26, n.10.\nListed under \"Chests that have survived substantially in their original form\"\nC. M. Kauffmann, <u>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings before 1800,</u> London, 1973, cat. no. 127, pp. 114-115.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nWorkshop of FRANCESCO di Giorgio and Neroccio di Bartolommeo Landi \n127 \nCASSONE, PAINTED WITH: \nfront: SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA; \nside: TWO COATS OF ARMS \nTempera \nH. 39 (99); \nW. 75 (190'5); D. 26 \n(66) \nThe lid and base of the cassone are late reconstructions. \nW.68-1925 (F. & w.) \n\nThis cassone was published by Borenius in 1926 as by, or 'gravitating round', Francesco di Giorgio. It is related, not only in style but also in architectural form, to the cassoni attributed to Francesco. The figures in gilt stucco bas relief on each side of the front panel are paralleled, for example, in the Tobias cassone in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery, Kansas (Weller, 1943, figs. 38,42). \nIt is known that Francesco had a joint workshop, whose products included cassoni, with Neroccio from about 1469 or slightly earlier until 1475, when the partnership was dissolved, followed shortly by Francesco's departure for Urbino. It is possible, therefore, to date these cassoni fairly precisely, c. 1469-75, but it is less easy to decide to what extent they are by Francesco himself and how far the execution was left to assistants. A. S. Weller claimed that only four were autograph and most of the othersincluding w.68-1925 - were products of the Francesco-Neroccio workshop. Although we know nothing of the number of assistants Francesco employed, it seems reasonable to accept Weller's verdict on this panel, which is not, in quality, up to the standard of Francesco's undoubted paintings.\nThe coats of arms painted on the side panels were described as follows: \nLeft: Sable, an eagle displayed gules (colours no longer distinguishable); Right: Gules, lion rampant sable. \nThese arms, but with different colours (or, a lion sable; sable, an eagle or (?)) are repeated on the front. Their identification is rendered difficult by the confusion in the colours. A search covering both alternatives has proved fruitless. \nWeller objected to the identification of the scene, 'as the gentleman enthroned with the queen is youthful and uncrowned, thus failing to be Solomon.' But he was unable to suggest an alternative and, as most of the features fit well with the tradition of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba illustrations and in view of the fact that this was a popular subject in cassone painting, it does not seem justifiable to dispute this identification. \nOn the back there is a monochrome brush drawing of a reclining woman. \nPainted directly on to the wood, it is crude but vigorous in execution. It has been attributed to the Francesco di Giorgio workshop by Philip Pouncey (letter in Museum file) and was probably done for the artist's own amusement. \n\nCondition. Painted surface considerably worn. Cleaned by S. Iseppin 1950. \nProv. Given as a wedding present in 1871 to H.R.H. Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (1848-1939) and presented by her to the Museum in 1925. \nLit. T.

            "history_note": "Given as a wedding present in 1871 to H.R.H. Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (1848-1939) and presented by her to the Museum in 1925.\n\nHistorical significance: Francesco di Giorgio Martini (bapt 1439-1501) was a Sienese architect, engineer, painter, illuminator, sculptor, medallist, theorist and writer. His activities as a diplomat led to his employment at the courts of Naples, Milan and Urbino, as well as in Siena, and was among the leading architects in Italy. His theoretical works, which include the first important Western writings on military engineering, were not published until modern times but were keenly studied in manuscript, by Leonardo da Vinci among others.  Francesco di Giorgio is generally thought to have studied with the painter and sculptor il Vecchietta.  He and members of his workshop produced numerous <i>cassoni</i> (e.g. Florence, Mus. Stibbert; New York, Met.) from the end of the 1460s which reveal Francesco\u2019s interest in narrative and taste for the classically inspired representation of architecture and cities. He worked closely with Neroccio de\u2019 Landi from around 1469 until 1474. This cassone appears to have been painted using designs by the master in his workshop during his period of collaboration with Neroccio. It can be compared for example with two similar cassoni also containing triumphal chariots at the Museo Stibbert, Florence.\nThis work was previously described as representing Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. However, the youthful uncrowned youth who sits with the queen is not convincingly identified with King Solomon who is generally represented as older, bearded and crowned. The scene may tentatively be identified as representing Dido, the founder and first Queen of Carthage and her love, the Trojan hero Aeneas. The scene on the left may illustrate Dido's procession to the Temple of Juno and at right, the meeting of Aeneas and Dido and an allusion to the subsequent Banquet with the Trojans, all recounted in Book I of Virgil's <u>Aeneid</u>:\n\n\u2018while in amazement he [Aeneas] hangs rapt in one fixed gaze, the queen, Dido, moved toward the temple, of surpassing beauty, with a vast company of youths thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas\u2019 banks or along the heights of Cythus Diana guides her dancing bands, in whose train a thousand Oreads troop to right and left; she bears a quiver on her shoulder, and as she treads overtops all the goddesses; joys thrill Latona\u2019s silent breast \u2013 such was Dido, so moved she joyously through their midst, pressing on the work of her rising kingdom. Then at the door of the goddess, beneath the temple\u2019s central dome, girt witharms and high enthroned, she took her seat. Laws and ordinances she gave to her people; their tasks she adjusted in equal shares or assigned by lot\u2026\u2019 \n(Aeneid 1:494ff)\n\nWhile some details of the text do not appear in the painting and vice versa, the niche carved out of the stairs in the platform in the second scene appears to hold several books and a lamp (?) to which the Queen gestures with her sceptre \u2013possibly a reference to Virgil's 'laws and ordinances.'  Further, the attention to architecture may also allude to Dido\u2019s role as the \u2018builder\u2019 of Carthage.  The subject remains however a subject of debate and is described more generally as 'A Triumph of Love' as suggested by the triumphal chariot at left and 'Two Lovers.'",

            "historical_context_note": "'Cassone' is the Italian term generally used for large, lavishly decorated chests such as this made in Italy from the 14th through the 16th centuries. Wealthy households needed many chests, but the ornate <i>cassoni,</i> (pl.) painted and often combined with pastiglia decoration, were usually commissioned in pairs when a house was renovated for a newly married couple and were ordered, together with other furnishings, by the groom. Florence was the main centre of production, though cassoni were also produced in Siena and occasionally in the Veneto and elsewhere. <i>Cassoni</i> were generally decorated with colourful paintings on three sides and, sometimes, the underside of the lid. The bride used the chests to store her trousseau; items of linen, underclothes, purses, combs, belts, towels, and devotional books. Until about 1460, it was customary, particularly in Florence, to parade these chests through public streets, after this time however, strict sumptuary laws encouraged families to restrict their wedding celebrations to palace courtyards or loggias. The depiction of triumphal processions in the later half of the fifteenth century may be imaginative re-creations of abandoned practices and traditions. \nBy the 19th century, many wedding chests had been dismantled and sold to tourists, especially British and Americans who developed a particular fondness for Florentine art.",
