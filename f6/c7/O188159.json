The photograph\u2019s extended caption informs us that the birds are 'European Finches seized upon illegal importation to into the U.S. and African Gray Parrots in quarantine.' The birds are dwarfed by their artificial, scientific surroundings. The photograph's limited, almost washed-out palette is in keeping with the institutional, fluorescent-lit dreariness of the location and the only specks of bright colours are the parrots' tails, their toys and their feeding dishes.   \n\nThe photograph is from 'An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar', a series of photographs that reveal a range of remarkable places and things. Some are things whose very existence is surprising, such as a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. We may be aware of the existence of some of her other subjects, such as a vial of live HIV virus, or a cryopreservation unit (in which dead bodies are frozen in the hope of someday being brought back to life), but most of us would only be able to imagine what such things look like.
