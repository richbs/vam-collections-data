            "public_access_description": "The Corsini Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine is one of the great showcases of Florentine High Baroque sculpture. It is also a testimonial to Giovanni Battista Foggini's artistic prowess. Foggini was contracted to supply a relief for the high altar in 1677. It was in place when the chapel was consecrated in 1683.\n\nThe present relief is based on a larger presentation drawing that is now in the Louvre in Paris. Foggini accurately translated the painterly qualities of the drawing into clay. He has rearranged some of the ancillary figures and isolated St Andrea's communion with the Virgin Mary more effectively. He has also given greater prominence to the high altar and the architectural backdrop. Changes between the terracotta and the marble are slight. They include the extended gesture of the Virgin's right arm, the altered gaze of the angel directly above the saint, and the more subdued pose of the kneeling man on the lower right.",
