The bottom consists of a single large, adzed plank.The lid consists of two (noticeably thin) planks with moulded edges on four sides (created by scratch mouldings), held on two large nailed strap hinges, the nails have not been properly driven into the back. Note that there is no overhang of the lid over the sides and front, suggesting that it is a replacement from another chest.\n\nThere are two lock escutcheons. The chest is missing the lock inside. There is no sign of an internal till.\n\nNote that the stiles, rails and muntins are noticeably thick (40-42mm), plain and sharp, and the panels thin.\n\nLater alterations\nThe top and bottom rails of the back. All four legs have been cut down, with 3 \u00bd\u201d deep round holes as if it had ball feet at some point. The feet all worm damaged. The PR end unstable where lower rail joint has failed at PR corner.\nTwo modern battens are screwed on underside of lid.\nA batten has been added inside the front rail above the bottom, the purpose unclear.\n\nNotes \nIncised double line around edge of lid incl battened ends. A filler block for the missing hasp. Some shrinkage visible on front panels, but quality not wholly convincing.",
