The French-style frame has square tapered legs with gilt brass mounts. (The music stand is missing). The wrest-plank is of massive construction with a 50mm layer of beech laid on the same depth of pine. The bottom board is of oak rather than the lime or pine usually found on instruments in the English style of construction. The soundboard of spruce measures 3-4mm in diameter and a triangular piece has been inlaid at the right-hand rear corner. The scantlings are <i>c</i>. 18mm.'\n\nHoward Schott, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Part I: Keyboard Instruments </i>(London, 1985), p. 109.",

The blue ground is painted with details such as trees in a white bodycolour. Some of the horn is cut very thin and has been used to simulate water in the landscapes. The roundels are glazed.\n\nWhen the case was restored by the Museum's Conservation Department in 1963, the missing ivory medallions were replaced by coloured photostats. (These have subsequently been removed).\n\nFor a discussion of the use of Wedgwood plaques to decorate pianos, see Alison Kelly, <i>Decorative Wedgwood in Architecture and Furniture</i> (Country Life, London, 1965) pp. 128-9.",

By 1791 Francisco Fl\u00f3rez (died 1824) was the leading piano maker in Madrid. He had spent the previous two years in London, studying English piano-making methods.\n\nFl\u00f3rez fitted this instrument with an English action, but followed French fashions in decorating the case and legs in the Neo-classical style. Jean-Demosth\u00e8ne Dugourc (1749-1825), the favourite designer and supplier of luxury goods to Carlos IV of Spain (reigned 1788-1808), propagated this style in Spain. This fine example of Spanish Neo-Classical casework closely resembles an unsigned instrument in the Palacio Real in Madrid. It may well have been made for someone at the court of Carlos IV (reigned 1788-1808) as Fl\u00f3rez is known to have supplied instruments to the King and the Condesa-Duquesa de Benavente.",

            "production_note": "English-type square pianos were apparently made in Spain in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. An instrument of this type dated 1788 (Koster Collection, New Bedford, Massachusetts), inscribed <i>Del Mormol / en Sevilla</i>, for example, is remarkably similar to English squares of a few years earlier as regards form, construction, type of action and even the casework, albeit of lesser refinement. The English influence to be seen in the pianos made by Fl\u00f3rez for the Royal Palace in Madrid has been noted (Juan Jose Junquera, <i>La decoraci\u00f3n y el mobilario de los palcios de Carlos IV</i>, Madrid, 1979, 32. A cabinet upright by Fl\u00f3rez in the Palacio Real is illustrated there, Plate 6). The present piano by Fl\u00f3rez, decorated with gilt ornaments and medallions inspired by Wedgwood originals, recalls the remarkable Broadwood piano of 1796 with a case said to have been designed by Thomas Sheraton. The Broadwood is a grand piano (formerly in the Deerfield Museum, now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts) with a satinwood case set with 'Wedgwood's and Tassie's medallions' as the original bill states, and is richly decorated with gilt ornament. It bears the Spanish royal arms because it was presented to the Queen of Spain, Maria Luisa de Parma, by Don Manuel de Godoy, Prime Minister of Spain, who had commissioned it in London.
