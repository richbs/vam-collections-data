            "public_access_description": "Lewis is famous for the exquisite paintings of oriental life that he exhibited in London in the mid-nineteenth century. Though lesser known, the watercolour sketches he made while living in Turkey and Egypt are also exceptional. In the example shown here, the vast interior space of Hagia Sophia is conveyed with an apparent minimum of effort. The delicately rendered pencil framework is given substance by a judicious use of white highlights and sparingly applied touches of colour, notably in the tiny pinpoints of red for the fezzes of members of the congregation. The view is of the eastern end of the basilica, at that time used as a mosque, with the minbar (pulpit) to the right. On the piers hang square levhas (painted wooden plaques), bearing the Sacred Islamic Names, which, during the restorations carried out by the Fossati brothers later in the 1840s, were replaced by round ones. Lewis spent about a year in Constantinople from October 1840 before continuing on to Egypt, where he lived for nearly a decade, returning to England in 1851.",

This drawing shows the eastern end of Haghia Sophia with the minber on the right, muezzin mahfili on the left and levhas (painted wooden plaques) hanging from the piers.  The latter were replaced during the restorations carried out by the Fossati brothers in 1847-9 (see SP.271 & SP.272).  See G. Goodwin, A History of Ottoman Architecture, 1971.",
