From this extends an irregular lattice of straight red/white dotted lines that connect with an incomplete mirror row of 2 pairs of red blossoms and 2 pairs of small rosettes. From the lower red blossoms extending upwards is an irregular large green zigzag (on both sides) which becomes a more conventional stem for the large irregular stems, top and bottom. From the medallion hangs a pair of large yellow pendants, each with a large sprig surmounted by a dark blue rosette. Below are 2 bands of large very irregular composite blossoms and above are 3 bands. The rest of the field, especially the edges, is filled with tiny geometric, floral, and animal motifs.\nMain: white ground with a repeating pattern of stylised floral motifs that have been \"degenerated\" to an unrecognisable degree; predominantly pink, brown, and blue.\nInner and Outer borders: light red ground with a small floral meander with a small flower-head alternating with 3 small buds; various colours.",
