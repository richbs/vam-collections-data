The first Iznik tiles were produced, and potters added a bright red to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, tiles of high quality were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds",

The s-cloud motif was first recorded on a candlestick of the late 15th century (Atasoy and Raby, 1989, fig. 60) but vanished from the Iznik potters repertoire until 1580s which coincides with a more conservative trend associated with the end of Murad III's reign. This motif was rarely applied to dishes, but was popular on jugs. A further development of this style occurs on a series of jugs from the 1590s on which clouds float on a white ground (Atasoy and Raby, 1989, figs. 555-557).",
