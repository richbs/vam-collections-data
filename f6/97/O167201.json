The right-hand side is missing but evidence at top right of plain weve with dark brown weft turned and stitched.\n\nEND FINISH: the lower end is incomplete with evidence of stout cord oversewn in blue and red in lower left.  The upper end is missing but there is evidence of 1 cm plain weave with red weft and then evidence in the upper left and centre that it was turned and oversewn with red and blue in a chevron pattern - but perhaps a cord was added.  It is not possible to ascertain whether both upper and lower left were the same but they would have formed the strengthened opening for the bag.\n\nDESIGN: field: parallel zigzag bands form deep, saw-edged triangles divided vertically into three wide and two narrow rows by four narrow purple and yellow poles.\n\nBorders: the main border has a reciprocal dark green/red horned motif, each pair of horns bearing a white floret.\n\nThe inner and outer borders have giagonal blocks of colour alternating with dark red blocks.\n\nFlaps: each has a stepped triangle, two predominantly white and two red, complimenting the design on the field.\n\nCatalogue date: 15.2.95",
