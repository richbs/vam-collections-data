The obverse of this medal represents Nicholas Kolnpock (1500-1570) facing left, bearded, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, gown and chain. The reverse shows a nude female figure seated on a stone on grass grasping her right foot. (A female version of the Spinario).\n\nNeufahrer may have been a sculptor originally, although his work as a Mint-master, seal-cutter and goldsmith was at least as important as his activity as a medalist. He produced medals between 1530 and 1557; these included portrait, religious and commemorative medals. He made both cast and struck medals, though the majority were struck. Habich noted that the models for his early, larger medals were in boxwood, while the later ones are of stone. He was appointed Court Goldsmith by King Ferdinand I by 1541 and worked in Linz, Prague and Vienna.\n\nLudwig Neufahrer (active 1541-1563) was a medallist, goldsmith and diecutter, active in Austria, Germany and Bohemia. He was almost certainly trained in South Germany, later lived in Augsburg, Nuremberg and Linz, until he resided in Vienna in 1548. Probszt listed 111 medals by Neufahrer with portraits of royalty and members of the nobility, as well as leading citizens of the imperial cities of Augsburg and Nuremberg; there are also 10 medals with scenes from Classical mythology and the Bible. Neufahrer is regarded as the most important medallist working in Austria in his day.",
