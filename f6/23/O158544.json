            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk and metal thread in straight stitches, needleweaving and pulled thread work; whitework, trimmed with an added metal thread and silk woven braid.\nDisplayed behind glass.\nThe main border has a line of lozenges truncated at two ends therefore forming hexagons with pulled thread ground worked with metal thread; there is a 4-petalled lozenge in the centre of each.  Each large lozenge has a border of fine pulled thread work with silk.  The space between the lozenges is filled with \nsmalled stepped diamonds in white silk straight stitches. Above and below the main border is a line of straight stitches forming diamonds each made from 8 triangles, with a pair of half diamonds in between and then a 3-part band of needleweaving. The field is embroidered with metal thread to form  a diamond grid with the ground fabric showing in each lobed compartment.  The grid contains small spots of the ground fabric. In each corner there is a triangle of pulled thread work using metal thread within which is a geometric floral spray of 2 leaves and a diamond shaped flower worked in pulled tread with silk.  There are 3 embroidered motifs in silver within each leaf, one where they join and 5 in the diamond-head - this extends beyond the corner triangle and this border is worked with reciprocal metal triangles on a silk pulled thread band.  An embroidered line and flower, both in metal thread, extend into the field. Along each side there are 3 diamonds on a triangular base and stem: the two outer ones are worked mainly in metal thread and the centre one in silk. In the centre is an octagon with a large square of pulled thread work in metal thread in the middle, a band of needleweaving in metal thread and then 2 bands of triangles and diamonds in straight stitch with metal thread on a silk pulled thread ground.\nThe metal thread appears to be silver strip wound around a white silk core; there is also silver-gilt strip wound around a silk core [colour not known].",
