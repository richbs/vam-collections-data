A large square mesh of brides boucl\u00e9es is used for most of the ground but there also are large areas filled with a square looped mesh and with a variety of fancy filling meshes. The pattern is outlined by a heavy raised cordonnet. The border is divided by curving lines of flowers and ribbons, and by more formal scroll work into a series of irregular cartouches which are filled with, or are decorated by, branching floral plants. The lower edge is scalloped and is decorated with flowerheads and with medallions containing fancy fillings. The upper edge is straight and the pattern was designed to continue across the join into a parallel border.",

The Burano Lace School copied it from a high-quality historical piece. The school was established on the island of Burano outside Venice for charitable reasons and with royal patronage after the severe winter of 1872. The Venetian lagoon froze and the communities dependent on fishing were badly affected. The school revived the skill that had made Venice the major producer of needle lace in the 16th and 17th centuries. It produced lace of every sort, and its lacemakers faithfully copied high-quality historical pieces, like this flounce. By the 1890s the school was also making lace in contemporary style. It continued to produce pieces of style and quality well into the 20th century.",
