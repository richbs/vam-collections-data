The bearded figure of the saint is seated in a recess in the panel, his feet resting on a ledge. He is wearing a robe and the cloak round his shoulders is draped over his knees from the left. In his right hand he holds two of this emblems, a boat and a double-ringed anchor attached to it. In his left hand he clasps an oar, another of his emblems, the top of which has been incorrectly restored. \n\nThe top part of the panel above the saint's head is a restoration, the rounded arch shape being incorrect. A diagonal break across the panel at the level of the anchor has been repaired. There are more cracks at the level of the boat. The top of the oar and the saint's left hand are restorations.\n\nGreen paint, now darkened, and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. The gilding on the background may not be original, since it is also to be seen on the background of the restored top of the panel. Some traces of gilding and red colour remain on the figure. \n\nThe back of the panel bears two holes plugged with lead. A small area has been scooped away near the middle of the panel.",

In his right hand he holds two of his emblems, a boat and a double-ringed anchors attached to it and in his left hand he clasps an oar, another of his emblems, the top of which as been incorrectly restored. \n\nSaints are the heroes and heroines of Christian faith. In the 14th and 15th centuries, they were a popular subject for alabaster carvings. Religious themes penetrated private life, so devotional images of saints were sculpted not only for church interiors, but also for individuals to contemplate within the privacy of their homes.",
