These designs are part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest and were probably acquired by him in connection with his publications on dance design in the 20th century, although they do not appear to have been reproduced.   \n This design is for the Janitor, danced by William Dollar.\n\nHistorical significance: When Lincoln Kirstein brought George Balanchine to America with the express purpose of founding a native American ballet, there was some feeling that this should have been entrusted to an American and not a Russian.  To counter this criticisim, Kirstein set about searching for suitable American themes for Balanchine and E E Warburg evolved the idea of a ballet based around American college football.   The ballet has thus a significance in the 'Americanization' of  Balanchine, although he refused to see an actual game before choreographing the work, which may account for the less than enthusiastic reception of the ballet.  The designs by John Held Jr, the celebrated cartoonist, perfectly suited the subject and treatment of Balanchine's first excursion into the world of American popular culture and sport.",
