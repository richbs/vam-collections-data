It was made in Dublin, which was a major centre of production, but jugs of this size and shape were also produced in large English towns. \n\nThese jugs appealed to consumers because their construction was simple and they were immensely practical and useful. Almost all are engraved with the crest or coat of arms of the owner, prominently displayed, as in this example.\n\nJoseph Walker, the silversmith who made this jug, registered his mark in 1690. The Assay Office in Dublin, which was responsible for marking pure silver, received its Royal Charter in 1637. The town\u2019s mark was a winged harp.",
