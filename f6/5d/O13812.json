Between these bands are columns of red flowers on green foliage with a maroon floral spray at intervals along either side.\n\nSack back with an open front, and pleated at either side from the waist to take medium size side-hoops. The robings appear to fall from the shoulders into the skirt, making the front straight and flowing. A scalloped, pinked and pierced gathered band is stitched round the neck and down the sides of the bodice to broaden and meander down the front borders of the skirt. Attached to the neck and bodice edge and, at one time, to the top of the stomacher is a band of green and white floss silk braid. The sleeves have double frills which are decorated in similar fashion to the skirt trimming.\n\nThe stomacher is in two halves and is trimmed with a band similar to that of the skirt. The bodice is lined with linen.",
