Cheaply made, in pressed glass, they were widely available.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of press-moulding glass with the aid of a hand-operated machine was first perfected in the United States of America in the early 1820s. It took only two people to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. By simply  depressing a lever, a metal plunger was lowered into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Europe and Britain, giving rise to stylistic changes and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid- to late 19th century the first period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved quality while cutting costs even further.\n\nPeople\nAfter a joint venture with his two brothers, John Derbyshire established his own factory for pressed glass in Manchester in 1873. Under the name of John Derbyshire & Co., the Regent Road Flint Glass Works, it operated for only four years.\n\nDesign\nJohn Derbyshire registered the design of this paperweight in 1874.",
