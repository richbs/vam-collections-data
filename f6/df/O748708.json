            "history_note": "<b>Provenance:</b>\nFrom the collection of P. A. Fraser, Hospitalfield, Arbroath; purchased at sale in 1931\n\n<b>Historical significance:</b> \nFrancis Barlow (1626?-1704) is often considered to be the first professional native English book illustrator and etcher (Hodnett, 11). His major work encompasses illustrations for Edward Benlowe\u2019s <i>Theophila</i>(1562) and three series of illustrations to Aesop (<i>Aesop\u2019s Fables</i> (1666), <i>Aesopicus and Androcleus</i> (1668), <i>Life of Aesop</i> (1687)). He worked together with Wenceslaus Hollar, Francis Place, Jan Griffier Henry Faithorne and Simon Gribelin, who amongst others, etched and engraved Barlow\u2019s drawings. His work includes subjects such as political cartoons and a few portraits, but he is most well known for his depictions of wild life and sporting scenes, of which he made several book illustrations (<i>The Parly of Beasts</i> (1660), <i>Variae quadrupedum species</i> (1663), <i>Multae et Diversae Avium Species</i> (1671?), <i>Severall Wayes of Hunting, Hawking and Fishing, according to the English Manner</i> (1671) and <i>Gentleman\u2019s Recreation</i> (1686)).\n\nAnimals are the most prominent motif in Barlow's work. Innovative in this context is Barlow's interest in the natural habitat of the fauna. Although some of the animal depictions in his work are still strongly rooted in the heraldic tradition, most illustrations of wild and domestic animals, and birds in particular, are executed with almost scientific accuracy and a strong awareness for the creatures\u2019 natural environment. The many postures and angles in which he draws his characters stem from years of studying from the life (Hodnett, 179). By putting the looking glass on the animals as they live and thrive in the wild, Barlow reveals tragedies and comedies on nature's stage in his drawings.\n\n<b>Textual Reference:</b>\n\nHodnett, Edward. <i>Francis Barlow: First Master of English Book Illustration.</i>London: The Scholar Press, 1978.",
