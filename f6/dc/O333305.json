            "public_access_description": "The Ottoman empire was viewed with fear and fascination in Europe at this time.  The Habsburg Emperor, Charles VI, had fought a successful campaign against the Turks in 1716-18 and gained territories in Serbia and Hungary.  However when in 1736-39 he engaged in another Turkish War with his ally Tzarina Anna Ivanova of Russia, the imperial forces were defeated and all the previous gains were lost.  \n\nTurkish style fantasies, known by the French term 'turqueries' were popular throughout the 18th century, although this model is probably based on an engraving of a real Turkish nobleman or officer, rather than an invented Turkish-style subject.  The Meissen factory in Germany was the first to make porcelain figures of Turks in the 1740s and several models are recorded by the great Meissen modeller and sculptor, Johann Joachim Kaendler (1706-1776).  This model ties in with a work report by Kaendler's assistant Johann Friedrich Eberlein.  In May 1743 he listed a 'Turkish Officier mit einem Streit-Kolben' (Turkish officer with a mace), and although the mace is now lacking from this example, it has survived in examples in other collections.\n\nSets and pairs of porcelain figures of men and women from distant lands were made by Meissen, and other porcelain factories imitating Meissen, and were popular in mid-18th-century Europe. They were used as table decorations during the dessert courses of grand dinners.",

This model still has its original mace or club, missing from C.92-1931.\nFor another model of a Turkish officer modelled by Kaendler, given a date of c. 1748, see Len and Yvonne Adams, Meissen Portrait Figures, Barrie and Jenkins, London, 1987, p. 168. The source engraving from the series after drawings by Jean-Baptiste Vanmour for Jacques Le Hay's 'Explication Des Cent Estampes Qui Representent Differentes Nations Du Levant', printed and published by Jacques Collombat in Paris, 1714-15, is also illustrated on the same page. Kaendler's model adheres closely to the engraving, unlike C.92-1931, which although similar, may have a different source.",
