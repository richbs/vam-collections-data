Tin toys cover a vast array of subject matters ranging from the space age to domestic objects. This car was made in Japan, a prominent manufacturer in the tin toy industry. Mainly specialising in Space toys, Japan also made toys such as this car. The Japanese tin toy production industry was at its peak in the late 1960s, but the increased cost of labour and the popularity of die cast models meant that the production of tin toys declined both in quality and quantity. Toys made of plastic soon took over because it was cheaper and safer than tin.",
