This is not dated, but the photograph itself might be dateable.'  Quoted from the registered file for the Prints, Drawings and Paintings  Department, Acquisitions: purchase, 'Designs by William Harry Rogers, purchase from Robert Harding, Maggs Brothers Ltd'\n\nHistorical significance: This design is part of the W.Harry Rogers Archive and to quote the information on the archive provided by 'RW' on 6 February 1998 on the registered file 1997/1476:\n'It is extraordinarily rare to have this kind of documentation at this level  of production for the middle decades of the 19th century.  The fact the (sic) the state of the designs ranges from rough sketches to finished drawings and proofs allows the pieces to document the design process very closely.'\n\nThis photograph is of the studio of George Alfred Rogers (b.1837 - after 1909), the brother of WH Rogers.  George Alfred Rogers adopted his father's profession of wood carving.  His father was the famous wood carver William Gibbs Rogers.",
