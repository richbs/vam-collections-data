PALMER \n\nGenerally, this exhibition shows very clearly how, in Palmer\u2019s work, most careful analysis went hand in hand with most imaginative designing. If, in etching, he had tapped the great resources of his analytical knowledge and draughtsmanship, now and then (as for instance the magnificent and very ancient tree trunks of Lullingstone Park), I am inclined to think that he might have done etched work as much to Ruskin\u2019s satisfaction as the tree-drawing which Ruskin eulogises in <i>Modern Painters</i>. \nWith the public verdict of seventy-four years (although I have not seen a tenth part of it), I feel content, and more than content. It has been kindly to a very high degree, even when written by those whose sympathies were almost entirely with etching of a totally different school. It has been, so far as I know, unanimous both in the press and privately. Maybe, that some day Mr. Rossetti\u2019s prophecy will be fulfilled \u2013 namely, that the realistic side of Palmer\u2019s art \u201con which he touches the many,\u201d will cause his work to grow in influence. \nOne of the objects of this exhibition was to demonstrate that the purely realistic and analytical side of that art was, from the very first, closely allied with the purely imaginative \u2013 that he continually turned from one to the other \u2013 thus vindicating Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s words: \u201cIt will be found that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\u201d \nIn all Palmer\u2019s art-teaching, or in the examples he made for his pupils\u2019 use, there was not one attempt to inoculate them with those artistic ideals by which, if his name goes down to posterity, he will be known. But there was a ceaseless effort to emphasize the importance of that universally unpopular pair, \u201cElements and Accuracy.\u201d \nAlthough my father once wrote that the destruction of an etched plate seemed to him like \u201cthe murder of a mind,\u201d I have followed the best advice in Europe most generously given at the cost of much time and trouble, and all the plates in my possession have been finally cancelled by one of the usual methods. This is a fate far more merciful than that they should have been ultimately sold and condemned to the lingering death and dishonour which has befallen plates by illustrious hands. \nThree eminent artists and etchers have, out of regard for Samuel Palmer\u2019s work and memory, done that memory the honour to attend to the plates\u2019 obsequies. They have done this even to printing some of the final impressions with their own hands. In the whole of my father\u2019s life there was no such incident as this. The devotion of the \u201cAncients\u201d to each other was as nothing to it. For brevity\u2019s sake I gave to the three artists the name of \u201cThe Trio.\u201d When any future collector sees the little equilateral triangle which symbolizes the three etchers (and also their initials F. S., F. L. G. and M.H.,) on the margin of an etching by their fellow craftsman, he will know that of all the kindly things which have been written and done in connection with Samuel Palmer and his work, none approaches theirs.\n\n[\u2026] \n\nADDITIONAL NOTES. \n\n<i>General Note on the Etchings</i>. \u2013 Although some of the best impressions of his etchings were sold or given away by Samuel Palmer, nearly all those which I have contributed to this Exhibition were, for various reasons, among his especial treasures. They also represent many days of intense agony and \u201cgrated consciousness\u201d by the side of the inanimate and animate machines which he had to deal with. Of the various states I myself know little. For that knowledge \u201cThe Trio\u201d must be consulted. \u2013 A.H.P.'\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>. London : Published under the authority of the Board of Education, 1926. Publication No. 178 E.I.D. pp.75-76.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'CHRISTMAS \n\nCatalogue, nos. 169-175 \n\nThe contrast between moonlight and rushlight or candle in the \"primitive cottage\" or with a forge was a favourite with the etcher. Another example will be found in this exhibition (No.113 [an object that was lent for the exhibition by Martin Hardie, Esp., R.I., R.E.]). \nIt was with this plate that I made my first attempt in artificial printing, when Goulding was teaching me at the Furze Hill private press. We had got over the first stages of the printer's art very quickly the same day. It now came to a matter of \"hands;\" and, more especially, to those very things which my father had been endeavouring to teach me for years. In the first case, entomology had taught me lightness of touch beyond anything needed in printing. Goulding printed a proof showing the full benefits of what he then called <i>retroussage</i>, and cleaned the margin. He then stood back and said nothing more. His teaching had been so absolutely clear all along, so admirably worded, and so kind, that I practically reproduced his proof. This was the foundation laid on which my father at once began to build; the troubles of nearly a quarter of a century later were over. \n\nI do not think that the possession of \"the palm of a duchess\" has much to do with successful printing, surgery, horology, or other delicate manipulations. To skin a Golden-Crested Wren, or to pin and set a specimen of the Tineid\u00e6 Family, is a far more severe test than the <i>retroussage</i> of an etching. Surely it was Goulding's wonderful quickness and power of assimilation of the teaching of such a man as Sir Francis Seymour Hayden and others, backed by the absence of all prejudice and pride (if absence can back a thing) that turned his prehensile hands to such wonderful account. Samuel Palmer's hands were small and delicate, but they were not naturally prehensile. He would never have been a good pistol-shot or fly-fisher. \n\nSome malignant spirit prompted the photographer who took Goulding's portrait in Mr. Hardie's <i>Life</i> [<i>Frederick Goulding, Master Printer of Copper Plates</i>, 1910.] to conceal that wonderful right hand which so many of us watched at its magic. He should have been shown holding the <i>filthy</i> canvas with which so much could be done; or the filmy muslin with which he made so many reputations that the following words appeared in the notice of his death in <i>The Times</i>:- \n\n\"His quickness in seizing the artist's idea was only equalled by his power of getting the best possible effects out of the plates by the younger artists who needed guidance. Many an exhibition of the Royal Society of Painter Etchers and Engravers has been, from one point of view, almost a 'one man show' by Frederick Goulding.\" \n\nIn the place of the vainglory of a Master Craftsman was avidity to learn, great generosity in teaching all he could, and a natural dignity which none could affront with impunity. So we find the rich, masterful and superlatively brilliant autocrat who tore the poor old Etching Club limb from limb, writing to Goulding in terms of affection, equality, and respect.'\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1926</u>, London: Board of Education, 1927.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'PALMER, Samuel (1805-1881).</B>\n\nChristmas.\nFinal state.
