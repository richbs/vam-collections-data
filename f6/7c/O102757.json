Her career proves that talent alone is no guarantee of immortality; a performer also needs the luck to be born at the right time. As her talents matured in the 1850s, ballet was no longer as popular nor as fashionable as it had been in the great days of Taglioni, Elssler and Grisi in the previous decade. So, while they are remembered and immortalised in much sought-after lithographs, Rosati is almost forgotten.  \nRosati excelled in quick, precise movements, a difficult style to capture in a still image, but prints give some idea of her considerable spirit and vivacious elegance. They suggest why she was, at the time and for a long time afterwards, the highest paid dancer ever at the Paris Opera.",
