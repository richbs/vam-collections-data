He painted on panel and in fresco and his mature works are characterised by bold and sometimes acidic colours in pink, green and yellow which later give way to a greater interest in dramatic contrasts of light and shade.  His figures demonstrate a natural or exaggerated grace in their poses and often contrast the smooth brilliance of the naked limbs with the intense colour, sinuous folds and decorative line of their draperies.

It seems likely that he also visited Florence at some date before 1512, but there is no documentary evidence for this early period nor are there any certain paintings before 1513. Except for a visit to Genoa and Pisa c. 1541, he spent the rest of his life in Siena. \n     Beccafumi's style appears to have been formed under the influence of the great Florentine painters of the early 16th century, in particular Fra Bartolommeo, Piero di Cosimo, Leonardo and Michelangelo, and also of Raphael. But his vision was highly personal and he ranks as one of the greatest of the early Mannerists as well as the last major representative of the Sienese school.\n \n<i>Lit.</i> J. Judey, <i>Domenico Beccafumi</i>, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1932; M. Gibellino-Krasceninnicowa, <i>Il Beccafumi</i>, Siena, 1933; D. Sanminiatelli, <i>Domenico Beccafumi</i>, Milan, 1967. \n\n\n18 \nCHARITY SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN \nPLAYING WITH DOGS AND HOBBY \nHORSES \n<i>Panel, square; painting circular</i> \nDiam. 15 (38) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.165 \n\nThe ascription to Beccafumi has never been disputed but the question of the picture's date has been controversial. Venturi (1932) dated it late in the artist's life, Gibellino-Krasceninnicowa (1933) connected it with the Genoese works and assigned it to 1541, whereas John Pope-Hennessy drew attention to the stylistic similarities with the Nativity in San Martino, Siena, and placed it in the middle '20s. This date was accepted by Luisa Becherucci (1944) and by Sanminiatelli (1967), who compared the painting with <i>The Continence of Scipio</i> at Lucca and a tondo of the Virgin and Child with saints in Mexico. \n     Pope-Hennessy suggested that the figure of Charity is derived from similar figures by Quercia and Francesco da Valdambrino on the Ponte Gaia in Siena, though he points out that she is also similar to Raphael's Madonnas. E. Wind (<i>J. W. C. I.</i>, i, 1937-38, p. 322 f.) has shown that this conception of Charity was invented by Michelangelo, adapted and sweetened by Raphael and then used by artists throughout Italy and the rest of Europe.\n\n<i>Condition.</i> Panel repaired. \n<i>Prov.</i> Probably in the Samuel Woodburn Collection, sold at Christie's, 25 June 1853, lot 95 'Beccafumi.

His figures demonstrate a natural or exaggerated grace in their poses and often contrast the smooth brilliance of the naked limbs with the intense colour, sinuous folds and decorative line of their draperies. In addition to his paintings and sculptures, Beccafumi made innovative oil-sketches, experimented inventively with copper-plate engraving and woodcuts which he sometimes superimposed to create various different effects and developed a new technique of marble inlay or <i>intarsia</i> for the pavement of Siena Cathedral. He became Siena's primary artist, receiving the most prestigious civic, ecclesiastical and private commissions and ultimately transformed the city with his personal interpretation of the <i>maniera</i> style. \n\nCAI.165 has been cut down and probably originally formed part of a piece of painted furniture.
