The villa is in the Hodkovicky area of the city, which Fric had commissioned in 1934 from the architect Ladislav Zak (1900-1973) who worked both on the exterior and interior design. Thanks to the uncompromising and firm hand of  Fric's widow, who had passed away on several months prior to Othova's visit, the house's original interior had been almost completely preserved.",
