Above this is a deeper border in which a small scene is repeated: there is a fine gold arch or niche around a circular motif edged with metal thread.  this is embroidered with green silk but might be a pond or flower bed around which grow some branches and a blue weeping willow. To one side of this is a building with three levels, the lowest one is blue and the upper two are pink and the roof is domed.  To the other side of the niche are pink blossoms.",

The colours of 18th and 19th century embroideries were originally very bright but many have faded to pleasing pastel shades; often great quantities of metal thread were used. Napkins were mainly used to clean fingers during meals, but were also used as decoration and as covers. Their designs were consistently inventive.",
