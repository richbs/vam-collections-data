The installation was created in a workshop in Tehran specifically for display at the Victoria and Albert Museum for the opening of the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art in July 2006.\n\nThe primary technique employed was mirror mosaic (ayinah-kari), by which pieces of silvered glass are cut to shape and set in a plaster matrix according to a predetermined design. The result is a patterned mirror surface. This technique has been in continuous use in Iran since silvered glass mirrors were first imported in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nSince the 1970s, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian has been using this technique to make works based on the Islamic tradition of geometric ornament. Her work is not a pastiche, however, but a creative response to her country's artistic traditions. \n\nThe geometric patterns she uses come from outside traditional mirror work, and she combines the mirror with other material, such as reversed-painted glass. In the case of the V&A panel, she has used blue glass beads that are a traditional talisman against the evil eye to create a pattern suggestive of peacock feathers.",
