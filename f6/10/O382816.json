There are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian, and each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  Ring brooches differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  \n  \nA glibbs\u00f8lje is a ring brooch decorated with six faces, usually human but occasionally animal.  It is a variant of the spores\u00f8lje, which is a ring brooch with projections round the outside.  They are usually made of cast metal, and were most popular in the south west of Norway, though they are found as far north as Lapland.  Both men and women wore them.\n\nThis brooch has the letters K T D D inscribed on the back in a cursive script, which may be the owner\u2019s initials.  Norwegians often inscribed their names or initials on the back of their brooches.  It was described as Swedish, from the 17th century, when it was acquired in 1923, but the shape is unique to Norway.  It was formerly in the Wimborne Collection.",
