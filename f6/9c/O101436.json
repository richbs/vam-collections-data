His early work reflects the style of the artist and illustrator Charles Rickets (1866-1931). During the early twentieth century Philpot became popular as a portrait artist. Always concerned that his style would become stale he chose different poses and techniques for these portraits. Constantly dissatisfied with his work, Philpot travelled to different places including Paris, North Africa and Venice. The portraits that Philpot is best known for present a cross-section of the early twentieth century, from his portraits of admirals during the First World War to the portraits of dancers from the Ballet Russes in the 1920s. \n\nThis study is of a male nude torso, from the neck down to the waist. The figure is shown standing with their hands behind thier back. Philpot has used the soft texture of the charcoal in varrying thickness of line to outline the contours of the body.",
