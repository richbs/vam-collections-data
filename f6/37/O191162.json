            "public_access_description": "The publishing activity of Solidarity was very broad. A wide range of posters, postcards, stamps, leaflets and other ephemera were printed. Among them calendars were very popular, probably because they provided an opportunity to commemorate various political events and anniversaries. On this calendar crucial dates relating to Polish national identity and the history of Solidarity in are marked by a Polish flag. \n\nAt the same time the calendar serves as a poster recalling a particular moment - the rise of \u2018Fighting Solidarity\u2019, when Solidarity became an underground movement after the proclamation of Martial Law in December 1981. The calendar-poster features a photograph taken at a demonstration. The banner in the photograph expresses a demand for the dismissal of General Wojciech Jaruzelski, the leader of the Polish Communist Party who was responsible for the proclamation of Martial Law. The calendar was issued by the Factory Group of \u2018Fighting Solidarity\u2019 of the Metropolitan Transport Enterprise in Wroclaw. It\u2019s a good example of the decentralized publishing activity that was typical for Solidarity.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
