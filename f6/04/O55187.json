The arms appear to have been added after the chair was made, as they are not carved in the same way and have an abrupt joint with the chair-back. The narrow seat is another indication that it was not originally intended as an armchair. The upholstery is of modern green wool.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe distinctive feature of the this chair is the carving of a single bullrush and leaves which intertwine to form the chair-back. The carving is unusually naturalistic for a chair of this period. The maker might have taken inspiration from Thomas Chippendale's design for a garden chair, which incorporates bullrushes and gardening tools. However, we do not know the maker or the original owner. Natural features such as leaves sometimes indicate that furniture was intended either for a garden building or for a room with garden views. The 'cabriole' or curving legs are also carved with bullrush leaves, while the back legs have club feet.",
