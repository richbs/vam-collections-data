The fabric is wrapped round the edges of the card to form a small border on the inside face of the folio, loosely tacked into place at the corners. An inner hinge has been created with a strip of roller-printed dress fabric with a pattern of purple wavy lines. There are traces of a purple silk ribbon tie at the four centre points of the inner edges. No visible selvedges.",
