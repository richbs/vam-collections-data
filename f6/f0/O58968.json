            "public_access_description": "Jean-Henri Naderman (also spelt 'Nadermann') was born in Fribourg , Switzerland, in 1735 and died in Paris in 1799. In 1778 he was appointed facteur de l' harpe ordinaire or harpmaker in ordinary, to Queen Marie-Antoinette of France (1755 - 1793). The queen played the harp and helped make it hightly fashionable in the salons in Paris, which would help explain why there were as many as fifty-eight teachers of the harp in Paris by 1784. In such surroundings, lavishly decorated examples like this one would have been highly appropriate and desirable. This instrument is fitted with crochettes, right-angled hooks, which were operated by foot-pedals and raised the pitch of each string by one semi-tone, a popular device during this period.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
