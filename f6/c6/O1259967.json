An estate and an old house on the edge of the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire provided accommodation, office and rehearsal space for an acting company of seven, as well as a home for the family of John Crockett, who was a fine artist and dancer, as well as an actor and director.\n\nThe company was dedicated to producing a repertoire of classics, and these included Doctor Faustus,Milton's masque Comus, plays by Shaw, Synge, Chekhov, Moliere and Christopher Fry, and versions of The Pardoner's Tale from The Canterbury Tales and of Jonah and the Whale - both adapted by John Crockett.\n\nThe Compass Players appeared in village halls, miner's institutes and schools across Britain, usually performing a school's matinee and an evening show each day. Cast and equipment travelled in a converted laundry van. The entire company acted, stage managed, lit the show, maintained the costumes and stage properties and put up the set.  \n\nJohn Crockett designed all the masks for Doctor Faustus, creating moulds based on the actors' faces. All available members of the company were recruited to make the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and the finished masks were then painted by John Crockett. Joyce Allan played Lechery. Armine Sandford, who acted and served as the company's wardrobe mistress, recalled that 'Joyce's own hair was visible behind the mask for Lechery whose face was deadly pale - one eye closed in a lascivious wink. For the other, John had used a huge amber glass eye which had fallen out of a rather battered leopard skin I had once brought back from Exeter' (Plays Without Theatres: Recollections of The Compass Players Travelling Theatre 1944-1952).",
