The arch itself is delineated with a composite line of small reciprocal trefoils, a narrow band of pulled thread both either side of lozenges of straight stitch triangles [so forming a zigzag line].  A small pendant 'square' form underneath the arch apex is framed with pulled thread in a basket-weave pattern may be where the mohr tablet is placed; beneath this two rows of small lozenges [representing the rosary] followed by a repeat pointed arch form with a pendant lozenge form in pulled thread and straight stitch, with a stylized plant/vase motif either side - a motif repeated below the pendant lozenge, and above an incomplete geometric form [an octagon?].\nThis central area is framed by a composite border on 3 sides of:\n[a] a row of small reciprocal trefoils in straight stitch\n[b] a line of patterned hexagons in straight stitch\n[c] a wide band of straight stitch and pulled thread octagons with the remaining triangular spaces filled with stepped rectangles in straight stitch\n[d] as [b]\n[e] a ribbon meander in straight stitch.\n\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\n\nBacking: machine woven plain weave cream cotton.\nFacing: bias-cut; block printed, incomplete pattern: plain weave cotton, white ground with a thin black stem bearing blue/green leaves and feathery flowerheads in red and blue.",
