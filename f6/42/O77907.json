But in addition, a matching pedestal was also available, doubling its height.  As a container, it ideally served the late Victorian interest in exoticism - such as dried pampas grass, peacock feathers and similar outsized decorations.  Like all of Dresser's designs for mass production, this vase was made in different glaze colours.  Although this example fits the reform notion of clean and functional form,  Ault's Pottery also made and marketed it with printed decoration of floral patterning in Art Nouveau style and naturalistic painting of chrysanthemums or dahlias.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDresser is often described as the 'father of the modern movement' and this vase form, based on the sphere and right angle, does indeed appear to preclude 20th-century Modernism. But, as is well established, his appreciation of spare, clean shapes, derives from his interest in Japanese forms and his profound understanding of manufacturing processes. This vase was made at William Ault's pottery at Swadlincote, near Burton-on-Trent in Derbyshire, was designed between 1892 and 1896. However, Dresser's earlier designs for the Linthorpe pottery, and for the metalwork companies with which he also had contracts throughout his career, are a similar play on geometric forms assembled in a wide variety of vases, jugs, candlesticks and other vessels.\n\nPlace\nThis vase was made by the Ault Pottery, at Swadlincote, Derbyshire, owned by William Ault who first met Dresser in 1883.",
