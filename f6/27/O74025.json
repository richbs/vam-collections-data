The design, of a trellis pattern with celestial winged figures in lobed medallions, is not printed but hand-drawn, and meticulously reists-dyed and mordant dyed. \nThe hanging was previously attributed to the northern Deccan, possibly Burhanpur, but the use of this very specific resist and mordanting technique suggests that it was in fact made in the area known as the Coromandel Coast in today's Andhra Pradesh. The presence of some motifs that also occur on chintz textiles exported to Thailand from that area strengthens this attribution.",
