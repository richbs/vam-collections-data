He soon developed his own style which characteristic features are the monumentality and the self-assured poses of many of his portraits. This painting is a good example of his early career when he was still influenced by the stylistic sobriety of his master Nicolaes Eliasz. Pickenoy (1588-1654/56). He gradually developed a more colourful ambience and devoted an extensive attention to details especially in the rendering of precious fabrics and costumes\u2019 ornaments.",

            "historical_context_note": "This painting shows a gentleman dressed in black as fashion required in Holland during mid 17th century. The identity of the sitter remains unknown but he was most certainly one of the Burgomasters of the city of Amsterdam where Helst achieved considerable success as a portrait painter. The placement of the sitter in a three-quarter pose to the left suggests that it may have been originally provided with a pendant. \n\nThe very dark background and the sobriety of the palette indicate that the portrait belongs to the relatively early career of the painter. It shares with such portraits as \u2018Portrait of a Man\u2019 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MMA73.71) and the \u2018Portrait of a Man holding a Glove\u2019 in the National Gallery (NG4691) the same characteristic smooth handling of the brush, especially in the delicate rendering of the fabric and lace. The present work can therefore be dated from mid to late 1640s. \n\nThis decade appears as a turning point in Van der Helst\u2019s career. Following a prestigious commission in 1642, Helst started to receive an increasing number of commissions for individual portraits. From a stylistic point of view, his early style is characterised by the influence of Rembrandt\u2019s examples of the 1630s and 1640s while the self-assured pose of his sitters were to become a characteristic feature of his work.\n\nHelst later developed a greater attention to ornaments and precious fabrics in a more colourful palette. Helst\u2019s ability and technical perfection was most sought after by prominent people in and outside Amsterdam. His work presents a perfect picture of Holland\u2019s regent culture during the Golden Age.\n\nBeside portraits, Helst also painted genre pieces, a few biblical episodes and various mythological scenes.",
