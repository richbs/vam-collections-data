            "public_access_description": "The west window at Fairford Church in Gloucestershire contains a masterful depiction of the Last Judgement. This theme had a very long history in medieval art in Europe. The elements portrayed are primarily taken from Revelation (the Apocalypse), the last book of the New Testament.\n\nThe angel here forms part of the company of heaven, surrounding the central image of Christ the Judge. These are the angels that hold the Instruments of the Passion of Christ - those items associated with his Crucifixion such as the lance, sponge and Crown of Thorns - as well as objects linked with the Day of Judgement. This angel might be holding a book.\n\nThe windows at Fairford Church were created by Netherlandish artists working in England. Since the time of Henry VI (reigned 1422-61 and 1470-1), stained glass workers in England had petitioned the crown in an attempt to prevent foreign craftsmen from infringing on their profession. Their attempts were largely unsuccessful, but the king did prohibit the importation of completed windows. Foreigners therefore had to set up their workshops in England, and probably had to rely on Englishmen for their workforce.",

King & Son workshop in Norwich is not known. The panels (C.12 & 13-2004)  were found during the clearance of the King workshop in October 2003 and were sold to George Wigley.\n\nThe great west window and those on other side were severely damaged in a storm that occured 26-27 November 1703.\n\nIt is likely that this panel was removed from its original position in the 1860s during Sebastian Evans' (working for Chance Bros of Smethwick) restoration work.\n\nIt is possible that this panel came from window w.I (CVMA numbering) / window 15 (19th century numbering). This is the great West window depicting the Last Judgement. Chance Bros. carried out extensive restoration work on this window. They removed much of what was left of the original glass and replaced it with their own reproductions. \n\nThe angel here bears a strong resemblance to that inserted by Chance in the upper register of the main lights - light one, angel at the base.\n\nHistorical significance: The glass from Fairford Church along with that at King's College Cambridge are major surviving ensembles of what is termed the 'Anglo-Netherlandish school of glass painting.",
