He was billed as \u2018the Popular Quaint Comedian of \u201cI never let it upset me\u201d fame\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAlf Gibson (1860\u20131920) was well known for his Yorkshire dialect. He also did an act billed as \u2018The Comedian who Never Moves\u2019. Like his contemporary, the performer Sam Mayo, who was known as \u2018The Immobile One\u2019, Gibson specialised in standing motionless on the stage for periods of time. He managed to maintain a deadpan expression. The tradition of the lugubrious comedian has continued in stand-up and television comedy. The art of standing still is practised by street performers, such as those in Covent Garden in London and Las Ramblas in Barcelona.",
