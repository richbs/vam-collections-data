Fuchsias was performed throughout the four-week season in variety at the London Coliseum. It was a short ballet probably arranged by Tamara Karsavina to the Waltz Opus 47 by Glazounov. \n\nThe annotations in the design indicate Claude Lovat Fraser\u2019s very specific requirements for the realisation of the costumes to be made by costumiers, Alias, London.\n\nAccounts for this production apperars in a number of publications. Karsarvina\u2019s Art. Contrasts at the Coliseum, The Times 5 July 1921 p.8., claimed that \u2018the dresses alone are well worth one or more visits to the Coliseum\u2019 referring to \u2018the charming red and purple dresses and the short red gloves of the ballet in a fuschia dance\u2019. \n.\nIn a letter of 15 January 1921 Claud Lovat Fraser writes to Bruce \u2018What Stoll wants\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018Stoll and Stalls\u2019 \u2013 all pink chiffon and tulle against their \u2018garden set\u2019. Although Fuschias was performed against the stylish \u2018luminous blue curtains, with one straight pillar of dark shade in the centre\u2019 (Observer 17 July 1921 p.5) it seems possible that in this ballet miniature Karsavina and Fraser may have been fulfilling Stoll\u2019s wish.",
