The elaborate embroidery of this edging is particularly remarkable in comparison with the incredibly delicate green silk ground fabric, which has perished in many places, partly because of the weight of the embroidered borders.  This style of bodice, with a halter neck, is called an angia, and this example was acquired as part of the so-called 'Queen of Oudh's costume'.  This was actually more likely to have been worn by a young dancer than a noblewoman of Avadh, known to the British as Oudh.  It was worn with a long, diaphanous over-shirt, a large veil covering the head and upper body and wide-legged trousers.",
