Turner take credit for establishing landscape as a suitable theme for oil painting. Until then, history paintings had been considered more important, but increasingly naturalistic oil paintings of picturesque views of the British landscape appealed to a wider section of the art-buying public.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe scene is the falls of the River Tummel, near Pitlochry in Scotland. The Pass of Killicrankie is in the background, while the promontory on the left is 'The Giant's Steps.' The image of a stream flowing through a mountainous landscape was a favourite of the artist, and is indeed one of the most commonly represented in Victorian landscapes.\n\nPeople\nThomas Creswick (1811-1869) was a native of Sheffield but settled in London in 1828. He exhibited 139 works at the Royal Academy, which were mostly landscapes and coastal scenes.

Studied art with the landscape painter John Vincent Barber in Birmingham, and settled in London 1828. Exhibited 139 works at the RA between 1828 and 1870, 80 at the BI 1828-55, and 46 at the SBA 1829-38. Early landscapes were principally in Wales, Yorkshire and Cornwall, then Ireland (after a visit in 1837), and coastal scenes after 1848. An early member of the Etching Club, many of his works were engraved. Commissioned 1851 to paint an extensive series of views in north Wales. Elected ARA 1842, RA 1851. Admired particularly in the later 1840s and 1850s for his truth to nature and the charm of his compositions; later works were criticised for being too dark and brown in tone. Occasionally worked in collaboration with other artists such as Richard Ansdell and W P Frith. Died Bayswater, London, 28 December 1869; his studio sale was at Christie's 6-7 May 1870. The <i>Illustrated London News</i> obituarist wrote that his life and work were 'comparatively monotonous and devoid of incident'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp141-4, 1870, p53 (obit); <i>The Graphic</i> 8 January 1870, pp121-2 (obit with engr portrait); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 8 January 1870, p53 (obit with engr portrait); C Collins Baker 'Thomas Creswick RA and Mid-Victorian Landscape Painters' <i>Art Journal</i> 1908, pp104-7 \n\n<b>Scene on the Tummel, Perthshire</b> \nFA61 Neg FF13lO \nCanvas, 91.5 x 71.1 cm (36 x 28 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1844. The well-known view is of the falls of the River Tummel, near Pitlochry. The Pass of Killicrankie is in the background, while the promontory on the left is the 'Giant's Steps'. This is a characteristic example of a favourite theme of the artist - a stream flowing through hilly landscape. Creswick specialised in such scenes in north Wales, the north of England, and Scotland. The <i>Art Union</i> critic wrote that 'the objects take their places in the composition with a more agreeable ease than in many of the painter's more imposing works'. \n\nEXH: RA 1844 (344) \n\nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1844, p161\"",
