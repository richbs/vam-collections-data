The original design for the case was made by Sir Edwyn Lutyens (1869-1944) for an 'oak drawing room in the Jacobean style' in the British Pavilion at the Paris Exhibition of 1900. Lutyens described the task of designing the piano as 'awfully difficult'. Between September 1903 and July 1907, John Broadwood  & Sons produced a total of ten of these 'Drawing-Room Grands', as they called them, and priced them at 350 guineas (\u00a3375.50p) each. This example was completed by February 1907.",
