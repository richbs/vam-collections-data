This base has a small vertical edge and then slopes on each face towards a secondary base also with a narrow vertical edge forming a plinth for a narrow intermediary supporting element which is straight on back and sides but bears ten flutes on the front. This supports a projecting rectangular plate with straight edges on top of which rests the main body of the piece formed as a rectangular box of panelled construction at the sides, plain back in two panels and two doors in the front. The framework at the sides and front has four stepped mouldings of diminishing width. The doors are plain but bear in the centre complimentary right and left silver handles which fit together to appear as a single central plate. Each handle has a notched outer upper corner below which is a projecting rectangular box cut out at the outer side and bottom to provide a grip. Bands of fluting decorate the outer vertical edges of the plates and the centre of the projecting handles. Each plate bears a keyhole towards the centre which is flanked by a further band of vertical fluting and by mouldings. These mouldings are stepped to form a shallow ziggurat at the top. The plates are secured by brass bolts. The missing lock on the right hand door originally shot towards the top and bottom of the framework. The right hand door bears on its edge a dust-excluding  curved projection which fits into a corresponding groove on the left door. The interior is plain with two panels at the back and a single full-length glass shelf supported on brass brackets.",
