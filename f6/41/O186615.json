Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  This earring is made of silver, gilded at the back, set with glass pastes.  The stones round the central stone at the top, and in the three drops, are backed with foil.  This was intended to make them look like gems, but the foil has decayed, leaving them pale and lifeless.\n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  One of the most popular designs was the girandole, with three drops hanging from a central boss.  This 17th century pattern survived until the end of the 19th century with traditional costume in Italy.  This earring comes from Lazio, but similar patterns were found throughout central and northern Italy in the 19th century.  The original owner of this earring would probably have worn a long matching pendant as well.\n\nThis earring was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
