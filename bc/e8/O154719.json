Erwin Panofsky was the first to explain the significance of the figure, noting its relationship of the iconography of Titian's \"Allegory of Prudence\". Oddly however, in this rendering there seems no allusion to the virtue of Prudence relying on knowing the past, the present and the future. \nThe three faces seem to have similar features and there is no obvious difference in their ages. There is, however, something rather reminiscent of contemporary representations of Christ in the half-closed eyes and slightly forked beard of the central figure that could lead one to speculate on possible associations between the \"trifrons\" Prudence and the Christian concept of the tripartite Holy Trinity. \nAs there is no trace of such a connection in the sources or commentaries of the period, however, it seems that any interpretation based on this possible association would be ill-founded.",

Erwin Panofsky was the first to explain the significance of the figure, noting its relationship of the iconography of Titian's \"Allegory of Prudence\". Oddly however, in this rendering there seems no allusion to the virtue of Prudence relying on knowing the past, the present and the future. The three faces seem to have similar features and there is no obvious difference in their ages. There is, however, something rather reminiscent of contemporary representations of Christ in the half-closed eyes and slightly forked beard of the central figure that could lead one to speculate on possible associations between the \"trifrons\" Prudence and the Christian concept of the tripartite Holy Trinity. As there is no trace of such a connection in the sources or commentaries of the period, however, it seems that any interpretation based on this possible association would be ill-founded.",

Maclagan and Longhurst (p. 40) point out that the relief has some stylistic connection with the work of Antonio Rossellino. The handling is reminsicent of the Desiderio workshop, and the relief was probably produced by a member of the Desiderio studio active about 1460.",
