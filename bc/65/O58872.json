James Gamble (1837 - 1911), who was responsible for much of the decoration of the museum between 1866 and 1889,  designed the case of this piano, and his motifs include early musical instruments that had been acquired for the Museum under Cole's directorship. This instrument was exhibited at the International Exhibition held in London in 1871.",
