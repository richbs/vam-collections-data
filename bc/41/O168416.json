Upper: incomplete; max. 18 cms. plain weave in bands: dark brown, red, light brown, red, light brown, dark brown (in which there is evidence of small white geometric motifs) followed by bands of light brown, red, dark blue, red, dark brown.\n\nDESIGN: Field: blue ground with a narrow band in dark blue at lower end.  There are two large red zoomorphic medallions with 'legs', each containing in the centre a row of 4 joined lozenges, apparently in a container from which a small tree grows towards the centre of the carpet.  There are small geometric and floral motifs elsewhere in the medallion.  In the centre of the field is a smaller blue medallion outlined irregularly in light red and within it, similarly outlined, is a purple/brown shape containing an 8-pointed star surrounded by small quartered red hexagons and angular leaves.  Part of this medallion is repeated in the lower and upper edges of the field but with a red ground within and leaves and blossom-like hexagons.  The edge of the field has a small reciprocal trefoil pattern with a red outer edge and within this, on all 4 sides, are broad hooked X-motifs reduced to half their full shape ath the bottom edge.  The field elsewhere contains small plant and geometric motifs.\n\nMain border: purple/brown ground with a double meander mostly in light red and purple/brown blocks enclosing pairs of red and blue angular S-motifs, stylised red or blue rosettes and large octagons quartered and re-quartered.  Inner border: purple/bbrown ground with a row of small quartered diamonds (red and blue) and above and below each diamond 2 halves of a gul motif in red, white and blue.\nouter border: light red ground with rectangles divided diagonally in light red and alternating with an upright 'hash-like' motif in purple/brown.\n\nDate catalogued 24.4.96",
