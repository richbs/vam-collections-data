His company produced high-quality furniture, including some key masterpieces, but Chippendale's outstanding skill was in design. His pattern-book The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director went through three editions in the 1750s and 60s and inspired trade catalogues and pattern-books from fellow designers. Usually produced by architects, a large, elegant pattern-book was an ambitious project for a craftsman at this time. The Director showed the full range of furniture available in the eighteenth century, and the range of styles that were fashionable. Chippendale created a trademark fusion of rococo style with Chinese and gothic elements, which was the basis of 'English' rococo. His style influenced furniture design in contemporary Europe and colonial America, and had a marked Victorian revival in England. The Director designs were the main source for Chippendale's high reputation until his furniture was first identified in 1906.",

They were bought from a descendant, George Lock, and had been exhibited by him at the International Exhibition held at South Kensington in 1862. The mixed nature of this Lock and Chippendale material has helped to fuel the idea that the two collaborated professionally. It has even been suggested that Lock \u2018ghost\u2019 designed for Chippendale, but it now seems more likely that he provided piece-work carving for Chippendale\u2019s larger projects.",
