Perfume test cards - which are sprayed with a sample for customers to take away - are often used by retailers as a promotional tool. This one advertises Jil Sander, a fragrance licensed by the German fashion label of the same name, owned by Prada.\n\nMiuccia Prada inherited her grandfather's luggage business in the 1970s and by the 1990s she had redefined the image of Italian fashion with her signature use of innovative fabrics. Prada experimented with 1970s furnishing fabrics in unusual colours and patterning while continuing to sell the company's trademark black nylon handbag range. The label now makes clothing in addition to bags and accessories.",
