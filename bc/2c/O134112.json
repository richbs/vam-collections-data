He settled in Rome around 1710 and joined the Netherlandish confraternity of painters working there, the Schildersbent, from whom he received the nickname 'Studio' for his attention to details. He specialised with success in 'vedute' paintings and Italianate landscapes. \n\nAlthough the buildings are difficult to identify, the subject matter of this painting is generally accepted as a view of Tivoli, a small city near Rome. This work is a typical example of van Lint's prolific output of vedute and Italianate landscapes executed in Rome and its surroundings reminiscent of the art of Claude Lorrain.",

Van Lint painted a number of Italian views of this type: closely related in style and subject matter are a <i>Landscape with an Italian Hill Town</i> in The National Gallery, London and a <i>View of Caprarola</i>, previously in Finarte, Rome. Although it does not seem possible to identify any of the buildings, the traditional identification of the painting as a view of Tivoli is plausible.",

            "historical_context_note": "Dutch and Flemish painters active in Rome between the early 17th and early 18th centuries produced numerous Italianate landscapes representing pastoral subjects bathed in warm southern light, in an Italian, or specifically Roman, setting. At Rome towards the end of the 17th century, Jacob de Heusch (1656-1701), Hendrik Frans van Lint (1684-1763), Jan Frans van Bloemen and, above all, Gaspar van Wittel (Vanvitelli), laid the foundations of a local school of <i>vedutisti</i>. The term <i>veduta</i> ('view' in Italian) signifies a landscape or town view that is largely topographical in conception. Famous Italian exponents of the genre include Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) and Antonio Canaletto (1697-1768). An Italianate landscape style indebted to Claude was perpetuated by an international coterie of artists including Carlo Labruzzi (1748-1817), Jacob More (1740-1793), Nicolas-Didier Boguet (1755-1839), Jacob Philipp Hackert (1737-1807), Georg von Dillis (1759-1841) and Franz Kobell (1749-1822). John Constable (1776-1837) was critical of the genre and by the late 19th century Italianate landscapes had lost favour through the rise of Realism and Impressionism.",
