Holy Communion is the service that re-enacts the sharing of bread and wine at the Last Supper of Christ. The footed paten can be turned upside down to act as a cover to the cup.\n\nHistory & Design\nAfter Henry VIII's break with the Church of Rome in 1534 and the establishment of the Church of England, liturgical silver developed new forms to signal the move away from Roman Catholic traditions. The communion cup now resembled large domestic cups to clearly demonstrate, on a symbolic and practical level, that the consecrated wine was for the congregation as well as for the priest. Instructions for the change in design came from the Archbishop of Canterbury, and were relayed to local goldsmiths by the Goldsmiths' Company. This cup was re-fashioned in Exeter from an earlier communion cup.\n\nOrnament\nAs sacred imagery was considered 'superstitious' in the Church of England, other forms of ornament were introduced. In this example the scrolling foliage engraved within cross-hatched strapwork is characteristic of the Renaissance ornament that had recently been introduced into England from Continental Europe.",
