Born in Leicester, where he attended the School of Art 1909-13; he went on to study and later to teach at the Royal College of Art. He was also an official war artist  in World War II. He was highly skilled draughtsman best known for his exquisite etchings and engravings, mostly of animals, birds and plants, domestic scenes, figure subjects (often religious), and also landscapes. \n\nThis is one from a gift of 50 prints - mostly etchings - which cover the whole range of Austin's subject matter. Many of the prints are annotated by Austin himself, and several are proofs, or early states. The prints are works of art in their own right, but also offer valuable evidence of Austin's working methods, and the practice of etching and engraving as a fine art practice in the 1920s and 1930s.",
