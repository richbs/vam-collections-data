            "public_access_description": "Bris\u00e9 fans were popular through the late 17th century and early 18th. They had no fan leaf. They were made of sticks held together with a silk cord or ribbon. Some bris\u00e9 fans accentuated the elaborate carving of the sticks. Others, like this example, were as pictorial as those made with a painted fan leaf. The fan painter has illustrated this fan with a representation of the final scene from the play \u2018Iphigenie\u2019 by French playwright Racine. Painting on bris\u00e9 fans was more difficult than painting a fan leaf. The artist had to colour each individual stick carefully so that the whole composition connected properly when the fan was opened. The heroine Iphigenie is shown saved from sacrifice by the Goddess Diana, who appears in a cloud and carries the girl away from the sacrificial priest. The female figures are represented in dress of the early eighteenth century, perhaps adapted to seem historical, whilst Iphigenie\u2019s father Agamemnon and his attendants wear \u201cClassical\u201d style armour. The costumes depicted are clearly theatrical, befitting the subject. The depictions of the figures are unsophisticated though colourful. The Chinese style decoration on the lower part of the fan sticks reflects the interest in Chinese design and objects at the time.",
