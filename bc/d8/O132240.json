He appears to have shared the studio of his elder brother Gian Antonio (1698-1760) in the period before 1760. Gian Antonio was a painter of figure subjects whereas Francesco practised mainly view painting, but the exact division between the two brothers is controversial. Francesco was influenced by Magnasco, Marco Ricci and Carlevarijs, as well as by Canaletto, whose pupil he may have been and whose compositions he copied in his early years (see below nos. 163-65). He was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1784 and died in 1793. His sister married G. B. Tiepolo. \nLit. G. Simonson, <i>Francesco Guard</i>i, 1904; G. Fiocco, <i>Francesco Guardi</i>, 1923; <i>Mostra dei Guardi</i> (<i>Catalogo</i> a cura di P.
