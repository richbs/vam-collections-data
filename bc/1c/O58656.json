Kem Weber was the architect of the building and the upholstery was chosen by the client. The name of the chair expressed the desire to associate the design with the most up-to-date development in modern industry.  Throughout the 1930s, a number of experimental passenger flights were completed. The first transatlantic passenger service was held on 28th June, 1939 between New York and Marseilles, France.\n\nWeber sought to make a 'comfortable, hygienic and beautiful chair inexpensively'. The result featured a cantilevered seat and a knockdown design. The strength of the frame allowed the designer to dispense with the rear legs giving the sitter a more comfortable, resilient seat.  The chair was easy to assemble; it came in a flat, square box relatively inexpensive for a manufacturer to store and ship.\n\nAlthough the Airline chair seemed destined for great commercial success, factory production of it never became a reality, despite extensive discussions between Weber and manny American manufacturers. Three hundred chairs were ordered by Walt Disney Studios for use in its projection rooms, lounges, and offices, but they were made by a local cabinetmaker rather than a major furniture producer.",

            "history_note": "This <font -i>Airline</font> chair was one of a group commissioned by the Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, and made in 1939.  Kem Weber was the architect of the project and the upholstery was chosen by the client.  The name signifies little beyond a desire to associate the design with the fastest most up-to-date product of modern industry. The chair has the impression of an object whose form has been shaped by  the flow of air around it. \n\nWeber sought to make a 'comfortable, hygienic and beautiful chair inexpensively'. The result featured a cantilevered seat and a knockdown design. The strength of the frame allowed the designer to dispense with the rear legs giving the sitter a more comfortable, resilient seat.  Easy to assemble, the chair came in a flat, square box relatively inexpensive for a manufacturer to store and ship.\n\nAlthough the <font -i>Airline</font> chair seemed destined for great commercial success, factory production never became a reality despite extensive discussions between Weber and a large number of American manufacturers.  Three hundred chairs were ordered by Walt Disney Studios for use in its projection rooms, lounges, and offices, but they were made by a local cabinmaker rather than a major furniture producer.",

            "historical_context_note": "The large, comfortable lounge or club chair is a design problem that was addressed between 1917 and 1932 by early modernist architects in Europe: Gerrit Rietveld, Marcel Breuer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Alvar Aalto. few American seating designs of the interwar years were able to match the inventiveness of the European works.",
