The decoration is of an architectural complex and other buildings around a lake, set in a landscape, which alludes to either the Chinese Eight Views of the Xiaoxiang (Xiaoxiang ba jing) or its Japanese version, the Eight Views of Omi (Omi hakkei). This pictorial scene is enclosed by a complex cartouche formed by four pairs of phoenixes. The rough surface on the reverse is covered with undecorated western black japanning. The panel has an irregular rectangular shape reflecting where it was cut away from its original chest. \n\nThis panel bears unmistakable similarities to the top of the lid of the Mazarin Chest (412-1882) and its companion, the Lawrence Chest (current whereabouts unknown). These also both reveal buildings, a lake and a landscape surrounded by a similar cartouche formed by four pairs of phoenixes.",

            "public_access_description": "The Mazarin Chest, probably the V&A's most important Japanese object, is an export lacquer chest of superb quality. From 2004 - 2009 it was at the centre of an international ground-breaking conservation project. At least one other closely related chest, the Lawrence Chest (current whereabouts unknown), is known to have been made. Both chests are not only extremely similar in technique and subject matter, but they also reveal a feature that is unique to them. This is an elaborate cartouche formed by four pairs of phoenixes on the outside of the lid and four pairs of dragons on the inside, enclosing buildings around a lake in a landscape. Since the new panel depicts the same phoenix cartouche and landscape, it is almost certainly the top of the lid of yet another closely related chest, even though the quality is not quite as high. \n\nJapanese lacquer was enormously popular in Europe but was always in short supply.  From the eighteenth century onwards, earlier items of Japanese export lacquer were often cut away from the original object and re-worked as fashionable pieces of contemporary furniture. One such item in the V&A, an early nineteenth century boulle-work cabinet (museum no.1084-1882), contains three export lacquer panels, which appear to be half the front and one side of another chest. A similar cabinet from Sotheby's, Paris, also seems to form the other half and side of the same chest, since the two halves of the front show unmistakable similarities to the front of the Lawrence Chest. It seems highly likely, therefore, that the newly-acquired panel was the top of this other 'Mazarin Chest'. From the other remaining pieces in the two boulle-work cabinets, it has been possible to reconstruct digitally what this chest would probably have looked like.",
