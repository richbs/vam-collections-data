Another on the end of an era and a rise / of protest symbolised by the clenched fist of the Spanish / Civil War and the demonstrations of the 30's. / One of a ghastly womb that gives birth to a tank - to give / birth to a tank... / There's one that says discussion is best when conducted between / equals and another about those blinkered enthusiasts who / see only the glorious young soldier (in traditional War / Memorial pose) but do not see the tank or the monstrous / process of soldiering! / For people who find only references to Czechoslovakia in / these pictures theres the three teardrops who conveniently / forgetting Munich and the more recent armed adventures / of their own governments, see only in one direction. / These silk screen prints are, admittedly, simplified / statements about complex policies. But somewhere in / that complexity lies truth. It might help us locate / it if we began by putting military ideas in the dustbin! / Ken Sprague. September 1968.",
