Taylor. The publication was one of the first of many books on villas and smaller houses which profoundly affected the development of architecture in the years around 1800. Its aquatint illustrations were the first to set classical buildings into the newly fashionable picturesque landscape. These preparatory drawings show some small differences of detail from the aquatints, particularly in the landscape backgrounds.",
