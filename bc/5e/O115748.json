It had the appearance of hand-knotted macram\u00e9 but also incredible strength and durability. The chair grew out of a project called Dry Tech, a collaboration which aimed to combine the rough-and-ready low-tech aesthetics of Droog Design with the high-tech materials of the Aviation and Space Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. Once the fibres had been hand-knotted and soaked with epoxy, the form was draped upside-down over a mould to get the shape of the seat and back. The designer produced the first versions of the chair himself, before production was taken over by Cappellini in Italy.",
