It stayed in the repertoire until 4 June 1959. Peter Williams, writing in Dance and Dancers, September 1954, noted that the ballet's theme - of 'man seeking to detach himself from common humanity' was well served by the design: 'The setting suggests a tangle of uncertainty - nothing leads anywhere in particular but everywhere in general. Strange blasted shapes seem the visual realisation of the twisted and tortuous recesses of an undetermined mind.'\n\nKenneth Rowell (1920-1999) began designing for dance in his native Australia in the 1940s. Following the success of his designs for Ballet Rambert's 1949 Australian tour, Marie Rambert and Laurence Olivier recommended Rowell for a British Council scholarship, and in 1950 he came to London to study. Two years late John Gielgud commissioned him to create the costumes for Macbeth at Stratford-upon-Avon and this established Rowell as a major stage designer. Based in England for thirty years, he worked as both a designer and a painter, returning to live in Australia in 1982.",
