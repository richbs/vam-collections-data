The whole is cast in two halves down the down and held together with tongue and slot joints. It is lithographed in bright colours to show a brown horse with yellow and orange trim and a rider in white; red and green with brown bearded face; hands and lower legs. The clockwork mechanism is housed inside the body and covered with a metal plate cut out to allow the front legs to move. The back legs are a separate cast pinned to the plate with tongue and slot joints. The integral key protrudes from the body at the left flank and when wound; only the front legs move causing the whole to hop along. This is a development from the earlier versions when both sets of legs moved.",
