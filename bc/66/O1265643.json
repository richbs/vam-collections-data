There is a matching yellow checked scarf around the neck. The material varies - the head and hands are plush, the top and feet are flocked and the trousers and scarf are smooth. The toy is soft filled with beans in the arms, bottom and feet.\nThe eyes are black plastic and the nose and mouth embroidered in black thread. There is a label sewn into the seam between the top and the trousers on the back left-hand side. It is printed with the Boots logo and information about Rupert on one side, and the CE safety mark, the company's address and washing instructions on the other.",
