            "public_access_description": "Measured elevation of the upper part of the fa\u00e7ade of the Villa Caldogno by leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The Villa Caldogno, designed in c.1545, was believed in Chambers's day to have been designed by Andrea Palladio; this has since been disputed (Puppi 1989, pp.103-104.). The sheet has been trimmed along the lower edge removing everything below the rustication at the top of the three great arches on the piano nobile.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
