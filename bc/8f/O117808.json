A stay in Florence between 1504 and 1508 was decisive for his artistic development as he changed significantly his manner while he became familiar with the works of the great Florentine masters such as Leonardo and Botticelli among others. He was later summoned to the papal court in Rome where he stayed until his death in 1520, decorating affresco the papal chambers in the Vatican and creating an impressive series of portraits and independent easel paintings of religious subject matters. Raphael had many pupils among whom the most notables were Giulio Romano, Perino del Vaga and Polidoro da Caravaggio.\n\nThis work is probably an ancient copy after a painting traditionally attributed to Raphael. It shows St John the Baptist as a boy, standing in front of a cave and pointing out at his reed cross from which emanates a halo of light. St John the Baptist was an important figure in Florence of which he was regarded as the patron saint.",

He succeeded Bramante in 1514 as architect of St Peter's, and later held responsibility for all papal enterprises in the arts.

This has been identified with the picture painted by Raphael for Cardinal Colonna (Vasari, ed. Milanesi, iv, p. 370 f.), but the ascription to Raphael is not universally accepted (A. Rosenberg, <i>Raffael</i>, 4th ed., 1909, pl, 166, p. 247). The fact that it is painted on poplar confirms the Italian origin of this copy. \n\nProv.

It is sometimes related to Vasari's description: \n\n'Raphael painted a St John on canvas for cardinal Colonna, who bore a great love for the painting because of its beauty, and when he was struck down by illness, the doctor who cured him, Messer Jacopo da Carpi, asked for the painting as a gift, and since Messer Jacopo wanted it, the cardinal, who felt he was under an endless obligation to him, gave it up, and it is now in Florence in the possession of Francesco Benintendi'.\n\nGenerally dated around 1518-19, the original painting entered the Uffizi collection as eary as 1589.\n\nThe composition shows St John the Baptist as a boy wrapped into a leopard skin, pointing out at his reed cross from which emanates a halo of light and holding in his left hand a scroll, on which can be read '[AGNU]S DEI' (i.e. lamb of God) alluding to the coming sacrifice of Christ. St John is set against a large piece of rock, perhaps the entrance of a cave, with a small stream running besides him. The features of the face are not as round and graceful as the original but look a little square and harsh. \nThe original composition was evidently successful as many early copies are known. The present work, on poplar panel, was probably made in the 16th century in Italy, probably in Florence.\n\nRaphael executed another painting of the saint (Louvre, Paris) which appears to be a variant of that at the Accademia, and could have been made a couple of years earlier.",

However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. \n\nSt John the Baptist was an important figure in Florence, where he was, among others, the patron saint.",
