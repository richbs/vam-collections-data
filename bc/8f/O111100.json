The bottom of 3 planks without any evidence of cut-down feet (to be confirmed). The back formed of three planks glued. \nThe lid held on two original tinned iron strap hinges fixed with round-headed rivets, and panelled, containing two panels of pine or ash (with visible shrinkage across the grain) - with modern fillets to hold them in place, surrounded by small panels with geometric ornament, all with mitred border fillets of a dark wood (rosewood?) inside and out(?). The front and end edges of the lid with an external moulding held with square pegs, and end cleats. Most of the lid veneers seem to have been long missing. \nThe ends with central strapwork panel within simple mitred fillets (of a dark wood) forming a simple geometric design, and with wrought iron handles set over two diamond-shaped plates.\n\nThe marquetry front with three arched panels set between pilasters (with vertebrate foliage over a baldachino) over a rusticated ground with sprouting weeds. The central panel of grotesque ornament (with spandrels containing parrots) surmounted by strapwork, and flanked by two panels with Justice (left) after Goltzius, and Charity (right), both with surrounding small panels with hunting scenes or grotesques. (The two larger panels above Justice and Charity each with a double-headed eagle bearing an armorial(?) shield.) Below the three main panels a series of 9 smaller panels with hunt scenes, foliage or male figures standing amid foliage. The marquetry of 5 or 6(?) colours including green stain.\n\n\n\nThe interior surfaces are neatly planed. With a till (PR) with lid (with moulded edge) and decorative skirt all in good condition (note wear from till lid against chest lid (as shown in illustrations) where lid was used as lid prop). \n\nMetalwork\nTwo original tinned iron hinges with spear tips matching the hasp plate. The original large internal lock now missing (but ornate escutcheon and nails remain), and the hasp male now missing from its surviving plate nailed to the underside of the lid. A later (18c or 19c) lock and hasp fitted and keyhole added.\n\nFinish\nDiscoloured varnish overall.",
