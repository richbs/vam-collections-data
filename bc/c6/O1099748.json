I, repra. pI. xxvii, no. 4; Reynolds 1975, no. 10, pl. 24. \n\nThe 'MrWignal' identified in the inscription, has proved elusive. Long worked on his identity, and corresponded with Collins Baker, who wrote to him, 11 December 1910, with a photograph of a portrait identified as Matthew Gibbon, apparently signed <i>Robt. Wignall</i>. (Christie's, sometime in 1909). Collins Baker's letter in the departmental files has provided the basis for subsequent references to this miniature as a portrait of <i>Robert</i> Wignal. The only other fruit of Long's research was a note in the <i>London Gazette</i> of 5 April 1697 to the effect that one Matthew Lock (perhaps an early reference to Matthias Lock (fl.1740-70), the designer) 'went away from his master Mr. Wiggnall \"picture-drawer'\". \n\nMore recently Mary Edmond has combed the likely archives for references to Robert Wignal and has found only one man of that name. (The surname Wignal, in its many variant spellings is itself uncommon, but Richard, John and Edward Wignals of the right sort of date occur in various professions and levels of society in Essex, Suffolk, Surrey and, of course, London). He was Mr Robert Wignall, who married Anne Sands at Knightsbridge Chapel on 9 July 1678; there is no indication of his profession. The most frequent archival references, however, are to a James Wignall, painter, of the parish of St Martin-in - the- Fields. This is the right part of London for a painter to live, and as close to the Rosses as other sitters for The Pocket Book group. Wignall's commercial connections with developments of the St James's, Piccadilly, Soho Square and Leicester Square areas of London, with Richard Frith (who left his name on Frith Street) and with William Pyrn place him as a likely acquaintance of the moneyed Rosse circle in the parish of St Martin's. Mary Edmond considers that, from the contexts of these references, it is clear that James Wignall was a painter-decorator rather than an easel painter. The inscription on the miniature, referring to him simply as 'painter', possibly thus differentiates him from familiars like Lely, Kneller and Wissing, for whom the word painter, with its artisan associations, would have been inappropriate and, as far as Susannah-Penelope is concerned, unnecessary.(2) 1 Autograph letter from Basil Long, serving with the army in France, to F W Stokes, as from c/o I.O,A.P.O. S.37, BEF; 20/5/17; endorsed by recipient <i>Rec\u2019d 22nd May Answered 12/7 /17F.WS.\n</i>\nDear Stokes, \n\nYours of the 17th to hand. Excuse pencil as my pen is aeger. \n(1) I cannot remember whether I measured the 'Pocket book miniatures', but you can take it that I did if any of the Catalogue sizes differ from the Inventory sizes. [Memo. Today I have actual measts of 456-'92, EWS.22/5/17]\n(2) The set was reframed before I joined the Museum staff on May 8 1906; or possibly the frame was actually being made at that moment. \n(3) None of the Pocketbook mins. was retouched since 8/5/1906. \n(4) I do not think the flaking of Wignal is recent. I seem to remember it. But this sort of thing shows how important it is to record the condition of all ptgs. objects. I hope that as occasion permits you are proceeding with the record I instituted. [Yes: FWS] \nHave you looked at * photos ofWignal to see if he was flaking when they were taken? [*The photo shows just as much flaking and in the same places. EWS.J \nAnyhow, the blackening is not serious - it can be corrected just as well a year or more hence as now, so I think it had better continue at least until my next visit. Ditto the flaking, about which I shd.like a reply to the query above. \n\nI hope you aren't ungoldbeatering any of the mins. \nYours sincerely \nB.S. Long \nPS. I hope you are not definitely assuming that the mins are by Rosse. \nPS. PI. tell Mr Kennedy I think it is time Turner's East Cows [sic] Castle was looked at. It requires very careful handling: no jarring. \n\n2 I am grateful to Mary Edmond, personal communication, for the information on Mr Wignall.</u>\"",
