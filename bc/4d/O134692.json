            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, cat. no. 269\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"On the back of the sketch, which is on white paper, is a pencil drawing showing a coast scene, probably the beach at Brighton, with houses on the West Cliff in the background. \nInscribed at top left in pencil by the artist <i>Battery</i> (referring to the guns on the sea wall) and vertically across the sky, right, with an indistinct date, perhaps <i>Aug</i> 20. Also inscribed in another hand below on left M.L. [Maria Louisa Constable]. \n\nAccording to J. A. Erredge,<u> History of Brighthelmston</u>, 1862 (p. 71) the only battery existing at Brighton at this time was on the West Cliff, opposite Artillery Place. \nDr. W. Katz of London had in 1954 a close-up sketch in oil on paper (5 3/8 X 4 ins.) of the two figures seen gleaning at the left No.269.  No.1817 in the Tate Gallery, called 'The Gleaners, Brighton', is dated 20 August 1824 and shows two figures in similar attitudes to those in No. 269 and the sketch mentioned, gleaning in fields near windmills. This, with the conjectural reading of the date on No. 269a, strengthens the possibility that No. 269 was painted on the same day as the work in the Tate Gallery. \n\nIn his letter to Fisher of 29 August 1824 (<u>Beckett</u>, VI, pp. 170-2), Constable gives an unflattering description of Brighton and concludes: \"In short there is nothing here for a painter but the breakers-& sky-which have been lovely indeed and always varying. The fishing boats are picturesque, but not so much so as the Hasting boats which are luggers ... But these subjects are so hackneyed in the Exhibition, and are in fact so little capable of that beautifull sentiment that landscape is capable of or which  rather belongs to landscape, that they have done a great deal of harm to the art -they form a class of art much easier than landscape & have in consequence almost supplanted it ... \" Constable had offered to lend Fisher one of his Brighton sketch-books but was eventually unable to do so because of the suggestion that the sketches should be engraved (see note following No. 284). In place of them he sent a number of oil sketches . He refers to them in his letter of 5 January 1825 (<u>Beckett,</u> VI, p.189): I have enclosed in the box a dozen of my Brighton oil sketches-perhaps the sight of the sea may cheer Mrs F-they were done in the lid of my box on my knees as usual. Will you be so good as to take care of them. I put them in a book on purpose -as I find dirt destroys them a good deal. Will you repack the box as you fmd it. Return them to me here at your leisure but the sooner the better\". In his letter of [6] April 1825 (<u>Beckett</u>, VI, p. 196) Fisher speaks of returning the Brighton sketches, and sending with them two volumes of Paley's sermons: \"They are fit companions for your sketches, being exactly like them: full of vigour, & nature, fresh, original, warm from observation of nature, hasty, unpolished, untouched afterwards\".\nThe inscription on the back of No. 266 shows that  it was almost certainly one of the Brighton oil sketches in this batch sent by Constable to Fisher. Others among the sketches certainly painted in this year (Nos. 263-265, 267 and 268) may well have been  included  in the consignment.\"\n\nGraham Reynolds",
