These boots were produced for Mary Quant's footwear range, 'Quant Afoot', introduced in 1967. They are made from clear plastic over a coloured lining, and resemble the Chelsea boots with square heels and toes worn by the Beatles during the mid-1960s. The heels are moulded with Mary Quant's signature daisy motif. The wearer would leave a trail of daisy footprints behind her after walking through a puddle.",

London: V&A Publications, 1997.\nBaker, Malcolm and Richardson, Brenda, eds. <u>A Grand Design: The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum</u>. London: V&A Publications, 1997. 431 p., ill. ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Museum's collection of shoes - like its larger twentieth-century dress collection - has been primarily of haute couture examples. It has been only in the past few years that the Museum has sought to expand its shoe collection - recent acquisitions have ranged from 1940s cowboy boots to 1990s Converse Allstars designs, each chosen for its significance in the changing history of fashion in the shoe industry.\nRevivalism has been a major theme in the design of twentieth-century shoes. All five of these pairs of shoes demonstrate a nostalgia that is manifest in creating new styles from old. Platforms, although seen as a new style in the 1930s - and subsequently revived in the 1940s, 1970s, and 1990s - had their origins in the chopines of the sixteenth century. The use of synthetics has also become more common in the last century, motivated both by technological innovation and by the scarcity of leather during World War II. Today, synthetics are often seen as an ethical alternative to leather, and companies like Vegetarian Shoes have begun to manufacture design classics - like the \"Doc Martens\" boot - in brightly coloured polyester.\n\nCATHIE DINGWALL",
