The major part - pp. 5, 9, 29, 33, 37, 41, 35, 49, 53, 57, 69, and 73 - consists of sketches of saint and angels. These are preliminary designs for the ballet <i>Liturgie</i>, the d\u00e9cor and costumes for which Diaghilev entrusted to Goncharova, who was at the time in Lausanne. In 1915, the ballet was rehearsed, but it was never staged. Pages 13 and 17 are working drawings for <i>mise en sc\u00e8ne</i> of Mussorgsky's opera <i>Boris Godunov</i>, produced in Berlin in 1913. Page 61 might be for the New York revival of Rimsky-Korsakov's <i>Sadko</i> in 1916. The letters can be dated approximately 1921, as they contain references to the possibility of reproducing a costume for Karsavina in <i>Le Coq d'or</i> in Valerian Svetlov's monograph <i>Thamar Karsavina</i>, ed. Cyril W. Beaumont (London, 1922), where it appeared facing on page 54. The erratic numbers on the pages show that they were collected together at a later date.",
