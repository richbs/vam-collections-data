A lower border of a different fabric has been stitched across the lower edge.  The central panel has a gold ground [gold strip S-wound on a yellow silk core] with spaced, isolated motifs in offset rows: an upright white iris [brocaded] with 3 flowers and leaves.  The white silk has silver strip open S-wound around it. The corner squares have the same gold ground with concentric circles of red or mauve flower heads with a central circular arrangement of 4 red and 4 light blue petals.  The whole is surrounded by an irregularly shaped white/silver band.  The borders also have the gold ground. They contain a pair of undulating white/silver bands almost forming compartments containing red and mauve flowers and green leaves. A red and white chevron border forms edges all round.\nThe lower border is woven as a horizontal piece and has a similar design but it is finer and more detailed and on a smaller scale. The white/silver bands are formed by serrated leaves.  There is a red and white chevron band above and below the main pattern.\nMetal Threads: [1] silver strip open S-wound on white silk; [2] silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk.",
