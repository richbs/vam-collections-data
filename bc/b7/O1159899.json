Much of Ghadirian's work addresses the theme of Muslim women living in Iran, exploring ideas such as censorship, religion, modernity, and the status of women.\n\nThe Qajar series is modelled after studio portraits made in Iran during the Qajar period which spanned the second half of the 19th century to the first two decades of the 20th. Like their predecessors, these formal studio portraits contain props that represent the aspirations of the sitters, but the objects they pose with are jarringly modern, such as in this image, a mirror.",
