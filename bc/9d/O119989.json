The naked tritons are shown up to their waists in water. The horses, open-mouthed in terror, are lifting their legs above the waves, one showing claw-like hooves.Two fish-like tails are also visible. \nThe figures are grouped either side of the central keyhole, moving towards it, each man among his horses. The man on the left grips a horse\u2019s mane, and carries a curved horn at his side.  The man on the right brandishes a large object in his right hand, possibly a jaw bone and what appears to be a shell-like horn in his left. As the two groups surge towards the keyhole, the lead horses\u2019 legs clash beneath it.  \n\nOn the back at each end is a simple mortise cut to receive a dovetailed drawer side (with remains of nails). A narrow rebate has been cut along the lower edge. Fixings for a lock (missing) appear behind the off-centre keyhole that was filled with wax (removed 2012).\n\nIt seems likely that a longer panel was adapted to serve as a drawer front, by reducing it to size, cutting joints and a rebate, and adding a lock and keyhole.",

There are still signs of the joints used to secure it to the structure of the drawer, a keyhole and evidence of a metal lock. As walnut is prone to woodworm damage, much early furniture is greatly deteriorated leaving only elements \u2013 usually the more decorated parts \u2013 to survive. From the 19th century some of these fragments were incorporated into new pieces of furniture made in a 16th century style.\nA design of tritons (mythological mermen) and sea horses is expressively carved in low relief from the solid wood. The design may relate to prints by early 17th century designers such as Odoardo Fialetti (1573-1638?), who had been influenced by Andrea Mantegna\u2019s engraving Battle of the Sea Gods (c.1470s), which was itself inspired by antique classical sculpture.",
