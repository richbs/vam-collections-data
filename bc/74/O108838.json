Mackmurdo designed most of the repeating textiles for the Century Guild. He was a close friend of William Morris, and it is likely that some Century Guild wall rugs were made at Morris\u2019 workshop in Merton Abbey. In the 1880s he encouraged another friend, Charles Voysey, to become a designer; his patterns were shown as part of the Century Guild\u2019s exhibits in 1888.\n\nMackmurdo often based his patterns on real, but unfamiliar and strange-looking, natural forms. As a young man he was strongly influenced by the drawings of the artist Burne-Jones and his swirling designs for stained glass. Mackmurdo developed his unconventional style with the help of his friend and fellow designer Selwyn Image. Later designers in the Art Nouveau style often imitated his eccentric motifs.",
