In 1846 the Tsar commissioned a tabletop directly from Michelangelo Barberi; the artist called its composition 'Il bel cielo d'Italia' (the beautiful sky of Italy). The original table, with a central composition of a group of putti holding a portrait  of Tsarina Alexandra, is now at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Its views match those of the present table, but are interspersed with symbolic images representing the Italian genius: works by famous Italian painters and portraits of illustrious figures.\n\nThe present work, made for Francis Needham, Earl Kilmorey, was exhibited in London at the Great Exhibition of 1851 where it received a Council Medal, the highest honour awarded.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Dr.  Ricks, Oklahoma City, 1974.\n\nHistorical significance: Michelangelo Barberi (1787-1867) known as 'Cavaliere' was the leading micromosaicist of the 19th century. His brothers were painters and his father Camillo was an architect, painter and designer.  Camillo served as Director of Fortifications and Prisons for Italy following his meeting with the Emperor Napoleon in Milan in 1804. The family lived in Paris for a while but returned to Rome during the reign of Pius VII (1800-1823).\n\nMichelangelo was apprenticed to Cesare Aguatti and worked from 1820 in the Vatican Workshop. From the 1820s his table tops were in demand by European nobility and he set up shop at 148 Via Rasella near Piazza di Spagna where his daughter later ran the business. He published 'Alcuni Musaici usciti dallo studio del Cav. Michel'angelo Barberi'. The Barberi shop also produced smaller mosaics illustrating literary subjects from Dante, Tasso and Manzoni.\n\nBarberi executed views of Rome for the villa of Prince Demidoff (1813-1870) in Florence. By 1856 he had been elected a member of the prestigious Institution of Virtuosos at the Pantheon and was named Commander of the Order of St. Sylvester by Pius IX.",
