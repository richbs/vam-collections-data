            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nDuring the 18th century, a fashionable woman wore from her belt a 'chatelaine', or, as it was then known, a 'chain' or 'equipage'.  From the chatelaine might hang a range of different objects: a watch, seals, a box for a thimble, or an '\u00e9tui' containing sewing, writing or cosmetic implements.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Hunt was apprenticed in 1709, and entered his mark at Goldsmiths' Hall, London, in 1725.  He appears to have specialised in gold chatelaines and other small objects in gold, such as cane heads and boxes.  Examples of these are shown in a magnificent Rococo trade card advertising the wares sold by William Hunt & Son in the 1750s.  His son, James, was apprenticed to him in 1742, and registered his own mark in 1760.  James also made chatelaines, and he supplied gold Freedom Boxes to the City of London \n\nDesign & Designing\nOn gold watchcases made in London, chased figure scenes were one of the most fashionable forms of decoration from about 1720 to 1770.  At first the scenes were set inside symmetrical frames of scrolls, but under the influence of the High Rococo these frames often became asymmetric in the late 1730s.",
