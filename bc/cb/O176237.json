The conjectural plan is reproduced Chanter (1932).  The extension was demolished in the mid-nineteenth century. It was recorded that one of the rooms was furnished with an oak roof of 'ornamental cross beams (Tucker 1846). A boss was mentioned in the form of a crouching hound which must be this lioness boss.\n\nThere is no documented date for the extension to the palace.  Charles Tracey suggests that it took place between 1335 and 1340.  If this is correct he argues that the wooden roof would have been designed by the master mason, Thomas of Witney in collaboration with the master carpenter.",
