Smaller scenes show cupids fishing, Cupid with a dart arousing a lady who is writing, and a small boy playing the bagpipes to a dog with geese and sheep about him.",

            "public_access_description": "The Art of Loving or The Pleasant Lesson is typical of many scenes printed on cotton textiles in the late 18th and early 19th century in various centres of cotton printing across northern Europe, including by Petitpierre et cie. in Nantes. The most famous cotton-printing factory was propitiously located at Jouy-en-Josas, half way between Paris and Versailles, the main residences of the French court - and the most desired market for these expensive furnishings textiles. \n\nThe designs were often based on engravings by well-known artists, and were sometimes updated to suit the period in which they were adapted for printing on cotton. Here, three of the scenes come from paintings by the French court artist Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-70) - The Pleasant Lesson (1748) and The Lovers Surprised (1748), both engraved by Ren\u00e9 Gaillard in 1758, and a now lost painting. A second source is an engraving by Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly (1761-1845)). The dress of the shepherd and shepherdess on the right are in tune with Boucher's era, while the fashionable women beside the vase and the sculpture of Cupid, wear the fashions of the last decade of the 18th century.",
