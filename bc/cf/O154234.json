They were seeking a fresh approach to colour but preferred to work with traditional rather than new materials. William Harper adapted and transformed the technique of cloisonn\u00e9 enamel into a more painterly fashion. The matte finish of the enamel is characteristic of his work. \n\nWilliam Harper was preoccupied with the mysterious and the magical, creating sumptuous jewels with glowing, contrasting pools of colour amid patinated silver and textured gold. \n\nOver the years he incorporated found objects from nature and from faraway cultures. He was interested in the cultural references of African, Asian and Central and South American art and in the use of gold in ritual objects. Harper later explored religious themes and symbols questioning the institutions of religion.  \n\nWilliam Harper originally trained as a painter, but soon moved to the enamels which were to become his trademark. In 1973 he published a technical book on enamel titled \u2018Step by Step Enamelling\u2019.",
