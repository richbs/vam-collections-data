When the wind was in the 'wrong' direction the kite was flown at the top of the road, and we would run with the kite line dangerously close to overhead power cables! Occasionally it was flown on the local recreational field. It caused consternation when flown near the village, villagers thinking that it was a huge eagle in the sky. Sometimes a necktie or belt was draped over the kite line and this would gradually creep up towards the flying kite as the line was tweeked. The reel was originally completely filled with kite line but I soon found out that it made very good bow strings, although I had to ask my mother for 'a bit more string' each time a new bow was needed. The amount of line remaining on the reel shows how many bows I cut from local hedgerows. Although the kite flew very high, we never did manage to get all of the line unwound from the reel.\"",
