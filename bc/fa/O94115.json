It may have been a model, although no medals are known to have been cast after it. Its large size suggests it is unlikely to have been a games-piece.\nHagenauer (1490-1500) was a German wood-carver and medallist. In accordance with his training as a wood-carver he prepared his models in boxwood or pearwood and then cast them in silver, bronze or lead. Hagenauer was active throughout the whole South German area and the Lower Rhine (main work output from the cities: Augsburg, Baden, Swabia, Bonn, Cologne, Munich). His models are very accurate and precise, and exact in the smallest detail. His patrons were fascinated by his models and treasured them as works of art, framed them and sometimes even coloured them. This is the reason also why so many have survived.",
