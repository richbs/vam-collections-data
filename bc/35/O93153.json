The large medallion motifs on this quilt suggest that it was probably intended for the Dutch market, as similar designs are known in other pieces from Dutch collections. The density and variety of the reds, blues and purples in this piece bear witness to the great skills of the Indian dyers who made it by a variety of time-consuming processes involving mordanting and resist-dyeing.",
