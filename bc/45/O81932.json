Nos 65, 72 and 94 [P.20-1941; P.19-1941; P.22-1941]; packed out with fragmentary trade cards. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Perhaps as given by Foster 1914-16, below; S S Joseph: Mrs Emma Joseph, by whom presented to the Museum, May 1941. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Possibly Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p78, no. 535 and p.169: 'unknown man (a divine) \u00be face to right. In a black skull cap and robe' - Christie's, Hawkins sale, 16 May 1904, lot 998 ('formerly at Bignor Park'), bt Gall, 20 gns; Foskett 1974, p. 126; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nThe miniature came to the Museum identified as <i>Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford</i> (1620-1708). Wertheimer, Joseph's usual dealer, was a large purchaser of snuffboxes and <i>objets de vertu</i> at the Hawkins sale, but he bought only a few miniatures. If this miniature were the miniature that Foster saw at the Hawkins sale, the identification of the sitter as Davenport must have been Gall's or Joseph's. In either case it is unsupported by documentary or iconographic evidence and has never been accepted by the Museum. Francis Newport, MP for Shrewsbury (1640-44), was a royalist soldier and after the Restoration a successful courtier (Treasurer of the Household 1672-87 and 1689-1708). He succeeded his father as Viscount Newport in 1650 and was created Earl of Bradford in 1694. The portraits of him at Weston Park by Kneller and Dahl are not compatible with this image. \n\nThe tight fit of the sitter in the oval, the absence of a marginal strip and the rough cutting of the vellum indicate that the miniature has been considerably cut down from its original dimensions. Perhaps it has also lost its signature, for the quality of the painting suggests that the miniature was a finished autograph work, perhaps (with its sky background) in the enlarged format which Cooper returned to for his major sitters including bishops in the Restoration. The date here, however, on the basis of the Flemish lace and the flamboyant tassle, seems to be the late 1650s. The skull cap is part of informal male dress, worn inside the house; it would be changed for a round, wide-brimmed hat for the street.
