            "public_access_description": "At the close of the seventeenth century, Charles de Moelder was one of the leading ornamental engravers in London. He produced designs that were sold to silversmiths or goldsmiths, who subsequently made objects using de Moelder\u2019s designs as patterns or as inspiration. Ornaments, such as those shown here, could have been cast or inscribed onto works by the silversmith after consulting with the patron. Several of the designs include heraldic motifs, which the patron could adapt to his own coat of arms. A sheet like this with a variety of patterns would have provided the silversmith with options for recombination within de Moelder\u2019s design aesthetic. There are also two mythological scenes, one of Mercury charming Argus to sleep and another showing a love scene between a nymph and a satyr. As such boxes were often part of a bridal gift, such scenes of romance were appropriate.",
