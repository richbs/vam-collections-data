There is a disc of sheet silver, with scalloped edge and pierced plaque nailed to the centre, attached to one end of the chain, with a long hook on its back.  At the other end is a two-part pendant, consisting of a stylised silver-gilt vase with a container hanging below it divided into segments marked 1, 2, 3.",

Although many of the elements are undoubtedly renaissance in character, the belt itself may not be that old.  Rich marriage belts of archaic design continued in use with traditional costume in much of Europe, from Iceland to Slovenia, up to the 19th century.  The winged angel\u2019s heads on the balusters of this belt are a common motif in traditional Scandinavian jewellery, particularly in Sweden, but the use of a large decorative loop-in-loop chain is more common with German traditional jewellery.  The various parts may not all date from the same period, and may not have belonged together originally.",
