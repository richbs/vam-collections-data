It might show a famous Roman ruler or statesman \u2013 Julius Caesar or Cicero for example. This circular relief medallion is made by the workshop of the Della Robbia in Florence in second half of fifteenth century. The Della Robbia was an Italian family of sculptors and potters. They were active in Florence from the early 15th century and elsewhere in Italy and France well into the 16th. Luca della Robbia founded the family sculpture workshop in Florence and was regarded by contemporaries as a leading artistic innovator, comparable to Donatello and Masaccio.",
