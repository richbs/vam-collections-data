The original work, an architectural history of the Bank of England, was published as volume 58 of the series \"Studien zur Kunstgeschichte\".\n\nThe manuscript has been painted and effectively sealed within a thick application of vermillion and yellow acrylic paint. With its large, visible brushstrokes, the work is highly tactile, its weight and shape reminiscent of a gold ingot. The book's reinforced impenetrability also draws parallels with a bank vault, a safe place perhaps for its valuable contents.\n\nProduced in a limited edition of 15 copies, signed by the author/artist underneath the coat of paint.",
