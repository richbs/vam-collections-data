This carpet was made by knotting woollen yarn by hand onto a hemp ground to create a dense pile which was then trimmed.  Carpets of this sort were known as Turkey work because they imitated both the designs and the methods of manufacture of carpets from the Middle East.  This example, however, is very European in its depictions of flowers and its incorporation of a coat of arms.\n\nThis carpet is dated 1672 and was probably commissioned to commemorate a special event.  The heraldic arms in the centre of the carpet are those of Molyneux and Rigby.  Sir John Molyneux (1623-1691) of Teversal in Nottinghamshire married Lucy Hesketh, ne\u00e9 Rigby (d. 1688) of Rufforth in Lancashire on 18 April 1655.  The red hand in the corner of the Molyneux cross is the symbol of baronetcy, although Sir John did not become a baronet until the death of his father on 21 October 1674.",
