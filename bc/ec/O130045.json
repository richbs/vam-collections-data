It regulated the use by manufacturers of basic raw materials, such as wood and petrol, that were in great demand during the Second World War. Furniture manufacturers were permitted to make furniture only according to specific approved designs. The design of this table illustrates the principle of the scheme that furniture should be well designed in terms of construction and appearance; it should be  solid, durable, economical, and distinctly modern. \n\nThe original bill for this table shows that it cost \u00a37.4.0, along with six ration points. Mr and Mrs Ryder, parents of the donor, bought this table in 1946 with a sideboard also now in the V&A's collection (Museum no. W.10-1996).  Like many couples who had married during the war, they were unable to set up home until Mr Ryder returned from the war.",

The Scheme was an historically unprecedented example of government regulation of furniture design and production. It represented what many saw as a practical effort to regulate the use by manufacturers of basic raw materials, wood and petrol especially, that would be in great demand during the war. In terms of consumption it ordered the priority by which members of the public would be allowed to purchase furniture; only those who needed furniture would be allowed to buy. The Scheme evolved into an attempt by members of its Design Panel - especially Gordon Russell - to raise what they saw as the low level of design in Britain. The idea was to produce pieces that were well designed in terms of construction and appearance: solid, durable furniture that would be distinctly modern but appropriate to wartime. Utility furniture production was officially ended in 1952.",
