Pupil of the portraitist in crayons and engraver John Raphael Smith 1802-6; entered RA Schools 1807. Exhibited 13 landscapes and topographical views at the RA between 1807 and 1828 and 11 at the BI 1808-24, but principally watercolours - 417 at the OWS 1808-49. Also worked for engravers of topographical books. Married the sister of his friend William Hilton RA. Lived many years in Lincoln, where the Usher Art Gallery has a fine collection of his work. Many watercolours and drawings also in the V&A collections. Died London 30 June 1849; his studio sale was at Christie's 22-28 May 1850. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1849</i>, p260 (obit); W Armstrong <i>Memoir of Peter De Wint</i> 1888; H De Wint A Short Memoir ... privately printed c1900, reprinted in <i>Smith</i>; H Smith <i>Peter De Wint</i> 1982 (and for fuller bibliography) \n\n<b>Old Houses on the High Bridge, Lincoln</b> \nP58-1921 Neg 36162 \nMillboard, 30.5 x 45.7 cm (12 x 18 ins) \nBequeathed by Miss Harriet Helen Tatlock (the artist's granddaughter) 1921 \n\nA watercolour of the same composition is also in the V&A collections (179-1898), although there are differences in the figures and the buildings on the left side. The view seems to be from the west; the central part of the High Bridge (one of the most celebrated sites in Lincoln, where De Wint lived for many years) on the river Witham dates from the 12th century, although the structure was extended to support a l6th-century timber-framed house. Smith records a larger, more finished watercolour of the subject, formerly in the J Leslie Wright collection. \n\nEXH: <i>Peter De Wint</i> Lincoln Art Gallery 1937 (66); <i>Peter De Wint</i> Agnew 1966 (43)\n \nLIT: <i>Smith</i> p38\"",
