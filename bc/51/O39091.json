NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative. To create this textile, an industrial vinyl polychloride fabric with a preset 50% heat-shrinkage ratio is layered onto a polyester organdie, but only partially affixed, using a special adhesive screen-printed in a checkerboard pattern.  The fabric is then subjected to a flash heat treatment which causes the polyester organdie to shrivel where adhered.  As the fabric is themoplastic, it retains these crinkles even after the vinyl polchloride is peeled away.  The vinyl polychloride fabic was original developed for use in the motor industry to make car set covers.",
