This photograph and Ph 457-1968:181 (D.593) may show two of Lady Hawarden's daughters dressed for amateur theatricals, perhaps for one of the shows presented at the Female School of Art fete in June 1864. This suggestion is supported by the report that 'artistes attired in motley entreated patronage for the show', which was performed by an amateur troupe. [The Times, 24 June 1864, 14.] Possibly the paper Clementina holds is a script. See also Ph 310-1947 (D.608) and Ph 352-1947 (D.610). See also Ph 310-1947 (D.608) and Ph 352-1947 (D.610).'",
