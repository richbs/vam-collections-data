It was made in Kyoto, Japan's former imperial capital, which had grown into an important centre of ceramic manufacture during the 17th century. It is one of a pair of vases decorated with an astonishing degree of skill, with naturalistic bird and flower studies framed within a stylized border. The subject matter and treatment of the painted panels is similar to that found in Japanese illustrated books of the kind that were arousing much interest in the West at the time.\n\nTime\nThe opening up of Japan in the mid-1850s after more than two centuries of seclusion from the rest of the world triggered a huge expansion in the manufacture of export goods in ceramics and other media. These were avidly sought out by western collectors, artists and designers, and played a central role in the development of 'Japonisme' and then art nouveau.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis vase was one of over 200 Japanese ceramics bought by the V&A after they had been shown at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in the United States in 1876. Some were old, but the majority, like this piece, were new or nearly new. The collection was assembled by the Japanese with funds sent from Britain.",
