By the twentieth century the shapes and styles of the traditional dress were changing. One of the adaptations made was to shorten it and tailor it more sharply so that it outlined the contours of the body, allowing freer movement. \n\nThe qipao, or cheongsam as it is also known, became fashionable amongst women, especially those living in urban areas. To some, the qipao was a risqu\u00e9 garment because it exposed female flesh and accentuated the curves of the body. It is often associated with the high life of Shanghai and its glamour, and the style was popularised by cinema and the advertising industry.\n\nThis dress is made from grey satin. It is lined with lightweight grey plain silk and edged in narrow grey satin. It has short sleeves and a stand-up, stiffened collar fastened with a hook and eye. The front panel is decorated with asymmetric lilies which are embroidered onto the satin in red with white centres and grey and white foliage. The design curls down from the left shoulder, across the top front, and down across the skirt section. There is a spray with a red lily bud embroidered on either side of the collar front. \n\nThe dress is closed with press-studs across the collarbone to the right and down under the arm where there is then a zip-fastener in the side seam. There are bust darts at the front and waist darts at the back only.",
