The karaweik, a mythical bird, is a symbol of longevity. The container was used at the royal palace at Mandalay as part of a betel paraphernalia set. The offering of betel--a mildly narcotic chewing quid--was an essential element of traditional Burmese society. Every household, including the royal family's, had a set of utensils for its preparation. Betel leaves, used to wrap the blend of areca-nut shavings, lime and spices, were stored in the karaweik container. \n\nThis object was given to the Museum by the Government and people of Burma in generous recognition of the Victoria and Albert Museum's safekeeping of  the  Burmese royal regalia from 1886 to 1964.",
