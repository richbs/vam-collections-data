The principal market for the tiles was for churches, both new and restored.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThousands of British churches were restored or built during Queen Victoria's reign.  Architects and manufacturers worked together to provide designs for items such as tiles and metalwork, developing new techniques of production to satisfy growing demand. These tiles were designed by Pugin specifically for the altar area of a church. The designs appear in his 'Glossary of Ecclesiastical Ornament' (1846).\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe four tiles bear symbolic representations of the Four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, represented by an angel, a winged lion, a winged ox, and an eagle. These conventions had been established in the Medieval period, and are found regularly in Romanesque and Gothic art. Pugin's re-use of this symbolic imagery in the 19th century is yet another example of his re-working of Medieval religious themes.",
