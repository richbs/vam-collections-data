This fashion came from the football terraces where rosettes would be sold in your football team's colours; it lasted until punk fashion of the late 1970s replaced the ribbon rosette with much smaller button badges.\n\nThis rosette features an image of the band Slade, a British Glam rock band from the early 1970s. They had twelve top five singles in the UK between 1971 and 1974, have been cited as an influence by Kiss, and were covered in the 1990s by Oasis. Their 1973 song Merry Xmas Everybody has been re-released every decade since the 1970s, and in a 2007 MSN music poll was voted the UK's favourite Christmas song.",
