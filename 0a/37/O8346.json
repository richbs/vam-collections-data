The window was supported by symbols of the Four Evangelists, each bearing scrolls containing prophetic texts from the Old Testament. The text of the scroll here, non dabis sanct[um] tuum videre corruption[em] (\u2018Thou shalt not suffer thine holy body to see corruption\u2019), is from Psalm 15, and refers to the Resurrection of Christ.\n\nThe window was designed by Thomas Willement, a stained-glass artist of the Gothic Revival An entry in his account book for February 1845 describes the window, which had the Crucifixion in the centre.\n\nUnfortunately, the church was demolished in 1982 because of its poor condition. Two panels by Willement from the church were given to the Victoria and Albert Museum (the other is Museum number: C.150-1980, depicting the Presentation of Christ in the Temple). Two other panels, the Nativity and the Emblem of St Matthew, are in the Stained Glass Museum in Ely. We do not know what happened to the rest of the window. \n\nThomas Willement (1786\u20131871) was Heraldic Artist to George IV and Artist in Stained Glass to Queen Victoria. He opened a workshop in London and began designing stained-glass windows in 1812. He pioneered a return to the true principles of medieval craftsmanship, using lead to emphasise the main outlines of the design and to join the pieces of glass together. He introduced colour into his works by using \u2018pot metal\u2019 glass, that is, glass coloured by metallic oxides. This reduced the need for enamel paints.",
