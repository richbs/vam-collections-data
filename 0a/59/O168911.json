La Goulue ('The Glutton') earned her name from her habit of drinking glasses dry in bars. Despite her poor, laundress background, she spent her evenings dancing amongst the fashionable and worked her way up the Parisian social ladder. She was eventually engaged to dance the quadrille at the Moulin Rouge, where she high-stepped the cancan and became the queen of Montmartre.\n\nHer star fell quickly, however, when she left the Moulin Rouge, in 1895, becoming a destitute alcoholic after a touring show she invested in was unsuccessful and frittered away her fortune.\n\nThis poster is from the original Shaftesbury Theatre. It opened in 1888 and was later destroyed by bombing in 1941; there is now a fire station in its place. The current Shaftesbury Theatre, further down the road in Holborn, was renamed in 1963, having previously been The New Prince's Theatre.",
