Compare the locket with that on Cat. No. 140. [P.21-1955]\n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop from an unrecorded source; lent to the Museum 1927-49; ownership transferred to Alan Evans, 1933, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at theV&A.

(1) He did not comment on the restoration, and there is no subsequent record of 'conservation' of this kind being carried out at the Museum, so the retouches were presumably done between 1949 and 1974. \n\n1 MS note in Wallop Loan Book, no. 138.\u201d ",
