Many devotional ivories, whose authorship was unrecorded, were produced in the Netherlands during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly crucifix figures and statuettes of the Christ Child. During the seventeenth century, leading artists such as Francois Du Quesnoy, and later Francis van Bossuit, carved or inspired numerous small-scale ivory reliefs and figures, and it is relevant that both these artists, as well as other Netherlandish sculptors, spent significant periods of time in Italy. Other Netherlandish icory carvers emigrated to Britain in the eighteenth century.",
