F Talbot's photographic discoveries in the late 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produced a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\n\nFrom 1845, Jones took many marine subjects in South Wales, Bristol and Italy. This photograph is one of a set of prints most of which were photographed in Belgium. In 1853, Jones moved to Belgium and remained there until the death of his wife in 1856. During that time, he took photographs various locations, notably in Bruges and Ghent.",
