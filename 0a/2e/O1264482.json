            "history_note": "This is a gold version of the Personal Medal for HRH Prince Albert. He commissioned it privately from William Wyon, Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint, in 1844. Albert specified a St George design for the reverse and sat for his profile bust on the obverse (front). The medal\u2019s St George and the Dragon design is loosely based on an earlier sovereign coin design by Wyon\u2019s colleague at the Royal Mint, the Italian Benedetto Pistrucci, but bears a classical liveliness and realism in details such as the veins on the horse. Although this reverse design is neo-classical, the gothic script used in the inscription reflects the contemporary neo-gothic style (which was beginning to rival neo-classicism in popularity). A wax on slate model by Wyon related to this St George design is in the British Museum collections. He exhibited his models for this medal in 1844, and the finished medal in 1845, both at the Royal Academy.\n\nPrince Albert\u2019s Medal appears here as part of a group of seven medals in a Presentation Set given to Henry Cole following the Great Exhibition of 1851. The standard Presentation Sets of medals for the Great Exhibition were made up of the five official medals, and normal recipients would not have received the Prince\u2019s medal as part of their set. A number of these standard commemorative Presentation Sets of medals were given to the Commissioners (the Members of the Royal Commission, established in 1850 by Queen Victoria to organise the Great Exhibition of 1851, and actively presided over by Prince Albert) and a number of other Senior Officials involved in organising the Great Exhibition, and were also presented to the governments or rulers of every country to exhibit displays in the \u2018Crystal Palace\u2019. Very few individuals received additional medals and Henry Cole\u2019s Presentation Set of seven medals may well be unique.\n\nHenry Cole was the first Director of the South Kensington Museum (the forerunner of the V&A) and was one of the main organisers of the Great Exhibition on behalf of Prince Albert. A letter from the Prince to Henry Cole dated 15 October 1851 (the closing date of the Exhibition) informs him he will receive this Prince Albert Medal as a memorial to their achievements together, and this letter was bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum in 1883 by the executors of Henry Cole\u2019s will, alongside the medal. The medal was not actually issued until 1852 because of the production delays that affected the distribution of all the Great Exhibition medals, also referred to in the Prince\u2019s correspondence, which further highlights the importance of Cole\u2019s contribution:\n\n\u2018I hoped to day after the happy close of the Exhibition to have presented you a Medal a token of remembrance of our long communion in this work, but am obliged to use your words: \u201cthat it will be given out when the arrangements for it shall be completed,\u201d which I hope however will be soon. You have been one of the few who originated the design, became its exponent to the Public and fought its battles in adversity & belong now to those, who share in its triumphs; & it must be pleasing to you to reflect how much you have contributed to them by your untiring exertions as it is to me to acknowledge my sense of them.-\nBelieve me always\nYours truly\nAlbert\u2019\n\nWindsor Castle\nOctober 15. 1851.\n\nHenry Cole was also dubbed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by Queen Victoria on the closing of the Exhibition in recognition for his services. \n\nAn illustration of the obverse and reverse of this medal appears in the Illustrated London News of 1852, including a notice about its award to \u2018all members of the organising committee\u2019 of the Great Exhibition.  Henry Cole, Charles Dilke and several other Great Exhibition officials were presented with Prince Albert's gold medal.",
