The seal then denoted the legality of the document and the identification of the issuing authority or individual.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe practice of wearing a seal ring engraved with a heraldic crest became common in England in the 15th century.  At first the ring was only engraved with the crest (the top part of a complete coat of arms). However, after the mid-16th century it became usual for a gentleman to wear a 'seal of arms' like this ring, which has a complete shield. \n\nThis ring has the crest of the Throckmortons on one side, and the arms of the Carews on the other. The reason for the double seal is that its owner, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, became heir to his uncle, Francis Carew of Beddington, on his death in 1611.  He acknowledged his inheritance by taking on the name of Carew, so this ring must date from after 1611. . He erected a funerary monument in 1611 in the Carew Chapel of Beddington Church \u2018to the memorie of his deare and well deserving unckle\u2019. The inscription on the tomb explains that  \u2018The said Sir  Francis living unmarried, adopted Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, sonne of Anne Throckmorton, his sister, to be heire of his estate and to beare his surname\u2019. \n\nPeople\nSir Nicholas Throckmorton (about 1560-1643), who owned the ring, came from a colourful family much involved with the court.  His paternal grandfather, Sir George Throckmorton, was related through his wife to Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's last wife.  His father, also Sir Nicholas, (1515-1571) was a staunch Protestant, who was cleared by a jury of treason under Mary I. He was then entrusted with high-level diplomatic missions to France and Scotland under Elizabeth I.  The sister of the younger Sir Nicholas (the owner of the ring) married the navigator and author Sir Walter Raleigh (1552-1618).",
