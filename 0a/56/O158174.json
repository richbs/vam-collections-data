Charles I's reign (1625-49) was characterised by the struggles between court and parliament which culminated in the English Civil War (1642-51) and the execution of the king in 1649.  The Restoration commenced in 1660 with the institution of his son, Charles II, as monarch.  This box bears a Latin inscription translating as 'Long live the King, may the law run its course, may the flock flourish', a motto in keeping with some Restoration attitudes towards kingship. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The engraving on the cover can be seen in the same light as the rings and other objects which commemorate Charles I.  The winged putti are,  it is reasonable to suggest, acting as angels holding the crown about Charles' head.  The crown is not a martyr's crown, but the image of the king with the crown supported by the putti, with the symbols of the nations, and the Latin insription connecting the king, laws,  and the prosperity of  the people, is that of the martyred king who died for his country and its laws.  At his trial Charles in 1649 told his accusers that he was the champion of the people of England:\n'do you pretend what you will, I stand more for their liberties.  For if power without law may make laws, may alter the fundamental laws of the kingdom, I  do not know what subject he is in England, that can be sure of his life, or anything he calls his own'.  'For the charge, I value it not a rush; it is the liberty of the people of England that I stand for'. \n\nThe case advanced in <u>Eikon Basilike: The Portrait of of His Sacred Majesty in his Solitudes and Sufferings</u> by Charles (with the assistance of John Gauden, Bishop of Exeter), of which advanced copies were available on the day of execution, is that 'civil justice' depended on a relationship between the royal prerogative and the people's 'liberties, which consists in the enjoyment of the fruits of their industry and the benefit of those laws to which they themselves have consented' (all these quotations from Tim Blanning, <u>The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815</u>, London: Penguin Books, 2008, pp. 197-9).  According to Blanning, <u>Eikon Basilike</u> had appeared in 35 English editions by the end of 1649, and eight on the Continent.\n\nAfter the Restoration, the Convocation of Canterbury and York canonised Charles in 1660 and added his name as King and Martyr to the Kalendar of Saints at the revision of the Prayer Book in 1662.",
