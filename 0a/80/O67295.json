One foundation weft after each row of weft-wrapping which goes over four threads and back under two threads; 26 rows of soumak per inch/104 per dm\n\nSIDE FINISH: returned weft\n\nEND FINISH: cut\n\nDESIGN: Field: red ground with three rows of off-set stylised blossoms.  The two outer rows have paired blossoms: an indented dark blue oval containing a horizontal palmette [three pairs in total] and three pairs of similar but smaller green blossoms with a central white star within a blue rosette.There is one pair of dark blue indented rectangles with a pair of white extensions and three dark blue curved extnesions and within is a dark blue star within a white rosette.  There is also a pair of similar white rosettes from which extend four blue arrows and four green blossoms.  In the off-set central row this device is repeated three times and separates three flame-edged medallions: the lowest is green the middle one is dark blue and the upper one is green.  It is symmetrical across the central vertical axis but there are differences between the top and the bottom. Along the edge are inward and outward facing black lines with small leaves in a variety of colours.  longer lines bearing these leaves lie on the field, especially around the most central motifs, predominantly in diagonal lines.  There is a band of three blue/white palmettes and two red/yellow horizontal palemttes along one end and a band a three of each along the other.  The junction between the field and the border is a reciprocal diamond-head in red/blue.\nsBorder: white ground with the 'Seichour' pattern in blue, white, black and red with an inward facingfloral sprig coming from the outer edge.\n\nDate catalogued: 10/03/1999",
