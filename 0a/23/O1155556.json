From 1947 to the closure of the business in 1993 they made thousands of different characters and ranges of puppets for children including hand and marionette varieties.\n\nPelham puppets used simple construction methods, materials and influences that reflected the decades in which they were made. Pelham puppets often took influence from popular fairy tales and stories for their puppets. This particular puppet depicts Andy Pandy from the very popular childrens BBC television programme in the 1960's.",
