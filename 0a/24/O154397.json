It is etched into four layers in a flowing pattern over the whole surface. The highly original, parallel split-ribbons lift rises, turns and transforms into a contoured, tubular, tapering handle that is etched over its whole surface in a complementary pattern. The handle is open at both extremities. The surface of the server is lightly anodized and has a lightly brushed satin finish. It will obviously do as well for cake as for fish, and illustrates well the sometimes artificial and semantic nature of the appellations that are used.",

The handle swirls with a memory of Art Nouveau, plunging down into the layered depths of the pool below. This is a wonderfully evocative piece, while retaining an acute respect for function, with its graspable handle and generous broad blade.",
