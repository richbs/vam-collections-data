The rings were used in the same way as a rosary . A 'Hail Mary' (Ave Maria) prayer was said for each of the knobs, and then an 'Our Father' (Paternoster) for the bezel (the centre of the ring).\n\nOwnership & Use\nRosaries were forbidden in England and Wales by a statute of 1571, but the act does not mention decade rings. They continued to be made until at least the 18th century for use by Roman Catholics (who were known as 'recusants', because they refused to attend Church of England services). Many decade rings survive from the Liverpool area with its substantial Catholic population. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nDecade rings in which the bezel was engraved with a saint appeared in the middle of the 15th century, but ceased to be produced after the Reformation. In this instance the bezel is engraved with the letter 'S'. This could have a religious significance (standing for servus or 'servant' of Christ), but may simply be the initial letter of the owner's name.",
