The rapier and dagger combination was primarily designed for self defence using fighting techniques developed in Italy that are the ancestors of modern fencing. The rapier was both a slashing and stabbing weapon. Its accompanying dagger was used in the left hand for parrying and stabbing in close. The stiff slender blades of both were designed to pierce clothing rather than armour. The intricately pierced cup protected the hand the uncovered civilian hand.\n\nThe rapier and dagger were also male fashion accessories worn at court, in procession and about town. They projected an image of honour based on social standing and, if necessary, defended the owner in one-on-one combat.",

            "historical_context_note": "This dagger would have once been twinned with a rapier, a long sword with a slender blade and elaborate hilt. The rapier and dagger combination was primarily designed for self-defence using fighting techniques developed in Italy that are the ancestors of modern fencing. The sixteenth century rapier was both a slashing and stabbing weapon. Its accompanying dagger was used in the left hand for parrying and stabbing in close. The stiff slender blades of both were designed to pierce clothing rather than armour.\n\nThe rapier and dagger were also male fashion accessories worn at court, in procession and about town. They projected an image of honour based on social standing and, if necessary, defended the owner in one-on-one combat. The private duel was one consequence of the development of the rapier. In this sense, it is the epitome of the new sense of self fostered by the Renaissance. It was an emblem of personal vanity that settled disputes privately.\n\nThe conservative English defence expert, George Silver, felt a noble heritage of purpose-made war blades, clubs, flails and maces had been sacrificed at the altar of fashion as swords and daggers became faddish civilian accessories. \u2018We like degenerate sonnes, have forsaken our forefathers vertues with their weapons.\u2019\n\nSome of the finest chiselled iron cup hilts in the Spanish fashion were produced by Italian craftsmen from the Kingdom of Naples, under Spanish rule in the mid 17th century. In their designs the Italian chisellers drew upon the common stock of engraved ornament of their time, but, interpreting their sources in a particularly individual manner, they created something that was quite fresh and original.",
