At the bottom right is the figure of the seated St. Anne, the mother of the Virgin, grieving after the departure of her husband, Joachim. To the left a haloed, bearded man is held by the hand by a mitred high priest. The former probably represents Joseph, and thus the scene would have formed the left half of the Marriage of the Virgin. In the second register, on the left, a haloed young female figure is shown supported by an angel, perhaps illustrating the Virgin as an adolescent, visited by angels during her time in the Temple. On the right is a crowd of onlookers, led by a cowled figure. In the top register, on the left, a female figure moves forward with arms extended, possibly to be identified as Anne meeting Joachim at the Golden Gate. On the right are two men holding books, probably the elders of the Temple consulted about the refusal of the Virgin to take a husband.\n[Panel] Panel of clear, coloured and flashed glass with painted details of a scene from a window depicting the Life of the Virgin Mary. This scene is believed to depict the priest of the Temple leading St Joseph. Originally in the Lady Chapel of Saint Germain de Pr\u00e9s.

            "public_access_description": "The scenes in this window are believed to be episodes in the 'Life of the Virgin Mary', mother of Jesus Christ. Such a window was erected in the centre of the apse of the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church of Saint Germain de Pr\u00e9s in Paris. This abbey was closed down at the end of the 18th century and the Lady Chapel itself was destroyed in 1805. Prior to that, the windows from the church had been removed and some of them ended up in a temporary museum in Paris. After this museum was closed in 1816, the windows were sold. Some ended up in museum collections, others were reinstated in the church and others simply disappeared. This window here is now believed to have been part of the Lady Chapel 'Life of the Virgin Mary' window. The 6 panels that form this window are a modern arrangement and so it is difficult to be certain which scenes from the Life are depicted.\n\nThe scenes probably depict St Anne, mother of Mary, grieving over her husband Joachim's decision to withdraw to the country. Joachim's offering to the Temple had been rejected by the Temple elders because the couple were childless and he withdrew in dispair and shame. During this separation, an angel appeared to Joachim and also to Anne to tell them that Anne would conceive. Joachim returns and one of the scenes on this window probably shows Anne waiting for him at the Golden Gate. Anne and Joachim's child was Mary. In thanksgiving for her birth, her parents dedicated her to the Temple and when Mary was 14, the Temple elders were directed by God to find her a husband. A number of suitors assembled, one of whom was the elderly St Joseph. The bottom scene on the left of the window may depict a Temple Elder bringing the rather relunctant Joseph to the Temple. The story goes on that God showed favour on Joseph by causing his rod to blossom, thus signalling that he was chosen to be Mary's husband.\n\nThe New Testament of the Bible contains no information on the life of Mary prior to the birth of Jesus Christ. In the early centuries of the Christian faith, various authors wrote stories to fill gaps in our knowledge of persons important in Christianity. These writings were not authorised by the Church but were popular and were re-written many times over the centuries. Collectively, they were known as the 'Apocrypha'.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, these apocryphal accounts were included, along with other stories of the lives of Christian saints, in popular texts such as the 'Speculum Historiale' ('Mirror of History') and the Golden Legend. These texts exerted a great deal of influence over the imagery of artworks made for the Church. It is also at this time that the Church recognised the importance of celebrating the lives of people such as St Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary. A Feast Day was established in her name. No information on her life exists other than in the Apocrypha and then in the compilation of these stories and saints' lives mentioned above.",
