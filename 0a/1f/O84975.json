Exhibited with the Norwich School, and member of the Sketching Society; showed 46 works at the RA between 1801 and 1836, 30 at the BI 1806-30 (winning a prize 1809), and four at the SBA 1825-6. Subjects were sent from London addresses, and included portraits, genre (usually humorous), and many theatrical subjects. Redgrave thought his art has \"a tendency to vulgarity'. Several of his works were engraved; four examples are in the V&A collections. His lecture to the Norwich\nPhilosophical Society in 1820 was published as 'An Essay on Gesture' in the <u>Annals of the Fine Arts</u>. Died Boulogne, France, 1840. \n\nLIT: T Smith <u>Recollections of the British Institution </u>1860, pp33, 51, 59, 85; Redgrave <u>Dict; Portfolio</u> 32, 1897, pp34, 42; DNB \n\n<b>Miss Duncan in 'The Honeymoon' </b>\nD36  Neg H1607 \nCanvas, 29.2 X 20.3 cm (11\u00bd X 8 ins) \nDyce Bequest 1869 \n\nMaria Rebecca Duncan, later Mrs Davison (1783-1858), played the part of Juliana (her most famous role) in John Tobin's <i>The Honeymoon</i> at its first performance at Drury Lane on 31 January 1805. The scene depicted is act 3 scene 4. It is strange that the engraving was published (see <i>Engr</i>: below) so shortly before the revival of the play at Drury Lane on 30 June 1827, when the part was taken by a Miss Lawrence rather than Miss Duncan. For another painting of <i>The Honeymoon</i>, and further details of the play, see George Clint, FA23, p30. \n\nENGR: Robert Cooper, pub 1 March 1827 (copy in the V&A collections, also from the Dvce Bequest, D3084) \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
