He studied art at the Academies of Amsterdam, Anvers and D\u00fcsseldorf. Webb moved to the latter in 1848 and whilst there he became a pupil of Wilhelm Camphausen. He occasionally worked in Anvers and Cleves but settled and remained largely in D\u00fcsseldorf for the majority of his life. He made a name for himself particularly as a painter of genre subjects and some of his most successful and well received paintings were taken from English life and history. He died in early December 1895 from injuries sustained from a fall.\n\n<i>Politicians </i>is painted in a style that was typical of Webb\u2019s genre paintings. The scene depicted is a rustic interior abounding with the accoutrements of everyday life. It was painted at D\u00fcsseldorf for John Forster in 1865 for the sum of \u00a350.",
