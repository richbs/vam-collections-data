In 1961 Charles Oman suggested that they originally belonged to a larger hoard of silver, whose origin is unknown but was possibly near Gaillon in Normandy. This hoard also included pieces now found in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny (traditionally thought to have been excavated in 1851 at the Ch\u00e2teau of Gaillon, once the country palace of the archbishops of Rouen), in the Basilewsky Collection now in the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg and in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris.\n\nHistorical significance: French domestic silver of this period is extremely rare.",
