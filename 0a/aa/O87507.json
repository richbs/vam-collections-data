Marble, on the other hand, is a hard, fine-grained, crystalline stone, which has to be carved with chisels and a mallet. All can be polished with fine abrasive powders, with marble, in particular, taking a high polish. Solnhofen stone is similar to marble in colour, but soft. It comes from quarries near Solnhofen in Franconia in southern Germany. Sculptors in Nuremberg, Augsburg and Eichst\u00e4dt used it from the 1570s.\n\nThis composition is a reworking of an early 16th century adaptation of the theme, typical of the northern Renaissance. Although not directly related to a specific example, the composition reflects the treatment of similar groups in the prints of Albrecht D\u00fcrer.",
