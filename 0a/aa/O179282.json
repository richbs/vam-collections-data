It is Coptic Egyptian, probably from the 4th or 5th century  (Coptic / late Antique).\n\nCoptic refers to the Copts, which are Christian Egyptians with ancient origins dating back to the first century.\n\nSimilar carvings, many of  which follow the more or less convex curve of the bone, have been found in great quantities, chiefly in the district of Alexandria. The figure subjects are usually taken from mythology and are similar to those on textiles, but occasionally biblical scenes occur. The carvings were probably used in the decoration of wooden caskets.",
