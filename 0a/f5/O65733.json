Ackermann claims that this is the first example of the depiction of this scene to have been discovered in Gandharan art.\n      This formerly rectangular panel has a diagonal break from the top left hand corner through to the middle of the lower edge, so that a quarter of the narrative scene is missing. The scene is carved against a flat back slab without any framing.  On the right hand side there is a figure entirely wrapped in snake coils with only his head visible under the spreading  hood of the snake's seven hoods. On either side further snakes have risen up with their heads looping downwards. On the left hand side the upper part of a monk is seen turning  to his right.  Behind his head there is a horizontally ribbed rectangular object and a series of roughly radiating scored lines, possibly denoting rain.  In the extreme upper left hand corner there can be seen the remnants of a doorway or window  out of which appears the top half of a head with a flattened ushnisha on top",
