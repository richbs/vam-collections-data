The attribution of the terracotta to Michelangelo is rejected by Thode (<u>Michelangelo</u>, vi, Berlin, 1913, p. 283, No. 4101), who compares it with the supposed model for the right hand of the Moses formerly in the H\u00e4hnel collection (A.8-1938, No. 450, q.v.). Frey (<u>Michelagniolo Buonarroti</u>, i, Berlin, 1907, p. 245 n., ii, p. 22, No. 12 and n.) regards the hand as \"ein sp\u00e4tes Machwerk...vielleicht zur \u00dcbung angefertigt, vielleicht auch eine F\u00e4lschung; wie ich glaube nach Passerottis Studien\".",
