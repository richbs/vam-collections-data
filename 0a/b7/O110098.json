It was carved by the artist Arthur Wilkinson (1882-1957) who was inspired to make puppets in 1914 by some toy Italian puppets. He started as a professional puppeteer by touring England in a caravan with his brother Walter and performing with puppets he carved.Walter Wilkinson went on to concentrate on the revival of glove puppetry in Britain, while Arthur Wilkinson continued with marionettes.\n\nBy the 1920s Arthur Wilkinson was so concerned that puppetry had become neglected in England that he began The Marionette Society to produce marionette theatre throughout the country. He launched the society with a performances at the Poetry Bookshop in London in November 1923, using his own figures including Harlequin, Columbine, the dragon and Pantaloon. By 1928 he had carved the remarkable set of marionettes illustrated on a flier for his show including the monkey and Marino, Pagliacci and Pimpinella, and Harlequin and Columbine. After Arthur Wilkinson married Lily Gair they became known as the 'Gair Wilkinson Marionettes' and he later assumed the name Gair Wilkinson professionally.",

He launched the society with a series of performances at the Poetry Bookshop in London in November 1923, using his own figures including Harlequin, Columbine, the dragon and Pantaloon.  An original advertisement for the show mentions: 'an entirely new Harlequinade showing such contrivances in Scenic Art as shall set both Harlequin and Columbine dancing with delight'.\n\nMost of these figures probably date from about 1920. When Arthur and Walter performed The Wilkinson Puppet Show at Heal's in November 1921 the reviewer noted a Harlequin, a Pantaloon, a Clown, Il Capitano, Columbine and and a Blackamoor. We know that most of the marionettes in this collection were in use by 1928 since a hand-coloured leaflet produced by Gair Wilkinson to publicise his show is illustrated with Harlequin on the cover and inside with Pimpinella and Pagliacco, between the Dragon (which St George fought to rescue Princess Cleodolinda), and Pantaloon, who took part in the Harlequinade.\n\nThese superbly carved marionettes, presented to the museum by Gair Wilkinson's daughter, are important in the history of the 20th-century revival of puppetry in Great Britain and are delightful objects for exhibition.",
