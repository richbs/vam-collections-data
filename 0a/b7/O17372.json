It is interesting to note that this picture was exhibited in the same year as Dickens first introduced Little Nell and her grandfather to the reading public.  The artist appended lines of verse, unattributed, to the title in the exhibition catalogue:\n   Youth in its dawn, daring the thorough fare\n   Of life with fearless foot and roving eye,\n   Age in its humble lustre,  breathing prayer\n   Upon the threshold of eternity!\nDeath with the accompanying expectation of eternal life is suggested by the tombstone, the spade and the freshly dug grave in the churchyard.  The old countryman pauses at the church door while his grand-daughter looks at him no doubt wondering why he has raised his hat in tribute.  The figures were painted from life, the child being the artist's young cousin,  and the elderly man the local sexton of the village in which Horsley was staying in the summer of 1839.",

Studied at Sass's art school and the RA Schools. Painted portraits, literary and historical subjects, domestic genre (often in historical costume), and rural genre scenes. Exhibited 121 works at the RA between 1839 and 1896, and 11 at the BI 1837-50. Elected ARA 1855, RA 1864. Won prizes in the competitions for the decoration of the Palace of Westminster 1843, 1844 and 1847. Some of his works were engraved; he also contributed etchings to the publications of the Etching Club and drawings to <i>Punch</i>, and in 1843 designed the first Christmas card. Associated with the artist's colony at Cranbrook, Kent, where he bought a house in 1858. At the RA, he was Rector 1875-90 (his campaign against the use of naked models in life classes earned him the soubriquet 'Clothes-Horsley'), Treasurer 1882-97, and initiator and organiser of the first Winter Exhibitions of old masters. Died Kensington, 18 October 1903. The painter Walter Charles and architect Gerald Callcott were his sons. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1857, pp181-4; <i>Illustrated London News</i> 24 October 1903, p608 (obit with photograph); J C Horsley <i>Recollections of a Royal Academican</i> 1903 (referred to below as <i>Recollections</i>); A Greg <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> exhibition catalogue Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977 \n\n<b>The Contrast: Youth and Age</b> \nFA81 Neg 51716 \nPanel, 45.7 x 40.6 cm (18 x 16 ins) \nSigned and dated 'J C H/1839' on tombstone at 1 \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1840, with the title 'The Contrast' and the following verse quoted without attribution in the catalogue: \n\nYouth in its dawn, daring the thorough fare \nOf life with fearless foot and roving eye \nAge in its humbled lustre, breathing prayer \nUpon the threshold of eternity! \n\nAccording to <i>Recollections</i>, it was bought from the artist by John Sheepshanks. On his first visit to Sheepshanks \n\nI told him I was painting another picture about the same size as the one he had already bought from me ['The Rival Performers', FA83, p129]. He cheerfully told me he would come and look at it. When next in town he at once settled to buy it, and plunging his hand into his very shabby coat-pocket, produced a cheque book, and asking for a pen and ink, wrote the cheque to pay for it on the spot, as was his invariable custom. This picture was called 'Youth and Age', and represents an aged countryman going into church with his little grandchild leading the way. \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> critic wrote: \n\nA little school girl is followed by a venerable man, whom she turns round for one instant to survey with gentle curiosity - the arch of the sacred building, by calling the thoughts away from earth, harmonizing these extremes of life, and reminding us how brief is the career just beginning, and just closing, when compared with the measureless past and future. \n\nThe <i>Recollections</i> note that the model for the child was the artist's young cousin, daughter of the Rev John Wall Buckley, with whom he had been staying in Totherfield, Sussex; the old man was the village sexton. This seems appropriate, for further reference is made to the brevity of earthly life by the tombstone on the left of the painting and the freshly dug grave at the right. \n\nHorsley exhibited another painting with the title 'Youth and Age' at the RA in 1857 (180), showing an old widow and a group of village children. \n\nEXH: RA 1840 (117); <i>Exposition Universelle</i>, Paris 1855 (833, as 'L'Enfance et la Vieillesse', lent by Sheepshanks) \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 16 May 1840, p401; <i>Recollections</i> pp50-2\"",
