Silver dishes of this shape, often containing an abundant display of fresh fruit, can be seen on Dutch still life paintings of the period. They were also made in tin-glazed earthenware decorated in Chinese style.\n\nThe potters of Delft made such products to compete with the very sought after and expensive porcelains imported by the Dutch East India Company from China. Most of the pottery in Delft was painted in blue on a white, tin-glaze ground, but purple and yellow pigments were also used. Here, the yellow pigment is applied over the blue, making it appear green.",
