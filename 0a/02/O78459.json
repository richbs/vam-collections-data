Driven by a curiosity about the past,  there was a revival of interest in the designs of antique silver  and a desire once again to display it on the sideboard. The grand buffets of the past began once more  to grace the dining rooms of the aristocracy.\n\nTrading\nAlthough the vase was made Benjamin Smith (1764-1823) , it was probably sold by the Royal Goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge & Rundell. Smith had managed a workshop in Greenwich near London for Rundells until 1807, but continued to supply the firm. The designs, so closely related to those of Rundells' other  main workshop managed by Paul Storr (1771-1844), must reflect the central control exercised by the Royal Goldsmiths. The vase may have been returned to the firm in the 1820s for engraving, since this records that the piece was presented as a marriage gift by  Alexander Saunderson in 1828.",
