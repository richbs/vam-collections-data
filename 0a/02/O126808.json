Palmer, this work is \nthe one of this title exhibited at the Royal \nAcademy in 1829 (641). It illustrates the \nmoment in the biblical story of Ruth \nwhen she brought the barley she had \ngleaned in the field back to the city: \n \nSo she gleaned in the field until even, \nand beat out that she had gleaned: and \nit was about an ephah of barley. And \nshe took it up, and went into the city: \nand her mother in law saw what she  \nhad gleaned: and she brought forth, \nand gave to her that she had reserved \nafter she was sufficed (Ruth 2:17-18) \n \nRuth is shown striding towards the city \nwith her ephah of barley under her \nmassive arm. The exaggerated forms of \nthis figure emphasizing power suggest \nPalmer\u2019s admiration for Fuseli,  \nMichelangelo and the Italian \nMannerists. It is an extraordinarily \nheroic concept of the female heroine of \nthe biblical story. In the middle ground  \nRuth\u2019s mother-in-law Naomi can be seen \nbefore her cottage, reading a book by \ncandlelight. \n \nThe theme of the Moabite woman  \nwho gradually gained acceptance among \nthe Hebrews through the display of  \ndecency and modesty had a prominent \nplace in Christian iconography because  \nshe was the great-grandmother of King  \nDavid and hence an ancestress of Christ. \nThe humane and sympathetic treatment  \nof her story in Ruth was a further reason \nfor her appeal.  \n \nPalmer may have been more attracted \nto the theme because of its resonances \nwith the contemporary rural community \n(see cat. 48). This biblical scene of a \ngleaner returning home is the equivalent \nin that sense of his images of gleaners in \nShoreham. Gleaning, furthermore, was a \nsensitive and much debated subject in  \nrural economy of the time. Traditional \nfarmers had always allowed the poor to \nglean from their fields after they had \ngathered the harvest in, while modern  \nmethods gathered more efficiently and \nthus denied the poor this bounty. \nGleaning represented the humane \u2018old \norder\u2019 that the modern world was  \ndestroying.\u2019\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
