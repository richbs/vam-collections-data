In his book Bookseller at the Ballet, Cyril Beaumont describes how he was inspired by the designs for the Diaghilev Ballet and by the atmosphere of the studio of painter Adrian Allinson, to attempt painting himself, trying to copy reproductions of the designs while giving his own impressions of the ballet.  To his surprise, he sold the first of his paintings, of Scheherazade, but Allinson's own reaction to Beaumont's work was 'he paints' rather than 'he is an artist'.",
