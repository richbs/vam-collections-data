This view of his own studio-cum-sitting room in a modern flat, made one year after he started work for Vogue, shows an informal Bohemian interior of the period. The low tables and flower container on the hearth are starkly simple and the armchair has its forms softened by a loose cover. The only strong note, as so often in modernistic interiors of the 1920s and 1930s, is the rug.\n\n[Michael Snodin, 'British Design at Home', p.122]",
