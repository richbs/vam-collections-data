He later became the superintendent of a glassworks near Madrid, Spain, before moving to Paris to work as an engraver. He later worked at  the factories at Chaumont-sur-Loire, in a glass and ceramics workshop. \nNini made his medallions in terracotta cast from moulds carved in wax. He did approximately 100 different roundels all just with an obverse. \nNini was a friend of Franklin and created images which became the most popular and most frequently repeated ones of Franklin.
