The cuffs are shaped to the elbow and ruched.  The skirt is tightly gathered and laid on top of the back bodice in a point.  Inside there are two green silk looped cords to gather up the skirt which fasten to the silk covered button above the waist on each side bodice seam. The bodice and sleeves are lined with white linen.  There are two bones down the centre back with a tape stitched at the centre back waist. The skirt is faced back with white silk.\n\nThe Polonaise is in matching material. It consists of a petticoat panel which has been converted into a ca. 1830 apron by shortening and mounting it at the waist on a figured blue green ribbon to which is added a long green tasselled cord.",

Using buttons and loops, the skirt of the gown was draped up to create the swathed effect at the back shown here. Also popular during this decade were a range of striped fabrics, often in a complex arrangement of colours with both sharp and shaded edges, as seen in this example. \n\nDraping the skirt was not only a fashionable option. It also served as a practical method of raising the skirt above the dirt and dust on the ground.",
