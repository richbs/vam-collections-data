What sets these apart is the use of initials as the focus of each pendant. Each set of initials is set on a dark ground and topped with ribbon work and a winged cherub head and hung with three pearls. Some of the pendant designs are accompanied by designs for buttons or smaller pin ornaments as well. As these designs were probably meant to be sold to jewelers who would use them for inspiration and design, it is quite likely that the initials are simply arbitrary combinations of letters. In these designs, Birckenhultz follows the work of his German predecessor Hans Holbein, whose similar designs for jewellery may be seen in the British Museum.",
