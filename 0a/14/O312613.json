Alterations to the house were subsequently carried out by Sir John Soane for J.R. Barker in 1789, and designs for the present chimneypiece are in Sir John Soane's Museum. A relief on the frieze is based on a drawing from the antique made by Soane when in Rome. \n\nSir John Soane was an architect and collector. He trained with George Dance, who instilled in him the 'first principles' of nature, truth, fitness and purpose. Soane used these, together with influences from many diverse sources, in a way that earned him recognition as the most original British architect of his period. He used concealed and top-lighting in his interiors to create uncanny effects that he referred to as 'lumi\u0160re myst\u201arieuse' (mysterious light). It was perfectly suited to his redesign of the Bank of England , where side windows were mainly forbidden, and used to wonderful effect at another commission, Dulwich Gallery.  His house in Lincoln's Inn Fields is now the Soane Museum, and houses his vast collection of antiquities, paintings and books.The Breakfast Room, with its extraordinary 'floating' domed ceiling, is a typical example of Soane's originality.",
