The picture was probably inspired by Anna's birth in 1867 and his wife's long illness that led to her death that summer. Alma-Tadema returned to this subject twice more in <i>A nurse Sunday morning</i> (LXXVIII, 1870) and No 139 (1871). The picture was exhibited with No 105 at the Levende Meesters Exhibition in Amsterdam in 1868, earning Alma-Tadema the Knighthood of the Order of the Dutch Lion. He probably chose this subject to exhibit in Holland, rather than a classical one, because it conformed more to Dutch tastes.\"",
