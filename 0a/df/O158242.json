The legs are joined by three stretchers in H-formation. The back of the chair is almost square, tapering outwards slightly at the top.  The back uprights and rails are carved with a shallow, curving depression on the front face. At their junction are cube blocks, the front faces carved with paterae.  The centre of the back is open, set with four turned columns forming three round-headed arches just below the chair rail, which, above the arches, is thicker in form to create a frieze, set with three star mounts in brass. The upholstery is not original.",

The design of the back is certainly similar to engraved designs published by Thomas Sheraton in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing Book, first published in 1792, although it is not identifiable with any particular design. Sheraton, however, had strong influence on other countries than England and it is possible that this is a Dutch design, influenced by Sheraton. The very strong taper to the legs and the slight outward splay to the sides of the back panel, are features found on Dutch chairs in the eighteenth century. The stretchers may be a later addition to the chair.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
