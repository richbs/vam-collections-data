            "history_note": "Historical Significance: Giuseppe Zais was born in 1709 in Belluno. He moved to Venice in the 1720s or 30s to practice as a landscape painter. Here the first major influence on him was that of the slightly older Marco Ricci, who also came from Belluno. His etchings, published around 1730, provided a useful source of inspiration for Zais. From them he derived the style of his landscapes, usually framed by trees, into which villages and figures were inserted in thick impasto. This descriptive and simple manner was refined later on through the contact with Francesco Zuccarelli. \n\nThroughout his life, Zais worked tirelessly to suit the various requirements of his patrons. He created landscape, battle scenes, frescoes and book illustration. Zais was supported by Joseph Smith, the English Consul in Venice and one of the most important foreign patrons in the city. Unfortunately, none of the works executed for Smith can be identified. Zais was accepted by the Venetian Academy as a landscapist only in 1774, 9 years after his application. He died in poverty in Treviso during the winter of 1781. \n\nThe drawing depicts a rural scene, with peasants on the left and cottages and a river on the rights. It seems that the composition is more finished in the foreground, where the amount of detail and the attention to the depiction of shadow is greater. The background consists mainly of a light sketch of clouds. The drawing was formerly attributed to Zuccarelli. However, there are visible differences in technique and style (see Dyce 699), which led to the attribution to Zais.",
