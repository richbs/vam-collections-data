There are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian, and each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  Ring brooches differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  \n\nA boles\u00f8lje is a large ring brooch decorated with six raised circular mounts.  It takes its name from a medieval cylindrical box, called a bole.  It is unique to Norway.  Brooches like this were always expensive, because of their size and weight.  In the 18th century they were usually cast, but by the 19th century most were made of filigree.  Boles\u00f8ljer mainly come from the south of Norway.\n\nThis brooch is decorated with alternating lions and griffins on the raised cylinders.  This design originally had crowned heads, representing St Olav, between the cylinders, but these deteriorated over time until they were reduced to the anonymous domes on this example.  There is a small Madonna and Child on the pin.",
