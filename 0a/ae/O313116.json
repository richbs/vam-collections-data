A small oval silver relief of <i>Christ as Man of Sorrows</i>, seated on the cold stone, is set into the frame above the ivory relief, and an irregularly shaped rectangular silver cartouche showing <i>Christ carrying the Cross</i> is set into the frame below the ivory. The rest of the frame is decorated with tortoiseshell panels, silver strapwork, and ivory strips, many of them painted green, analogous to the decoration on the frame on A.94-1923.",

The maker of the ivory reliefs is anonymous, but the frame was made by Andreas Thelot. The composition is frequent in Italian art and the carving may be based on a 16th or 17th century painting or engraving. \nThis altar and the companion altar (A.94-1923) were noted in a memorandum at the time of acquisition as having 'considerable decorative value' (Museum records). They are analogous stylistically to over twenty other ivory reliefs of devotional subjects, which Theuerkauff has identified as a cohesive group.",
