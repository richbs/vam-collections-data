The artist successfully captured a blend of traditional English architecture and classically-inspired elements such as the spiral columns. Hoefnagel meticulously reproduced the framed stucco panels that lined the palace walls. With fine lines of black pen heightened with white, the artist illustrated the moulded high-relief panels depicting Roman emperors, gods and goddesses as well as the Labours of Hercules. Hoefnagel then balanced the exquisite detail of Nonsuch Palace with the sweeping countryside in muted hues of green and brown. Hoefnagel utilised this drawing for an engraving in the fifth volume of Civitates Orbis Terarum, an atlas of towns, in which Nonsuch Palace received a dedicated plate, a credit to its fame.",

            "public_access_description": "Nonsuch Watercolour\n\nThis watercolour by Joris Hoefnagel shows Henry VIII's remarkable Palace, an unparalleled Renaissance hunting lodge, which only stood for about one hundred and fifty years. A handful of views survive; this is the earliest and perhaps the most significant of them all.  Henry conceived Nonsuch as an architectural expression of the power and supremacy of the Tudor Dynasty.  Its dazzling fusion of English, French and Italian forms rivalled the newly built palaces of the French King Francis I at Fontainebleau and Chambord.  In the words of the poet John Leland:\n\n   This, which no equal has in art or fame, \n   Britons deservedly do Nonsuch name.\n\nConstruction began on St.George's Day, 23 April 1538. The local parish church of Cuddington, near Ewell in Surrey, was demolished to make way. This showed the king's dominance as head of the Church in England. The date was also significant; it was the thirtieth anniversary of Henry's accession to the throne, and the first birthday of his long-waited, only legitimate son, Edward. \n\nEntering through the square gatehouse of the Outer Court with its traditional battlements, one sixteenth-century visitor to Nonsuch was 'struck senseless' by the Renaissance-inspired Inner Court. As you can see on the watercolour - look closely with the magnifying glass - the upper parts of the walls were completely covered in stucco reliefs, representing the Labours of Hercules, Roman Emperors, Classical gods and goddesses. Set amongst these carved figures, literally amongst the gods, were reliefs of Henry and son Edward.  Many of the carvings were the work of the Italian sculptor Nicholas Bellin of Modena, who had worked for King Francis I at Fontainebleau.  In 1959, Hoefnagel's incredibly detailed painting was shown to be surprisingly accurate.  Archaeological excavations unearthed pieces of a stucco figure leaning on a shield, directly beneath the point where a similar relief is shown in the painting.\n\nHenry died in 1547, before the palace was completed. In 1670 Charles II gave it to one of his mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine. In the 1680s Barbara Villiers had the palace demolished; she used the building materials to pay her gambling debts.  \n\nAudioguide text for Treasures of the Royal Courts, 2013",
