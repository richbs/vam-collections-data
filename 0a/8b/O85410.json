The performance was scene 7 of the revue, choreographed by Massine, an adaptation of Hogarth's series of paintings A Rake's Progress, simply entitled The Rake.\n\nThe scene was painted by Gluck, an artist well-known in the 1920s and 30s for her portraits and floral paintings. Her full name was Hannah Gluckstein but she insisted on being known only as Gluck, distancing herself from her society family, whom she scandalised with her exclusively male attire and lesbian relationships. Identifying with no artistic school or movement, she exhibited her work only in solo exhibitions, where they were displayed in a special frame she invented and patented. The \"Gluck frame\" extended from the wall in three tiers; painted or papered to match the wall on which it hung, the paintings became part of the architecture of the room. This painting is in a white-painted Gluck frame not visible in the image.",
