It is too small and insubstantial to support its weight, and there are signs it has been padded out to accommodate the load. Moreover the ornament on the foot, associated with military victory (the feet of lions, oak leaves) bears no relation to the ornament on the vase itself (ivy, an owl) which is associated with mourning and night.",
