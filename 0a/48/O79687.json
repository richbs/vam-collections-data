The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman or western in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThis delicate gold filigree earring with seed pearl pendants is from the urban tradition.  There is very little to distinguish it from filigree work from anywhere else around the Mediterranean, but there is no reason to think that it is not typical of what was worn in Syrian towns such as Beirut at the time.",
