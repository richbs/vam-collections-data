            "public_access_description": "In 1517, Raphael was commissioned by Pope Leo X to decorate the papal palace in the Vatican. This is a detail of that decoration, etched and hand-coloured by Giovanni Ottaviani after Pietro Camporesi and G. Savorelli. The decorations of the second floor loggie, or open arcades, influenced European designers for 300 years. They were painted and modelled in stucco by Giovanni da Udine and others under the direction of Raphael. They established the grotesque, a type of decoration whose name derives from the Italian word grottesco. It was inspired by ancient Roman designs discovered at the end of the 15th century in the underground rooms, or grottoes, of the Golden House of Emperor Nero in Rome. It was much copied since, as an ornamental form.",

Savorelli and P. Camporesi, after Raphael (Raffaello Sanzio) (1483-1520)</b>\n\nPl.1 from the set entitled <i>Loggie di Rafaele nel Vaticano</i>, Rome, 1772-77.\n\nLettered <i>Cai. Savorelli Pict., et Pet. Camporesi Arch. delin. Joann. Ottaviani sculp. cum privilegio SS. D.N. Clementis XIII</i> and with a scale. Numbered <i>Num.1</i>.\nEtching, coloured by hand. Cut to 107.5 x 40.5 cm\nE.335-1887\n\nThe excavation of private dwellings around Rome at the end of the 15th century delighted scholars and artists alike. The light fanciful nature of the decorations consisting of an abundance of decorative motifs arranged symmetrically and in compartments but otherwise with little relation to one another (see cat. no. 1.9.a) surprised a generation who knew only of the monumental public style of Roman architecture. \nA number of artists were inspired by the decoration but Raphael was the first to transform them in to a system of decoration which has become known as the 'grotesque', the term stemming from the style's below-ground, grotto-like source. \n\nRaphael's work in this style 'set out to create... [an] interior which should accurately reflect all the most recent discoveries had taught him and his contemporaries about Roman decorative art as applied to private apartments, and he came so close to success that for the next three hundred years his Loggia was studied by architects and decorators as reverently as the ancient ruins themselves. Even in the archaeological revival during the second half of the eighteenth century, the works of architects like Robert Adam proclaimed that they had learnt as much from Raphael as from Fabullus, the decorator of Nero's Golden Palace'.<sup>4</sup>\n\nArtists and designers of every kind studied Raphael's Loggia when they visited Rome and prints of details were in circulation. The engraving (Cat. no. 1.4.b) by the Flemish artist, Cornelis Bos, shows a small 16th century example. This 18th century series was, however, among the first to show the Loggia so extensively with overall views and scaled details. The lavishness of the publication shows Raphael's decorations being presented in a way indistinguishable from the Roman murals that were their prototype. The overworked faded appearance of the etched line under the hand colouring of this example is an indication of the large number of impressions printed and published.\n\n<sub><sup>4</sup></sub><sup>.P.Ward-Jackson, <i>Some main streams and tributaries in European ornament</i>, Victoria and Albert Museum Bulletin Reprints 3, 1969, p.9; see also N.
