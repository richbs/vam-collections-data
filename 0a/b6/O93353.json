They were made for ordinary people and were produced in lay workshops. They are small and often highly decorated and were intended for reading in the home. The owner of a Book of Hours was meant to stop eight times a day and read the appropriate text as in monastic orders. The central text of a Book of Hours was the Hours of the Virgin. This comprised prayers and Psalms intended to be used in honour of the Virgin Mary at particular hours of the day (Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline). This page is from Sext. Pictures or miniatures appear at the beginning of the text to guide the thoughts of the user.",
