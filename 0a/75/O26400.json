Counters would be used with each player starting on one or at a starting point matching their colour.  The number of moves would be determined by the toss of the dice.  If a player lands on the square marked SALIDA leading to the dice, he would have the opportunity to toss the number to exit via the coloured triangle.  If the correct number was not tossed, he would continue around the board.\n\nThe ladder squares are continuously numbered from 1 to 102.  On each of the ladders are two black circles and one matching colour strip leading off to the right to join a hole cut into the board.  Each hole contains a dice and is covered by a clear plastic cap.  On the edge of the board by each hole is a triangular plastic trigger which operates a mechanism below the dice to toss it.  \n\nRules placement: none",
