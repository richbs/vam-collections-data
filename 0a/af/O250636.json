A tall central neck is surrounded by three vases with treble necks.  These alternate with three single smaller spouts with lateral knobs.  Rough scrolls of large flowers with spiky leaves cover the top part of the vase.  Like trees they also surround at a distance three musicians with string instruments and a drum, a pair of youngsters and a bearded man with a creature in trousers on his lap.  One youngster wears a European hat, the others have fairly flat turbans.  A round shape, perhaps a shield, decorated with a broad cross and four roundels hangs in mid air to the left of the couple.  A row of lotus panels with plain dividers completes the decoration towards the base.",
