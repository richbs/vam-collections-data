Savva Mamontov was a wealthy businessman and a great patron of the arts. He invited artists to live and work on his estate at Abramtsevo, near Moscow, promising them: \u2018\u2026 you will not make a mistake if you settle down in Moscow. Moscow is a source of unique and fresh impressions for an artist.\u2019 The Abramtsevo artists studied traditional Russian culture and their output enjoyed world acclaim, winning gold medals at the 1900 Exhibition in Paris.\n\nFrom 1884 Polenova managed the woodworking workshops at Abramtsevo, and designed furniture and other objects. Her designs were not just replicas of traditional forms, but sensitive reworkings of traditional patterns and types to create a new style.",
