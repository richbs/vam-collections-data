Long considered this to be eighteenth-century, and accepted it as representing an authoritatively traditional identification. Three points, however, are worth making: \n1 The inscription, whatever its date, has been tampered with and is thus prima facie suspect. \n2 The handwriting, the consistent use of the short's' (even in 'ass's') and the pound sign \u00a3, together with the very high price paid for the miniature, suggest a date at the earliest in the mid-nineteenth century. \n3 The use of unstiffened card for the mounting of the vellum is rare in Cooper's practice in the 1650s.The likelihood is that the vellum was remounted at the time of the repainting of the face, which was carried out in zinc-based white (not introduced until c. 1792) by a restorer of considerable skill. \n\nUntil the late 1940s there was, apart from Goulding's discreet scepticism, a consensus enforced by Long's prestige to give this miniature the benefit of any doubt occasioned by comparison of it with the more credible pastel drawing (D91).\n\nIn March 1947 Graham Reynolds expressed doubt, (1) repeating it a year later in correspondence about the pastel with David Piper. Piper publicly agreed with Reynolds (2) and subsequent writers have added their endorsement, occasionally with some confusion. \n\nThe pastel does indeed have a very long tradition identifying it as an image of Cooper; it goes back to the Graham sale.(3) Graham was the most important early biographer of Cooper. (4) His belief in the pastel is partly supported by the statement of Cooper's sister-in-law that it was 'not very like, not by Cooper himself but by ... Jackson\u2019; and further supported by Vertue's interesting statement that 'Jackson' was a relation of Cooper. As Mary Edmond has suggested, 'Jackson\u2019 must be 'Jack's son', i.e., Cooper's cousin, the younger Hoskins. (5) Whoever it is by, however, the identification is relatively secure, and by comparison with it the miniature is clearly of a different person. The nose especially is different, being hooked in the pastel but long and straight in the miniature. Furthermore, in 1657 Cooper was about forty -nine and the sitter for the miniature seems younger than that. \n\n1 MS note in Museum files. \n2 Piper 1963, p. 82. \n3 6 March 1711, at Pelletier's in Henrietta Street, lot 48, bt by 'Mr Boyle'. \n4 Author of 'A Short Account of the most eminent Painters' (see Graham 1716). \n5 'Lord Carleton had a portrait of Cooper in crayons, which Mrs Pope said was not very like ...
