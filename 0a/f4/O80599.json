He first trained there with his brother-in-law, Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), then made several trips in the peninsula during which he befriended other great painters of his generation such as Pietro da Cortona (1596-1669) and Guglielmo Cortese (1628-1679) but never left Italy. In 1657 Dughet was elected to the Accademia di S Luca and rapidly became one of the most distinguished landscape painters working in Rome in the 17th century, painting decorative frescoes and many easel paintings for such major Roman patrons as Pope Innocent X and the Colonna family.\n\nThis painting is a good example of the early production of Gaspard Dughet when he painted in a cool silvery tonality. It depicts a landscape dominated by slender trees, which resembles birches, and a path receding into the distance. Two pastoral figures, dressed all'antica, are seen from the back and delicately modelled by patches of light reflecting on their bodies. Dughet would further developed this classical trend in a manner close to that of Poussin and appears therefore a good example of Poussin's influence on 17th century landscape painters.",

For some years from c. 1630 he was a pupil of Nicolas Poussin in Rome and he was also influenced by Claude. He painted landscapes, for the most part in Rome and its vicinity. \n\nAscribed to Gaspard DUGHET \n90 \nITALIAN LANDSCAPE \n<i>Canvas</i>  \n27 X 19 3/4 (68.5 X 50) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.107 \n\nThe close stylistic relationship of this painting to the work of Poussin has long been recognized, but the attributions have varied considerably. Long (1925) catalogued it as 'attributed to Francois Millet'. In 1950 Sir Anthony Blunt devoted an article to a group of paintings based on three works: (1) <i>Landscape with Shepherds,</i>N. G., no. 2619; (2) CAI.107; (3) <i>Landscape with rocky pool,</i>Corsini Gallery. He described the style of these paintings as being similar to Gaspard Dughet, with characteristic foliage and the predominance of a tree with white striped bark like a silver birch. The exact identity of the tree was left in doubt - mountain ash, more common in Northern Italy, was suggested as an alternative - but the unknown painter was dubbed the 'Silver Birch Master'. Meanwhile, for the related picture in the N. G., Martin Davies retained the attribution 'Follower of Nicolas Poussin(?)' (<i>French School,</i>2nd ed., 1957, p. 192). More recently, however, Sir Anthony Blunt (<i>Burl. Mag.,</i>civ, 1962, p. 498) has supported J. Shearman's view that the Silver Birch Master may be identified with the young Gaspard Dughet. Thus the wheel has turned full circle, for it was to Gaspard Dughet that O. Grautoff (<i>Nicolas Poussin,</i>ii, p. 265) attributed the N. G. picture in 1914, and it is probable that CAI.107 may be identified with: 'G. Poussin: A Woody Landscape with pastoral figures' at the Peter Norton sale in January 1869, lot 1721.\n\n<i>Condition.</i>Surface cleaned in 1957. \n<i>Prov.</i>Probably sold at the Peter Norton sale, Christie's, Jan. 1869 (same date chalked on the back as CAI.22 (no. 283), which was lot 914 in that sale) plausibly to be identified with lot 1721, bought Waters for \u00a37. 5s.; Constantine Alexander Ionides; bequeathed to the Museum in 1900. \n<i>Lit.</i>Long, <i>Cat.

            "history_note": "Probably Peter Norton collection, sold Christie's London, 23 January 1869, lot 1721 (G. Poussin: A Woody Landscape with pastoral figures). Bought by Waters for \u00a37.5s. [for Ionides?], coll. C.A.Ionides by Nov 1881 when valued at \u00a3150 as by Francisque Millet; bequeathed by C.A. Ionides, 1900 \n\nHistorical significance: This painting appears to be a good example of Gaspard Dughet's early works in which he developed a style close to Titian as well as Poussin. A. Blunt (1950) gathered these early works under the name of the 'Silver Birch Master', which has been later identified as the young Dughet by J. Shearman. These works are characterised by the presence of a screen of slender trees, which resemble silver birches.\nThis painting shows in fact a path receding into the distance between silver trees enlivened by touches of ochre. Two figures are seen from the back, one is helping another to stand up, a compositional idea that enhances the sense of movement. M.N. Boisclair suggests that a drawing in the Louvre, formerly Inv. RF 32464, may have served as a preparatory study for the painting. Other works have also been stylistically related to CAI.107: <i> Landscape with a Cowherd</u> The National Gallery, London (NG2619) and a<u>Landscape with a nymph riding a goat</u> pendant of a <u>Landscape with a satyr</u> attributed by Sir Anthony Blunt to the 'Silver Birch Master' all later re-attributed as early works of Gaspard Dughet.\nDughet's career roughly divided into three periods. His first landscapes were 'a little dry' (Pascoli) and dominated by a cool tone; in his second period he developed a more learned style and depicted more classical landscapes in the manner of his master, Nicolas Poussin but his late style became more innovative and more personal. \nS.S. Long suggested this painting corresponds to the one entitled <i>A Woody Landscape with pastoral figures</i> attributed to Gaspard Poussin at the Peter Norton sale, Christie's, January 1869 (to which could allude the inscription on the back reading 'Jan 15/69'). It was then probably bought by Ionides who eventually bequeathed it to the museum in 1900. Ionides may responsible for the intermediary re-attribution to F. Millet.",

            "historical_context_note": "Although France and England became the new centres of landscape art in the 18th century, the Italian and Dutch traditions retained their authority. However the Arcadian vision of Italy increasingly tended towards a more precise observation of nature. Some of the most exciting developments took place in Venice, in the soft scenes of Francesco Zuccarelli (1702-1788), inspired by Claude Lorrain (1604-1682), and the fresh, spontaneous landscapes of Marco Ricci (1676-1730). Wealthy patrons, often accompanied by artists, on The Grand Tour, created a market for veduta and capriccio paintings, respectively topographical and fantasist landscape paintings. Landscape conventions were further enriched by foreign artists working in Italy, responding both to the beauty of Italian light and scenery celebrated by the Latin poets and vividly captured in the most popular landscapes of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Gaspard Dughet (1615-1675).",
