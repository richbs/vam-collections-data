On the right is a halberdier, with a halberd in his right hand. Two compartments at the top contain, on the left the children mocking Elisha, and on the right, the bears devouring the children.\n\nThe eagle on the right side of the shield has been left unfinished.  This is because this section would be a direct mirror of that on the left. The column on the right side by the halberdier is also unfinished.  Such economy is typical of the working practice of designers and the glass painter would have reproduced on the right the shading on the left side.  Other designs by Lindtmeyer show that he often left the right side of the shield and the column unfinished. This method can be seen in the earlier sketch for the shield of the Schauffhausen Registry Office of 1570; the design for the shield of the Solothurn Registry Office of 1572, and in copies of his designs by the 1628 copyist for the shield of the Registry Office at Bern, and for the Swiss shield.

A line for the same purpose could, however, have been more easily drawn. The creases could have been an aid to transfer of the design by painting onto a glass panel. The guidance being given by clear division into sections. The creases thus might be part of the designer's working method and can be seen in other designs by him, for example, the sketch for the shield with the coat of arms of the Schaffhauser gunsmiths and riflemen in Historisches Museumin Bern, and the sketch for the shield of the Schaffhausen Registry Office in the Schweizerisches Landesmuseum in Zurich, see ibid, Kat. 33, Abb. 57 and Kat.5, Abb.6.
