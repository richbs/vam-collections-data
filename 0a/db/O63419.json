Several members of the family worked as cabinet makers in Paris during the century. When Jean-Baptiste retired in 1764 his son assumed control of the workshop and continued to use his father\u2019s stamp.\n\nThe day-bed has all the hallmarks of the then popular rococo style, with its serpentine form and decorative scheme comprising carved sprays of flowers that alternate with rocaille shells and cartouches. \n\nIt is thought that the bed was made for the Marquise de Pompadour, although the carved shield on the cresting which bear his arms were added at a later date.\n\nThe decoration is not in its original condition; the gilding has been renewed.",
