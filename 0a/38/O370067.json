The belly is later; it is surrounded with a thick black moulding and has a small fretted and gilt rose somewhat similar in pattern to the roses of English Guitars. The bridge is centred far over to the bass side and 16 cm from the base of the body. There are no 'beards' at the end of the fingerboard. The neck appears to be older than the two peg boxes. The fingerboard has nine ivory frets. The lower pegbox is for one single course and six double. The upper is for five double courses, and has a square finial like that of an English guitar, with a tortoiseshell slip\".
