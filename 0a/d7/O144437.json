The son of a peepshow owner, George (1827-1911) and his brother John began in 1848 by performing at fairs with conjuring tricks and birds and mice before setting up a small tenting circus with a 'learned' pony, a ring horse, a company of nieces and nephews and only three experienced circus performers.  By 1887 George Sanger had split with his brother, opened circus buildings in at least ten provincial towns, had a vast tenting show,  and called his operation 'Lord' George Sanger's.  Despite his death in 1911, Sanger's Circuses survived well into the 20th century with various family-run concerns.",
