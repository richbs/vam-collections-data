Made of black wool and designed by Sheilagh Brown, London, 1988.\n\nSheilagh Brown's 1980s womenswear designs were inspired by traditional menswear tailoring, as exemplified by this frock coat. Brown's masculine inspiration was, however, contrasted with a feminine sensibility in cut, colour and use of fabric. This was evident from the ensemble acquired for, and displayed in, the 'Club to Catwalk' exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum of which this frock coat was part. On display the frock coat was teamed together with a pair of striped trousers (T.47:2-2013), a black and white floral-printed shirt (T.47:3-2013), a pink shirt (T.47:4-2013), a spotted scarf (T.47:5-2013) and a silver brooch (T.48-2013).",
