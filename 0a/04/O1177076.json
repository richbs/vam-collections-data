It is an ancient tradition but best  documented for the 19th century. \n\nThis mashrabiyyah screen was made using traditional materials and according to traditional methods and designs and is an important example of the continuity of craft  traditions in Cairo into the 20th century. Original mashrabiyyah screens in situ are now very rare,  since restorations of historic houses in the later 19th century, which meant that in many cases  the windows were ripped out and discarded. During modernisations of the 20th century, this architectural tradition has declined, though the workshops of Omar Farouk and Abu Zaid Hassan demonstrate that interest in this tradition and the craft skill has continued to an extent.",
