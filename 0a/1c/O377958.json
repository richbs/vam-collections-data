Adam van Vianen (d. 1627) developed an innovative style of sinuous figures and ornament chased and embossed on ewers, basins and other silverwares. Although these fluid forms are not evident on this plaque of 1614, his skill as an embosser and chaser is evident. Here he depicts a scene known in Christian art as 'The Assumption of the Virgin Mary'. Mary, mother of Jesus, rises to heaven; the twelve apostles gather in wonder around her empty tomb. St James, identifiable by the pilgrim flask slung round his neck and his staff, sits prominently by the tomb which may suggest the person or institution that commissioned the plaque felt particular devotion to this saint. The execution of the scene in such high relief and the shape of the plaque itself suggest it was designed to be applied to a piece of furniture, perhaps as the door on a cabinet or tabernacle (the casket used in church to store the chalice and paten).",
