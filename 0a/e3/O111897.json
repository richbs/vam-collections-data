They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. This frequently encountered plaquette has bevelled edges which suggests that it was perhaps part of a casket or sandbox. It may have been associated with a papal gift as the original terracotta matrix was found during the 1876 excavations of the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, the palace of Pope Paul II.",
