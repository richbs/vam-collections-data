The foundation stone of  the new bridge designed by Joseph Cubitt and H. Carr was laid by the Lord Mayor on 20 July 1867 and opened by Queen Victoria on 6 November 1869. Holborn Viaduct took six years to complete and was opened on the same occasion as Blackfriars Bridge. The viaduct, which was constructed to span the valley of the river Fleet and designed by the City surveyor, William Heywood, is reputed to have cost \u00a32,500,000. \n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe roundel was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",

Adams, daughter of George Gammon Adams in 1980.\n\nHistorical significance: The original bridge has been built in 1760-69 and designed by Robert Mylne, was pulled down in 1864. The foundation stone of  the new bridge designed by Joseph Cubitt and H. Carr was laid by the Lord Mayor on 20 July 1867 and opened by Queen Victoria on 6 November 1869.\nHolborn Viaduct took six years to complete and was opened on the same occasion as Blackfriars Bridge. The viaduct, which was constructed to span the valley of the river Fleet and designed by the City surveyor, William Heywood, is reputed to have cost \u00a32,500,000. This piece is one of a series of medals commissioned by the Corporation of the City of London; 400 specimens were struck.",
