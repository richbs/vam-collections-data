In the early 1880s, when this brooch was designed, the world annual production of silver was three times as high as it had been in the 1850s.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe manufacturer of this brooch has stamped a design registration mark (a lozenge shape) on the back. There is also a minute version of the mark (in reverse) just beneath the back handle of the cradle. Under the Copyright of Design Act passed in 1842 the registration mark was intended to protect the design from being copied by other manufacturers for three years. The information contained in the mark shows that the design of the brooch was registered in 1883. In 1884 a new act took effect that abolished the lozenge mark and introduced a number sequence.",
