His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nHouse of Flowers, a musical presented on Broadway, New York, in 1954, is based on a short story by Truman Capote (1924-1984).  Set on a Caribbean island, rival madams of two bordellos compete for business, while a young, innocent girl experiences first love.   Messel won an Antoinette Perry 'Tony' Award for his set designs in 1956.   Despite all the ingredients for success, the musical failed to ignite the critics and public, and lasted only 165 performances.\n\nA pencil sketch of flowers, probably for the interior decoration of Madame Fleur\u2019s house.",
