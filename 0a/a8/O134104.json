For example, as in Constable\u2019s work, Nasmyth employs the large motif of a gabled farmhouse and an oak to push back the middle-ground and create the vast expanse of space in the foreground. The motif of large- gabled house and watery expanse, is also reminiscent of that in Constable\u2019s <i>Dedham Mill</i>, a version of which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1819 and possibly earlier at the Royal Academy in 1818 (see Graham Reynolds, <i>The Later Paintings and Drawings of John Constable</i>, Text, Yale, 1984, p.47). Nasmyth was a frequent exhibitor at both institutions from 1811 and would no doubt have seen Constable\u2019s works.\n\nThe use of such techniques in landscape painting also recalls Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/9-82), particularly his later works, and may point to the common heritage of both Nasmyth and Constable in the work of this renowned 17th-century Dutch landscape artist; for a discussion of Constable\u2019s admiration of Ruisdael, see Leslie Parris and Ian Fleming-Williams (eds.), <i>Constable</i>, London, 1991, p.493, and Seymour Slive, <i>Jacob van Ruisdael: Master of Landscape</i>, Yale, 2005, p.29).\n\nPatrick Nasmyth made studies from nature of trees, plants, hedgerow subjects and details of foliage and trees. James Nasmyth wrote of his brother\u2019s trouble in recording cloud formations, and Patrick\u2019s truthful approach is visible in 1033-1886 with its painting of stratocumulous cloud (see Peter Johnson and Ernle Money (eds.), <i>The Nasmyth Family of Painters</i>, 1977, p.30).",
