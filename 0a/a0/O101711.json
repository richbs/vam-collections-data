Proofs are individual impressions produced, except in the case of artist's proofs, before the printing of the published edition. They may be trial proofs taken by the artist to see how the design is progressing during the production of the printing surface or printer's proofs taken to ascertain how the plate should be inked and on what paper it should be printed.  \nThese five progress proofs make visible the stages that this early 19th century book illustration, made up of many overlapping networks of lines, went through before reaching its final form. The way the five impressions are held together suggests these proofs may have been put together by the printmaker or in the printing shop.\n\nThe image shows a Palladian interior, with a card table on the left, a young man with hand on his breast holds out his hat with jewels, to a young woman sitting by a fire. Having gambled away her financial resources the lady's last stake may be her hand in marriage or her virtue.",
