She was first engaged by Richard D'Oyly Carte for the 1914 season, having seen her London debut in A Dear Little Wife at the Haymarket Theatre, December 1913. She replaced Beatrice Boarer as the company's leading soubrette and immediately took the roles Hebe in H.M.S. Pinafore, Edith in The Pirates of Penzance, the title role in Iolanthe, Melissa in Princess Ida, Pitti-Sing in The Mikado, Phoebe in The Yeomen of the Guard, Tessa in The Gondoliers, and the Lady Angela in Patience.  The Sorcerer was added to the repertoire in July 1916, with Nellie Briercliffe as Constance Partlett.\nShe left the company in 1918 and appeared in the musical comedy Our Boys at the Adelphi Theatre from May until August 1918, but returned to the D'Oyly Carte for its 1919 season at the Princes Theatre.  She left the company again for other roles but returned to the D'Oyly Carte for the last time for a London season at the Savoy Theatre from October 1929 until May 1930.",
