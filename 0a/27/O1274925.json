Bags decorated in this way were popularly known as 'Waldybags' as they were sold by the firm of H. Wald and Co. Mrs Campbell painted designs such as this on transparent plastic so that potential clients could envisage how the finished products would look. Designs on plastic would be held against satin bags of different colours and sizes so clients could select their desired pattern and type of bag. Mrs Campbell would then transfer the design from the plastic sheet onto the bag by tracing it on greaseproof paper, and pricking it to create the outline of the design. She would then paint the design directly onto the bag. ",
