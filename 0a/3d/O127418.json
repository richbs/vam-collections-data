His work may be described as Symbolist and has much in common with that of figures such as Odilon Redon and Gustave Dor\u00e9, although Hieronymus Bosch, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Francisco de Goya have also been cited as possible influences. \n\nBrandel\u2019s imagery often includes architecture  fantastically interpreted, with exaggerated and highly improbable structures, scale and perspective. These fantasies are frequently inhabited by men, women and animals engaged in strange or ritualistic behaviour, sometimes endowed with supernatural powers such as the ability to float or fly. Here Brandel has created a kind of Tower of Babel with vast arcades spiralling heavenward and inhabited at different levels with floating horsemen, elephants, a Buddha, a winged couple and, at the top, a female torso with belly disclosing an embryonic child. Near the foot of the image an inscription in Italian reads \u2018Potrebbe qui dubitarre\u2019 (\u2018One may here doubt\u2019).",
