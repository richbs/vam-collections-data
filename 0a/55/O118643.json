Sadler experimented with transfer-printing on white glazed delftware tiles, transferring images from engraved copper plates to tiles, using enamel colours fixed in low-temperature firing.\n\nActors and actresses could become big stars in the 18th century, when theatres, concert halls and pleasure gardens were the major forms of public entertainment.  Engravers regularly produced images of paintings of the most popular performers, so the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear on the tiles in reverse.\n\nWilliam Smith, was educated at Eton and Cambridge. After his first stage appearance at Covent Garden in 1753 he gained the nickname 'Gentleman' Smith and a reputation as a good looking, respectable and cultivated man.  He first played Lord Townley at Covent Garden in the 1768-1769 season and played a wide variety of leading roles, mostly at Covent Garden and Drury Lane Theatres, until his retirement in 1788.",
