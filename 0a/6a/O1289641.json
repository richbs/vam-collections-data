Standing on pointe with her arms crossed over her chest (hands fluttering) and head tilted to her right.\n\nThe Enchanted Princess was the pas de deux for the Bluebird and Princess Florine from the ballet The Sleeping Beauty with music by Piotr Tchaikovsky and choreography by Marius Petipa. This divertissement was performed by Serge Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes under a number of guises most famously by Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina as L\u2019oiseau de feu or L\u2019oiseau d\u2019or. Leon Bakst designed new costumes for the ballet and a set showing a clearing in an exotic forest for the two performances given by the Ballets Russes in 1915 ahead of their first tour of north America.  The Enchanted Princess was first performed with the new set and costumes in London At the London Coliseum on 16 September 1918  when Lydia Lopokova took the role of The Princess.\n\nAllinson\u2019s drawing suggests either an  illustration for a booklet in Cyril Beaumont\u2019s series Impressions of the Russian Ballet (but this short ballet would not sustain a full book in its own right) or a preliminary drawing for one of Beaumont's wooden souvenir figures.",
