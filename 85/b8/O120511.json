In 2 stages, the cabinet consists of two class-panelled doors with heavily moulded surrounds composed of 'C' curves, flowers, rocaille and cabochon oranments and acanthus and cabochon openwork. From the rosettes of each scroll hangs an acanthus leaf; on a central plinth is a laurel-wreathed bust of an empress. The cabinet contains 2 shelves.\nThe base is of 4 basically cabriole legs with exaggeratedly hairy knees and calves, terminating in paw feet. The 4 legs are bound together by rope and in the front 'S' curves, cabochon and acanthus centre on a rococo flower whose petals are inset with cabochons.\nThe overloading of the decoration and generally rather charmingly naive proportions of the cabinet suggest its Irish origin. However it should be mentioned that the quality of the carving is of an exceptionally high standard, which is also consistent with Dublin work of the mid-18th century.\n\n\nInspected on loan at Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk by NH 2005-10-06\nOxburgh has key; cabinet showed full of objets.\nCarcase is oak, not pine. Back formed from vertical oak boards. Carving built up on oak supports. Apron break has been reglued. The glass modern. Three shelf grooves and two shelves. Assembly marks at the top of the legs and rails. \nPL side waist has replaced horizontal mahogany batten.\nThe moulding around the top of the stand (inside which the top section sits) seems replacement, of a different colour.",
