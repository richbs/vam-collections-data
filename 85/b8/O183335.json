However, when the ruling Safavid dynasty (1501-1722) moved their capital to Isfahan around 1600, the production of luxury dishes and wall tiles rapidly increased. Safavid potters worked in a wide variety of styles and techniques, often seeking inspiration from their 12th century traditions and techniques. \n\nSingle colour glazes were by Safavid potters used to great effect, with coloured slip, carved or moulded details. The decorative technique used on this jar recalls Chinese cloisonn\u00e9 wares in metal ware and in ceramics. The design was created with a mould the produced deep channels or wells in relief, these channels were later filled in with pigments. The wells helped to keep the colour contained and prevented it from muddying the other colours.",
