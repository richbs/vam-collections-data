It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe Canadian-born actress and singer Victoria Hopper was educated in England where she studied singing at London's Webber-Douglas School.  She made her first professional stage appearance in London in 1933 when Martine, a play in which she starred at drama school, was transferred to the Ambassador's Theatre. After her success as Martine she was offered a series of major roles in the West End, and in 1935 she appeared as the principal boy in pantomime in Manchester. She first appeared in films in 1933 including Lorna Doone with Margaret Lockwood (1935), Whom The Gods Love (1936) and The Mill on the Floss with James Mason (1937).  She toured with ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) during the Second World War and married the theatrical producer and head of ENSA, Basil Dean.",
