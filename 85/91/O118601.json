He was a member of the group associated with the painter J.A.M. Whistler, who was a great influence on his work. \n\nRoussel designed his own frames for his prints; this frame is for Dawn, a print (Museum no. E.503:1-2005) of which he made about four finished impressions. However he made about 60 trial proofs of this print, since the combination of printing techniques used was quite complex. Most of his frames are decorated with printed paper applied to plain painted wooden mouldings; this frame is more typical of the period in its use of traditional materials \u2013 gilding over gesso \u2013 but it is more radical in form, having rounded corners and applied three-dimensional motifs.\n\nThe subject matter of \u2018dawn\u2019 is personified in the female figure floating in the air, symbolising the first light of the morning beaming through the clouds. In the area beneath, nymphs bathe in the lagoon. Roussel achieves an ethereal mood, with deep colours receiving emphasis from the moulded gilt frame.",
