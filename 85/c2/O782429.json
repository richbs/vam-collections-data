He gained experience from a young age as an illustrator by working for the Westminster Budget and other magazines. He worked mainly as an illustrator to Children's books. From the early twentieth century Rackham developed a talent for portraying witches and fairies by employing vivid characterization, which often has an underlying sense of horror. These illustration effectively incorporate fine outlines with a pale palette to create the feeling of another world. \n\nThis watercolour illustrateswas reproduced in W.Heinemann's publication of A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1908. Shakespeare's play has been a continual source of inspiration to artists. This illustration shows an elf attendant that is summoned to serve Bottom. This tiny elf is on of Tatania's attendants summoned to serve the bewitched mortal, Bottom. His Srpightly movement reflects the mischief perpetrated by the fairies in the play.",
