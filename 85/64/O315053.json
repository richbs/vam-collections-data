In the right foreground, three soldiers in bonnets and kilts stand on a promontory. Other soldiers are boarding a small sailing boat nearby, behind which is a boat with rowers at the oars. In front of the promontory is a small river running under a bridge on the left. A track runs across the bridge, past a single birch tree, and up to a small cottage surrounded by other trees. The background is filled with hills on the far side of the loch. There is a painted inscription, 'Loch Lomond', on the front left hand edge of the leaf. The handle, turned and gilded, has a slot at the top so it can be attached to the leaf by two small metal pins.. The back of the leaf is japanned black.\n[Hand-screen] The screen has the same shaped leaf with a japanned back, and handle as W.9-1929. The leaf is painted with a view of Loch Fyne. In the left foreground is a boat with a man at the oars and a second man pulling in a fishing net, the floats of which are visible in the water across the centre of the picture. Behind them in the background is a white tower on a promontory or island, with hills behind. On the right two men in a boat head towards the shore on which fishing nets hang to dry on poles. Behind in the distance on the right is a small white painted building with trees. In the centre of the loch, there are a group of larger sailing boats at anchor, with two more boats with sails and distant hills in the background. There is a painted inscription, 'Loch fin'e, on the front left hand edge of the leaf.",

Pairs of these screens were often part of a symmetrical arrangement of ornaments and other decorative objects on a mantelpiece. These examples are painted with views of Loch Lomond and Loch Fyne and were probably produced as souvenirs for tourists visiting Scotland. Hand screens, painted with landscapes, or views of medieval buildings in cities such as Oxford, were one of the many products of the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 manufacturers of the West Midlands. Firms like Jennens & Bettridge of Birmingham employed skilled artists to paint a range of smaller items, such as these hand screens, as well as larger wall panels which were used for interior decoration on ships.",
