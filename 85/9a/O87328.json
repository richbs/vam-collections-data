Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nBless The Bride, the musical by A.P Herbert with music by Vivian Ellis, was very popular when originally produced in London at the Adelphi Theatre in 1947 and when it was revived in 1951 at the Stoll Theatre. It continued to be revived throughout the 1950s.",

            "history_note": "The artist of these caricatures, Gilbert Sommerlad, was by profession a musician who was born into a family that had a long tradition of professional musicians.    In 1936 he moved to the recently built New Theatre, Oxford, to join his brother Roy (violin and clarinet) as resident pianist.\n\nGilbert was an exceptionally good and popular rehearsal pianist, and visiting companies and individual performers used to make sure that he would be available.  He became well-known in the profession and his ability as a caricaturist became common knowledge.  The volume that includes this drawing contains sketches mostly of musical directors and conductors working at the Oxford New Theatre with Gilbert Sommerlad.",
