She has copied various images from historical sources and annotated them with the name of the character and any variations that she wants to translate into stage costume.  From many of the references, it would appear that she was at some time working in the National Art Library of the V&A.  \nSketch books of this kind are valuable in showing the process through which a designer goes before producing the finished design. Because human bodies, ways of moving and fashions change, it is not possible to create totally authentic historical costume on stage, but to create a convincing period design does require considerable historical knowledge to whittle down complexity to essentials. Stone's thoroughness and considerable knowledge of historic costume that underlies the often simplicity of her finished designs.",
