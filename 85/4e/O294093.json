In 1935 his son Charles entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company\u2019s offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nCharles Oliver Goldsmith designed this frame at a time when the plastic was cut and shaped by hand in the company workshop. The application of the bamboo was also done by hand; each piece was secured to the plastic frame by tiny screws. This style was a follow on from the full-rimmed 'Bamboo' (T.243A-1990) and allowed the fashion conscious woman a more wearable design.",
