            "public_access_description": "This mosaic shows a soldier with musket, sword and powder flask. His dress and equipment are inspired by 17th-century examples. Musketeers, cavaliers and other chivalrous characters were a popular subject-matter for micromosaics created at the Vatican Workshop in the late 19th century. Since the era of Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) and widespread popular interest in romantic swashbuckling characters, subject-matters such as this were a commercially successful addition to the products of the Vatican Workshop.\n\nThe dates of Luigi Tarantoni's life are not known, but it is certain that he worked for the Vatican Workshop during the second half of the 19th century, and probably during the early 20th century as well. He appears to have depicted a series of fictitious soldiers in historic costume. Often these figures are shown in historic dress in the style of contemporary photographic portraits in historic disguise, set against a plain, monochrome background. These backgrounds tend to be of a comparatively simple opus tesselatum design. The soldiers are idealised representatives of a type, not individuals.\n\nThis particular mosaic is unusual in comparison. Not only does it depict the musketeer against a landscape background, but it also shows him at dusk, or dawn, walking down a hill towards the observer with what could be interpreted as a tired and melancholic expression upon his face. This integration of individualism invites titles - such as Soldier Returning from War - that give the figure a history and a narrative context.\n\nThe sunset is in the tradition of the fantastic skies that can be found in micromosaics from around the middle of the 19th century, and proves what a seemingly infinite variety of glass colours were available at the Vatican Workshop by the end of the 19th century. It also proves that even then, pictorial illusionism was still one of the main criteria for the quality of micromosaics.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The first micromosaics were created in the 18th century, but it was not until Arthur Gilbert himself became interested in collecting them and invented the term 'micromosaics' that they became known as such. The tesserae are minute pieces cut from thin pieces of glass known as smalti filati, and some of the finest micomosaics can consist of as many as 5,000 tesserae per square inch (ca. 3 by 3cm). By the late 18th century Rome had become central to the production of micromosaics and sold them as souvenirs to wealthy foreigners visiting the city. From small elegant snuffboxes to large monumental tabletops, micromosaics could be used to decorate objects of all shapes and sizes. They could even be made to resemble full-sized canvas paintings, and indeed Arthur Gilbert himself mistook his very first micromosaic for a painting. When he brought it home to show his wife, he had to convince her that it was not in fact a cracked painting, as she supposed, but a mosaic.",
