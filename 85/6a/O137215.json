            "public_access_description": "This server is an abstracted fish. The blade is an asymmetric trowel shape with a gentle curvilinear form that captures the \"fishy\" essence. It is bevelled on the left side and over half of the blade is pierced in an intricate swirling pattern suggestive of seaweed. This piercing is continued along the topside of the hollow handle, giving a pleasing unity to the piece. The triangular cross-section and straight end offset the natural curves of the blade. The interior of the handle, visible through the piercing has been given a white matt finish that subtly highlights the white moonstone eye of the blade, suggesting light glancing off the scales of a fish. This delightful piece has a sense of movement and action created by the fluidity of form and the freedom of the piercing.",
