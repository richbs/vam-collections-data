By the 1940s, the dress had become tailored to be much more form-fitting, and this dress, tailored in the 1950s or 60s, retains this feature. The short sleeves may reflect on the relatively more humid climate of Hong Kong, where the dress was made. Worn on its own, the dress exudes an undeniably Chinese flavour.  When the veste and the jacket are worn over the dress, it cleverly transforms the Chinese dress into a Western suit ensemble.",
