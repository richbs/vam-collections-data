Arranged with accompaniment for the pianoforte. Published in London, ca. late 19th century - early 20th century. \n\nIn 1828 a white actor called Thomas Dartmouth Rice made his first appearance as 'Jim Crow'. He was not the first white man to use burnt cork to black his face and appear as a black man. As early as 1767 a New York act was billed as 'a Negro dance, in character'. It was Rice, however, who popularised the act and made a fortune. He performed throughout America, where both the song and the dance became a national craze, and also in London and Dublin. The popularity of the minstrel show in the late 19th and early 20th century owed much to his success. According to Rice, his posture, movements and song were based on those of an elderly, lame, black groom he had once seen. As a showman, he would have exaggerated and distorted the movements, not reproduced them exactly. Rather than giving a true picture of a black slave's dance, Rice helped create the caricature which was passed down through the minstrel shows.\n\nThe term \"nigger\" has been used to describe people of black (sub-Saharan) African heritage. From the 1800s it has carried strong derogatory intent. The term is repeated in this record in its original historical context.",
