Between the two panels is a band 1.5 cm wide without weft; by cutting along this band the two panels would have been separated for sale. The pattern in the central part of each panel is a mirror image of the other while the pattern in the stripes running along the sides continues in the same direction.\nThere is a central panel with a red ground and a central stylised cypress tree in purple, green, yellow and white growing from a purple and yellow mound.  This is flanked by a smaller version of the tree each surmounted by a stylised peacock in green and yellow.  This peacock is repeated, in green, as a confronted pair above the central cypress and above them is an green diamond form.  The red ground ends in a serrated arch outlined in white leading in to a purple band containing one and a half diamond forms in red and yellow on either side.  Across the top is a reciprocal pattern in purple edged with yellow and red edged with white.  Down either side of the central panel is a series of narrow, plain stripes in yellow, purple, red and green and these edge a series of wider ikat stripes:\n[a] red, yellow and blue in elongated chevrons\n[b] joined lozenges in white and purple\n[c] red, yellow, green and purple in elongated chevrons\n[d] same as [b]\n[e] same as [a]\nThere are three yellow bands across both ends.",
