The prints were arranged in stacks, continually replenished throughout the duration of the exhibition. The artist intended visitors to help themselves to these prints which they could take away in the plastic bag (E.100-1996) also provided in the gallery. Dissemination of multiples is a characteristic feature of Gonzalez-Torres' exhibitions. \n\nThis print is inspired by the tradition of sending black-bordered cards and letters as funeral announcements and memorial cards. It is intended as an oblique reference to the US government under President Ronald Reagan which denied funds for research into AIDS  even though the epidemic was at its worst during the late 1980s and early 1990s.",

The prints were arranged in stacks, continually replenished thoruhgout the duration of the exhibition. The artist intended visitors to help themselves to these prints which they could take away in the plastic bag (E.100-1996) also provided in the gallery. Dissemination of multiples is a characteristic feature of Gonzalez-Torres' exhibitions.",
