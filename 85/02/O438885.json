            "physical_description": "A rectangular box with hinged lid, the lid fitting over a low riser, leaving the front top and bottom sections flush. The decoration is deeply carved throughlayers of the red and black lacquer, with a thin layer of red as the top layer, giving the object a overall reddish-brown appearance. Six bands of colour are identifiable in all, the red layers being in each case thinner than the black. The grooves are deep, with straight sides and broad, gently rounded bottoms.\nBrass corner strengtheners are pinned to the corners at the top and bottom, that on the bottom left front having been repositioned, with empty pin-holes visible. The two brass hinges are each double pinned through the body at the top and bottom, with the pins exposed. The lid carries a brass fastening plate, with a protruding tongue grooved to fit over a pin held at right-angles to the body on the lower half. This pin is attached to a knob, by twisting which the tongue is secured and the lid fastened. The hinges and front plates are likely to be original, since they do not interrupt the decoration of the front and rear.\nDECORATION: The sides of both top and bottom are carved with 'xiangcao' scrolls. The top is carved with an outer band of 'xiangcao' scroll, within which is a rectangular panel. This panel is carved with a row of 'ruyi' heads at its outer edges, and with three pairs of opposed 'ruyi' heads set at right angles to the long edge of the box.\nCONDITION: The riser, which is of lacquer on a fabric-only core, is damaged at the right. Some cracking to sides, back front, and underside of lid. The surface is covered with a network of minute cracks, possibly covered by a thin layer of clear lacquer. The underside of the base and the interior of the box have been relacquered in black.\nThe box was acquired by the donor from Bluett's, who had in turn purchased it in Japan, in assosiation with another box of carved and marbled lacquer, presented by the donor to The Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh.\nThe donor argued strongly in favour of a 13th century date for this piece, adducing as evidence a piece published in WW 3.1979. See also WW 8.1981 p.39.\nThe V&A and RSM boxes were contained in an Edo period pine box with internal shelf, and inscription in ink on the lid: 'tsuiu kyoku suzurifumibako'.\nOpinion of James Watt , Metropolition Museum, 6/8/1990: Definitely Southern Song, 13th century.",
