The Totum must be marked one to eight, on its several faces with a pen and ink, or with a pencil.  You may begin the game agreeably to the following RULES.\n1.  Each player must have a pyramid, and four counters of the same colour.\nII.  Spin for first player, the highest number to begin the game.\nIII,.  Let the first player spin, and place his or her pyramid on the game according to the number turned up.

THE JACKAL\nIn the torrid regions of Africa and Asia, these active and rapacious beasts supply the place which is occupied in temperate and frozen districts by the wolf.  The hotter the climate, the greater is their strength and vigour.  They collect together, and hunt their prey, in packs of from forty to fifty in number, and attack and devour all kinds of animals.  In the burning plains of Egypt and Arabia, they follow the caravans, for the purpose of feeding on whatever is left behind.  The lion and the panther oftentimes lurk in the rear of the jackals, and as often rob them of at least part of their prey; hence appears to have arisen the erroneous notion of the Jackal being the lion's provider.  These animals live in burrows, which they dig under the surface of the ground; and from which they seldom issue, except during the stillness of the night.  Their howling, when in pursuit of prey, is said to be dreadful.  If caught young, they may be rendered perfectly tame and domestic.  Like a dog, they distinguish their master from every other person, eat out of his hand, and love to be fondled and patted.  In many respects the jackal has a great resemblance to the fox.  Although it is one of the most numerous of all the wild animals of the East, there is scarcely any one less known in Europe, or more confusedly described by natural historians.  They vary in size.  Those of the warmest climates are said to be the largest.  Nothing can escape their rapacity.  They will ransack the repositories of the dead, and greedily devour the most putrid bodies.  They are said to attend caravans and to follow armies, in hopes of being furnished with a banquet  by disease or battle.
