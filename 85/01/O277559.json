Augustus the Strong, the owner of the Meissen porcelain factory, is known to have loaned the factory pieces from his own collection of precious Far Eastern porcelains in order to copy their shapes and designs.  The shape as well as the precise and colourful Japanese decoration, known as 'Kakiemon', has been faithfully copied here by the skilled craftsmen at Meissen.\n\nThis piece bears the special mark of the Saxon king's own collection housed in his 'Japanese Palace' in Dresden.  This residence was so large that the Augustus's Chinese and Japanese porcelain collection was not large enough to fill it and Meissen pieces decorated in similar styles were used there to fill in any gaps in the displays.",
