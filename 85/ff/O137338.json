This albumen print, a type of photograph, was made in 1861 from a glass negative in the photographic studio in the factory building of Skidmore & Co. at  Alma Street, Coventry.  This photograph is thus a record of the work done and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm. Francis Skidmore (1817-1896) was a leading Victorian metalworker in the Gothic Revival style, which was an architectural movement the nineteenth-century practitioners of which sought to revive medieval forms.  Skidmore also produced church plate, and furniture. \n\nHe was particularly interested in the developing technology of gas lighting. His firm installed it in three buildings in Coventry - in the medieval St Mary's Hall in 1850, in St Michael's church a year later, and in Holy Trinity church in 1856.  In the following decades, Skidmore continued to design brackets for gas lighting which existed throughout Britain in this period. Inspired by Gothic decoration, the scrolling acanthus leaf beneath the chandelier and up the central stem demonstrates this artist-craftsman's involvement in the Gothic Revival.",
