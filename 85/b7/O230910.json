There are six half-stars and four quarter stars in the corners. Between these are large X-motifs which create a disjointed diamond shaped grid on the red/pink ground. The X-motifs are woven with a chequered pattern using metal thread. \nMetal Thread: silver strip open S-wound on a white silk core. One of the stars is woven completely with dark blue silk; the others have half their pattern woven with beige silk.\nThere are other irregularities in the colouring with a light blue band at the bottom of the main panel changed to darker blue.\nThe border is woven in red/pink silk and metal thread with a bold pattern of pairs of silver split palmettes, alternately inward and outward facing on a red/pink ground. There is a very narrow band of reciprocal brown and silver trefoils.\nMaterials and Techniques: silk thread, metal thread, weaving",
