It was opened in the mid 1960s, and is today Grade II-listed by London Heritage. The structure is a landmark example of optimistic modern architecture.\n\nPaul is known primarily for her portraits, and this image could also be seen as a portrait, depicting a familiar, iconic London building. The use of soft ground etching makes the image atmospheric, as if it is seen through London fog. The urban monolith is made more compelling by the delicate, fragile soft ground treatment.",
