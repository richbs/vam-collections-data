The fashion for Ancient Greek motfis like Apollo's lyre, combined with the increasing popularity of the guitar, encouraged the development of this hybrid instrument. By about 1800, guitars with six single strings (like this example) were increasingly adopted by players who until then had mostly used versions with five pairs of strings or 'courses'. This lyre-guitar is very similar to one depicted in Johann Christoph Rincklake's The Coppenrath Family in a Boating Party of 1807 (M\u00fcnster, Westf\u00e4lisches Landesmuseum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte).",
