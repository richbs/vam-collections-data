            "public_access_description": "Laxma Goud was born in Nizampur, a village in South India (Andhra Pradesh) in 1940. After a diploma in drawing and painting from the Government College of Art and Architecture, Hydrabad in 1963, he studied mural painting and printmaking at M.S. University, Baroda (1963-65). \n\nHis rural upbringing provides the inspiration for his work. He does not present an idyllic and romanticised image of village life, as do typical representations. His intimate knowledge and understanding of rural life enable him to depict his subjects in a more truthful and humorous way. He sees the village as a very open society, where humans and nature interact dynamically. Thus, his prints portray the close relationship of the villagers with the animals and the landscape. They capture their vitality and lust for life.\n\nIn this semi-surrealist etching, Goud has depicted a hog standing over a human figure. The barren landscape enhances the fanstastic and lunar feel of the image. In the background we see an autumnal-looking tree.",
