On the right scene the Buddha, seated on a low socle covered with draperies, occupies the centre. He wears a sanghati, his left hand rests on his lap, and the right is raised in abhayamudra.   The hair is gathered in long waves under the usnisa. Two branches of the bodhi tree are shown in the background.   On the right and on the left two figures  approach respectfully.   Apparently the main character is the close shaven monk on the Buddha's right  holding a jar for making an offering.  Behind him there follows a layman with his head lowered and hands joined.  On Buddha's left  a layman offers a flat bowl while his right hand is raised in greeting.  Behind  him a figure carries  a long thunderbolt which could be Vajrapani.\nThe scene on the left  shows a shaven monk turning to the centre of the scene.  The figure next to him is Vajrapani holding a thunderbolt in his left hand. The third figure  is the standing Buddha raising his hand in abhayamudra addressing the layman standing in front of him.\nThe layman has his right hand raised  and in his left hand he hold a round object and a small basket dangles from his waist.",
