They formed the Estonian Peoples' Forum.\n\nOn 24 September 1988 the Estonian Peoples' Forum adopted a resolution, serving as a basis for the establishment of the Estonian Union of National Minorities. Its articles of association were approved on 18 May 1989. One aim of the Union was to help ethnic minorities execute their rights and obligations granted by the constitution of the Republic of Estonia and other legislation.\n\nArtur Kuznetsov was a Popular Front activist and the Minister of Population Policy (1990\u20131991) in the cabinet of Edgar Savisaar\u2019s transitional government. After the restoration of the statehood of Republic of Estonia in 1991 Artur Kuznetsov received neither Estonian citizenship nor a permanent residence permit, because of his service in the State Security Committee (KGB) of the Soviet Union. Edgar Savisaar reveals in his book \u2018The Prime Minister\u2019 that these problems with Kuznetsov were not anticipated at this time this poster was printed.",
