It was given to warrant officers who had served in the campaign.\n\nPeople\nConrad Heinrich K\u00fcchler (active 1763 - after 1821) was born in Flanders, and was first recorded as a die-sinker in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1763. He worked elsewhere in Germany, and then in France, and probably arrived in England in about 1790, where he was employed at Matthew Boulton's Soho mint in Birmingham until perhaps 1806. While in Birmingham, he seems also to have cut dies for many coins, including Portuguese, Danish and Russian ones.",
