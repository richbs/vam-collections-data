London : Futures Publications, 1991. p.62.\nThe relevant text is as follows: \n\n'<i>Bob Linney, The Arts Council and the 'Bloody Loud LCO</i>'. \nOf particular note are the imaginative and impressive series of Arts Council Contemporary Music Network posters and flyers designed by Bob Linney (b.1947), throughout the '80s. These 'uncomplicated' sheets are the results of several distinct stages of production. initial <i>Rotring</i> pen 'roughs' on plain paper are submitted for approval before the colouring can begin. Gently-blended hues are introduced into an enlargement of the chosen drawing by way of a silk-screen process involving repeated manual application of selected semi-opaque inks through a limited number of stencils. From a group of these uniquely coloured prints, just one is chosen as the 'camera-ready' art-work. When the image is prepared for offset litho printing, the 'solidity' of colour is maintained by the omission of the lined-screen which, if used would break up the image into tiny regular dots.'",
