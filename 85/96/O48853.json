A master Chimney-sweeper patroles the street for custom, attended by two or three boys, the taller ones carrying the bag of soot, and directing the little diminutive creature, who, stript perfectly naked, ascends and sweeps the Chimney.  The common price is sixpence per Chimney; but for those of large kitchens, where much scraping is required, they usually demand a shilling.  The greatest profit arises from the sale of the soot, which is used for manure. \n        Formerly it was the custom to cry \"Sweep for the Soot O!\" the sale of the soot then being the only compensation of the sweeper.  The hard condition of Chimney-sweeping devolves upon the smallest and feeblest of the children apprenticed from parish workhouses.  The employment in itself stints their growth, and it is unhappily too much the interest of the master so to feed his apprentices as they shall not be liable to outgrow their occupation.  It is very common to see Chimney-sweepers of twelve and fourteen years of age who do not exceed the ordinary stature of boys of seven and eight.  Many hardships to which these defenceless beings were subjected, have been alleviated by the exertions of the celebrated and benevolent Mr. Jonas Hanway, who obtained an act of parliament, enacting that every Chimney-sweeper's apprentice shall wear a brass plate in front of his cap, with the name of abode of his master engraved on it, thus enabling any humane person to take immediate cognizance of their treatment.  Happily, however,  for the cause of humanity, a society has been lately established to alleviate the misery of these unfortunate beings, by the adoption of a mode of sweeping Chimnies by a machine, which, upon the examination of several intelligent persons, has been highly approved.'\n\nThere then follows a note about the Foundling Hospital, on Guilford Street, the location of the itinerant trader featured in this plate.",
