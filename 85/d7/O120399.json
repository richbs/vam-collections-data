She required an extensive wardrobe for the many formal dinners and state functions that she had to attend.\n\nLady Alexandra dressed exclusively at Jacques Fath (1912-54), and he also supplied her accessories. A hat was considered the essential finishing touch to any outfit during the 1940s and 1950s, and this hat completed an outfit that Lady Alexandra wore to the unveiling of a statue in honour of her father, Field Marshal Earl Haig, in Montreuil-sur-Mer in 1950.",
