The couple married in 1891 and Sweet Nell was the first of several romantic-historical dramas with which they became indelibly associated. Although they toured extensively, they also had annual six-month seasons from 1905 until 1913 at the New Theatre. Fred Terry's great-nephew Sir John Gielgud once recalled that Terry and Neilson \u2018took the theatre dreadfully seriously. This made them extremely good in rubbish. They performed in very fustian plays\u2019.\n\nParrott & Company was established by Arthur William Parrott and his brother Charles Henry Parrott in about 1921 in the Albert Street Pottery, Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent.  It was amalgamated with Burgess and Leigh at the beginning  of World War Two. Charles retired and moved to Ilfracombe but Arthur continued in the business.",
