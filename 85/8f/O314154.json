This irregularly-shaped heraldic relief represents the coat of arms and was perhaps an architectural decoration in a secular building or church, or possibly it adored the side of a tomb. The imagery suggests an ecclesiastical context. The sunken field implies it might have been part of a moulding, either for a tomb or as part of an architrave. In style this panel recalls late 15th and early 16th century pieces in Castile, and its provenance supports the idea that it was produced in Toledo. It is in the same tradition as the far larger and more magnificent coats of arms in the north transept of S. Juan de los Reyes in Toledo by Juan Guas (active 1459-d. 1496). What is probably a slightly later heraldic relief is to be seen on the side of the tomb of Juan L\u00f3pez de Le\u00f3n in Toledo Cathedral.",
