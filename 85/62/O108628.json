Cupid, the god of love, here holds the torch of Hymen, the god of marriage. This classical subject was typical of Rennie\u2019s work; he studied under Bertel Thorvaldsen in Rome in the 1820s, and was much influenced by the Danish sculptor\u2019s style, which echoed the sculpture of ancient Greece. Rennie supported the establishment of the Government School of Design in the 1840s, which was a forerunner of the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
