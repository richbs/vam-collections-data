This coat is one of a group of chestnut-brown leather garments screen-printed with silver bees and trailing chrysanthemums. The leather is treated as cloth, with puffed sleeves and a high-waisted silhouette. The Museum also has a suit from this collection (T.334&335-1995)\n\nBill Gibb's designs were particularly influenced by non-Western dress. He revelled in rich textures and patterns and lavish use of fabrics. This coat comes from his first solo collection for Autumn-Winter 1972. Previously, he had worked for Baccarat from 1968 to 1971, before launching his own design label.",
