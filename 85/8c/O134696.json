The drawing is from almost exactly the same viewpoint: but evidently both it and No. 112 [130-1888] are taken from nature and there is no reason to assume in the case of a subject frequently sketched by Constable that they were necessarily made at the same time.  The oil sketch, with the angular clouds, conspicuous bristle marks and inky blue sky may be compared with No. 111 [161-1888], and the same reasons would hold for assigning this to a date <i>c.</i>1810-15.\n\nNote on Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888]\n\nNos. 109-113 form a miscellaneous and somewhat unhomogeneous group.  Most of them have either been assigned to a date near 1811 or may be compared with another oil sketch assigned to that date.  Accordingly, though their general character hardly warrants a dating more exact than <i>c.</i>1810-15 or within even wider limits, they are grouped together here.  Their relationship to Nos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888], the earliest oil sketches in the Museum to show the full effect of the revolution in Constable's style, helps to justify this grouping.\"",

His attachment to Maria Bicknell became known during this year, and he received her father's permission to write to her in October.'\n\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 69]",
