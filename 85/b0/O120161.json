Originally the character Dundreary was fairly insignificant but Southern worked it up until it became the talk of the town.  It was revived several times at the Haymarket with Southern in the role up until 1878.  Later his son Edwin Hugh revived the part. \n\nEdward Askew Southern played a few parts in Britain before going to America in 1858. He was essentially an eccentric comedian but after the runaway success of his portrayal of Dundreary he attempted romantic roles in other plays, none of which enjoyed the same acclaim.",
