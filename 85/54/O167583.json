            "bibliography": "Tobias Jellinek, Early British Chairs and Seats, 1500-1700 (Woodbridge, 2009), plate 88, page 93. English. Oak. Circa 1580 The back panel of this highly remarkable and exceptionally sophisticated armchair is an interesting geometric variation of the back panels of Plate 89 and 91. This time, though, the central motif is a lozenge containing a carved triad of daisies and is surrounded by four other panels, each with a different floral carving. The substantial horizontal arms with scroll ends have fine foliate carving along their sides. The arm supports are fluted columns with Corinthian capitals on cylindrical bases carved with \u2018S\u2019 motifs, and the legs are similar but with fish scales carved on their bases. A series of wild roses is carved along the seat rails and the seat edge has narrow rope carving. The stretchers are carved with a chain motif with two simple scratch-mouldings on the top edge. Note particularly the carving on both sides of the squares on either side of the front rail, the applied lion masks on the top rail, the carnation and pomegranates on the rail itself and the cockerels\u2019 head on the upper end of the \u2018ears\u2019. Last, but not least, note the amazing crest depicting two scantily clad women leaning casually against a delicately carved Tudor rose with a turned and carved finial. This crest bears a curious similarity to the crests on the two armchairs from Salisbury, Plates 110 and 111.\nEnglish. Circa 1580\nSee Country Life, Sept. 28th 1935, pp. 320-21 About 1620. 'This chair is in remarkable condition, its only restoration being the small finial above the Tudor rose.'\nWINDISCH-GRAETZ, Franz: M\u00f6bel Europa. 2.
