Silk brocades in the style known as \u2018ito-maki\u2019 are wrapped round the section of the scabbard near the suspension cords. When the sword was worn with full armour, this helped to prevent the expensive lacquer from being abraded. \n\nThis mounting was made for a 14th century sword. It was probably assembled about 1850.  The tachi blade itself is signed \u2018Bishu Osafune Morimitsu\u2019 (Morimitsu of Osafune in Bizen) and dates from the late 14th century. The blade has been shortened considerably, perhaps by as much as 10 centimetres. It has a strong gunome choji-hamon.\n\nSir Claude MacDonald was British Ambassador to Japan from 1905 to 1912. He had a particular interest in swords. According to V&A records, this blade was given to him by \u2018Prince Katsura\u2019. Sir Claude\u2019s widow, Lady Ethel MacDonald, gave the V&A four splendid swords.",
