It was the first to be designed and manufactured by the GPO, but was a commercial failure.  It was designed and produced in-house at the GPO's factory in Cwmcarn, South Wales, from the mid-1970s.  The design brief was for a compact phone capable of fitting on a narrow shelf (which meant the bell set had to be external).  The design was deemed old-fashioned by the public, and most stocks were scrapped after 1977. The Silver Jubilee special edition phones were issued as gifts by the GPO, and others were rented or sold to the public.",
