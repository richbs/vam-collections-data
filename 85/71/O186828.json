It was completed between 1778 and 1781 while Soane was travelling in Italy in the company of Grand Tourists who had admired Chatham. \n\nSoane had previously drawn upon ideas from Peyre 1765 for the Triumphal Bridge and James King Mausoleum. In the case of the Chatham Mausoleum, Soane borrowed from Peyre's plan for a sepulchral chapel, however, eventually he decided to elongate the chapel in order to provide greater space for internments. He grafted on to the centralised shape a long niche-like projection reminiscent of the Serapaeum of Hadrian's Villa.\n\nThe entire evolution of the design is an excellent instance of Soane's eclectic design process at work and other Soane mausoleum designs relate to the Chatham one, including a British Pantheon.\n\nThis copy of the elevation comes from the collection of James Charles Richardson, Soane's assistant from 1824-1837, and is perhaps less faithful to the original design.",
