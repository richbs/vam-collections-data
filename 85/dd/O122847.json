Dresden was an important centre for porcelain production and decoration in the late 19th century in response to the rise of Romanticism.\n\nDresden china has been described as the 'rococo revival' style. Called 'rococo' after the French word 'rocaille', the style was inspired by the decoration of artificial grottoes or rock work in French gardens.  Characterised by the shape and swirling lines on the base of this figurine, the style also suited ornately decorated figurines such as this.  The maker of this figurine has also taken obvious pride in reproducing the intricate lacy jabot and cuffs in porcelain.",
