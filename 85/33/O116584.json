            "public_access_description": "'Paul Nash was one of the most influential British painters of the 20th century. By introducing elements of surrealism and abstraction to the English landscape tradition, he played an important role in disseminating European modernism in Britain. In 1933 he co-founded the art group 'Unit One', with Herbert Read, Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. He exhibited at the International Surrealist Exhibition in London in 1936. As an Official War Artist, his evocative landscapes captured the conflict and desolation of both World Wars. Nash was also a prolific book illustrator, designer, photographer and writer. He taught at the Royal College of Art (1924-1925 and 1938-1940). Notable students included Edward Bawden and Eric Ravillious.'\n\nFrom London Transport Museum 'Our Collections' page, London Transport Museum webpage.",
