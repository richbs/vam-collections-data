The Art of Deception</i>, held at the British Museum in 1990, these two portrait miniatures of John and Frances Croker, born Kingsmill, previously attributed to Nicholas Hilliard, were displayed as examples of nineteenth century fakes or pastiches.  The catalogue entry written by Jim Murrell (1), then conservator of miniatures at the V&A, detailed the technical grounds for this attribution (2). Until the mid-1970s these miniatures had been accepted as by Hilliard, perhaps the foremost Elizabethan miniature painter.  Authorities in the field, such as Graham Reynolds and Erna Auerbach had previously regarded them as characteristic examples of Hilliard's work (3).  But from 1975 the two works were reattributed as 19th century, perhaps painted around the 1840s by the miniature painter George Perfect Harding (1779/80-1853)(4).  In a forthcoming paper this attribution is reconsidered and the miniatures re-attributed to Hilliard.
