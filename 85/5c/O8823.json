The pictures nearly always show the sitters splendidly dressed in the height of expensive fashion, often in order to emphasise their new wealth, status or nobility.\n\nPeople\nIf the identity of a sitter for a portrait of this period is lost, it is often surprisingly difficult to recover it. Owners may be  tempted to identify their pictures as being of someone famous, especially if the costume is very sumptuous. This splendid portrait was until recently thought to be of Charlotte de la Tr\u00e9moille (1599-1664), Countess of Derby,  but the woman depicted is too young.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nWealthy men and women sometimes spent enormous sums of money on their dress, even if they were mere citizens and not ennobled. It is sometimes difficult to realise that even obscure but ambitious merchants and landowners would invest a large amount of their wealth in their clothes, so that they could resemble the courtiers that surrounded the King.",
