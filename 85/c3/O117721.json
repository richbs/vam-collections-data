The bodice is lined with a white, glazed cotton with bones at the front seams. There are holes for a lace fastening at the centre-back and a draw tape around the neck.\n[Skirt] Skirt, flat pleated to a silk waistband with a panel of tighter pleating at the back, where it fastens with a brass metal hook and eye.

The diaphanous wool gauze woven with a silk stripe enhances the effect. Light materials such as printed gauze and muslin were popular for day and evening wear, and ribbon bows in harmonious colours provided attractive trimmings. \n\nThe sleeve borders and skirt flounces on this example are printed with a separate pattern so that they complement the shape of the dress. This style of printing and weaving was popular in the late 1850s and 1860s as it emphasised the width of the sleeves and skirt.",
