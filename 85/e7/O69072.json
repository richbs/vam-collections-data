Tea sets were common on the silver stands at the exhibitions, and were often used for experiments with new styles. Contemporary illustrations reveal that items as humble as pepper pots, eggcups and toast racks were offered by several manufacturers in the medieval style. This is a particularly successful example of domestic Gothic, which can be attributed to the training of the designer. John Hardman Powell was the only pupil of the architect and designer A.W.N. Pugin, and later became Pugin's son-in-law. William Burges, who organised the medieval display at the 1862 exhibition had this to say about Powell: 'At present, the silversmiths, with the exception of Hardman, keep clear of the figure, and the simple reason why Hardman is the exception is that there is an artist, Mr. John Powell, at the head of the establishment'.",
