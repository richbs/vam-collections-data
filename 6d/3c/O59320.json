Art and Love', catalogue of hte exhibition at the Queen's Gallery, 2010, no. 180, pp. 261-2). The table was given to Prince Albert as a Christmas present in 1855.  Both table and cabinet were at Osborne in the late-nineteenth century (Osborne Catalogue, 1876, vol. II, p. 22) where they stood in the Small Drawing Room or Audience Room. It is not known when or how the table left the Royal Collection.\n\nIn 1964 the table was with the dealers Kerrins in London and was bought by Mr George Farrow, who presented it to the V&A.",
