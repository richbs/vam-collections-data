            "public_access_description": "Mezzotint is an engraving technique where the surface of a metal plate is roughened and indented by a \u2018rocker\u2019, a tool with metal teeth.  The rocker makes lots of dotted indentations in the surface of the plate which hold ink.  To allow a gradation of tone, certain areas of the plate are burnished \u2013 the surface is smoothed - so that their ink-holding capacity is reduced.  Mezzotint allows subtle variations of tone to be achieved.\n\nGodert de Ginkel, first Earl of Athlone (1644-1703) was a Dutch general who served under William III and Queen Anne; he fought at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 and as Lieutenant General and Commander-in-Chief in Ireland was charged with crushing the Jacobite cause.  In 1692 he was created Baron of Aghrim and Earl of Athlone for his services to the crown.\n\nJohn Smith (1652-1743) was a leading London mezzotint engraver, producing many engravings after portraits by Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723).  Smith trained in London under the Dutch painter and engraver Jan Van der Vaart.  The German-born Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723) came to London in 1676 and, following the death of Sir Peter Lely in 1680, he became court painter to Charles II - a position he maintained under four successive monarchs.  He was also involved in politics and was a member of the Kit-Kat club - a group of prominent early-eighteenth century Whig writers, artists and intellectuals.   \n\nHere Ginkel is shown in full armour holding a baton, a symbol of his authority as a general, and resting his hand on a helmet.  In the background, to the right, a battle takes place.  Military figures were often depicted in a classicised style of armour in this period, even though armour was no longer worn on the battle field.  Along with the general\u2019s baton, the armour is used to create the image of a battle-hardened commander and his role in warfare.",
