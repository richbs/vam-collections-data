The numbering is not consistently sequential . For example, there are no 'L' numbers 8, 9 or 10: the numbering jumps from 7-11.\n\nSome sets of the edition were printed in red, others in blue. When the edition was finished the artist painted the blocks to signify their cancellation as blocks and designated them as sculptural reliefs.
