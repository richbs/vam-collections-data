McLean, London, 1924; and <i>Characters at the West End of the Town, Drawn and Etched by Richard Dighton</i> (referred to as <i>West End Characters</i>), published by McLean, 1825.  The latter volume contains an additional plate by George Cruikshank. \nA number of these portraits were included in a reduced form in a roll entitles <i>The Mirror of Fashion</i>, published by W. Samms, London, 1822-3, re-issued by McLean, 1825 (BM:S.14817), an impression of which is in the Department of Prints and Drawings, E.2257-1929. \nThe caricatures are discussed and listed by Sir Henry Hake in 'Dighton Caricatures', <i>The Pint Collector's Quarterly</i>, Vol.13, London, 1926. \n\u2026 \nThey'll be done, We are obliged to thee.  (BM:S.14064)  Caricature portrait of Samuel Gurney (1786-1856, Quaker bill discounter and philanthropist, in <i>City Characters</i>.  \n<i>Lettered with title and</i> Drawn Etchd. & Pubd. by Richard Dighton, 1820.  <i>Inscribed in pencil</i> Mr Overend. \n<i>Etching, coloured by hand.</i>               E.3815-1953 \n\n<i>Note:</i> This portrait is sometimes identified as John Overend, Samuel Gurney's partner, and is so described in a faint pencil note on the print, and in a manuscript list bound in the front of the volume.  On the whole the evidence suggests that the subject is Samuel Gurney.  A reduced version, with the same title, is in the Department of Prints and Drawings, E.2257-1929. \nConfusion has also arisen between this subject and another Dighton portrait which has sometimes been described as Samuel Gurney (see E.3826-1953 (BM:S.14529)).\"",
