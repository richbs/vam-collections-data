The catalogue entry lists numerous copies of the painting by Von Angeli and others. Apparently Von Angeli asked Queen Victoria's permission in 1887 to paint a copy of the earlier portrait, but this was refused (Millar, p. 5). However, the signature and date of the present painting suggest that the Queen was persuaded otherwise, and that this is the result.",

During the sittings in 1875, the Queen described the portrait in a letter to her daughter as follows: 'It is quite <i>en face</i>; hands crossed before me as I generally stand; my usual Evng. Cap - & a black satin dress cut square as I wear them in the winter.' (1) Queen Victoria was delighted by portrait, describing it as 'absurdly like' and 'a marvellous likeness - as if I looked at myself in the glass' (2).\n\n<u>Notes</u> \n(1) Oliver Millar, <u>The Victorian Pictures in the Collection of HM The Queen</u>, Cambridge, 1992, cat. 5, p. 4\n(2) Ibid.",
