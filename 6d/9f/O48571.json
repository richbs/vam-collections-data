The dessert might consist of fresh or candied fruit. Steel-bladed dessert knives could also be used to cut cheese or cake.\n\nTable Cutlery & Flatware Development \nTo the specialist, the term 'cutlery' refers to edged tools, such as knives, while 'flatware' denotes forks and spoons. By 1700 diners were no longer expected to provide their own knives, forks and spoons  at dinner and there was a clear distinction between table and dessert cutlery and flatware. The dessert  wares were smaller and often gilded to reflect the status and expense of the dessert course and to protect the silver from attack by fruit acids. Originally part of a matching set, dessert ware became more elaborate in design than the cutlery and flatware used with earlier courses. Cutlery and flatware formed the cheapest element of a silver dinner service and was often bought first, before the sauce boats, tureens and plates.\n\nManufacturer\nIt is very unusual to find marks on a piece of close plate which enables the manufacturer to be identified. Thomas Butts is one of only a small number of close platers working in Birmingham whose marks are known.",

The dessert might consist of fresh or candied fruit. Steel bladed dessert knives could also be used to cut cheese or cake.\n\nHistorical significance: It is very unusual to find marks on a piece of close plate which enables the manufacturer to be identified. Thomas Butts is one of only a small number of close platers working in Birmingham whose marks are known.",

The dessert  wares were smaller and often gilded to reflect the status and expense of the dessert course and to protect the silver from attack by fruit acids. Originally part of a matching set, dessert ware became more elaborate in design than cutlery and flatware for use with earlier courses. Cutlery and flatware formed the cheapest element of a silver dinner service and was often bought first, before the sauceboats, tureens and plates.To the specialist, the term `cutlery' refers to edged tools, such as knives and `flatware' to forks and spoons",
