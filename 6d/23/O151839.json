            "public_access_description": "Between 1876 and 1893 Alphonse Legros taught at the Slade School of Art in London. While other art schools advocated detailed compositions, placing great emphasis on shading, Slade students were encouraged to make rapid linear sketches from the life model. Legros was an accomplished portraitist, but this study was probably a one-hour demonstration drawing made against the clock in the Slade life room.",
