It was designed exclusively for them by the artist Humphrey Ocean who had been artist-in-residence at the gallery in 2002, culminating in the exhibition 'How's my Driving'. Ocean has given the traditional seasonal iconography of Father Christmas and one of his reindeer a fresh contemporary feel, rendering them in his characteristic loosely-drawn flat style in dark green and red outlines against a white background. What looks like a loop on the back of the reindeer suggests an ornament for hanging on a Christmas tree.",
