In the book, this fear is turned on its head, so that Jasper is in fact a lion trapped in the body of a small boy, pondering his noble past and wondering what is to become of him.\n\nThis is a folded book, its leaves joined together by means of two strips of gold-coloured adhesive tape, so that each page appears suitably regal for a lionhearted boy. The text is handset on Somerset paper and illustrated with three original collographs by Susan Johanknecht. The texture and shapes of these prints hint at the idea of a lion rather than explicitly depicting one, whilst the colour and texture of the cover boards suggest a lion's hide.",
