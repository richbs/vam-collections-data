The back is set witha large cartouche, framed in rococo motifs, the ground set with a trellis of giltwood.  The case contains carved and dressed figures of the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph to either side of a blank central section at the base, which must originally have held a crib with the Christ child.  Above are three angels.  The floor of the case is decorated with a blue and white lozenge pattern, which may relate to the arms of the house of Wittelsbach, the rulers of Bavaria.",

The figures illustrated the story of the Nativity, the birth of Christ.  Some examples included a large crowd of figures, as well as the central players in the story, and were designed for use in a large church or convent.  This crib was probably designed for a private house, as only the Virgin Mary and St Joseph are shown, with three angels.  The figure of the Christ child lying in the manger or cradle, which should have been the centre of the scene, is now lost. \n\nIn the eighteenth century, the areas around Naples in Italy and in Bavaria in Southern Germany, were particularly noted for making such figures and figure groups.  This nativity scene may have been made in Bavaria.  The blue and white lozenges which pattern the floor are found on the coat of arms of the Wittelsbach family, which ruled Bavaria.",
