This poster design was for the comic opera Rose of Persia, which featured a plot centred on dancing girls and thick with mistaken identities and disguises. It played at the Savoy in 1899 and was a great success, focussing more heavily on dance than other comic operas. \n\nPeople\n\nDudley Hardy made his name originally as a painter and illustrator. His bold venture into poster design in the 1890s gave him scope for all sorts of unconventional ideas.  Although he was influenced by designers of the French 'artistic' poster, such as Jules Cheret, he developed a characteristically English approach with his simplified style and integrated lettering. After his initial success with a poster nicknamed 'The Yellow Girl', advertising the To-Day magazine, many of his earliest posters were commissioned  for theatrical productions by the well-known firm of publishers Waterlow & Sons. \n\nDesign & Designing\n\nPoster magazine praised the clarity of outline and colour schemes in Hardy\u2019s work and described him as a pioneer of the 'artistic' poster. Hardy gave his views on design in an interview with the same magazine in December 1899: 'both from the artistic and commercial point of view, [posters] should be as simple and striking as possibly; very little background, very little detail, a bold, striking line which will arrest the eye of the passer-by.'",
