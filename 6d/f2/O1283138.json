When Laurence Olivier invited him to join the new National Theatre Company, at the Old Vic, Robert Lang was already earning high praise as an actor. From 1971 until his death he was married to Ann Bell, best known for her portrayal of Marion Jefferson in the BBC war drama Tenko. The couple appeared together in Tenko Reunion.\n\nMichael Annals began his career in 1961 by designing the sets and costumes for the Old Vic company's Soviet Union tour of Macbeth and their production of Dr Faustus at the Edinburgh Festival. Annals produced designs for several original Broadway theatre productions, including The Royal Hunt of the Sun in 1965, the short-lived Those That Play the Clowns in 1966, Staircase in 1968, and Noises Off in 1983. From 1966 through 1967, Annals served as Associate Professor of Scenic Design at Yale University. Annals was nominated for the 1969 Tony Award for Best Costume Design for his work in Morning, Noon and Night, though the award was won by Loudon Sainthill for his work on Canterbury Tales.",
