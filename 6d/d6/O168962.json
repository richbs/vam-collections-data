Four vertical pieces of dress fabric sewn together to form a cover.\nDark blue satin ground divided by metal thread serrated leaves into an ogival lattice.  The metal thread has largely worn away.  It is silver strip close S-wound on a yellow silk core. Each compartment contains an oval-shaped spray with a central rosette and with buds.  Pale green silk can be seen but any other colour has faded.  Where pairs of leaves join there is a small flower head.\nWhere the textile has faded the yellow silk core for the metal thread is white.\nBacking: pieced; striped cotton, red and white. The red stripes have a white pattern of daisies and stems and leaves.  The white stripes have an isolated motif of a pink rose with trails of small red and yellow flowers and green leaves.",
