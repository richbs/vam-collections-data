            "public_access_description": "Benjamin Turner was one of the first, and remains one of the greatest, British amateur photographers. He began practising photography in 1849 according to the technique patented in 1841 by the British inventor W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877). Turner's photographs were 'contact' printed from paper negatives (known as calotypes) of the same size as the print. He printed them on albumen paper, which is paper that has been floated on an emulsion of egg white containing light-sensitive silver salts. Between 1852 and 1854 Turner compiled 60 of his own photographs, including this one, in what is believed to be a unique album, 'Photographic Views from Nature'. It might have been a sample book, a convenient method for presenting photographs for personal pleasure, and for showing to colleagues or potential exhibitors. It remained in the Turner family until it was bought by the Museum.\n\nThis is one of several photographs Turner made of the house and grounds at Loseley in Surrey. The house itself had been built in 1562-1568 for the More family. Queen Elizabeth I apparently visited Loseley on no less than three occasions. Although the bricks used in constructing the house would have been made on site, most of the stone was carried there from the ruins of nearby Waverley Abbey. Turner was fond of photographing the residences of the aristocracy, something he had in common with other early amateur photographers.",
