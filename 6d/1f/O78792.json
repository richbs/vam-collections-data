It is equally likely that they used a designer who was keeping up with with current international taste.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAlthough arabesques, strapwork and other elements of Renaissance ornament were known to English designers, they were seldom used in their pure form. Usually they were combined with specifically English motifs or modified to suit the current English taste for more naturalistic design.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis style of embroidery belongs to a group in which rich woven fabrics were applied to one another and embellished with minor details in silk and sometimes metal thread and sequins.",
