Both plaques could have been displayed alongside each other in a scholar's study.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nWhen this majolica (tin-glazed earthenware) panel appeared in the sale of the Pourtales collection in 1865, it was described by Robinson in his recommendation for purchase as \"most exquisite and rare [and] by one of the greatest of the early maiolica painters.\" Its importance was widely recognised with the publication in 1873 of C. D. Fortnum's catalogue of the majolica at South Kensington, in which it was described as \"perhaps the most artistic production of the Italian painters on enamelled pottery which has descended to us.\" A study by ceramics curator Bernard Rackham in 1930 made it the central example in a group of ten pieces attributed to the \"Master of the Resurrection Panel.\"\n\tAlthough the TB monogram has not been identified convincingly with any named painter, the style in which the panel is painted suggests that it was executed by someone, probably working in Faenza or Urbino, who had as precedent examples the work of artists such as Andrea Mantegna, Melozzo da Forli, or Girolamo Genga, as well as the distinctive Resurrection woodcuts of Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Taken together, these features suggest a date after 1510, which is confirmed by comparison with dated pieces of majolica.\n\tAttitudes toward majolica, what was essentially a painting on a ceramic ground, were somewhat ambivalent. An extreme viewpoint, held by Richard Redgrave and quoted in the 1853 Marlborough House catalogue, was that \"Landscapes and pictures are almost always out of place in pottery.\" Italian majolica was regarded technically, Redgrave continued, as \"a ceramic art . . . [but] important primarily for its painted decoration, often of a pictorial character.\" Rackham was likewise very much attuned to the qualities considered appropriate to ceramics, but in his writings about majolica he made constant reference to contemporary painters and concluded that because of the Resurrection Master's \"skill of hand and his gifts of imagination alike he must be accorded an honourable place in the history of Italian art.\"\n\tBy claiming it to be \"quite as excellent in its degree as great works of painting and sculpture of the same period,\" majolica pieces such as this were given canonical status, thus legitimising applied arts through reference to the fine arts. It is perhaps an irony that, following the transfer of the ceramics collection to the top floor of the Aston Webb building in 1910, this canonical masterpiece has been almost lost among the many riches of the collection, with no visual indication of its importance.\n\nLit.
