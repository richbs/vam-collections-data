Such depiction of the effects of light and atmosphere was very popular with the major patrons of the day.\n\nPeople\nAugustus Wall Callcott (1779-1844) was trained at the Schools of the Royal Academy and was principally a landscape painter whose preference was for coastal and marine scenes. This view was executed late in Callcott's career. It reveals a similarity between his work and that of the 17th-century Dutch lanscape painters that was being eagerly collected in Britain.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe painting, which depicts a herd of cattle with the Dutch town of Dort or Dordrecht in the distance, is typical of thousands of landscapes in the Dutch style. The imagery of a townscape in the background, with its tall spires, and the peaceable cattle in the foreground, was a useful formula for the imitation of old master painting by British Victorian artists.",

First studied music in the Westminster Abbey choir, then painting with John Hoppner RA; entered RA Schools 1797. Exhibited 129 works at the RA between 1799 and 1844, and 14 at the BI 1806-38. A few early exhibits were portraits, but he soon achieved success with picturesque landscapes influenced by Gainsborough and 17th-century Dutch painting. From about 1815 exhibited principally coastal and marine subjects; his work was compared to that of Aelbert Cuyp and, especially, Turner, with whom he had a close association. Also painted classical landscapes in the manner of Claude, and a variety of genre, humorous, literary and historical subjects. Travelled abroad, notably in 1827-8 following his marriage to Maria Graham, a writer of art and travel books and most famous for <i>Little Arthur's History of England</i> (1835). Elected ARA 1806, RA 1810, knighted 1837. Served on committees for the Government Schools of Design and the National Gallery, and was appointed Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures 1843. Died Kensington 25 November 1844; his studio sales of drawings and watercolours were at Christie's 8-12 May 1845 and 22 June 1863. Although in his lifetime his work commanded high prices and attracted the leading patrons of the day, it was not always well received by the critics, particularly in later years; Ruskin wrote that 'he painted everything tolerably, and nothing excellently'. \n\nLIT: \t<i>Athenaeum</i> 17 December 1831, pp817-8, 30 November 1844, pp1097-8 (obit); <i>Art Union</i> 1845, p15 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p9, 1866, p99, 1896, p334; J Dafforne <i>Pictures of Sir A W Callcott</i> ... nd [1875] (referred to below as Dafforne); <i>Portfolio</i> 1875, p161; DB Brown <i>Augustus Wall Callcott</i> Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (with full bibliography and list of archival sources) (referred to below as Brown) \n\n\n<b>Dort (Dordrecht)</b> \nFAll Neg GK5682 \nPanel, 31.7 x 76.2 cm (12\u00bd x 30 ins) \nSigned and dated 'A W Callcott 1841' br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1842, and acquired by John Sheepshanks before 1847, when a lithograph was published by Dibdin (see Engr. below). Brown comments that the painting must have appealed particularly to Sheepshanks, who collected Dutch 17th-century prints, and that it is 'a cabinet picture designed to appeal to a specific \"old master\" taste'. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> critic wrote: \n\nSurely this is beating Albert Cuyp on his own ground; there is the same spire and other lofty objects in the distance; and - not the same cows, but their descendants fully as well-favoured as they - which Cuyp has painted twenty times in an atmosphere not so palpable as in this picture, which is in short a Callcott with figures, every whit as Dutch as even Cuyp made his, and without any balancing between Dutch nature and human nature. \n\nCuyp was born and worked in Dort (Dordrecht), in the south-west Netherlands, and painted views of the town several times. The present painting may be compared with 'A Distant View of Dordrecht' (the so-called 'Small Dort'), which was shown in an old master exhibition at the BI in 1818 (81), bought by Wynn Ellis in about 1840, and bequeathed by him to the NG in 1876. Other recorded paintings of Dort by Callcott include 'A Distant View of Dart, a group of figures and horses, in the front ground, on the bank of the river', signed and dated 1830, painted for General Phipps and sold at Christie's 25 June 1859 (94), bought Ford for \u00a3283 10s. \n\nBrown comments that 1842 was 'a year when Callcott summarised his lifetime's achievements in landscape'. \n\nEXH: \tRA 1842 (262); <i>Augustus Wall Callcott</i> Tate Gallery 1981 (23) \n\nENGR: T C Dibdin <i>Sir Augustus Wall Callcott's Italian and English Landscapes.
