The elaborate pattern is more often paired with a bamboo shaped handle as basket.\n\nMaterials &amp; Making \nThe technique of press-moulding glass with the aid of a hand-operated machine was first perfected in the United States of America in the early 1820s. It took only two people to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. By simply depressing a lever, a metal plunger was lowered into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Europe and Britain, giving rise to stylistic changes and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid- to late 19th century the first period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved quality while cutting costs even further.\n\nPeople \nGreener &amp; Co., in Sunderland, was a relatively small firm which often produced innovative patterns and designs.\nThe firm of Henry Greener (-1882) at the Wear Flint Glass Works in Sunderland, Tyne and  Wear, had run in partnership with James Angus since 1857 and registering designs under the  name of Henry Greener &amp; Co. since 1869.",
