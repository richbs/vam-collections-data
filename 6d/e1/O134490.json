Before 1800</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 56-63, cat. no. 60 (P.26-1938 - P.78-1938)\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Luca CARLEVARIJS (1663-1730) \n<i>Venetian School</i>  \nBorn at Udine, he moved to Venice with his sister in 1679, and later visited Rome. He was influenced by Sebastiano Ricci (1659-1734). A mathematician and architect as well as a painter and engraver, he was the first Venetian to paint vedute (mainly for a foreign and diplomatic market), his predecessors having been foreigners such as Joseph Heintz (in Venice by 1625). There is no evidence for the view that Canaletto was taught by him, though Canaletto was plainly influenced by his works. His paintings are comparatively rare. \n\n60 \nFIFTY-THREE STUDIES \n<i>Canvas</i> \n(except where otherwise indicated) \n\nP.60-1938 A man wearing a red jacket 6 1/2 x 2 7/8 (16.5 x 7.2)\nRizzi (1967): No.35, fig.33\n\nThese well-known sketches by Carlevarijs include figures which he used frequently and virtually without variations in his paintings between 1707 and 1726. In addition, some of the figures in his etchings of 1703, <i>Le fabriche e vedute di Venetia</i>, are related to them (Pope-Hennessy, 1938). He seems therefore to have used them during the greater part of his active life as a painter. They demonstrate his influence on Canaletto, whose figures and their arrangement in some of his early paintings show a marked debt to Carlevarijs, in, for example, <i>The Doge visiting the Church and Scuola di S. Rocco</i> of circa 1735 (London, N. G.) (Constable, 1962). \nAmong the figures which are used most often, P.68 appears in: <i>Piazza S. Marco con ciarlatini</i> (Berlin-Dahlem, Rizzi, 1967, pls. 104-07), <i>Piazza S. Marco with a market</i> (Rome, formerly Lazzaroni Collection; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 101-03), <i>Piazzetta seen from the Molo</i> (Milan, private collection; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 42), <i>Regatta on the Grand Canal</i> (Copenhagen, Frederiksberg Castle; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 35-7), <i>Piazzetta from the Sea</i> (formerly Munich, Collection Drey; Rizzi, 1964, pl. xxxii), <i>Molo with the Zecca</i> (Rome, Galleria Nazionale; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 57 f.), <i>Piazza</i> (Poznan; Mauroner, 1945, fig. 25). The left-hand figure of P.65 appears in, amongst other paintings: <i>The Duke of Manchester's Entry into the Doge's Palace</i> (Birmingham, City Art Gallery; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 28-30), and the other version of this subject (The Hague; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 31-4), <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Balcarres; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 96-9), <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Kiplin Hall; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 119 f.), <i>Il bucintoro in bacino S. Marco</i> (Rome, formerly Lazzaroni Collection; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 43-4), <i>Riva degli schiavoni</i> (Milan, Collection Fano; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 54-6), <i>Piazza S. Marco con ciarlatini</i> (Berlin Dahlem; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 104-07). P. 76 can be seen in: <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Kiplin Hall; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 119 f.), <i>The Duke of Manchester's Entry into the Doge's Palace</i> (The Hague; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 30-4), and <i>Piazzetta seen from the Malo</i> (Milan, private collection; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 42). P. 69 appears in the first two of those paintings, and P.72 in <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Hartford; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 115-16), and <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Kiplin Hall; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 119 f.). \nThe earliest dateable painting, <i>The Duke of Manchester's Entry into the Doge's Palace</i>, 1707 (Birmingham City Art Gallery) includes P.37, P.64, P.65 and P.69. Even more of the figures are used in <i>The Reception of Count Colloredo</i> (Dresden), dated by Rizzi to Colloredo's mission of 1726, rather than that of 1714: P.42, P.43, P.44, P.50, P.55, P.57, P.58, P.59, P.61, P.63, P.67.\nThis is not intended as a complete list of paintings in which the sketches were used, but it does demonstrate that once Carlevarijs had devised his principal figure types he used them again and again throughout his career. He presumably worked them up from pen and pencil sketches from life such as those also in the Museum (D.1352A-1887), several of which relate in general terms to the oil sketches. \n\n<i>Prov</i>.
