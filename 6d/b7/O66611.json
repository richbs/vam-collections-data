The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. Work probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\n\nThis illustration depicts the miraculous events that were said to have taken place in Mecca at the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. Idols fell from the walls in places of worship and the water in the sea drained away. At some time in the painting's history, probably in the 19th century, the faces of all the living beings have been obliterated.",
