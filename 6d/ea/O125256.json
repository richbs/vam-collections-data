After a short time in the army, he studied painting in Rome with the painter of miniatures, portraits and copies of old masters G B Canevari. First painted miniatures, but soon specialised in portraits, particularly of ladies of fashion (winning great reputation and patronage), ballet dancers, and also Italian subjects. Exhibited 77 portraits at the RA between 1842 and 1877, 32 Italian subjects at the BI 1850-65, 44 works (nearly all portraits) at the SBA 1840-76/7, and three paintings at the Grosvenor Gallery 1879; also exhibited in Rome. Lived at Cleveland Row, St James's, from 1847 till his death 12 August 1883. A sale of his collections, including his own works, was at Christie's 22-26 February 1873. Maas describes him as 'one of the best and most typical' painters of his kind. \n\nLIT: <i>Vanity Fair</i> 1 September 1883, p119 (obit);] Maas <i>Victorian  Painters</i> 1969, pp212-3; B Stewart and M Cutten <i>Chichester Artists</i> 1530 1900 Canterbury 1987, pp3-6 (With full bibliography and portrait photograph); B Stewart and M Cutten 'The Forgotten Genius of Richard Buckner' <i>Antique Collector</i> April 1989, pp34-41\n\n<b>Portrait of a Boy Chorister of the Chapel Royal</b> \nP30-1962 Neg HF955 \nPanel, 45.1 x 29.2 cm (17\u00be x 11\u00bd ins) \nSigned 'R Buckner f\u2019 diagonally br \nClaude D Rotch Bequest 1962 \n\nPossibly the 'Portrait of Master Wood, of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, St James's exhibited at the SBA in 1874. Unlike most of the exhibits, no price for this is given in the catalogue; presumably the work was painted on commission. Brian Stewart provides the information that Buckner's account books list under 19 November 1873 'Portrait of Wood (posthumous) \u00a3210'; this was a high price for a portrait, and the present work seems likely to be a sketch for the finished and exhibited picture. Another entry in Buckner's account books concerns the Wood family: 16 April 1875 lists Mrs Wood of 25 Baker Street for \u00a3130. The directories for that address around 1870 have John Henry Wood, glass manufacturer to the Queen, presumably Master Wood's father; he died in 1875. \n\nWhen acquired, the portrait bore the title 'A Boy Chorister of the Chapel Royal, Windsor'; this is incorrect, as the Chapel Royal is opposite St James's Palace. The choristers, always 12 in number, began wearing the distinctive frogged scarlet frock coat and breeches in the early 18th century, and continue to do so today. The artist had his studio in Cleveland Row, opposite St James's Palace. \n\nEXH: ?SBA 1874 (202); <i>19th Century English Art</i>  New Metropole Arts\nCentre, Folkestone, 1965 (44)\"",
