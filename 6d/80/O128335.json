He joined the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1642.  From the mid-1650s until his death, Berchem shuttled back and forth between Haarlem and Amsterdam where he died in 1683.\n\nThe present painting is a copy of a work by N. Berchem in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin. In this painting, a conversation at an inn door, the artist focuses his attention on the interaction between the figures and the architectural settings. In the composition, the horses seem as important as the human figures. Such detail is representative of the new interest in Holland for nature and its creatures. Berchem had many followers and his oeuvre was extensively copied during his lifetime up to the 19th century.",

Parsons, 1870\n\nJohn Meeson Parsons (1798-1870), art collector, was born in Newport, Shropshire.  He later settled in London, and became a member of the stock exchange.  His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.\n\nHistorical significance: The present work is an exact copy, perhaps of 18th century date, of a painting by Berchem in Berlin. (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, Die Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, <i>Die holl\u00e4ndischen Meister 17. und 18. Jahrhundert</i>, 1932, pl. 13; size: 32 x 27 cm.) Another copy was on the London art market in 1960. This composition is typical of his pastoral scenes, which were frequently engraved by Berchem himself, as well as by other artists such as Johannes Visscher in the 17th and 18th centuries . As no engraving of this composition is known, this painting may have been copied after the original.",

            "historical_context_note": "Nicolaes Berchem (1620-1683) was born in Haarlem and trained by his father, Pieter Claesz., and then by the famous landscape painter Jan van Goyen. He was a prolific painter (about 850 paintings), draughtsman and etcher. He joined the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1642. From the mid-1650s until his death, Berchem worked in Haarlem and Amsterdam, where he died in 1683. He adopted a classicizing manner and is best known for his imaginary Italianate landscapes. It is not certain whether he visited Italy or knewn it only through the drawings of artists who had travelled there. \n\nBerchem had many followers and influenced artists outside the Netherlands. The French painter Fran\u00e7ois Boucher owned some of his works in the mid-18th century, and he inspired Francesco Zuccarelli, Marco Ricci, and perhaps Antoine Watteau. Italianate landscapes were popular from the 17th century and the market for them remained strong until the early 19th century. The term conventionally refers to the school of Dutch painters active in Rome in the 17th century who specialised in pastoral scenes bathed in warm southern light, in an Italian, or specifically Roman, landscape. The term is also often applied generally to artists who never left the Netherlands but worked in an Italianate style. The taste for such works continued undiminished into the 19th century.",
