            "public_access_description": "John Cox Dillman Engleheart (1782/4-1862) was the nephew of George Engleheart (1750/3-1829).  George Engleheart was an accomplished and successful miniature painter and JCD Engleheart became first his pupil and later his assistant.  JCD Engleheart entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1800, where his age was noted as 18, and by 1807 he had apparently established his own painting practice separately from his uncle.  He worked for some time in Birmingham, and married Mary Barker of Edgbaston, Birmingham, in 1811.  \n\nThis miniature is one of  two by Engleheart of seemingly related sitters acquired by the museum (see also E.3162-2007).  The identification of the sitter, the attribution to JCD Engleheart and the dating are provided by a small metal plate attached to the back of the frame; this reads, \"Charles Stuart J.D. Engleheart. 1814\".  The frame has not been opened while in the V&A and it is possible that this plate repeats a manuscript inscription found on the back of the object; the artist signed either on the back or the front of his miniatures, and sometimes both.  Engleheart favoured the larger, rectangular format which from about 1800 gradually replaced the smaller oval format of his uncle's generation of miniature painters.  His work is variable in quality, but these are good examples of his better work.",
