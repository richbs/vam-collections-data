The bar of the watch is gilded brass and is not original; the hands are also later replacements. \nThe watch was taken from the treasury of Tipu Sultan at the Siege of Seringapatam in May 1799 when the British army defeated the ruler of Mysore in southern India. It was given to the Indian Museum by Colonel E.F. Waterman of the Madras Staff Corps on 12 March 1877 and was said to have been purchased from the soldier who killed Tipu Sultan. On the back is an engraved inscription: 'This watch was found on the person of Tippoo, Sultan of Mysore on his death and was presented to the Indian Museum by Colonel Edmund Frederick Waterman (Madras Staff Corps) specially to carry out the wishes of his late dear wife, a daughter of Brigadier Robert McDowell into whose hands as Lieut.
