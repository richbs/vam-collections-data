            "physical_description": "Holster for a pistol or revolver, leather and silk velvet embroidered with silk in straight stitches, couched metal thread and cotton in chain stitch.\nBasically this is an elongated triangle with slightly curving sides.  The back is flat and is made from brown leather. At the bottom is a leather strap which has been stitched directly onto the leather, it ends with a metal buckle and is 10 cm long; it is secured with cotton stitches.  The lower edge is bound with a narrow strip of green leather.  There is a line of yellow silk stitching down the sides.  Towards the top of the back there is a larger downward pointing arch shape in green leather.  Inserted into this are the two ends of a brown leather strap forming a loop and stitched in place with cotton twine.  These are further secured by a horizontal piece of brown leather and a piece of green leather which are stitched into 2 small horizontal arch-shaped pieces of green leather. \nThe front is formed by a curved piece of leather joined down the sides to the back but open at the bottom.  An arch-shaped flap of leather covers the upper half of the front but is now loose and joined only in the top right hand corner. This reveals that the upper part of the front has a top layer of blue plain weave cotton bound along the top edge with green leather.  The blue cotton seems to continue underneath a layer of light blue card through which the embroidery has been worked. This is done with couched metal thread with some details in green, yellow, faded mauve and pink silk probably over a padding of loose fibres. The design on the lower part shows a straight stem, 2 lower flowers, central flower with pointed petals above with two facing lions and a branching stem and flowers.  There could be a large bird attacking the lions, but it isn't clear. The flap is backed with blue plain weave cotton through which the silk embroidery has been worked.  The edges are embroidered in red, white, mauve, yellow, dark blue and green.  The design on the flap shows two lions attacking a horned bull or cow, with flowers.\nMetal Thread: [1] silver strip slightly open S-wound on white silk.\n[2] silver-gilt strip close S-wound on pale yellow silk.",
