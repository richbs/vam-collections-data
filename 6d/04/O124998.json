Studied drawing with Samuel Prout and entered RA Schools 1809. Won silver medal of the Society of Arts 1810. Travelled to Paris 1815, and lived in Rome 1816-30. Exhibited 51 works at the RA between 1823 and 1855, and 18 at the BI 1813-40. Subjects principally classical, historical and biblical, but also later Italian genre subjects. Elected ARA 1827, RA 1830. Also pursued a distinguished administrative career, notably after election to PRA 1850, and his directorship of the NG 1855-65. Several publications, notably <i>Materials for the History of Oil-painting</i> (1847), and translations of German art treatises. Married the author Elizabeth Rigby 1849; died Pisa, Italy, 24 December 1865; his wife refused a public funeral for him in St Paul's Cathedral.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1855</i>, p277, 1865, p60 (obit); Lady Eastlake <i>A Memoir of Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</i>; 1870 W Monkhouse <i>Pictures by Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</i> 1875; D Robertson <i>Sir Charles Eastlake and the Victorian Art World</i> 1978 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>The 'Cumaean' Sibyl</b> \nF6 \nPaper on canvas, 29.8 x 24.1 cm (11\u00be x 9\u00bd ins) \nForster Bequest 1876 \n\nPainted over an engraving after Domenichino's painting of 1616-17 in the Borghese Gallery, Rome. R E Spear reproduces and discusses the painting (<i>Domenichino </i>1982, text vol pp191-2, p117l); it was evidently much admired and well known, as he lists 17 copies and five engravings (the latter by M Benedetti, P Fontana, T Marcucci, C Zocchi, and G Folo). In the painting, there is musical notation on the scroll of paper. Spear comments that the classic female type in the painting marks the beginning of a long tradition in which Eastlake presumably saw himself participating. \n\nPROV: Given to John Forster by Lady Eastlake, the artist's wife\"",
