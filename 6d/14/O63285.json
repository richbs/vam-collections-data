On the left the god is shown  descending on the shoulders of the Bird-man Garuda.  In the middle, the god places his two normal hands on the head of the kneeling Elephant, whilst Garuda stands behind him, on the extreme right is seen the crocodile biting the elephant's leg with the released Gandharva Huhu issuing from it with his hands in the anjalipose.  Above and below the middle band is a narrow openwork band of quatrefoils, and round the whole runs a fillet of rosettes, The back of the panel shows the backs of the front figures.",
