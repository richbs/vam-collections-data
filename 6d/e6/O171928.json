He is best known by these later works, but even his earliest productions suggest his future interests.\n\nSeen as a group, his very earliest prints, made while he was studying in Essen, from 1916-1919,  already demonstrate a thematic, serial approach. This self-portrait  is one of a series, made in the style of contemporary German Expressionism. They are different yet related views of the same subject. Significantly, they are comparatively abstract, indicating his concern, even at this relatively early stage of his career, with analysing visual phenomena rather than representing them.",
