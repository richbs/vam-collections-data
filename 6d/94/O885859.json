The air burner is not very clearly drawn, but appears to have been a wick holder perforated with slots to supply air close to the burning oil, which must have been colza or some equally heavy vegetable oil.   The material used in the production of the wares is not specifically stated but was probably brass, as there are numerous references to finishes, such terms as \" bronz'd \" and \" lacker'd,\" being engraved against the parts.   The lustre drop is described as an \" icicle.\"   Dimensions are freely given and in some places the prices have been written in.   The quality of the wares in every case appears to have been first class.\"",
