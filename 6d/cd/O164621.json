Sniffed from the back of the hand, pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff taking was enjoyed at social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder, were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts. Decoration varied from the most expensive in jewelled gold and silver, to much more modest boxes, such as this, carved in wood.\n\nShoe and boot shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. This carved mahogany snuff box is decorated with brass piqu\u00e9 work taking the form of a heart on the front and on the sole of the shoe, so it may well have been given as a love token. The top has been hollowed out to form a container covered by a sliding lid. The size, weight and materials of this box made it easily portable.",
