As a result, the shoulder is shaped like an eight-pointed rosette when viewed in plan.  The flat rim  slopes down into a dished area.  At the centre of the dish a  thick grooved moulding leads to a cylindrical shaft which carrys the, now partially preserved, socket.\n\nThe engraved decoration is arranged in bands around the body.  From the top, an epigraphic band circles the socket, bordered below with a band of silver-inlaid guilloche.  On the neck, four sets of seven rosettes of silver-inlaid  tangent discs alternate with knots.    A guilloche runs around the grooved moulding that isolates the the shaft from the dished area.  \n\nThis dished area is decorated with 8 sets of five discs with lotus buds at top and bottom, the central disc in each inlaid with copper.  These sets alterate with pyramids formed from  two discs topped with a lotus bud, all silver-inlaid.  These are flanked by scrolling brackets.  The short, slanting edge that leads from the rim to the dished area is decorated with foliate scrolls.\n\nThe rim carries an epigraphic frieze framed by a silver-inlaid fillet that loops at each point of the rosette.  \n\nOn the upper section of the walls an epigraphic frieze is enclosed by horizontal silver fillets.  Below on each of the eight facets are lambrequins decorated with four interlocking, scrolling circles with lozenge-shaped leaves.\n\nThe vertical base is engraved with an epigraphic frieze, framed by two horizontal fillets of silver. \n\n Patina: fine purple red to reddish brown",
