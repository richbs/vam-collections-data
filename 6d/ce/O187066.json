This took the form of a calendar illustrating twelve works of art by graduate students of the Royal College of Art.  Rod Kelly was one of the students whose work was selected.  In 1983, the public relations company, Butler, Dennis, Garland and Partners Ltd. working on behalf of Diary Crest were asked to approach art galleries and museums with a view to donating the works of art illustrated in the calendar.  The bowl by Rod Kelly was eventually given to the National Museums of Scotland.  This Kite bowl was subsequently commissioned by Diary Crest for presentation to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The formal presentation was made at the Hyatt Cadogan Hotel, Cadogan Place Knightsbridge on March 1st, 1984.",
