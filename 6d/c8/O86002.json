The rest of the surface is painted with ribbons, jewelled strings, pairs of books, lozenges, tassels and flowering branches with finials. Inside are divided into eight panels each with a leafy branch and two flowers rising from a rock. A central medallion with a bald-headed rider on a mule amidst flames. The design is of European origin, with inscription originally in Latin; probably copied from a Chinese bowl with this decoration. Imitation Chinese square mark in black.",

The source of the original commission has not been identified. Examples appear in Lisbon where a dish is in the ceiling of the Santos Palace installed in the 1660s, a bowl appears in a Dutch still-life dated 1638 by Willem Claesz Heda (1594-c.1681) in the Hamburger Kunsthalle (JHH 2009), and there is a bowl in the British Museum (OA 1957,1216.19). As well there was a bowl available to the Iranian potter, who made this bowl. The inscription is 'SAPIENTI NIHIL NOVUM' (sic) (To the wise man nothing is new). The rest of the decoration is Chinese in character with Buddhist motifs and lotus flowers. The Iranian potter faithfully imitates the design, but the inscription is completely illegible as it was in a foreign script. The bowl is an important document in the history of international trade, evidence that a design made for one customer could be copied and sold to others of different nationalities. For an Iranian variation on this design see 2911-1876.",
