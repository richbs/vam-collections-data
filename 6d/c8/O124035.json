Copied works by George Morland, and studied watercolour painting with John Varley. Entered RA Schools 1805. Associated with William Henry Hunt, William Mulready, Dr Thomas Monro, and later William Blake. In a long and prolific career, he exhibited 176 works at the RA between 1807 and 1881, 91 at the BI 1808-59, and 52 watercolours at the OWS (Member 1812, Treasurer 1817). Subjects mainly portraits up to the late 1840s, then landscapes. Worked also in engraving, etching and mezzotint. Surprisingly, he submitted his name unsuccessfully for election to ARA 1821, and withdrew 1842; the RA later offered him membership, which he refused. Died Redhill, Surrey, 20 January 1882; a memorial exhibition was held at the RA 1882-3. Three of his sons (James Thomas, William, and John junior) were also artists, and his daughter married Samuel Palmer. \nLIT: \tRedgrave Cent; Art]oumal1882, p262 (obit); A T Story Life ofJohn Linnell 2  vols, 1892 \n\n488-1882 Neg Y1307 \nPanel, mahogany, 24.8 \u00d7 38.1 cm (9 \u00be \u00d7 15 ins) Signed 'J Linnell' bl and inscribed on the back as below [ones Bequest 1882 \nA MS label on the back reads: 'No 2/The Farm,/Evening/J Linnell/Porchester terrace/Bayswater/1851', indicating that the work is probably the painting of that title exhibited at the BI in 1851 and listed by Story as painted in 1850, size 10 by 16 inches.
