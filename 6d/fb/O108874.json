Although Nizamu\u2019d-Din died in 1325 it is not clear how much of this present tomb dates from that period. The main part of the present structure as seen in this photograph was built in 1562-3 by Faridu\u2019n Khan, a high ranking nobleman. The verandah, which encloses a square chamber and is lined with arched openings was built in 1652-3. In the photograph, a man can be seen seated in the verandah looking into the square chamber. The tomb is topped with a dome ornamented with stripes of black marble. \n\nTo the west of the tomb, and on the left hand side of the photograph, is the Jama \u2018at-Khana-Masjid. This is in a similar style to the Ala-I-Darwaza (at the Kutb complex), being veneered with red sandstone and the arches lined with \u2018lotus-bud\u2019 decoration.\n\nSignature and negative number in bottom left hand side.",

Although Nizamu\u2019d-din died in 1325 we are not sure how much of this present tomb dates from that period. The main part of the structure shown here was built in 1562 to 1563 by Faridu\u2019n Khan, a high-ranking nobleman. \n\nThe veranda, which encloses a square chamber and is lined with arched openings, was built in 1652 to 1653. Here, a man sits in the veranda looking into the square chamber. The tomb is topped with a dome ornamented with stripes of black marble. To the west of the tomb, and on the left-hand side of the photograph, is the Jama\u2018at-Khana-Masjid (mosque).\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
