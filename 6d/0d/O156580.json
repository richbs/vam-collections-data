He was elevated to the peerage of Ireland as Baron Charleville and Viscount Tyrconnel in 1718. In 1725 he was made a Knight of the Bath. He first married Eleanor, daughter and coheir of his uncle, Sir John Brownlow. She died in 1730, and on January 24, 1732, he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Cartwright of Marnham, Nottinghamshire. He was a member of Parliament for Grantham and Lincolnshire from 1731 until his death. (Schroder, 1988, p. 207)  The design of the mirror is admittedly somewhat 'retardataire' for its putative date, when most of de Lamerie's work was beginning to incorporate rococo elements, but there is no sign of any alteration, and it can therefore presumably be dated on the evidence of the coat of arms. It seems likely that the mirror formed part of a toilet service purchased on the occassion of Brownlow's second marriage, having possibly been in the goldsmith's stock for some time. A third mirror, silver - gilt, but otherwise identical, was formerly in the collection of the late Francis Stonor (Grimwade, 1960, p. 43, no. 11). This, too, is unmarked; mysteriously, the owner of the monogram, coronet, and supporters that surmount it has not been identified.

Violet, Lady Melchett,  sale, Sotheby's, lot 140, June 20, 1946.  Purchased from Partridge (Fine Arts) Ltd., London, 1980.",
