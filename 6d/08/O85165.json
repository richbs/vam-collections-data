He was billed as \u2018The Swell Comedian with a Method Entirely His Own\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums.\n\nBorn in Liverpool in 1881, Weldon made his first appearance in music hall in Barrow in March 1900 and in London that year at the Marylebone. In 1910 he appeared with Fred Karno\u2019s troupe and Charlie Chaplin in The Football Match at the Nottingham Empire. He was known for his eccentric clothes, eyes that seemed always shut, ponderous face and sibilant voice. His comic characters included \u2018Stiffy the Goal-keeper\u2019 and \u2018Jack Sheppard\u2019. His catchphrases included \u2018\u2018s no use\u2019 and \u2018Tell them what I did to Colin Bell\u2019, which he used after 1914, when the Australian heavyweight boxer was knocked out at Olympia. Weldon died in 1930.",
