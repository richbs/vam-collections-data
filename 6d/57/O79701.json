The loose pendant bells, always of an odd number, served the double purpose of allowing the infant\u2019s mother to keep track of its location while simultaneously scaring away any evil spirits.  Bells were rarely attached to stiff bracelets of this shape.\n\nAnklets similar to this were worn over a wide area, but the facetted polyhedral ends are characteristic of many kinds of jewellery worn by the tribal populations of North Africa, Syria and Arabia.  This example was acquired in Cairo and described as \u2018Modern Egyptian\u2019.",
