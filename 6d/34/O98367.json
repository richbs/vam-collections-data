It has its origins in the fancy-dress of several Greek mountain provinces and it became the importance of the national dress during the wars of independence. \n\nThe actual King's Guards are formed by two hundred men, especially selected among the regular service men. They come from all parts of Greece, besides their moral qualities they have to be 1.80m tall. Military service in Greece lasts 24 months, the soldiers may enter the Guards after a recruit training of three months and a battalion training of three to five months. A soldier gets for the first six months a pay of Drachmes 45 000.- ($1.50) a month, for the last 18 months 60 000.- ($2.00). Four times a week they get a meat meal, mostly meals consist of white beans, potatos [sic], bread. \n\nThere are two hundred of them. Their main task is the guard of the several entrances of the Royal Palace in Athens and the King's summer residence in Tatoi. Besides, they have every four weeks to form the guard in front of the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The other weeks it is the turn of the infantry, marine and air force. Each hour the soldiers are relieved.\"\nStatement issued by The John Hillelson Agency.\n\nKing Constantine II of Greece (b. 1940) went into self-imposed exile in December 1967 following a military coup in April of that year. The monarchy was abolished by referendum in 1974.",
