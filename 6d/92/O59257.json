            "public_access_description": "This chair is very simple in design but was made by the largest and best-known furniture-making firm in Paris in the 1800s. The firm, Jacob-Desmalter, had been founded in 1765 by Georges Jacob, who supplied carved furniture and chairs for Queen Marie Antoinette (1755-93) before the French Revolution. During the revolutionary years Jacob took care to maintain favour with whichever government currently ruled France. In 1796 his sons took over the business, and in 1803 the firm of Jacob Fr\u00e8res changed its name to Jacob-Desmalter. The Emperor Napoleon spent huge sums on redecorating the former royal palaces, and the firm undertook much of the work. Its workshops also supplied furniture to members of the new imperial court.\n\nThis chair was part of the furnishings ordered by the military hero Marshal Ney (1769\u20131815) for his house in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Saisseval. The inventory of the house taken after Ney\u2019s execution in 1815 listed the furniture of the Petit Salon as mahogany with upholstery of blue brocaded satin. The current green upholstery was probably put onto the chairs in the 1950s.",
