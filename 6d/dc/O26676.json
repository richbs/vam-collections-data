THE POPULAR GAME OF TRIO\n\nThe game is provided for three players, and to select the dealer the players draw cards, the one drawing the card of the highest value becomes the dealer for the first hand, after which the deal passes to the left.\nAfter shuffling, thirteen cards are dealt to each person, one at a time, in rotation commencing on dealer's left and the odd card, known as the floater is left face downwards on the table.\nThe player on the left of the dealer bids first or passes and the other follow in rotation.  If all players pass the hand is abandoned and the deal passes.\nThe lowest bid is 5 tricks in Apples, and the highest 10 tricks in Grapes, overcalled only by Misere.\nThe bidder of the highest number of tricks of the most valuable suit has the call and lead irrespective of possible score, for instance a bid of 5 tricks in Oranges is higher than 5 tricks in Apples and so on, also a bid of 6 tricks in Apples is higher than 5 tricks in Grapes although the possible score in Grapes is 20 against 6 only in Apples.\nThe bidding ceases when a call made by one player is passed by the other two and the hand is played with the last named suit as trumps.  At the conclusion of the bidding the declarer only has the option of exchanging any card in his hand for the floater, the discard remaining unexposed.\nThe player who becomes declarer leads and the other must follow if possible with a card of the same suit, failure to do so constitutes a fault and if the offender is other than the declarer the full number of points according to the bid is claimed by the declarer, so also are an equal number claimed by each of the other players if the declarer is the offender.\nIf unable to follow with a card of the same suit a player has the option of playing a trump card and claiming the trick, or discarding a card of any other suit.  If the declarer makes the number of tricks specified in his bid, or a greater number, the points to be scored for each trick won are according to the value of the suit in which the hand is played.\n     If trumps are Apples, each trick counts 1 point.\n     If trumps are Oranges, each trick counts 2 points.\n     If trumps are Bananas, each trick counts 3 points.\n     If trumps are Grapes, each trick counts 4 points.\nLITTLE SLAM - 12 tricks any suit, add 10 to score.\nGRAND SLAM - 13 tricks any suit, add 20 to score.\nMISERE - Score 50 and beats all other calls.\n\nIf dealer fails to make his contract he scores nothing for any tricks won, and his opponents each score the gross value of the tricks bids.\nMisere beats all other calls and the declarer contracts to lose all thirteen tricks.  If forced to take a tricks, he scores nothing, and the opponents each score 50.\n\nThe game is for 100 points, or the highest over to win game.",
