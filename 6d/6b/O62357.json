            "physical_description": "[Longcase clock case] The mahogany case consists of arched hood flanked by half columns at front and quarter columns at back, supporting three brass finials (these may be later replacements, as may their mahogany plinths). The half columns at the front support curious trefoil shaped capitals.\nThe replacement door (which is paler in colour than the surrounding case) has a herringbone border and pronounced pendulum lenticle positioned rather too high and not corresponding with the base of the pendulum. The plinth base is also decorated with herringbone border, although this appears to be wider than the door. The plinth is supported on bracked feet which are apparently a later addition and may replace a lower plinth.\n[Movement] The movement is a good example dating from about 1800 of a type mass-produced in Halifax. It is attached to the dial with three rather than the usual four feet. The seat board of the movement is usually lined up with the base of the window but is rather higher.\n[Dial plate] The dial plate is surprisingly clean and regular and probably machine milled. It may date from the 1940s. The hands-of blued steel-are compatible with the date of the dial but may be a later marriage; the hour hand is a little too long; the minute hand is a little too short for the dial. The patination of the minute hand is rather less blue than the hour hand. Above the dial a circular plaque is crudely engraved with the figure of Father Time. This is flanked by standard dolphin mounts. A larger ring mark around this suggests that this 20th century plaque replaced a missing name plate or a strike/silent disc.\n[Dial] There are two filled holes in the matted dial centre and the surface has been deliberatly distressed in these areas to camouflage the alterations. These should have been intended for a calendar dial but there is no corresponding date work in the movement. The standard spandrel mounts feature a central female head.",

            "historical_context_note": "The clock is a fairly recent marriage of case, dial and movement. As such, it represents an interesting teaching piece.\n[Longcase clock case] The architectural features of the case suggest a date of about 1730, but the lenticle is a feature normally associated with long case clocks in abour 1700 although it is found on provincial examples later in the 18th century. As the door is a replacement, the lenticle may have been around it suggests that the adapted door of the case was originally part of a clock case made in the North West of Britain.\n[Movement] The deal back to the movement is surprisingly clean. The movement is a good example dating from about 1800 of a type mass-produced in Halifax. It is attached to the dial with three rather than the usual four feet. The seat board of the movement is usually lined u p with the base of the window but is rather higher. The weights are of lead rahter than breass as would be expected for a 1730 date. A shadow on the back of the case suggests that the pendulum was originally hung lower or that the present movement is not original to the case. the bell does not have a pleasing sound.\n[Dial] The dial appears to date from about 1700-the form of signature 'Londini Fecit' was common at this date and went out of fashion shortly afterwards. The dial may have come from the same workshop as the V&A's Martin bracket clock (W.61:1-1926).",
