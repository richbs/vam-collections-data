They often had inscriptions such as 'Mother', like this one, or of names characteristic of the period, such as 'Florence', 'Maud', 'Beatrice' and 'Grace'.\n\nPeople\nGeorge and Robert Sydenham formed a partnership with Claude Tebbitt which ended in 1875. When George died in 1910, he left an estate worth the then large sum of \u00a314,729, an indication of the firm's prosperity. The firm, which had premises in Tenby Street, Birmingham, became a limited company in the same year. An advertisement in 1913 describes the firm as manufacturers of diamond and gem-set jewellery. It ceased trading in 1930.\n\nPlace\nBirmingham was the largest centre of jewellery making in Britain.  Estimates of the number of people employed in the trade and its branches in 1913 ranged from 40,000 to 80,000.\n\nTime\nThe First World War had a huge impact on jewellery making in Birmingham, as many of the younger men joined the armed forces. Yet the trade continued, and many firms made buttons, badges and parts for munitions. Women, already working in significant numbers in some parts of the trade, took on further work. However, the union and  employers agreed in June 1916 that 'no women or girl labour employed during the War is to be retained to the detriment of male labour'.",
