Another version, dated 1682, is at Burghley House, Stamford, Lincolnshire.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis over-life size bust, dated 1684, was probably inspired by an engraved or painted source. It may be based on a portrait of Charles II dating from about 1670, by the Dutch painter Simon Verelst.\n\nPeople\nHonor\u201a (Onorato) Pelle was probably a native of Marseilles, and is likely to have trained under the French sculptor and painter Pierre Puget (1620-1694). Pelle seems to have spent most of his working life in Genoa, where he undertook commissions for churches, including a silver statuette of St John the Baptist.\n\nCharles II had spent much of his youth on the Continent, and favoured continental arists. Although it is not known how or why this bust was commissioned, it is clearly in the tradition of flamboyant and imposing portraits of monarchs, and would have unambiguously asserted the King's status.",

Little is known of Pelle, who seems to have spent his working life in Genoa, perhaps after training in Rome. He almost certainly never came to England, and the bust was probably based upon a painting or an engraving after a painting. This sometimes happened when the subject could not sit for the artist, most famously when Charles I was sculpted by Bernini in Rome, the bust in that instance being based upon a painting sent over by the Court Painter Van Dyck.\nGiven by Mr Henry Durlacher.\n\nHistorical significance: Charles II is portrayed in a dramatic and animated fashion, his head turned to one side,an elaborate wig cascading down over his lace cravat and billowing drapery. Such grand Baroque images of monarchs and powerful aristocrats were more common in seventeenth century France and England than in England. This piece may have been inspired by Bernini, particularly works such as his bust of Louis XIV at Versailles.",
