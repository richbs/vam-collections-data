It is fully lined in a green/grey synthetic lining, probably originally the same colour at the matching coat but some fading has occurred probably to the coat. The bonnet's shape is cut straight around the nape of the neck and forms a rouched stitched ruffle effect running from below each ear around the brim. \nThere is a looped strap stitched to both sides to form a loose chin strap to be tightened around the child's chin. There is a bow of the same fabric stitched on to the brim of the bonnet. There are also two even lines of  seamed detailing running from ear to ear across the crown part of the bonnet to mirror the detailing on the bottom portion of the coat.\n[coat] This coat is a peppermint green wool. It is fully lined in a pale pink synthetic fabric and has an A-line shape, fitted around the arms and shoulders and flaring out from above the waist, the hem falling at about knee length. The coat has a small rounded collar and four rows of double breasted plastic buttons from the neck to the waist; it then flares without any fastenings. Below the buttons the skirt section  has been cut on the round to create a fully flared effect on the back skirts of the coat. From the waist down the coat has stitched detail of six stitched pleat lines running in even sections horizontally around the full skirt. The bottom right hand button (when facing) is missing. The company label is sewn in to the back neck of the coat.",
