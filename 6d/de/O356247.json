Medium high waist-line, leg of mutton sleeves with a narrow facing at the cuff, and a skirt arranged at the waist in tight even gathers, and with a broad facing band on the reverse of the hem. The bodice is loosely cut and gathered at the shoulders into two narrow applied bands edged with piping. It is similarly trimmed at the medium low neck. The bodice is not attached to the waist band in front so that it could be lifted for nursing. It would have been held in place with the gathering tape through the bottom of the front of the bodice and there are pin marks in the band of the skirt. The dress fastens at the back with buttons with a metal wire foundation over which is stretched cotton. There is a tape fastening at the back waist, which runs through a worked eyelet, and possible to tie in the front. A part lining is stitched inside the bodice and it is an integral part in that the button holes are worked though it. It includes lining with a draw tape for adjustment for the short puffed sleeves, and lines the back, top and sides of the front but is cut away at the centre front.",
