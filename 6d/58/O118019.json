There are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian, and each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  Ring brooches differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  \n  \nA horves\u00f8lje or tagges\u00f8lje (barbed ring brooch) is made of cast metal, and is characterised by its small protruding prongs or studs.  Horves\u00f8ljer were most common around 1700, when they are often mentioned in inventories, but were no longer made by the 19th century, when they seem to have gone out of fashion.  They were mainly worn in the area around Tinn, but versions were also found in other places in Telemark, and in Setesdal.\n\nThis ring brooch was described as Norwegian, from the seventeenth century, when it was acquired by the Museum in 1957.",
