He made several visits to London, the first in 1871 at the time of the Paris Commune. \n\nIt was during this visit that the bust of the vivacious Mrs Turner (n\u00e9e Louisa Westall) was commissioned. The plaster model for this bust is in Copenhagen (Ny Carlsberg Glypotek) and still retains the drop ear-rings which have broken off the marble version here.  Two years later Carpeaux produced a marble bust of Mr Turner (A.20-1984), as a companion piece.\n\nFor this portrait, Carpeaux has chosen to depict Mrs Turner in a style and composition reminiscent of 1750s. The brilliant depiction of the dress and virtuoso marble carving, retaining the vibrancy of the original model, are a re-working of an earlier idiom to perform new functions. Patrons whose wealth often came from industry and trade - and Mr Turner was the owner of a firm manufacturing paint and varnishes -  were often represented in a style of a previous era. In this way they are associated with the pre-Revolution, grand and aristocratic earlier age.",

The original plaster, inscribed 'J.-Bte Carpeaux 1871' was in the sale of the atelier Carpeaux, 30 May 1913, and is now in the Carlsberg Glypotek, Copenhagen. \n\nCarpeaux asked to make a second, more informal, bust of Mrs Turner. This second marble is in the Mus\u00e9e de Valenciennes and the plaster for this later version, acquired by the Louvre in 1895, is now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris.",
