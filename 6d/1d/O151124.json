Display dishes with elaborate free-hand trailed decoration were made by several families of country potters, of whom Thomas Toft I is justly the most famous. In the Burslem area, 'tygs' (multi-handled jugs) and posset pots for communal drinking were made on a commercial scale, as well as porringers, and small cups for strong ale. Before salt-glazing was introduced to Staffordshire about 1700, imitations of stonewares were made with streaky brown glazes.\n17th-Century Slipware\nMade in the South East and South West of England; 160-1700\nLead-glazed earthenware with impressed, applied or trailed white slip decoration\nRed earthenwares with trailed white slip designs were at first imoported from the Netherlands. They were later copied at Harlow in Essex, at Wrotham in Kent and, by the mid-17th century, in North Stafforshire. The Harlow kilns supplied London throughout the 17th century with 'Metropolitan Slipwares' often bearing moralising inscriptions. The farmer-potters of Wrotham supplied their local market with robust multi-handled 'tygs' from about 1600 until the 1730s. In Wiltshire, special covered pots for mulled ale were made for wassailing on Twelfth Night.",
