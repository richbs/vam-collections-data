They helped to protect fabrics such as silk and satin which could not easily be washed. Women also used them to keep the hems of their dresses clean when playing sports or out walking.\n\nDesign & Designing\nPatents helped market ingenious new devices. Many skirt holders had names such as 'Bicycle', 'Eureka', 'The Grappler', 'Invincible', 'The Automatic' to help the average customer who might find it difficult to describe a special grip. B.O. Brendel took out the patent for these skirt grips on 12 April 1902. They were recorded as 'dress suspenders'.  An abstract accompanying the patent explains the relationship between the clips, chains and plate and states that the skirt may be 'held at any height'.  There are also two drawings.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis pair of skirt holders was probably used for outdoor exercise.  The serrated edges of the clips could have been only been used on heavy woollen fabrics, as the teeth would have torn more delicate materials.  The dagger-shaped piece of metal at the top would have been inserted into the belt or waistband to keep the skirt grips in place.",
