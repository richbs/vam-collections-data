            "public_access_description": "Gianni Versace opened his first shop in 1987 on the via Spiga in Milan, and presented his first signature collection as well as his first menswear collection. As one of the most important Italian designers of the 1980s and 1990s, Versace became famous for his flair and strong colour sense and clean lines. After Gianni's death, his sister Donatella took over the house of Versace. \n\nThis ensemble was given to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Sir Roy Strong. Author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to 1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria & Albert Museum, Sir Roy was a high-profile figure known for his strong sense of personal style. Within a fairly conservative dress code of suit and tie, Sir Roy frequented designers known for sartorial exuberance such as Gianni Versace, who was a personal friend. Versace frequently used his logo (Medusa, the woman from ancient Greek legend who had snakes instead of hair) to embellish his designs.  Within this ensemble, the tie and belt in particular, represent Versace\u2019s flamboyant use of print and surface decoration. The tie is printed with Versace\u2019s Medusa logo. In addition, the jacket\u2019s buttons and lining, and the belt\u2019s metal studs also feature this motif.",
