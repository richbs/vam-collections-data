            "public_access_description": "Measured drawing of a window surround in the Cortile of the Valmarano at Vicenza by leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The Palazzo Valmarana was rebuilt for Leonardo Valmarana by Andrea Palladio 1565-1566. This window is one of those above the colonnade of the courtyard, at the top of the giant order which adorns the lower two floors. In designing the fa\u00e7ade to the courtyard Palladio was influenced by the fa\u00e7ade of Baldassare Peruzzi\u2019s Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne, a building Chambers also studied and drew (see cats.298 and 547-548). The sheet has been trimmed along the top edge leaving a fragment of an inscription, and along the right-hand edge removing the outer part of the window surround. Chambers has included profiles of the mouldings on this elevation.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
