It is pierced, first, by a single leading retainer hole, 7mm in diameter, which receives the point of the piece of cake. This hole is followed by four pairs of diverging holes, which decrease progressively to 3mm diameter and which act as piercing of the blade when the cake is removed. The blade is 4mm thick at centre and decreases in thickness to bevelled edges. It has a flat bottom and polished surfaces. It rises via a heavy forged lift to a spreading handle which is cross-peened and gilted on both sides. The handle is 2cm wide at the terminal and has a gently rounded end edge. The hollow triangular piece if cake is \u201cdouble layer\u201d with a 6mm middle \u201cicing layer that leaks out on the right side; the bottom layer exhibits two oozes of icing. The top layer has a 6mm icing layer and two \u201ccream\u201d swirls at the rear. The latter are actually the caps of two rods that terminate in thread and that engage the rear pair of holes in the blade and hold the piece firmly in place.",
