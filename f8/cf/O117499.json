            "public_access_description": "Jennifer Wright is an artist who works with textiles, and in particular with the tools, motifs and concepts of embroidery, but translated into other forms and materials. As part of her installation at the Eagle Gallery (for the exhibition 'Space Craft', with Jane Langley)  Wright produced site-specific prints which she used to screen the windows in the gallery. Her starting point was a series of photographs taken through the windows of the gallery of the street scenes outside.(As the title suggests, in coded form, this print was based on a view of the NCP multi-storey carpark opposite). These were imported into PhotoShop, a standard computer package, which she used to enhance their luminosity; she then transformed these images into layered drawings, lifting certain elements of the visual information to create a mediated version of the photograph that functioned as selective time-based analysis of the original visual data.\n\nThis data was then codified - or schematised - to produce an embroidery-type pattern, using software specifically designed for embroiderers to design and plot their patterns. The colour palette is DMC, a standard brand-name embroidery thread, and the printed pattern itself is expressed both in colour and in DMC code. The result is apparently abstract imagery which nevertheless holds onto vestiges of the information from the photographs - a sense of spaces and outlines, and of course the window structure itself as a framing device. Wright's other works in the exhibition incorporated translations of the window print imagery as panels of digital print on PVC and as embroidery.\n\nWright sees the computer as the equivalent of a vitrine -  a gallery display case - which holds an image in waiting, in a transitional stage between one kind of information and another. By screening the windows with patterns produced in this way, the interior space of the gallery becomes the equivalent of this virtual 'space' behind the screen, a kind of meditative space. This effect was enhanced by the filtered daylight shining through the print-screened windows as if through digital stained glass.\n\nThis print and its companion piece BAKERSROW36 (E.501-2005) was reprinted in 2005 for the V&A collection.",
