            "public_access_description": "Martin Baker's modelling prowess is evident in this heavy, \"Rococo\" piece.  Like his American counterpart, Robert Butler (also represented in the Rabinovitch collection), Baker is a skilled caster and has used this technique to create a striking server that centres on a crab, taken not only literally as the blade but also as a metaphor, using the movement of a crab claw as inspiration.  The sheer realism of the cast form seizes the imagination, and adds a thrill of drama to the act of serving;  if you are not quick enough the menacing claw locked on the handle might get you!  Our appreciation of realistic modelling, \"captured from life\", ties this server to the cast marine creatures created by the French, eighteenth century silversmiths Thomas Germain (1673-1748) and Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier (1695-1750).  Their tureens and sauce boats were topped by silver fishes, shells and crabs, some of them cast from life, and revelling in the same watery environment that Baker has drawn upon.",
