Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot. \n\nLizzie the Lizard was chosen to carry the Paralympic messages of performance, power and pride to both Australian and international audiences. Her strength, determined will and attitude symbolize all Paralympians. Lizzie's frill is shaped as the map of Australia with its green and gold colours, while her body is the red ochre colour of the land.",
