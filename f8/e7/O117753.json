(NB: could provide a range of readings).\n\nPILE:  wool and camel hair?  13 colours: dark red, red, dark yellow, yellow, light yellow, dark green, green, dark blue, blue, pink, very light pink, brown, cream; symmetrical knot tied around 2 warp threads; 112 knots to the sq. inch (1,512 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: both sides have a white cotton web over 3 cords.\n\nEND FINISH: lower end: incomplete; 6 rows of countered soumak over 4 threads and back under 2 in cream wool; 6 passes of the same in plain weave before knotting of 8 warp threads at a time for closely knotted offset trellis fringe with evidence of at least 5 bands of knots of 3\" (7 cms max length).  Upper: incomplete; 5 rows of countered soumak in cream wool, the rest as above.\n\nDESIGN: field: on a dark yellow ground are 10 assorted floral bands; the alternating smaller rosette and geometric bands are bracketed horizontally by dark brown lines with two 'shoulders' of differing colours; the larger blossoms are separated by a vertical bar linking pairs of brackets, the bars bearing four florets on a dark brown diamond, a motif which also divides the rosettes and which, in the former bands, becomes a stylised floral sprig.\n\nMain border: cream ground with self-coloured blossoms with four attached leaves in the 'crab' pattern.\n\nInner and outer border bave blocks of diagonal lines in alternating directions, one block coloured blue, red, green, red, blue and the other - yellow and dark red.  There are directional variations on the left hand side.\nGuard stripes:  there is a pair on either side of the inner and outer border; the inner guard stripes have small diagonal blocks in cream and red ('barber's pole' pattern) and the outer have blocks in yellow and dark brown.",
