Together with his brothers-in-law Antonio and Felice Beato, he travelled and photographed from Athens to Egypt, Jerusalem and eventually India.

Around 1853, assisted by his brothers-in-law Antonio and Felice Beato, he travelled to many places, including Greece, Egypt and India. This photograph shows a fountain, also known as Sultanahmet Fountain, which lies in front of Bab-I Humayun, the gate of Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. It was built in 1729 as a gift to Ahmet III, who ruled from 1703-1730 and was influential in the 'europeanisation' of Ottoman culture. The crisp detail of the Islamic decoration in this image, even in the areas of shadow, shows considerable technical accomplishment on the part of the photographers.",
