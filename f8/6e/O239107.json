            "public_access_description": "Louis Bourgeois is an internationally acclaimed sculptor, but also draughtswoman and painter, who works in a huge variety of media, from  bronze to old stockings. Her work is rooted in the history of her own life, referring to the betrayal of her mother by her father, the strength of her mother, and other issues of sexuality, gender and psychology. The human figure, or various parts of it, mutilated or mutated, or suggested by garments or other objects- is key to her work. Her drawings are often diagrammatic but emotive at the same time. The cover illustration for this cd of her own musical work suggests two figures who embrace yet lie separately side by side, the gently curved parallel lines which bind them together  suggest strings of an instrument to be plucked and the deeply curving outlines of the figures suggest the contours of a guitar or violin.\n\nThe music itself is a collaboration by Satch Hoyt and Ramunchto Matta",
