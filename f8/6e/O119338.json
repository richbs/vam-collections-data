The top, of pine, of 18th century date, is probably a reproduction of the original; it is hinged by means of pivots inserted horizontally through the back uprights and fixed into the clamps on the underside of the lid.\n\nThe piece is of rough workmanship saw marks being clearly visible on the front panel.\n\nNotes made for RFS store visit, Nick Humphrey\nRepairs\nBoth rear feet (and one front) tipped.\nRat hole at rear\nLid replaced but following form of original (with battens on underside at each end) and apparently using earlier fixings - huge iron pin hinges (?); the original lid presumably had a clasp for ring fixing on the front. A trace of an iron hinge at PL rear.\n\nThe wide leg-stiles produced by cleaved oak to centre of trunk (quarter riven).\nThe front and back (saw marked) panels held in a long groove, held by 4/5 pegs at each end (round, relatively tight fitting). The front and back panels are remarkably thin given the difficulty of pit-sawing so thinly.\nThe ends fit into a tall mortise and held by 3 long pegs.\nThe two end battens tenoned into the front and back planks - served to hold it together.\nThe bottom (a single plank, now split and wormy) held poorly with nails through the ends into the ends of the planks, and through the front (note iron staining) - but also from a comparitively early date by two metal U shaped brackets. Note old nails in bottom (for an old patch?)\n\nBoth locks attached plausibly with clinched nails\n\nRPs record that it was bought (\u00a35.10.0) from E.M.Dent who bought it in 1919 from a dealer, and that it was formerly in Great Bedwyn Church (but without any further detail or substantiation.)",

These are rarely, if ever, found in the fourteenth century, heavy iron clamp-hinges being substituted...There is no attempt at ornamentation, altough, originally, the bottom of the upright styles may have been carved with simple cusping. The ironwork at present on the chest is all of a much later date.'",
