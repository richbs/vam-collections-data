Like \nmany of Sara Radstone\u2019s works, it uses the form \nof the book to convey the suggestion of memory \nand history. More specifically, it is part of a series \nthat \u2013 as the title suggests \u2013 explores absence and \nloss by evoking the idea of ghosts within texts. \nMade in London\nStoneware, hand-built from press-moulded slabs, \npainted with slip and dark stain\nMuseum no.
