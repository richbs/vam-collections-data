The natural world and particularly animals had spiritual significance to the Moche. Birds and other animals were a common theme and bodies were formed depicting a wide range of identifiable species  - although the bird here is stylised it has enough attributes to identify it as a bird of pray, probably a Condor. Portrait heads were also a popular sculpture form for the stirrup spout handled vessels and many were rendered with great realism. \n\nStirrup spout handles with moulded figures such as this sometimes have a whistling mechanism in the sculpted form above the bottle such as in the head of the bird. Blowing into the missing spout would then have produces a whistling sound within.",

            "historical_context_note": "The stirrup spout bottle is the most common and characteristic Moche vessel form. A huge variety of sophisticated sculptural forms often formed the body of the vessel. The Moche potters were the first Andean culture to developed press-mould and stamping techniques, thus the initial sculpture formed by a skilled potter could then be mass produced. Soft clay was pressed into two halves of a mould. As it dried it would separate from the mould and the two halves would be joined together to form the body of the vessel and a stirrup spurt handle formed from tubes of clay was added.",
