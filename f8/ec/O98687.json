Although this was London\u2019s most fashionable street during the 1960s, Cowan here revels in the contrast between the model\u2019s youth, beauty and energy and the traditional scene of men playing cards over a pint of beer.",

This exhibition was more recently toured by Fondacion La Caixa around regional venues in Spain. Key images from Cowan's oeuvre shown in the exhibition were selected by Charlotte Cotton for the national collection and given to the V&A by Cowan's estate holders. These will boost our holdings of fashion photography and act as a record of his successful exhibition and tour.\n\nThe model is Jill Kennington for the shoot 'What happens when a photographer plans to shoot swimsuits outdoors and it rains?' which took place at the World's End pub, King's Road, Chelsea.",
