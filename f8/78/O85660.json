The most notable item traded was silk. Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed the goods from oasis to oasis. The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas. Whilst silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in  this way. \n\nThis textile was brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862-1943). The V&A has around 650 ancient and medieval textiles recovered from the Silk Road by Stein at the beginning of the 20th century. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals.",

The Chinese first occupied Hami in 73 AD, making it a base for their expansion westward into Central Asia and north across the Tian Shan Mountains. A military colony was established to cultivate the surrounding lands for Hami played a crucial role in China's defence against northern invaders, including the Xiongnu, Turks and Mongols. The city became an oasis for traders crossing the Pei Shan Desert. The V&A holds, on loan, from Hami, a woven cream silk with floral pattern, which dates from the eighth century AD.",
