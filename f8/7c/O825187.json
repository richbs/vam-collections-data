The following is the full text of the entry: GIAQUINTO, CORRADO (1703-c.1765) 1021 Rest on the Flight into Egypt Inscribed on the back in ink in an old hand (possibly the artist\u2019s) \u2018Fatto Per il Re di Sardegna mi (one illegible word or abbreviation) 15\u2019 Pen and ink and wash heightened with white 14 \u00bc x 9 \u00bd (361 x 242) E.3981-1919 PROVENANCE Bernard H. Webb Bequest 1919 Formerly anonoymous. Mrs Salmina-Haskell has observed that it is connected with a painting of the Flight into Egypt in S. Teresa, Turin (Mario d\u2019Orsi, <i>Corrado Giaquinto</i>, Rome, 1958, pl. 34 and discussed on pp. 44-5). A bozzetto in oils is in the Busiri-Vici collection, Rome, <i>op. cit</i>., pl. 36. Mario d\u2019Orsi dates the work during Giaquinto\u2019s second stay in Turin (c. 1735-39). The inscription on the drawing confirms that the work was done in Turin. Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, became first king of Sardinia in 1720.",
