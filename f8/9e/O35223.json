In Willette's composition however, the woman wears traditional Dutch folk dress, signalling the Netherlandish extraction of the Van Houten company, whose cocoa she advertises. The artist cleverly fuses symbols of tradition and 'exoticism' by placing the wholesome figure of the young woman against a yellow ground with trailing cacao tree branches. This enables him to suggest at once the origins of the product and its alleged health-giving properties.",
