The white ceramic dish is transfer printed with motifs of golden brown teddy bears playing sports: in the centre is a newly bowled-out cricketer looking down at his bat, with his stumps fallen behind him as a bear who is fielding runs to catch the ball.  In a ring around the edge are smaller motifs: the running fielder from the cricket scene, a golfing bear holding his bag of clubs, a soccer playing bear kicking a football away from two other bears in a goal mouth, and another golfing bear raising his club to hit a ball.  The ceramic dish also has a curved and slightly uptilted rim decorated with an inner gold line and an outer line of fleur de lis motifs in brown.  The hollow metal outer shell has two D-ring handles, one at each side, and a raised tube at one edge for the addition of hot water.\n[Chafing dish screw cap] Flat circular screw-topped cap for water tube.",
