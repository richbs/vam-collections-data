In the 1970s aspects such as humour, eroticism and symbolism were also present, such as seen here in the cigarette lighter made by Karel Bartosik. \n\nIt belongs to a range of lighters and jewellery he made in the seventies with houses and office furniture as themes. The naturalistic architecture in silver and gold shows a closed butcher's shop. In the upper window, we glimpse a silhouette drawing down a blind.\n\nBartosik was born in England but his parents were of Dutch and Czech origin. Between 1946 -1967 he lived in Czechoslavakia and worked initially for a costume jewellery manufacturer. On his return to England he joined the workshop of Andrew Grima in London, where he stayed for several years. Later he became a technician at the Royal College of Art in the Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery Department (1991-2007).",
