The archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann invited the London jeweller Carlo Giuliano to inspect the jewels which were then supposed to have been worn by Helen of Troy.

The first painting (oil on canvas) is dated 1881 and was exhibited at the Royal Academy the same year.  It is now in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.  The second painting (watercolour and gold paint on paper) was executed in 1887.  Both paintings show the actress Lillie Langtry as Helen of Troy wearing regal jewellery.  In the paintings it can be seen that the gold trapezoids of Poynter's necklace are directly copied from contemporary traditional amulet Gujurati plaques as worn by women and children, 'in the form of three silver plaques strung on cord with beads as spacers'. Giuliano's necklace is one step further away from the Gujurati necklace: 'he has removed the pendant loops from each plaque, slightly altered the shape and gilded it, but otherwise the plaques are identical' (Rudoe and Gere, 2010, pp. 302-3).",
