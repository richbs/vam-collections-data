The purpose for which the carving was made is not unclear, nor whether it was formerly part of a complete horse of the same material. During the Han and the succeeding Six Dynasties' periods, however, many pottery models of horses and of horses' heads were made for inclusion in the furniture of tombs, together with those of other animals and of humans.  This head is evidently a rare example of such work a more precious material.",
