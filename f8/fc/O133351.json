Fabric \u2013 folded, draped, floating, falling \u2013 has been a recurrent motif in her work, including her photo-booth sequences, and in large-scale public commissions such as the billboards which she designed for the BBC to screen building work at the HQ in Portland Place, London, in 2004.\n\nThis print comes from an experimental series in which Rideal inks pieces of fabric and uses these to print with, so the finished print is a direct and unique impression of the fabric, without the mediation of plate or block, in which subject and process become one. Though the print process is low-tech, it has produced visually sophisticated results. The folding and layering of the diaphanous fabric produces a moir\u00e9 effect, but at the same time the earthy colours suggest associations with landscape, and the natural world, which is also a recurrent theme in Rideal\u2019s work.",
