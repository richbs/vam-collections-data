They were often built as an act of piety by rich people for the public, water provision being regarded as a particularly meritorious act in the warm climate. The Turkish women here have paused to drink, one of them having lowered her veil in order to do so, while the black servant holds the small boy. His fur-edged coat indicates that his father was a man of substance. While the little girl is dressed in a vividly coloured outfit, the women are completely encased in their feraces or cloaks. The similarity of figure style and subject-matter to Women and a Child in the Victoria and Albert Museum's series of Constantinople characters [D.23-1907] suggests a similar date around the mid 1840s.",
