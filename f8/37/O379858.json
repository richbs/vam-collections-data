In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nDelicate bracelets of plaited wire, like this one, were mainly worn by women in the rich cities.  The sophisticated workmanship is in the Ottoman tradition.  Similar bracelets were also popular among fashionable women in Britain in the late 19th century.  Many were imported by Liberty & Co of Regent Street, London, where they were sold as \u2018Damascus Bracelets'.  This example is said to have come from Beirut.",
