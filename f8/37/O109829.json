Caumont and M. Marsoudet',<u> Catalogue of the works exhibited in the British section of the Exhibition</u>, Class II Everything relating to the management of trees, page 114. In Class XXIV Furniture, page 129, No. 179, Eugene Ponsard of Sydney exhibited `Meubles de bois de la colonie', translated in the adjacent column as '\"Bureau de dame\" made in Paris, of woods of New South Wales'.\n\nThe display cases may therefore have been made in Paris of timbers from New South Wales. By 1857 they were in use in the Education Museum, one of the early galleries in the South Kensington Museum, and are visible there in <u>Vision and Accident The Story of the Victoria and Albert Museum</u> by Anthony Burton, V&A Publications 1999, fig 3.7, one on the extreme right and the other behind the doll's house. <u>The Illustrated London News</u>, 6th-11th July 1857, page 6, described them as 'constructed from designs by Professor Semper to illustrate all the leading varieties of the ornamental woods of Australia'. Gottfried Semper was an architect, art-historical theorist and lecturer in the Schools of Design at South Kensington. At some point the cabinets must have left the South Kensington Museum for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, from where they were acquired in 1979.",
