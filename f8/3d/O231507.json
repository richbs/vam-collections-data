This poster is in support of the election of Boris Yeltsin (born 1931). In the anti-Communist sweep of the June 1991 election he became President of the Russian Federation, the largest and richest of the fifteen Soviet republics.\n\nA flamboyant champion of the underdog, and an advocate of decentralization, Yeltsin had defined himself as the populist alternative to Gorbachev. His dramatic election to the Presidency made him overnight a powerful figure on the world stage. He remained in power until New Year's Eve 1999, when he decided to retire, and handed over to his Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, pending a spring election.",
