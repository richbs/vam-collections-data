Pugin executed four windows from 1848-1851. These drawings are typical of Pugin's preliminary designs for stained glass, with small figure scenes set in roundels or quatrefoils in a 13th-century style. They would then be drawn out full size in his Cartoon Room, at the Grange, Ramsgate, and sent on to Hardman's factory at Birmingham to be executed. The iconography of window no. 1 seems to be associated with Leviticus, and that of window no. 2 is taken from the book of Revelations.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In \u2018Contrasts\u2019, published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
