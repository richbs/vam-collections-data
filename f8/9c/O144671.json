This object is made of black velvet embroidered with silver and silver-gilt thread and cord, spangles and red silk cord in raised and couched work, with a small piece of velvet applied as a lining to the helmet of the coat of arms.  This lining is in turn edged with a silver-gilt fringe, with the fringe at the bottom being much deeper than the others. In the centre are the arms of Sandys of the Vyne within a strapwork cartouche, with crest and elaborate mantling. The rest of the area is occupied with cherubs heads (alternately with gold and silver hair) and wings. The area is arranged in rows within an elaborate symmetrical arabesque ornament of scrolls, formal leaves and shells. The ground is powdered with spangles and small rosettes.",

The chapel, which no longer exists, was the burial place of the Sandys family. At the time when the hanging was made, the head of the family was Henry Sandys 5th Baron, who was killed in the Civil War Skirmish in 1644. When the Revd Joseph of Basingstoke described the hanging in 1819, it was in the Mottis Font House in Hampshire, where it belonged to Sir Charles Mill Bartholemew, a descendent of the Royal Sandys Family.\n\nThe remainder of the chapel fittings are also renumerated, from a description given by  the steward to the Mottisfont Estate, Thomas King. They consisted of an alter frontal embroidered with the Last Supper, some pieces of purple velvet with the initials IHS, a desk hanging of purple velvet embroidered in gold and silver with the arms of Sandys, two book covers and a folding cushion with the letters 'THS' on the outside and the arms of Sandys on the inside. The four corners of the cushion are flanked by cherubs.",
