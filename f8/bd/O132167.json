He was a pupil of Adolf Stademann (1824-1895) and Adolf Heinrich Lier (1826-1882) in Munich. He travelled extensively in Germany, England, Italy and Holland, exhibited in Vienna and Munich between 1873 and 1883, and in the Royal Academy in London between 1880 and 1881. \n\nHeffner was one of the greatest exponents of the Munich School of Paintings led by A. Stademan who was his master. This painting depicts a winter scene in the Rhenish lands with a cattle walking on the frozen surface of a river in the distance. Following the Realist technique, this work was probably executed directly after the motif in open air. This work belongs most likely to Heffner's early manner.",

Such pictures attracted patrons and collectors and hitherto a great extent of Heffner's oeuvre is to be found in private collections rather in public institutions.",
