For spinning a teetotum or dice would be needed, however, as this is a Passmore game it is possible that a card with numbers and blanks together with the letters all to be cut up was provided as given in the previous couple of games.  In that case the rules were probably similar.\n\nRules:\nThe playing sheet is divided into four concentric circles, three of which contain 16 pictures each.  The inner ring illustrates the signs of the Zodiac and the four cardinal points of the compass.  The sixteen pictures of the outer ring each have a title, which has a connection with the two other pictures of the two inner rings adjoining.\nThese are:\n1,17,33   Europe      5,21,37   Asia          9,25,41   Africa       13,29,45  America\n2,18,34   Earth         6,22,38   Air            10,26,42  Fire         14,30,46  Water\n3,19,35   Electricity   7,23,39  Chemistry   11,27,43  Optics   15,31,47  Astronomy\n4,20,36   Spring       8,24,40   Summer     12,28,44  Autumn  16,32,48  Winter\n\nExamples of the pictures under these main headings are:\nSPRING\n4.  Dancing round a maypole   20.  A Rainbow  36.  Birds feeding their young \nAIR\n6.  A Balloon and a Parachute  22.  A Shipwrecked Sailing Vessel  38.  Windmill\nCHEMISTRY\n7.  Alchemist   23.

Magic Lantern Show\nAUTUMN\n12.  Harvest Supper   28.  Hop Picking   44.  Pheasant Shooting\n\nPlayers would progress round the game on the spin of a teetotum or the selection of a numbered card.  At each stop, they would be required to describe the events happening in the illustration and it is possible that forfeits and rewards would be given depending on each.  It is possible to given forfeits and rewards to each squares and some are more obvious that others such as a fire or ship wreck go backwards or perhaps start again.\n\nRules placement: possibly in booklet",
