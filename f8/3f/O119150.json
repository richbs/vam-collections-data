Elagabalus in fact held the hereditary rank of high priest to the Syrian sun god El-Gabal (or Baal), and his mother was related to the Imperial dynasty. Behind the figure of El-Gabal in the sky is a blazing star, another potent symbol of Rome's eternal light and power, burning bright amid a sea of non-Roman neighbours, 'barbarians' and the like. \n\nElagabalus was born Varius Avitus Bassianus in 203 or 204 at Emesa in Syria. Around 220 he unsuccessfully attempted to make El-Gabal the supreme god of the Roman state cult.\nFrom the Salting bequest.",

They are general not 'portraits' in the modern sense, but instead use facial and physical features to express the manner, and central tenor of the Emperor's rule - his style and interests as a ruler - a thinker like Marcus Aurelius was shown bearded and wise-looking, regardless of whether or not he did in actual fact wear a beard.  \n\nNonetheless, they should not be completely dismissed as records of Imperial likenesses, since the Emperors showed an interest in portraiture in the modern sense, and artists had produced naturalistic portraits since Alexander the Great's time, another man with a keen interest in spreading his image, one of youth, vigour and victory.",
