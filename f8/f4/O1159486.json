Circa mid nineteenth century. \n\nThis print appears to be part of a series of prints entitled 'Galerie Dramatique' and is associated with the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Opera Comique. \n\nAnna Thillon was born Anna Hunt in Calcutta in 1819. She was educated in England but left after her father's death and travelled to Le Havre, where she married her husband M. Thillon who was at that time chef d'orchestre of the Philharmonic Society in that town. Her debut in Paris took place at the Renaissance, where she played la Chaste Suzanne and Lucie de Lammermoor. On 11th August 1840 she first appeared at the Opera Comique. During her engagement there she sang in Zanetta, Les Diamans de la Couronne, L'Eau Merveilleuse, La Part du Diable, and Cagliostro, \"investing each different character assumed by her with that peculiar charm of which she only knows the secret.\" (Hervey, C. The Theatres, Paris). After her time in Paris she returned to England, and subsequently toured in America with great success. \n\nThis print is part of the Harry Beard Collection",
