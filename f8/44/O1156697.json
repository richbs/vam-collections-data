A waterfall bound by a series of bridges is visible in the background as is a crowned figure, his arms outstretched.\n\nDer Freisch\u00fctz (The Marksman) is an opera in three acts by Carl Maria von Weber to a libretto by Friedrich Kind. Its plot was taken from German folk legend and many of its tunes were inspired by German folk music. The scene illustrated on the front of this music actually appears to be 'Wolf's Glen' where the hero is tricked in to casting the cursed bullets under the enchantment of the villianous Kasper.",
