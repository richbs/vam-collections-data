This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread. According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass. \n\nThis chalice is designed in the neoclassical style, inspired by the mid 18th century revival of interest in the architecture and ornament of classical Greece and Rome. Despite their 'pagan' associations, neoclassical designs dominated church architecture and furnishings in the second half of the 18th century. However, the design of this Italian chalice is far removed from the austerity advocated by early neoclassical designers in the hunt for a 'true style'. It is richly ornamented with pierced cagework and seed pearls around the cup and its base is so heavy that it makes the piece almost impractical.",
