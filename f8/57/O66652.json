It shows the crowd waving palm branches, shouting \u2018Hosanna\u2019 and laying a garment on the ground for Christ to pass over. Originally, the panel came from the choir windows in Erfurt Cathedral in the eastern part of Germany. \n\nThe Entry into Jerusalem is seen as the beginning of the Christian Holy Week leading up to Easter. The day is known as \u2018Palm Sunday\u2019, in reference to the palms that the people waved as Christ rode through the gate of the city on a donkey.\n\nThe custom of commemorating the event with palms and processions does not appear in liturgical texts before about the 8th century. However, we do have a pilgrim\u2019s account dating from the late 4th century that records the ceremonies celebrated in Jerusalem during Holy Week. It refers to a procession with palms that re-enacted Christ\u2019s triumphal entry.",
