            "public_access_description": "Elevation of a flagon, Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire by leading designer and architect Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). It is drawn by John Yenn and shows a flagon, together with a chalice and bread plate which forms a set of communion plate for the chapel. These pieces, which were made in 1769 by the silversmiths James Ansill and Stephen Gilbert, under the auspices of John Parker and Edward Wakelin, survive at Blenheim. Behind both drawings (see also cat.605) must lie a lost design by Chambers. The background to the design is a light blue. The tall body stands on a fluted pedestal. Leaves are used to decorate the lower part of the body and a band of wave scroll and calyx encircles the flagon at its widest point. The neck has a band of fluted moulding around it. There is a tall upswept handle. During manufacture the mouth of the flagon had to be reinforced by the silversmiths, suggesting both Chambers's reliance on ceramic prototypes and his lack of technical knowledge of the manufacture of silver.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
