            "public_access_description": "This type of large beaker has been called a Humpen (a German word meaning a tankard but without a handle) since the seventeenth century but when this particular example was made in 1594, it would have been known as a Glas, Luntz or Willkomm. The name Willkomm (welcome) refers to the custom of presenting a guest on arrival with a drink in such a vessel.  The guest was expected to drink the entire contents of the glass.  Some Humpen could be as much as 60cms tall and might hold up to about four litres of beer, then as now a favourite German drink.  Humpen were always held with both hands as they were so substantial and were often used for communal drinking.  They were passed around for drinking toasts at banquets. \n\nEnamelled decoration on glass remained popular for German forest (potash based) glass long after it had ceased to be fashionable for Venetian 'cristallo' (soda based glass).  The colours are achieved through the use of different mineral oxides and they were fired on in order to fuse them to the glass.  Two of the main glassmaking families who produced enamelled wares in the Ore Mountains region bordering Saxony and Bohemia in the late sixteenth century were the Sch\u00fcrers and Preusslers. \n\nThis glass, painted in 1594 with the double-headed imperial eagle, bearing at its breast the imperial orb and on its wings rows of armorial shields is known as a Reichsadlerhumpen (imperial eagle beaker).  The stock design symbolises the union of the central European states under the Habsburg emperors and was used with little variation from about 1570 to 1740s.  The eagle was shown either with a crucifix (mainly between 1570 and 1600) or an orb (mainly from 1585 onwards).  The painting of this particular design was used as a compulsory exercise to test the skill of apprentice guild-masters. The formal image was based on literary and print sources from the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries and presented an idealised view of the structure of the Holy Roman Empire.",

            "history_note": "[Beaker] Before being bought by the Museum in 1855, this beaker was in the possession of Mr J.G. Pfister, 64 King Street, Golden Square, London.\n\nHistorical significance: Enamelled decoration on glass remained popular among the German middle classes even though it was no longer fashionable in Venice.  Painting with mineral oxide colours which were then fired on to fuse them to the glass was a Venetian technique used on glassware chiefly from Saxon and Bohemian glasshouses from 1560s.  Two of the main glassmakers who produced enamelled work in the Ore Mountains area in the late sixteenth century were the Sch\u00fcrer and Preussler families. Enamelled wares in the forest glass tradition continued throughout the seventeenth century, finally degenerating into naive folk art of a rather repetitive nature by the early eighteenth century.\n\nHumpen such as this one which depicts the eagle emblematic of the Holy Roman Empire and the arms of its electors and members are known as Reichsadlerhumpen (imperial eagle beakers).  This stock design symbolising the union of the central European states under the Habsburg emperors was used with little variation from about 1570 to 1740s.  The eagle was shown either with a crucifix (mainly between 1570 and 1600) or an orb (mainly from 1585 onwards).  The existence of so many examples of Reichsadlerhumpen and lack of variation on the theme is largely due to the fact that until at least 1683, this design was used as a compulsory test of the skill of apprentice guild-masters. The formal images were also closely based on literary and print sources from the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries and presented an idealised view of the structure of the Holy Roman Empire.  The so-called Quaternion system grouping the arms of the representatives of the various professions, classes and places which the Empire contained in rows of four shields on each outspread wing of the imperial eagle was probably derived initially from a woodcut of 1511 though the literary origin was at least fifty years older.  The vast majority of such depictions appear on Humpen rather than other vessel types.",

            "historical_context_note": "[Beaker] This type of large, wide, cylindrical beaker or handleless tankard is known by its German name, Humpen, though this term was probably not used until the 17th century. Certainly before the1580s, contemporary documents either simply called this vessel type Glas, Luntz or Lontz, or Willkomm.  The latter term, meaning \"welcome\", refers to the most usual way in which these beakers were used - for communal drinking.  In particular, a guest was expected to drink the entire contents presented to him on his arrival.  The glasses might be anything up to 50 or 60 cms. tall and could hold from at least one litre to over four litres of beer (then, as now, a favourite German drink) which meant that this was a glass to be held with both hands.  Such glasses were also passed around for drinking toasts during banquets. The provision of copious quantities of beer on such occasions was seen as a normal facet of German hospitality.\n\nThe Humpen vessel type originated from the earlier South German and Tyrolean Stangenglas (\"pole glass\").  But the tall, slender Stangengl\u00e4ser were made from delicate \"cristallo\", the soda glass recipe used by the glasshouses of Murano (Venice) to make fashionable glassware which German princes wished to emulate.  The sturdier form of the Humpen, however, was dictated by the use of the less ductile and cheaper traditional German forest glass which used potash obtained from locally plentiful wood.  Most German glasshouses in the later 16th century were clustered around the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) which were rich in useful glass-making and decorating minerals as well as wood both for potash and for furnace fuel.",
