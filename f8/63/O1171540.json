Its concept is very simple, it can be used as a seat or it can stack. Combinations of the K-Block can be used to create other furniture requirements or a creative jigsaw. It was subsequently manufactured by Nola Industrier in Stockholm. \n\nThe seat was acquired by the museum in 2010 as part of the exhibition 'Sit Down: Seating for Kids'. It was used in the section titled 'Who are seats for?' and represented 'playing' because it shows the different ways a seat can be used creatively for play, alongside swings and ride-on cars.",
