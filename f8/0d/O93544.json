By the beginning of the 7th century large quantities of silver pieces in exotic shapes and styles were imported along the Silk Road from Iran and Central Asia to China. Chinese craftsmen often reproduced foreign shapes and also acquired new manufacturing techniques from Central Asian silversmiths who had settled in Chinese urban centres beginning in the mid 7th century.\n\nThis thin-walled cup was probably used to contain alcohol; its flower shape was derived from similar Sasanian silver examples.",
