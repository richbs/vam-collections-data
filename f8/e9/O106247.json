In it, she danced a Passepied, literally translating as passing feet. This is a dance related to the minuet, but much faster with, as the title suggests, quick, neat footwork. Tthe music was taken from Lully and Rameau.  The dress might have concealed much of the footwork, but the impression was of elegance as she manipulated her dress and stole and speedy movement across the stage.  \nThe richness of the fabrics and trimmings and the finish of the dress is outstanding.  Gen\u00e9e spared no expense to achieve the right effects and Wilhelm's researches ensured all possible accuracy, although, due to lack of original images of Pr\u00e9vost, the costume was based on a print of an earlier dancer, Mlle. Subligny.",
