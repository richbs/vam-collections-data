The back stiles are continuations of the back legs and curve backwards.  The leather seat (now re-upholstered over the original cover) is shallow in profile and is upholstered over the rails and held with brass nails.  Larger brass nails with turned heads are set at the corners and two in the centre of  front rail. The back shows a shaped panel of leather that covers the top rail and the top outer corners and is attached to the stiles over a low rail set between them.  Between that it curves in at either side and is not attached to the stiles.  The leather is embossed with a symmetrical, curved design and is partly coloured green. The back panel has been removed from the chair at some time and re-applied.",

In 1895 Bing founded a gallery in Paris, which he called 'L'Art Nouveau', which showed modern design. It became so influential that it gave its name to the contemporary design movement in France and throughout Europe and beyond. Bing sold the work of many of the most successful designers of the time from France and Britain, including Eug\u00e8ne Gaillard, who designed fabrics as well as furniture. Bing also manufactured some of the designs he sold, like this chair, while he bought others in. \n\nGaillard's success in flat pattern design can be seen in the sinuous forms with which he decorated the back of this chair. He believed that ornament should be inspired by nature, but that designers should not simply copy natural forms. The carved walnut frame appears to 'grow' organically, like the branches of a tree. The sinuous legs and stretchers are jointed in a traditional manner, but this is not apparent at first sight, and the sculptural form of the chair would have seemed entirely novel in 1900.",
