The front seat rail is attached over the front legs with dowels or screws and plugs.  There is no rear seat rail, but a lower stretcher is tennoned into the rear legs.  The rear legs rise to become the sides of the back, and are connected at the top by a simple rail tennoned into them. Three uprights connect the top rail to a rail about 6cm above the seat.  The four sides of the shallow seat frame are tennoned or dowelled together and the caning was completed before it was attached to the chair frame. The simple six-way caning has an edging on the top surface but no retaining groove on the underside. The chair was painted but was stripped before it was re-caned.
