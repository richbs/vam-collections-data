The lower and larger of the two universal junctions is a modified ball and socket joint sitting on an alternatively convex and concave collar.  The joint itself consists of a two interlocking, segmented hollow spheres.  The smaller of the two sits in the neck of a cast washer surmounting the collar.  The larger virtually encloses the smaller and thus swivels around its circumference.  It is enclosed by three equally spaced curved prongs which are decorated with cast strap work and are attached by screws to the underside of the cast washer.\n\nThe shaft is a narrow, cylindrical tube, rising from a stepped collar which connects the shaft itself with the lower universal joint.  The top of the shaft terminates with a everted sleeve containing a ball joint to which the shade and the bayonet lamp fitting are attached.\n\nThe shade is centrally positioned over the lamp and is secured to the shaft by three equidistant wire struts which are soldered to a ring held in place by two knurled washers just below the bayonet fitting.\n\nThe hexagonal shade is also of chromed metal.  The outer surface is polished while the inner surface has been left matt.  It consists of flat panels with vertically tapered edges.  The bottom edge is straight, with a narrow flat strip of metal applied externally while the top of each panel is arched with straight, sloping sides.  Just below the upper edge is a similar strip of metal which runs parallel to the undulating edge of the shade itself.",

He was articled to Sir Arthur William Blomfield from 1898 to 1901, and remained as his assistant until 1902 when he joined the office of Edwin Landseer Lutyens as his assistant. He left in 1904 to commence practice on his own account in London. He went into partnership with the Hon. Paul Phipps in 1919. Their practice chiefly involved country houses. He joined his father's practice Milne and Hall in 1906, which he continued until until 1916. His work included some of the main interiors of Claridge's Hotel in London. He was later in partnership with Alfred Underhill. In 1927 he was in practice at 64 Wigmore Street in London. His work includes the Eleventh Church of Christ Scientist in London, Hunterscombe Place in Oxfordshire, Sprowston Court in Norwich, Coleton Fishacre in South Devon, Tirinie in Perthshire, and the War Memorial Building at Bedford School (1). He was also the architect of Nuffield Place near Henley-on-Thames, the home William Morris, founder of Morris Motors in Oxford, later Lord Nuffield (2).\n\nHe was a leading Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a Chairman of Council in 1959-61 and Vice-President.\n\nOswald Partidge Milne died on 15 January 1968 at Hampstead in London aged 86 years.",
