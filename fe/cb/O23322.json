One of the passengers in the boat is Ebisu - a Japanese deity of good fortune. Across the centre back seam at the top is a flying crane bearing a name - probably that of the ship on which the original wearer worked - in a circle.\nThe designs are executed in a polychrome resist-dyeing technique applied using a stencil (<i>katazome</i>).\nThe garment is lined throughout with a dark blue plain weave cotton and the end of the sleeves are faced with black ribbed silk. There is long and short stitching in white cotton thread along the centre front edges below the collar band, around the hem, and around the sleeve opening. The garment has been tucked and sewn at waist level, the tuck at the back being higher than that at the front.",

It would have been worn by a Japanese fisherman on the coast of the B\u00f4s\u00f4 peninsula near Tokyo on New Year's Day and other festive occasions. Maiwai are decorated with colourful sea motifs and auspicious symbols. This robe depicts two of the seven gods of good fortune in treasure ships. Overhead, a crane flies carrying a banner bearing the name of the ship on which the fisherman worked.",
