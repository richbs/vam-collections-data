Scotland Yard is similar to a game of cat and mouse or Fox and Geese and played by three to six players aged 10 and above. The aim of the game is for players playing detectives to stake out the player named Mr X. Cops and robbers must negotiate their way around Central London, trading their allocations of bus, underground and taxi tickets for passage around a game board with 199 locations such as Regent's Park and Buckingham Palace. One contestant takes on the role of Mister X and travels around in secret, attempting to outwit his would-be captors. The detectives follow various clues that may or may not lead to the fugitive's new location.",
