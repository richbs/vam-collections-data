Rows of alternately silver and gold.  Each circle is composed of spiralling couched thread with the stitches forming spiralling spokes coming from the centre in a clockwise pattern. Where the thread has worn away it is possible to see a printed outline of a circle.  The lines are not evenly spaced - they are closer at the sides and more spaced in the centre.  The border is delineated with two bands of black silk couched with silver thread forming alternating blocks.  The border pattern is a meander with 'gold' rosettes and blue irises. \nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: blue, light blue, light pink, light green.\nMetal thread: silver-gilt strip close S-wound around a yellow silk core and also around a pink silk core, and silver close strip S-wound around a white silk core.\nBacking: pieced along the left hand side in several places.  Pink ground with close, off-set rows of an identical floral sprig.  There is a pair of serrated green leaves, red, white and purple flower, red bud to the left and red and yellow petals above.\nFacing: bias-cut black silk",
