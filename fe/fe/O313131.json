They may have as their ultimate source the earlier engravings by Jacques Callot (1592/3-1635). Formerly such pieces used to be attributed to the Dresden artist Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger (1680-1756), to whom the present statuettes were attributed at the time of their acquisition. However there is no evidence Kr\u00fcger worked in ivory. They inspired Dieppe ivories if the mid-nineteenth century.",
