The subject wears a tunic and is holding the cross over one shoulder and with his hands folded. The eyes are alike in size and shape but the mouth is asymmetrical with a melancholy expression. His rather short beard has in inward curve and his dark hair falls on his back. Frontally viewed, Christ appears rather flat and impassive. The face recalls typical western representations of Christ but is executed in the style of a Byzantine icon. Under the figure in ink an earlier pentimento depicting the figure of Christ can be detected. The painting is executed with a brush and is in ink, superimposed on another figure of Christ in pencil. The artist developed the theme of Christ systematically during his later years. Such themes found a ready sale with Europeans and servicemen in wartime Calcutta.",

He developed his own personal style which was characterised by bold lines and flat use of colour. \n\nIn this work, Christ is depicted within a rectangular fram. The subject wears a tunic and is  holding the cross over one shoulder and with his hands folded. The eyes are alike in size and shape but the mouth is asymmetrical with a melancholy expression. His rather short beard has in inward curve and his dark hair falls on his back. Frontally viewed, Christ appears rather flat and impassive. The face recalls typical western representations of Christ but is executed in the style of a Byzantine icon. Under the figure  in ink an earlier pentimento depicting the figure of Christ can be detected. The painting is executed with a brush and is in ink. The artist developed the theme of Christ systematically during his later years. Such themes found a ready sale with Europeans and servicemen in wartime Calcutta.",

            "historical_context_note": "Jamini Roy (1887-1972) was one of the most important artists of the modern period in India, drawing on the popular and folk traditions of rural Bengal for his inspiration. Born in Beliator, a village in the Bankura district of Bengal, Jamini was raised in a family of small landowners.\n\n In 1906 he entered the Calcutta School of Art and studied under Abanindranath Tagore, the pioneer and leading exponent of the Bengal School of Art. Abanindranath's tutorage secured Jamini's dexterity both in European and indigenous painting traditions. For a short period Jamini became a portrait painter, a skill for which he was highly regarded in Calcutta. He then experimented with Impressionistic landscapes before rejecting his European training in favour of indigenous art forms. \n\nInitially Jamini adopted the Kalighat style of painting, a popular art form with origins in the rural traditions of Bengal, but found thriving in the back streets of Calcutta. However by the 1920s, Jamini felt that Kalighat paintings had lost their rural ideal having being adapted too much to fit the requirements of their new urban environment. Jamini sought to define an authentic modern Indian art; he therefore travelled through Bengali countryside studying folk painting traditions. He developed his own personal style which was characterised by bold lines and flat use of colour. He used indigenous materials, including lamp black for the outline drawing, 7 basic colours (Indian red, yellow ochre, cadmium green, vermilion, grey, blue and white), which he applied with organic tempera, earth and mineral pigments to homemade canvas spun with fabric. His paintings can be divided into three main themes: the everyday life of rural Bengal, particularly the women of the aboriginal Santhal community, Hindu mythological subjects and Christian imagery.\n\nJamini was a supporter of the Indian independence movement and his search for an authentic modern India was a response to this. Part of his search involved the restoration of the collaborative indigenous artisanal labour model. Thus, in his workshop he produced a range of stock motifs which his apprentices then copied- all were signed with his name. This increased the production and dissemination of original works which were then affordable to a wider body of people, not just the rich. Jamini gained an international reputation during the 1940s; his work was exhibited in London in 1946 and in New York in 1953.",
