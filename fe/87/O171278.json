De Maar rarely photographs the inhabitants of these spaces but the rooms nevertheless are seen by the artist as portraits of those who live in them.  Personal belongings, and the evidence of  habits and daily necessities,  give shape to the character of the room and the person. \n\nIn most cases, De Maar gains admittance by going unannounced from door to door and showing a letter of introduction in the appropriate language.  With this method, she is able to catch authentic states of domestic interiors and not one that is a censured or a version presented for visitors.  Her images are made predominantly with available natural light and require long exposures. They share a sensibility with historic Dutch 'Golden Age' paintings of domestic interiors, but combine this with distinctly modern subjects and concerns. \n\nAcross cultural boundaries, desire for personal space seems to be universal. By dealing with the notion of home de Maar's images touch a common personal interest to which all viewers can relate.  The photographs  not only open the door to the private lives  of others but  also offer a possibility for reflecting on our own.",
