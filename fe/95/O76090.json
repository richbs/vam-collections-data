In polite society tea was served in the drawing room after dinner, which at that time was eaten in the afternoon. The lady of the house would serve tea to her family or her guests herself. She would use fine silver and porcelain on specially designed tea tables. This one is particularly finely decorated, with inlay of brass and mother of pearl on the top and on the feet. The fashion for using these materials to decorate furniture developed in London from about 1737. Only a small number of workshops practised the technique. It may have been brought to Britain by craftsmen who came to work here from Germany.\n\nOn loan to Mompesson House.",
