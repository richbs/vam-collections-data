NB: as all brocading is woven from the back, the right side of these motifs appears on the back of the carpet.   A  band of green follows and then a band of red. Upper: 1\" (1.5 cms) plain weave with red weft with 2 narrow bands of white diagonal blocks joined by a band of black blocks in reverse direction.  Immediately above this decoration are 2 pairs of white wefts beyond which the warp threads are knotted in groups of 4 to form a fringe, max. length 7\" (13 cms). In the top corners the outer 22\" (6 cms) of warp does not form the fringe but continues for a max. of 5\" (13 cms); the lower part (12\"/3 cms) is woven in plain weave with narrow bands of dark blue/dark red/dark blue/dark red of the left and on the right in orange/dark blue/orange/red/dark blue.  The wefts are returned at both sides to form what may have been a long tab, the upper end of which is missing.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark red ground with 12 bands of 4 guls and 11 and two half bands of 3 and two half minor guls. The main gul is a quartered octagon in white and red and each quarter contains a pair of two-headed horned dark red animals.  In the centre of each gul is a hooked, dark blue cross on a dark red ground. Secondary guls are alternating white or yellow stars (red in lowest band) within either a blue or green stepped lozenge that extends into a hooked cross.  \n\nMain border: white ground.  The sides have a angular dark red meander with red, blue or green curled leaves.  The upper and lower border has V-shaped stylized flowers in place of leaves. Inner and Outer borders: reciprocal tulips in red, blue and green along the sides.  Upper and lower border have red ground with \nalternating green and blue stepped crosses.\nOutermost border (on sides only): dark red ground with a zigzag band of diagonal blocks of red and green. \n Upper and lower elems: dark red ground each with 3 bands of outward facing stylized floral sprigs.\n\nDate catalogued:  16.4.96",
