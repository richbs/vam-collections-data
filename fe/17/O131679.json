The upper part consists of two panels, each inlaid in lighter woods with a flowering plant, and surrounded by a framework of dentil and guilloche ornament.  In the middle and on either side is a pilaster, carved with an Ionic capital, and leaf, fluted and reeded ornament; at either end is a terminal figure in the shape of a grotesque bird.  The frieze at the top is composed of two panels between three brackets; the panels are carved with leaves amid interlacing bands.  The lower portion consists of four plain panels separated by moulded stiles.\n\nEnd of 16th century.\n\nFrom:  H.
