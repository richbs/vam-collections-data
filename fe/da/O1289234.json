Each of these triangles features an image or hand-written words on both front and back. The images are all laser-copies of illustrations featuring one or more of the title elements, whilst the text on each triangle presents statements that conjure up these elements, such as 'Splash, Ripple, Calm' and 'Solid as a rock'. \n\nLike a moebius strip, the book offers a continuous loop of information and can be folded like a child's paper toy to present varying ways of juxtaposing each triangle. This allows pictures and words to be manipulated by the reader and viewed in different sequences. The images, the text and the form of the book all suggest the way that the eponymous environmental forms overlap and intermingle with one another, simply co-existing in natural harmony.\n\nNational Art Library hold two copies (no. 3 and no. 9) which are signed by the artist.",
