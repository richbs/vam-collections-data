He was a rather successful artist and ran an important workshop with his two younger cousins, Agostino and Annibale Carracci with whom he also founded around 1585 the Accademia degli Incamminati in Bologna. He received important commissions in Bologna and near cities, including wall decorations. He died in Bologna where he spent most of his life in 1619.\n\n The painting is a fresco transferred on canvas, which was executed in 1594 by Lodovico to decorate his cousin's house in Bologna. It shows the ancient Greek hero Hercules just after he killed the Hydra of Lerna, a monstrous sea serpent. The hero is shown sat on a rock, his burning torch in his left hand while he is resting his head on the other. This painting is a good example of the new style influenced by the Venetian art that Lodovico developed in the 1590s.",

Before 1800</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 65, cat. no. 62\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Lodovico CARRACCI (1555-1619) \n<i>Italian (Bolognese) School</i> \nBorn in Bologna, he was a pupil of Prospero Fontana and became a member of the painters' guild in 1578. In 1582 he founded an Academy, the 'Accademia degli Incamminati', together with his cousins Agostino (1557-1602) and Annibale (1560-1609) which attracted many pupils and became a key factor in the development of the Bolognese School. \n\n62 \nHERCULES AND THE HYDRA \nDated lower left 1594 \n<i>Fresco transferred to canvas</i>  \n84 x 67 (213.5 x 170) \n8368-1863 \n \nAccording to Malvasia (1678), Lodovico Carracci painted a Hercules in fresco in the house of his cousin Carlo Carracci, 'a work which alone suffices to show what a great man Lodovico was, and that no one was his equal or ever could be in either colour or design' ('che solo basta a far conoscere che grand'huomo fosse Lodovico, e chi mai l'abbia uguagliato o sia mai uguagliarlo e in disegno, e in colorito'). Malvasia gave the fresco a star in his guidebook to Bologna and when this was re-published by G. P. Cavazzoni Zanotti in 1706 it is described in the preface ('1'Ercole famoso del Carracci') as having been moved to the palace of the Marchese Achille Maria Grassi in Bologna, where it remained until the middle of the 19th century. In spite of its early fame, the fresco was wrongly attributed to Annibale Carracci when it was acquired by the Museum and it was only in 1937 that it was restored to its rightful author by Otto Kurz. \nDated by Bodmer (1937) 1595-1600, recent cleaning has revealed what appears to be the date 1594. \nIn compositions of this subject, Hercules is usually shown fighting the hydra. Here he is resting after the fight, a theme not often illustrated. A copy of Lodovico Carracci's composition appears in a 17th century drawing in the Louvre, Cabinet des Dessins (J. Guiffrey and P. Marcel, <i>Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des dessins du Mus\u00e9e du Louvre ... \u00c9cole fran\u00e7ais</i>e, viii, 1913, p. 118, no. 8453 as 'school of Lebrun'). The posture of Hercules was adapted by Annibale Carracci in his ceiling painting in the Camerino of the Palazzo Farnese, after 1595 (J. R. Martin, <i>The Farnese Gallery</i>, Princeton, 1965, pl. 11; cf. also his <i>Choice of Hercules</i>, Galleria Nazionale, Naples, <i>op. cit</i>, pl. 10). The pose of the head resting on the hand indicates melancholy, described in classical literature as the 'disease of heroes' (R. Klibansky, E. Panofsky, F. Saxl, <i>Saturn and melancholy,</i>1964, pp. 16-8). \n\n<i>Condition</i>. Cleaned in 1957, when a dark varnish and a film of discoloured soluble size were removed. The condition was found to be reasonably good, though in a number of areas repairs and over-painting were found to be extremely hard and these were not removed. \n<i>Prov</i>.

            "history_note": "Given by the Earl Granville, K. G., 1863\nGranville was vice-president for the Royal Commission dealing with the Great Exhibition. He was a skilful diplomat, known as 'Pussy' on account of his smoothness. He donated \u00a35,000 to the project, chaired the Committee which worked to involve local communities in the Exhibition, and later the Board that selected loans to the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A).\n\nHistorical significance: Formerly attributed to Annibale Carracci when given to the museum in 1863, it has been reattributed to Lodovico Carracci by Otto Kurz in 1937. This detached fresco transferred onto canvas was executed by Lodovico to decorate his cousin's house (Carlo Carracci) in Bologna (Malvasia, 1678). \nThe fresco is dated 1594 (inscribed lower left) and displayed a Venetian influence, a new style that Lodovico developed in the 1590s. \nThis painting shows the ancient Greek hero Heracles, Latinised in Hercules, on a rock, with his head leaning upon his wrist and holding a burning torch in the other hand. One of his feet is resting on the dead body of the Hydra. The Hydra of Lerna, a monstrous sea serpent with seven heads, was killed by Hercules as the second of his Twelve Labours, which were given as a penance for slaying his own children in a fit of madness.\nThe monumentality of the figure contrasts with its melancholic pose  while his posture was adapted by Annibale Carracci in his ceiling painting in the Camerino of the Palazzo Farnese, after 1595 as well as in <i>Hercules at the Crossroad,</i> 1596-97, Museo di Capodimonte, Naples. Hercules' melancholic attitude can be explained by the subject matter which presents the hero after he killed the beast, that is after his superhuman action described in the ancient literature as <i>hybris,</i> a force inspired by the gods, left him in a deflated condition.  \nThe fresco was moved to the palace of the Marchese Achille Maria Grassi in Bologna and transferred on canvas in the middle of the 19th century. \nLodovico's art was highly regarded in England in the 18th century by such critics as Joshua Reynolds, but fell out of fashion in the 19th century, and was renewed in the mid-20th century.",

            "historical_context_note": "Fresco painting on wet plaster originated in Antiquity, was reintroduced in the late 13th century and perfected during the Renaissance. This medium was used to decorate large wall areas. Timing was of critical importance and a number of assistants was typically involved. A precise plan in the form of a drawing or of many drawings was required so that the composition would fit exactly on the wall. The artist could draw directly on the wet plaster (this underdrawing technique is called <i>sinopia</i>) or use cartoons (from the Italian word <i>cartone</i>) from which the composition was then transferred onto the wall. Another method of transfer, used especially in the 17th century for vast ceiling frescoes, was squaring, which replaced the time-consuming and costly cartoon technique.",
