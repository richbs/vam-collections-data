The character of each role is reflected in the clothes that they wear, which means that the designer has to have a total knowledge not just of the play as written, but of the play as interpreted by the director as well as the preferences of any star actor. \n\nThe spray is one of several, of differing sizes but of the same overall concept, scale and style of making.  However, identifying how items like this were used in a theatre production can be difficult, involving lengthy detective work.  Some could be decorations for the hair, or for a coat or a hand muff.  Not every design survives and those that do may not be in great detail.  Messel, had a team of makers and assistants familiar with his methods, and only had to use a \u2018shorthand\u2019 or even just verbally explain what he wanted.  In fact, these objects are unusual in their making; Messel usually favoured a bolder approach and used unusual materials, like acetate, pipe cleaners or chandelier drops.  The fabric and bead flowers are more like the sprays available to the general public for fashionable wear.  \n\nPossibly the sprays were part of the original concept, but were abandoned either during the initial dress parades, when the finished costumes were seen together for the first time, or in subsequent dress rehearsals.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel\u2019s style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
