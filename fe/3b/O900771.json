The lamps are for a vegetable oil, the reservoirs in many examples being above the burner, devices being shown for regulating the flow of oil.   Glass ware is shown, but invariably \" charged separately.\" Many of the examples have the height indicated.   The lustre drop was in vogue when this list was issued.   A reference to Palmer in the case of some of the patterns recalls the fact that a firm of that name, and in a similar way of business, has been settled in Clerkenwell for a great many years, and may have succeeded the party indicated.   Some details are furnished about finishes in bronze and lacquer.   Prices are written in with ink.\"",
