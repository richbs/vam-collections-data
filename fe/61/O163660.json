            "physical_description": "Cap, plain weave cotton, quilted, lined with plain weave cotton, embroidered with silk and metal thread in running and chain and buttonhole stitches and with spangles; partly unpicked.\n\nFour conical curved sections of cream cotton, each three layers thick, sewn together and quilted in the central area with fine narrow diagonal lines using white silk in a running stitch.  The quilting is corded: white cotton thread has been laid in a continuous sinuous line on the back of the upper layer and seems to have been glued in placed - it was not inserted through the quilted channels using a needle - the quilted lines were worked around the threads. A second layer was glued on to these threads and the final layer of the backing was stitched in place. The quilting lines come from a narrow stylized cypress tree with a twin bird-headed root triangle and two small boteh motifs at the base, while the tree is infilled with a flowering stem; a pair of birds face downwards at the top of each cypress and two gilded spangles are sewn inside the twin bird-headed root. All motifs are outlined in chain stitch in [faded] coral red, light green, light blue, 'bronze' brown and [tarnished] metal thread. Each section is outlined along the 3 sides with a band containing a blue and [faded] coral red meander with rosettes in the spaces in the above coloured silks, omitting the metal thread; above the band, facing into the central space is a row of small botehs.  Again chain stitch is used but with some buttonhole for the rosette. A line of black silk chain stitch outlines each of the four sections. The under-drawing in ink may be seen in places.\n\nLining: 3 of the 4 panels are backed with a coarse plain weave cream cotton, pieced in places and held in place with stitching.\nEmbroidery Thread: 'bronze' and light blue silk, S-twist; 2S.\nMetal Thread: silver strip close S-wound on light yellow silk core.",
