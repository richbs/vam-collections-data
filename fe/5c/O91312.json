            "public_access_description": "Sewin is the colloquial Welsh name for the sea trout. This is a migratory brown trout that, like the salmon, spends time feeding at sea before returning to the river of its birth to spawn. Anglers prize sea trout highly for their strength, beauty and elusiveness. Chefs value them for their delicately flavoured flesh, which is tinted pink from their sea-diet of shrimps. This fine specimen is shown displayed on a traditional bass bag made of rush. When soaked with water, the bag keeps the fish cool by evaporation. A fourfold carpenter\u2019s boxwood rule has been included to show scale.\n\nLlewelyn was an important pioneer of photography. He was related by marriage to the inventor of the positive-negative process, William Henry Fox Talbot. This photograph was at once a demonstration of still-life composition, photographic draughtsmanship and skilful fly-fishing.",
