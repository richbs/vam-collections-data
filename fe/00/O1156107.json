He is dressed in richly embellished armour which a white silk ground, trimmed with velvet and metallic motifs of upstanding lions. Real feathers have been used to create a plumed helmet. The actor's left hand is upraised, displaying his circular red and gold shield with its central lion motif. In his right hand he carries a sword.\n\nChevy Chase was inspired by a ballad of the same name a version of which was entered in to the Stationer's Register in 1624. It is generally thought to describe the dramatic Battle of Otterburn which took place in 1388. This battle, in the course of which the Earl of Northumberland Henry Percy was captured, but not killed, was a surprise attack launched as daylight was fading. The majority of the fighting was through hand to hand combat as it was too dark for the archers to use their arrows.",
