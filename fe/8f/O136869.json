His clothing became renowned for its layered informality, clean lines and simple silhouettes. Beene's designs responded successfully to the era in which they were worn - youthful styles in the 1960s and loose, fluid, body-freeing clothing in the 70s. During the 1980s and 1990s he took an independent approach to his work, devoting his time to the search for the perfect fabric, perfect seam and perfect cut. \n\nThis pair of cufflinks was originally worn with a pair of Geoffrey Beene evening pyjamas and was donated to the museum along with the pyjamas and its other accessories which included a patent leather belt and a pair of clip-on, round black plastic earrings with a rhinestone centre. The full ensemble belonged to Catharina Tinniswood, a former show and fitting model for Geoffrey Beene in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The collection she kept is not the usual examples that were sold in the stores but rather the actual garments included in catwalk shows and trunkshows at the beginning of each season.",
