The case would have protected the cup itself but also the users from contact with the dangerous metal.\n\n\n\nMaterial & Making\n\nThe inner case is made of wood and covered with leather ornamented with gilt tooling. The decoration is made by  applying gold leaf to the leather, then pressing it firmly with a small, hot tool bearing a pattern. Any excess gold is then brushed away.\n\n\n\nOwnership & Use\n\nThe case is marked 'Antimony Cup Ld, Peterboroughs' and contains a letter dated 13 May 1775 explaining the use of the cup.\n\n\n\nThe letter reads:\n\n\n\nDr. Brocklesby's Compliments to Mrs. Shaw, In answer to her desire to be informed about the Antimonial cup and how to use it. Fill the cup with Lisbon Wine or Moselle Wine, set it to stand for 24 hours and then pour it into a Wine Glass, two tablespoons are to be taken at first and after waiting from 10 to 15 minutes, give a 3rd spoonful unless the first has begun to operate, but if 3 fail after 15 minutes then give a fourth or a fifth if required at due intervals and most commonly the 3rd produces nausea, sickness and vomiting. It is to be wrought off like another vomit by taking at proper intervals (a pint at a time) from 2 to 3 quarts of bitter, strong, chamomile tea.",
