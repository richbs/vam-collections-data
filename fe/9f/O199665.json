They show the extent to which durability was key during this period of austerity. The loose covers would further extend the life of the furniture underneath, and by making more covers in a different fabric the homeowner could avoid boredom with a particular fabric by quickly changing the mood or style of a setting at a relatively small cost.\n\nThese covers are part of the Utility Scheme in Britain in the 1940s and early 1950s, a government initiative which promoted the design and supply of simple, functional, hardwearing objects, including clothing, furniture and homewares in a time of limited resources. The V&A holds an interesting collection of Utilty objects and these furniture covers relate particularly to Utility Furniture designs by Gordon Russell in the Designs Collection and pieces of Utility Furniture in the Woodwork Collection.",
