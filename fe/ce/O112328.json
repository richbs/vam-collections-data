            "public_access_description": "This fine example of the carver's art is a mould for decorative relief, of the kind used to adorn panelling, ceilings, fireplaces and door surrounds.  The shallow carving indicates that this mould was for making a fairly flat band, probably for a picture frame. Although the scrolls, feathers and rosettes depicted here are reminiscent of the neo-classical motifs of the 18th century, it is more likely that this mould was carved during the 19th century when the neo-classical style was revived.  \n\nDifferent mixtures of whiting, glue and gum arabic, known as 'composition', were pressed into the boxwood mould to make crisp, detailed mouldings that were light and easy to apply to a ceiling or wall.  For larger mouldings paper pulp or some kind of textile were added to provide body. The development of moulded composition ornament brought about a decline in the number of professional woodcarvers engaged in decorating interiors.  Skilled carvers, however, were still very much in demand for the production of perfect moulds. \n\nThis piece is part of a large collection of moulds and carvings once owned by George Jackson & Sons, a London firm specialising in decorative plasterwork.  Established in 1780, Jackson's were reputed to have produced neo-classical mouldings for interiors designed by the Adam brothers, such as those at Croome Court in Worcestershire.  Later Jackson projects included work on the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, Buckingham Palace and several Cunard liners.\n\nThis scrolling pattern derives from the Vitruvian scroll, a frieze and banding ornament also known as running dog.  The motif appears in classical architecture and was named after the author of the only written account of architectural theory to survive from classical antiquity, Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, who wrote in the 1st century AD.",
