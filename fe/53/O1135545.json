Art director on the student magazine Oz, he had been convicted alongside Richard Neville and Richard Walsh for producing obscene publications. On moving to London he worked on producing posters for the UFO and Middle Earth nightclubs, and for musicians and bands including Cream, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nJimi Hendrix was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, widely considered to be the greatest guitarist in the history of rock music. His heyday in the mid 1960s to early 1970s was in tandem with the Peace and Love hippie movement, development of worldwide pop music festivals and the recreational use of psychotropic drugs, such as LSD. All these elements are combined in this psychedelic poster, with the bright flowing colours deriving from visions seen through 'acid trips', melting the image of Hendrix playing guitar into the abstract colours of the background.",
