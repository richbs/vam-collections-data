            "public_access_description": "Shoes with modest heels first came into fashion at the end of the 1850s, after nearly 50 years of low-heeled and flat-soled footwear. During the 1880s, the heel shape became more waisted, echoing the 18th century 'louis' heel. These white silk satin shoes have a moderate 5 cm heel with a slight waist.\n\nIn the 19th century, brides often remade their expensive silk dresses into evening or dinner dresses by altering the neckline and sleeves, or chose to get married in a coloured silk dress that could be worn for 'best' afterwards. Even aristocratic brides often had their wedding dresses remodelled to wear for their first presentation at Court as a married woman. Shoes and accessories could easily be tucked away safely as souvenirs, which may explain why this pair has survived in such good condition.",
