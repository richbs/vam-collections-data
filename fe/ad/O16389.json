Cotman does not show us the whole structure, but takes it up to its piers to suggest domination over the surrounding landscape. It is shown off-centre to suggest a progression of arches to the left and right.  The strength and power of the structure are contrasted with the fragility of the rickety wooden fence glimpsed through the arches below. \nAlthough the viaduct, designed and built by John Carr in 1785, was only 20 years old when Cotman painted it, some of the rendering that Carr had specified had already fallen off, revealing the long slabs of local stone beneath. Thus the structure had mellowed, and superficially resembled some of the ancient Roman aqueducts that were rendered in a similar way.",

Its quality derives from the simplicity of its composition, three great arches of an aqueduct standing alone in the countryside, and the delicate play of washes that envelop it and suggest the fall of sunlight on the scene. Cotman was of the same artistic generation as Turner and Girtin, and like them sought to make landscape-water-colours that are not simply portrayals of a place but make an appeal to our emotions. It was his apprenticeship with Girtin that taught him to use wash to suggest subtle changes of tonality and atmosphere, and his membership of Girtin's sketching club 'The Brothers' that helped to develop his sense of the underlying significance of a theme. \n\nChirk Aqueduct is a fine example of their approach to a subject. The aqueduct must have been quite new when Cotman sketched it, on one of his tours of Wales in 1800 or 1802. Cotman does not show us the whole structure, but takes us up to its piers to suggest its size and dominance over the surrounding landscape. It is shown off-centre, to suggest a progression of arches to the left and right, and its dominance is further reinforced by its reflection in the stream below. \nThe sun beats down and cuts great dark diagonals of shade out of its arches to give us a sense of the building's height and massiveness, and its strength and powers of endurance are contrasted with the fragility of the rickety wooden fence glimpsed through the arches below. All detail that would give us a specific sense of place is omitted, and the surrounding trees and foliage of the hills are reduced to an undifferentiated green mass which serves as a backdrop to the new building. \n\nRecent studies have in fact suggested that this is not a real place but an imaginary structure of the artist's own invention. However, Cotman must surely have stood under a similar structure in order to produce so convincing a water-colour. \nIt is a record of a powerful emotional experience rather than a description of a place, and is the painted equivalent of a poem or an ode by Keats. It was this development of the poetic and atmospheric qualities of the landscape that brought British landscape-painting to pre-eminence in the early 19th century and remains our greatest contribution to European painting.\n\nHoward Coutts\"",
