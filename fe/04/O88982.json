Whitcombe Green in 1929.\n\nHistorical significance: This piece, showing the Adoration of the Magi, is convex and partly cut away at the back, and may have been set into a medallion to be carried, fixed to a portable altar, or possibly worn. The donor shown behind the Virgin on the left may be a portrait of the original owner of the piece. The star which guided the Magi to the nativity is seen on the upper left.",

Often such works depicted religious subjects (though some portraits are also known), and were probably particularly valued because they could serve as portable devotional items. Engraved sources frequently provided the basis of the compositions, and the carvings were generally produced in anonymous workshops. The material was valued as much as the skill in carving. Some mother of pearl reliefs were attached to crucifixes, reliquaries, portable altars or rosaries, while others were later valued as Kunstkammer objects, and set into caskets and cabinets.",
