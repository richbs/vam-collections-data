They were owned by the wealthy and displayed as examples of scientific novelty. Despite this, they were not dependable time-keepers and people still relied on the movement of the sun and stars to determine the passage of time accurately. The clock on this example is a later replacement, but the construction of the piece, in which a mythical monster supports the dial, is common to other clocks of the period. It is also typical of sixteenth-century workmanship that the clock mechanism is concealed in the base and not in the figure itself. The monster, a griffin, would have opened its beak and flapped its wings as the hours struck. Only the development of the steam engine in the late eighteenth century ended the dominance of the mechanical clock in the world of Western technology.",
