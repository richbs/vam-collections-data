ISBN: 0642541566.\nExhibition catalogue.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 115, 118\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nHolmes (p. 244) plausibly identifies this with the drawing 'Elms' exhibited by Constable at the Royal Academy in 1818; it was on this basis included in the exhibition 'The First Hundred Years of the Royal Academy' 1951-2, No. 443.  Holmes's further statement that the drawing was bought in at the Executors' sale, 16 May 1838, is disproved by the inscription on the back, idntifying it with Lot 63 (sold for 7 gns. to White junr.).  The drawing was Lot 168 at Miss James's sale at Messrs. Christie's, 22 June 1891, whence it was bought for the Museum.  The year 1817, written on the front at the time when the drawing was made, is doubtless right; 1816 was added on the back by the artist from memory some eighteen years later.\nThe symbol 10 x in the inscription perhaps implies that the elm measured about ten times the height of a man, or ten diameters; the tree in Constable's drawing is in fact about twelve times the height of the man standing under it.  A lable inscribed <i>Miss James No. 8</i> (The figure <i>8</i> in pencil) from the back of the frame is preserved in the archives of the Department of Paintings.\nFor Old Hall see the note to No. 42a.[806-1888].",
