This bronze censer has a rectangular body meant to be formed of four peaches, their stems forming its handles. It has 'gold splash' decoration. This would have been achieved by fire-gilding. This involves applying gold in the form of a gold/mercury amalgam and then heating the vessel to drive off the mercury. A small amount of gold was left adhering to the base metal and the method was particularly suited to the application of very thin layers. The process could be repeated many times to build up layers of gold. Fire-gilding is now banned in most countries because the mercury vapour is not only toxic to the person undertaking the gilding, it also escapes into the atmosphere.",
