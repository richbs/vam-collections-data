But when Yama, God of Death, came to claim him, the youth held steadfastly to Shiva's emblem, the 'lingam'. When Yama's lasso encircled both Markandeya and the 'lingam', the angry Shiva appeared in person and drove Yama away. Markandaya is said to have lived on for 100 million years.",

Steele in 1950.\n\nThe lithographs with watercolour painted by hand and published by the Calcutta Art Studio at Boubazar, Calcutta and a few other litho printers became popular as wall hangings. The printers embarked upon marketing a whole range of pictures which included images of gods and goddesses as well as mythological themes.\n\nThe art of lithography was introduced in India around 1822 by Belnos and Saviagnac as they successfully practised it in Calcutta. Soon after the first Bengali lithographic press, the Shura Pathuria Press, was launched around 1829. The lithographs with real regional flavour were produced only in 1876 by Annadaprasad Bagchi with four of his colleagues when they opened their famous lithographic press, the Calcutta Art Studio. Annadaprasad Bagchi and his colleagues all trained in the Government School of Art. Almost simultaneously, another group of lithographers also left the Calcutta Art School and started their own press, the Royal Lithographic Press. It was however, in 1878, that the Calcutta Art Studio started the art of chromolithography in India.",
