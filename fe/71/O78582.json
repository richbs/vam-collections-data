It was one of a number of pieces presented by George IV (1762-1830; reigned 1820-1830) to government officials and royal attendants.\n\nPeople\nThe cup and cover was made by the Royal Goldsmiths Rundell, Bridge & Rundell for George IV. Surviving documents record that it was for 'The Right Honourable the Earl of Ormonde & Ossory, as his fee for executing the office of Chief Butler for Ireland at the Coronation'. Ormonde was one the chief attendants at the coronation. The cup and cover cost the nation over \u00a3230.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis cup and cover was one of a number of gifts that George IV gave to officials and attendants who assisted at his coronation and banquet in 1821. It was a custom for the sovereign to present gifts at the time of the coronation. The gifts included badges, mazers, and gold chains, as well as three other gold cups.\n\nThe banquet was the last traditional and the most extravagant feast of its kind ever held.  For this very splendid occasion the King spent \u00a348,152 10s 2d to borrow jewels, refurbish plate and to buy new silver and gifts from the Royal Goldsmiths. The steward's bill, mostly for food, came to over \u00a325,000.",
