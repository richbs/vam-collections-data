It is decorated with engraved champleve designs inlaid with black composition on hatched ground, all in the style of contemporary Western Iranian metalwork. The inscriptions on the outside of the rim, first reproduced by A.S. Melikian-Chirvani in his catalogue of Iranian metalwork in the V&A (Islamic Metalwork from the Iranian World 8-18th centuries, HMSO 1982, cat. 165) are written in nasta'aliq and include verses by Hafez. There is also an inscription identifying the owner, Khwaja Muhammad Bajiv (?) Kashmiri, and the date 1026 AH (9 January 1617-28 December 1617). The bowl was bought for the museum in Kashmir for \u00a31 4s by Caspar Purdon Clarke on his Indian purchasing trip in 1881-2. Given the Kashmiri owner, the 19th century provenance and characteristics of the design, it is likely that the bowl was made in Kashmir.",
