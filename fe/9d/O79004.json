In their simplest form turned seats were stools made by inserting three splayed legs into holes in a flat piece of wood. \n\nMaterials & Making\nChairs like this and other objects turned on a lathe were sometimes called 'thrown'. They were made on a pole lathe,  driven by pulling on a length of cord attached to a pole. The post was attached to a spindle, which was turned by the cord. It was shaped and patterned by a gouge, or cutting tool, held against the post as it turned. Pole lathes were simple to make and could be set up anywhere.\n\nThese chairs were often made from locally grown wood, in this case freshly cut oak, a tree native to Britain. The wood has since been varnished black.\n\nTime\nTurned armchairs and three-legged stools can be seen in medieval manuscripts, though they probably were made even earlier.  Similar chairs were also made in other parts of Northern Europe and Scandinavia.  They are difficult to date accurately, but in Britain many were made in the 16th and 17th centuries. We think this one dates from that time.",
