The ripple effect relates to the work of the English silversmiths Toby Russell and Alex Brogden, who also relish the malleability of the metal, which lends itself to this wave-like treatment and exploits the reflective quality of silver. The ripples in Pearson\u2019s handle are echoed in the fretted ripples in the blade, creating a sort of positive/negative effect and uniting both parts of the server. The simplicity of the design belies Pearson\u2019s mastery over the material, and the delicacy of his workmanship.",
