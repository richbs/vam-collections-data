Under the patronage of Catherine the Great in the 18th century, the workshops at Tula diversified into the production of forged and chiselled steel arms for a courtly clientele, and produced a wide range of other decorative objects, from snuff boxes to furniture. Tula weapon-makers became associated with a very fine 'blued' steel finish, complemented by gilding. They were renowned for their excellent craftsmanship, combining originality of design with technical virtuosity.",
