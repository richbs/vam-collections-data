Bookbindings were sometimes worked by skilled amateur embroiderers. The best known examples are a series of books with embroidered bindings made by the future Queen Elizabeth I as New Year gifts for her father, Henry VIII, and his last wife, Katherine Parr. However, the materials that have been used here - metal thread, strip and purl - are difficult to work with. When applied in embroidery of this quality, they almost always indicate professional work.\n\nThis binding showes two scenes from the Old Testament, the Sacrifice of Isaac, and Jonah and the Whale.",
