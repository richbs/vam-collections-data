There were major revivals of interest in engraved gems in Europe during the Byantine era, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  At each stage cameos and intaglios, these skillful carvings on a minute scale, were much prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment.

Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.\n\nHistorical significance: For comparison see 'Classical Gems.
