Sprang, which is originally a Scandinavian word, is made with threads stretched in tension and secured at both ends. The lengthways threads are then twisted in such a way that a net-like textile is produced.\n \nBurials from many sites in Egypt reveal that sprang was popular in particular for headwear, such as caps and harnets and snoods. A married woman in Egypt during the Roman and Byzantine periods was expected to cover her head when out of doors. The many finds show that Egyptians mastered the technique of sprang and its rich patternmaking potential.",
