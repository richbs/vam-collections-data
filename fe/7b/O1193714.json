It was made in four colourways: navy and white, mustard yellow and white, pale blue and white, petunia and white. \n\nAscher was an innovative designer whose company became incorporated in 1942 (Ascher Ltd). His wife designed for him, and he also employed artists freelance. This textile design was made by the society photographer and set designer Cecil Beaton.  \n\nThis particular design is typical of those made into smart summer dresses in the late 1940s. The French couturier Balmain chose it for an afternoon dress for his Summer 1946 collection, and it appeared in the French fashion magazine Jardin des Modes in that same season, accessorised with a dark wide-brimmed straw hat, and dark gloves. The dress had wide shoulders, and the skirt was gently pleated with a soft bow.",
