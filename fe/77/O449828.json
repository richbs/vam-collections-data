Two grades of powder were required, a coarse grain which propelled the bullet from the barrel and a finer grain (sometimes called serpentine) which was placed in the external priming pan with which to ignite the main charge. The priming flask was usually smaller and often adapted from the hollowed out horns of an antelope.\n\nDespite the development of other mechanisms, the simplicity and robust nature of the matchlock led to its continued use in most parts of India and surrounding regions throughout the 19th century and in some cases into the early 20th century.",
