Isma\u2019il Jalayir taught at the main art school in Tehran, but he stands apart from his contemporaries. He developed a distinctive personal style, and he often depicted people excluded from direct political power, such as the Sufi saint Nur \u2018Ali Shah, and this group of women from the harem of a member of the ruling dynasty. It may be that his aristocratic background allowed him greater freedom as an artist. \n\nThe emotionless, posed quality of the faces suggests that the women did not sit for him as a group but were photographed individually, and Isma\u2019il then used the images to create a large composition. The women have gathered for a tea party in a pavilion in a wooded garden. The princess standing at the centre offers a glass goblet to another princess, also standing, while the veiled woman seated between them smokes a water pipe. The other women drink tea from a samovar and listen to the music of the tar \u2013 the instrument played by the woman on the right. Isma\u2019il\u2019s paintings are suffused with a dreamlike, melancholy air, which has transformed the tea party into an event filled with mystery.",
