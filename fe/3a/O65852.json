St Norbert stands beside him with his left hand on the abbot\u2019s shoulder. St Norbert wears a bishop\u2019s mitre and carries a crozier. His cope is fastened with a morse with an image of Veronica holding the veil with Christ\u2019s face imprinted on it. Kneeling behind the abbot is a monk in brown robes. He holds a crozier which bears small figures within niches, one of whom is St Peter holding the keys. At the top of the crozier is an image of the seated Virgin and Child. This scene takes place within a room with purple draperies and a red column. Behind the kneeling monk, as if through a window, there is a scene from the life of St Norbert. St Norbert receives a scapular from an angel. This is executed in brown pigment and silver stain on light blue glass.",

            "public_access_description": "This window came from the cloisters of the the Premonstratensian Abbey of Steinfeld, near Cologne in Germany. The windows were created and installed in the first half of the 16th century. They were paid for by local clerics and some of these donors were depicted in panels which occupied the lowest parts of the cloister windows.\n\nThis panel depicts the donor Abbot Johann von Ahrweiler and his patron saint Norbert. Saint Norbert founded the monastic Order of Premonstratensian Canons in 1120. St Norbert had received a vision of St Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in North Africa and one of the Four Fathers of the Western Church, who had died in 430. In this vision, Augustine advised Norbert to adopt a rule for monastic living which he had outlined. This 'rule' emphasised an active life of preaching the gospel to the people but the canons lived and prayed together in a monastic environment. Hence, Canons are quasi-monastic. St Norbert stressed that his canons should be well-educated so that they would be better fit to teach the writings of the Gospel.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Steinfeld was closed down in 1802 but prior to that in 1785 the stained glass windows of the cloister had been taken down. It is believed that they were purchased, probably at the time of the closure in 1802, by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Steinfeld panels to various churches and to private collections. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow, who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nAbbot Johann von Ahrweiler (1517-1538) commissioned windows for the cloister of the Praemonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld in the Eifel.\n\nWe know the layout of the windows of the cloister glazing at Steinfeld from an illustrated manuscript that was made in 1632 and was housed at Trier. \n\nAnother manuscript showing the arrangement of the windows is in the state archives in Dusseldorf. This dates from 1719.\n\nThe majority of the windows appear to be from the workshop of the glass painter Gerhard Remisch.",

            "historical_context_note": "During the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Steinfeld was closed down in 1802 but prior to that in 1785 the stained glass windows of the cloister had been taken down. It is believed that they were purchased, probably at the time of the closure in 1802, by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Steinfeld panels to various churches and to private collections. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow, who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nAbbot Johann von Ahrweiler (1517-1538) commissioned windows for the cloister of the Praemonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld in the Eifel.\n\nWe know the layout of the windows of the cloister glazing at Steinfeld from an illustrated manuscript that was made in 1632 and was housed at Trier. \n\nAnother manuscript showing the arrangement of the windows is in the state archives in Dusseldorf. This dates from 1719.\n\nThe majority of the windows appear to be from the workshop of the glass painter Gerhard Remisch.",
