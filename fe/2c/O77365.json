The handbell would be rung at intervals to invoke all those who heard it to pray for the repose of the departed.  Contemporary engravings depicting funerals in the 17th century show the sexton walking ahead of the coffin and carrying a staff and a  bell.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis bell was found buried near Worcester Cathedral.  It was cast in 1638, just before the Civil War of 1642-1646, when the city of Worcester and its cathedral were badly damaged. This bell may have been looted from a church or from the cathedral during the upheaval.",
