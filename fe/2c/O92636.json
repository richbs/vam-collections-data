Christ stands behind the bed, holding up the personification of the Virgin's soul (restored). Two angels fly down on the left and a third flies up to heaven. Inscriptions above the bed. In teh middle section are St. Gregory of Nyssa and St Basil, and St Paul and St Peter embracing. On the bottom row are Sts Cosmas and Damian, St  Nicholas and St John Chrysostom identified by inscriptions. On the back is a large cross with rosettes at the ends of the arms (a cross is frequently carved on the back of Byzantine ivories).",

            "public_access_description": "This is a Byzantine ivory panel made in Constantinople in the late 10th or early 11th century. This plaque formed once the centre of a triptych.\nThis panel depicts the Dormition of the Virgin. At the top of the Dormition, Christ stands behind the Virgin's bed, taking her soul up to Heaven. In the middle row are Sts. Gregory of Nyssa, Basil, Paul and Peter; at the bottom Sts. Cosmas, Damian, Nicholas and John Chrysostom. On the back is a cross with resettes at the ends of the arms.\n\nThe Death of the Virgin is depicted at the top, a scene which does not show the moment of the Virgin's death but the moment at which Christ comes to take away her soul after death. The story of the Death of the Virgin  comes from the Apocryphal New Testament and appears very often in Byzantine art; its importance is reflected in the dominant place it often occupies in church decoration, on the west wall of the building. The basic format of the scene varies little over centuries. Standing saints appear very frequently in all forms of Byzantine art; here they are arranged not according to the calendar but according to their hierarchical order as found in the liturgy. Sts Paul and Peter embracing is very unusual in Byzantine Art and was probably taken over from western examples. In the present context it is likely to represent the saints' final meeting before martyrdom, juxtaposed with the Virgin's death on the level above.",

Acquired in 1867.\nThis plaque formed once the centre of a triptych.\n\nHistorical significance: The Death of the Virgin is depicted at the top, a scene which does not show the moment of the Virgin's death but the moment at which Christ comes to take away her soul after death. The story of the Death of the Virgin  comes from the Apocryphal New Testament and appears very often in Byzantine art; its importance is reflected in the dominant place it often occupies in church decoration, on the west wall of the building. The basic format of the scene varies little over centuries. Standing saints appear very frequently in all forms of Byzantine art; here they are arranged not according to the calendar but according to their hierarchical order as found in the liturgy. Sts Paul and Peter embracing is very unusual in Byzantine Art and was probably taken over from western examples. In the present context it is likely to represent the saints' final meeting before martyrdom, juxtaposed with the Virgin's death on the level above.",
