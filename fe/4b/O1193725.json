It belonged therefore to Dior's cheaper, ready-to-wear collections, and was described as a 'go anywhere' dress, suitable for hot days of summer. It was sleeveless, with a low V-shaped neck and full, pleated skirt. Customers could choose one of three colours for the background: royal blue, pistachio green, or light rose.",
