Both worked for the Russian Imperial Ballet. Nicolai became an important teacher and after leaving the Imperial Ballet in 1914 went on to teach dance in Russia, Paris and London, where he eventually settled.  Sergei, regarded as the greater choreographer and perceived as the natural successor to Pavel Gerdt as the Imperial Ballet's Premier danseur noble, committed suicide, aged 30.  \n\nThe brothers worked together to produce caricatures of fellow dancers and choreographers.  In an unpublished memoir Josif Kschesinky described their methods: 'One of them would be sitting at a desk and the other standing behind him, leaning on his shoulders.  Then, suddenly, he would snatch the pencil or paint-brush from his brother's hand and push him off his chair.  He would take over the drawing and proceed to work on the sketch.  A little later the first brother would have a new idea and go through the same manoeuvre and would continue the sketch.'",
