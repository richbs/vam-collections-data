The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nIt shows images of candidates from New Forum, Democracy Now and Initiative for Peace and Human Rights standing for election in Berlin and the five states. The text states: 'Nicht Rechts. Nicht Links. Geradeaus nach Europa\u2019, meaning \u2019not right, not left. Straight ahead to Europe\u2019. It further states 'Entscheiden Sie sich am 18. M\u00e4rz f\u00fcr Ihre Rechte als B\u00fcrger\u2019, which means \u2018decide for your rights as a citizen on the 18th of March\u2019.\n\nAlliance 90 came together for the People\u2019s Chamber elections. It consisted of different groups emerging out of the Citizen's Movement. These were: 'Neues Forum' ('New Forum'), 'Initiative f\u00fcr Frieden und Menschenrechte ('Initiative for Peace and Human Rights') and 'Demokratie Jetzt' ('Democracy Now'). Later on the B\u00fcndnis 90 became a political party. On 14th May 1993 it aligned with the party 'Die Gr\u00fcnen' ('The Greens) to become 'B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen' ('Alliance 90/The Greens').\n\nThe Alliance did not do well at the elections for the People's Chamber, although it had been representatives from these groups who managed to provide the moral and intellectual basis for the 'Wende' ('turnaround), often by overcoming state repressions. They were the negotiators at the 'round tables' and provided the basis which led to overthrow of the GDR-system and ultimately the GDR itself.\n\nAlliance 90 could therefore run the campaign using the names of personalities whose political aims and message were well known. There was, nevertheless, no great trust in Alliance 90 to manage the desired reunification because the groups within the Alliance were initially formed to reform the GDR, rather than join West Germany.",
