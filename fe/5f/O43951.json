Among those who produced printed textiles based on his designs were Zika Ascher, Bernard Ashley and Bern Silks. None of the designs show the repeat fully worked out. Generally the repeat was arrived at by the manufacturer's design team who also determined the colourways. The artist stated that the designs were inspired by or derived from trends in contemporary painting.",
