            "public_access_description": "This jigging doll was made by Richard Morgan Davies in 1951 as part of a school project when he was 14. The puppet is designed to 'dance' when the rod in his back is rotated.\n\nThe donor is the maker's brother, and he remembers being entertained by the puppet as a child. The puppet is a good example of woodwork projects completed at UK schools in the 1950s and will complement the collection of homemade objects already held at the museum.\n\nThe personal story that accompanies the object shows how the toy provided a link between school and home life. Woodwork was introduced into schools in the late 19th century, at this time practical subjects were viewed as suitable for those who were \"dull in all 'brain work'\". An increase in the acceptance of crafts and technology occurred after World War II when its practical advantages were realised, but they were still seen as inferior to more 'academic' subjects.\n\nAs well as its practical implications, the study of woodwork is proven through this object to be fun and entertaining, and a skill that can be shared with the family.",
