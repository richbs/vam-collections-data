Croft to Harcourt-Smith\ndraws attention to oak doors and panelling for sale by Albert Cubitt, Ipswich.  He notes the doors are in good condition but have several coats of paint on them.  He has been told that the doors came from some old cottages at Lavenham.\n\n14 July 1913 Minute paper\nupon receipt of photographs from Cubitt, Lehfeldt writes that the doors \"seem interesting\".  The Dept. has 368-05 but these doors present variations in design (one slightly arched) and despite the lack of available funds, he supports having them sent for approval.\n\n15 July 1913 Minute paper of DFM\nsupports acquiring the door marked \"A\" and notes that the other doors are so similar in style to the doors  declined on score of price by the Museum last year and afterwards purchased by the Ipswich Museum that they must have come from the same house.\n\n(CM note - the door selected in the end is \"B\" - one of the others, similar to those in the Ipswich Museum).\n\n23 July 1913 Purchase Form\ncondition of 3 old oak linen-fold panel doors is noted as \"damaged, portions missing\".\n\n30 July 1913 Minute Paper\nO Brackett supports purchase of the door marked \"B\" on the photos.  \"An ornate example of this type of work and finer than anything of the kind in the Museum\".  The door \"B\" is purchased for \u00a318; the others are returned.",
