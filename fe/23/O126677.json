The norm was arrived at by the selective use of antique remains, by influential people. All over Italy, imitation of the Ancient Roman orders was a sine qua non. At least theoretically therefore 1851 and 1852-1892 could have been carved anywhere since architects and gentlemen would have had no reason to take exception to them. Since, howeevr the are made of Istrian stone and were probably acquired from the Venetian dealer tadesco, it is not impossible that in turn, Tadesco acquired them in Venice itself from oneof its many freshly demolished and heavily restored buildings. \nAlthough of squatter proportions, this pair of capitals bears a marked resemblance to capitals from the Arch of Caracalla at Ostia. Parts of a capital from which were only brought to light at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.Other capitals from the same monument may have been known in the Renaissance only to be lost (as was the case with many important antiquities) or virtually identical capitals from other works of Caracalla's imperium.",
