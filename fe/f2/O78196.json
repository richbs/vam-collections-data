After printing this sheet, another person probably coloured it by hand.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis print illustrates the interior of a well-known shop in London's Strand, Ackermann's Repository of Arts, in 1809.\n\nCustomers are shown looking at paintings on the wall, choosing prints from a portfolio and purchasing art materials at the counter. The shop sold a wide variety of art materials, from watercolours and paper to pens and inks.\n\nDecorative papers could also be bought, which were used for 'fancy paper work'. This involved ornamenting small decorative objects, such as screens and boxes, with patterned papers. 'Fancy paper work' was a very fashionable activity for women around the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nTrading\nRudolph Ackermann's business, The Repository of Arts, was an extremely diverse concern. As well as selling artists' materials and fancy goods, he exhibited and sold contemporary prints and watercolours. Ackermann (1764-1834), originally from Germany, also began a circulating library of prints and drawings, which subscribers could borrow to take home. The Repository was also a publishing business, producing high-quality illustrated books and periodicals. One of its most famous publications was the magazine The Repository of Arts, Literature, Commerce, Manufactures, Fashions, and Politics.",
