The decoration on the obverse is divided into three compartments, the central one being larger than the others. Each is separated by a border of rather crudely painted classical motifs. From left to right, the first scene shows a ship at sea flying what appears to be English Naval flags, the red ensign and pennant and the Union flag. The central scene shows a fancy dress masked ball. The third scene is pastoral with cows in a landscape and a young woman and a baby seated beside them.\n\nThe reverse has a Chinoiserie scene with an oriental couple in a fanciful landscape of plants, trees, insects and birds.\n\nThere are 21 sticks and guards. The sticks are arranged close together so that they overlap. They have carved and pierced decoration. The decoration consists of a central panel carved in relief with figures in a pastoral setting, and on either side there is a roundel with a single figure in each. The remaining area comprises rococo, Chinoiserie and classical motifs. \n\nThe rivet is set with clear pastes.",
