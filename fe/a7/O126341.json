The scene is painted using the rich colours and composition associated with the Baroque style. Classical references are made in the representation of costume, for example the strapped sandals of the women and the armour worn by the male figures. The figures are lively and expressive, and the composition of the scene is engaging, and full of incident and interest. The fan maker has decorated the lower halves of the sticks with silver piqu\u00e9 work, setting patterns of tiny silver nails or dots into the ivory. Mother of pearl has also been used in the decoration. The reverse of the fan leaf is painted with flowers.",
