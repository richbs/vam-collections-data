            "public_access_description": "This caricature is of the red-nosed comedian Harry Bedford when he was performing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 31 October 1904. He was billed as \u2018the original singer of \u201cA Little Bit off the Top\u201d and \u201cThe Cock of the North\u201d, in his latest London successes\u2019. Bedford was making a return appearance at the theatre that year, having already appeared there in January. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Bedford was on the bill that week with R. A. Roberts and Rose and Calvert, who were also drawn by Cooke. \n\nHarry Bedford (1873-1939) began as a child performer at the Magpie Music Hall, Battersea, the Elephant and Castle Theatre and the Britannia, Hoxton. He did a variety of apprenticeships, joined a touring theatre and worked as a minstrel and clown on south coast beach shows. At the age of 15 he played cat to Vesta Tilley\u2019s Dick Whittington at the Theatre Royal, Portsmouth. He made his first solo music hall appearance in 1889 at Vento\u2019s Varieties, Portsmouth. In 1895 he appeared at the Middlesex Music Hall in London and soon after as a solo comedian and dancer. A popular \u2018low comedian\u2019, his earliest song successes were \u2018Cock of the North\u2019 and \u2018When I Get Some Money\u2019. \u2018A Little Bit off the Top\u2019 was his first hit after he sang it at Southampton in December 1898. It was considered saucy at the time.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall performer and red-nosed comedian Harry Bedford (1873-1939). After making his first appearance with Mamley's Variety Company at the Magpie Music Hall, Battersea, he took child parts at the Elephant and Castle Theatre and the Britannia Hoxton. After a variety of apprenticeships, he joined a touring theatre and also worked as a minstrel and clown on south coast beach shows. At 15 he played cat to Vesta Tilley's Dick Whittington at the Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, making his first solo music hall appearance as Fred City in 1889 at Vento's Varieties, Portsmouth.  In 1895 he appeared at the Middlesex Music Hall and soon after as a solo comedian and dancer. A popular low comedian, his earliest song successes were 'Cock of the North' and 'When I Get Some Money'  His greatest hit was 'A Little Bit off the Top'. The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
