            "public_access_description": "Charles Edward Stuart (1720-88) was the last serious Stuart claimant to the English throne. He staged an unsuccessful rebellion against George II in 1745-6. He was later romanticised in literature and legend as Bonnie Prince Charlie.\n\nIn the 17th century, new techniques of painting enamels allowed delicate portraits resembling tiny oil paintings to be created. These enamel miniatures were first fashionable in continental Europe, but were particularly in vogue in Britain from the 1720s to 1760s.  Denis Brownell Murphy was born in Dublin around 1745. During his long career he worked in both  England and Scotland. Brownell Murphy painted a set of enamel miniatures in Scotland in 1804, taking as his source portraits which were in Scottish collections at the time. He chose images illustrating the lineage of the House of Stuart, beginning with Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
