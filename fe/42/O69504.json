            "public_access_description": "This ewer shows how it can be difficult to unravel the many different influences generated by intense trade across the Mediterranean in the late 15th century. The piece was made in northern Europe.  However, the ornament on the lid includes the coat of arms of the Molino family of Venice, and the decoration was probably executed in Syria. It seems that a member of the Molino family sent the ewer to Syria to be decorated in an Islamic style. It was then returned to Italy.",
