            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis typical delftware display charger offers the maximum area for decoration. The edge forms a minimal frame, with slanting cobalt-blue brush strokes.\n\nTime\nIt is difficult not to believe that owning such a dish in London in 1653, in the very year that Oliver Cromwell was made Lord Protector, would not have been an act of treason, probably punishable with severe penalties. Although we do not know the identity of the Royalist couple who commissioned the piece, its existence tells us much about the latent loyalty to the king that thrived underground during the harsh repression of the Commonwealth period (1649-1660).\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe striking full-length portrait of Charles I (reigned 1625-1649) and his three male heirs (Prince Charles, Prince James and Henry, Duke of Gloucester) was closely copied from a print of about 1641-1642. This in turn was copied from an engraving of Charles I without his children published by Joseph Bruyning of Amsterdam in 1639. The crowned warrior king in armour and robes of state was indeed a potent image, one which was later adapted and re-used many times on commemorative delftware, where the same pose was extended to his successor, Charles II (reigned 1660-1685).",
