These items would have been regarded as a necessity particularly in damp, poorly-heated houses with stone or brick floors, but would have only been found in prosperous middle-class homes. They would have been the responsibility of the woman of the house, as was maintaining the warmth, light and comfort of the home. In order to spread the heat, they needed perforated sides, which made for elaborate carving. The carving might commemorate family ties, religious beliefs or national preoccupations. When not used, foot warmers would be hung from a ceiling beam, which explains why the base was often as elaborately carved as the other sides.",
