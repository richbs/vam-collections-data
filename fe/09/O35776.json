Above the donkey are the words ' PLAYERS; PLEASE NOTE I WANT MY TAIL IN THE RIGHT PLACE NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY RIBS. In the lower right corner are the words British Made. \n2. tail of the donkey to be pinned on. The game is in very poor condition, mainly due to the fact it has been played with and its surface is covered with pin pricks. Also along folds the paper has split and broken away. It\nis also stained and has large holes where the game was originally attached to some support. It is, however, interesting as few of these party games survive and the actual print and design is attractive. It would be possible to play the game as a board game, straight forward race from 1 to 100.",
