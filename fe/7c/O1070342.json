F H A Wallop from an unrecorded source, lent to the V&A 1928-49, given to Alan Evans, 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 78 (Anon., English c.1680). \n\nLong listed this simply as 'by a 17th century artist; date about 1680' in the Wallop Loan Book. It is hard to improve on that, unless to speculate that the stipple technique is so loose and disorganised by comparison with that of Cross, its foremost practitioner at this date, that the artist here may have been an amateur. Technically, however, the miniature follows normal English practice.\" \n",
