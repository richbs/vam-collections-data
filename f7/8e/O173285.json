He is best known by these later works, but earlier works, like this drypoint  made in 1940, suggest he was energetically experimenting with form and a technique of 'drawing'  of a more spontaneous nature, which relates to the surrealist technique of automatic writing. The image is thought to be  inspired by a very young child,  Eddie (hence Eh-De) of whom Albers was very fond. At this time Albers was teaching at Black Mountain College in Carolina, but also making trips to Mexico, which he found very inspiring.",
