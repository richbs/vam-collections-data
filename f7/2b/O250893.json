A similar format appears in <i>Scroll, c</i>.1871, and <i>Marigold, c.</i> 1875. \n\n<i>Larkspur</i> was first issued as a monochrome paper. A single-colour version was registered as a printed textile in April 1875. Similarly <i>Marigold</i>, another monochrome design, was registered as a wallpaper in 1875 (its design was well underway by late 1874) and as a fabric later in the same year (cat.no.M.46). \n\nAlthough the detailing helps to break up monotony, the later multi-coloured version is more successful. The veining on the flowers, variations on the green and a dotted background gives a pretty pattern with depth and variety.' \n\n'cat.no.M.46' is V&A object CIRC.496-1965.",
