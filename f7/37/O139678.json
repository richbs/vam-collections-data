            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans, parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThe outbreak of war in 1914 slowed the pace of changing fashions which had previously called for a new style each season. This sober plain- covered brown en-tout-cas (all weather parasol), is of a larger circumference which remained in vogue for the wartime period. Here the decorative interest is provided by a large flower on the handle and elongated rib tips of a contrasting colour, all made of a form of early plastic. Rib tips (the coverings at the end of each supportive metal prong), once hidden away, became a feature in their own right after 1914 and necessitated a wider central stick. The large loop handle, also of plastic, demonstrates the 20th century trend for holding the parasol cover- down when not in use, enabled by the addition of thin band holding the shade closed.",

Broughton died before he could be elevated to a peerage, their eldest son Urban H.R. Broughton (1896-1966) became 1st Baron Fairhaven of Lode on 20 March 1929, while Cara became 1st Lady Fairhaven. This barony became extinct on Urban H.R.Broughton's death, but a later barony, Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey, co. Cambridge, was granted to him in 1961, with a remainder to his brother, Henry (1900-1973), to enable this title to continue after his death without male heirs.\n\nThis forms part of a large donation of late 19th and early 20th century garments and accessories (with a few historical textiles) donated to the Museum in 1972 by Cara's grandson and Henry's son, Major Ailwyn Broughton and his wife, a year before Ailwyn became Lord Fairhaven following his father's death.",

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans, parasols displayed and individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.",
