He created among other designs the group's bestseller, the First chair (1983), which looked something like a diagram of an orbiting satellite. The Oceanic lamp, with its diagonal composition and bold combination of black-and-white stripes atop a pink block, is a quintessential example of Memphis design in its first year. This example is an early edition piece. For the inaugural collection, de Lucchi also created a small armoire named Pacific, and a shelving unit called Atlantic, completing a trio of similarly named objects which refelcts an interest in theming that runs through Memphis's production.",

By the time of the founding of Memphis under the leadership of Sottsass in 1981, de Lucchi had already designed a number of product designs in a postmodern style, among them the <i>Sinerpica</i> lamp (W.7-2010) for Alchymia (1978), a set of prototypes for the Italian manufacturer Girmi (1978) and a coffee pot commissioned by Cleto Munari (1979).\nDe Lucchi was arguably the most important furniture designer, apart from Sottsass himself, for Memphis. He created among other designs the group's bestseller, the First chair (1983), which looked something like a diagram of an orbiting satellite. The <i>Oceanic</i> lamp, with its diagonal composition (recalling Sottsass' <i>Beverly</i> sideboard) and bold combination of black-and-white stripes atop a pink block, is a quintessential example of Memphis design in its first year. For the inaugural collection, de Lucchi also created a small armoire named <i>Pacific</i>, and a shelving unit called <i>Atlantic</i>, completing a trio of similarly named objects (an interest in theming that runs through Memphis's production. Like all of the lighting in the first collection, the <i>Oceanic</i> lamp was manufactured by Artemide, with Memphis designer Martine Bedin acting as the liaison to the factory.",
