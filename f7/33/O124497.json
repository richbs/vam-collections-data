This design was made from a copperplate engraving and produced for the private use of goldsmiths.  This copperplate engraving could have been used as a base to try out enamel or gold colours.  It could also have been shown to potential customers. The design was drawn by an anonymous designer in about 1760-1780 and was possibly made for an elite client from the Court of Louis XV, King of France, from 1715 to 1774, or that of Louis XVI, King of France from 1774 until 1791 at Versailles, Paris. \n\nThis design is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines.  \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
