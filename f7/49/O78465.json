The four-lobed, domed lid is made in the same way. The handle, finial and spout were cast.\n\nPeople\nThis coffee pot was made in the 1830s by the Royal Goldsmiths, Robert Garrard & Brothers. It was inspired by a design of about 1760 by the furniture designer and maker John Linnell (1729-1796). By 1760 Linnell's engraved designs for silver were too late to have much impact on the silver of his contemporaries, although a tea caddy based on his design was produced at the time.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Rococo was one of the earliest and most significant of the 19th-century stylistic revivals. Many of the designs simply re-assembled Rococo motifs to suit the eclectic taste of consumers. This coffee pot, however, copies an original 18th-century design more faithfully in form and in spirit.",
