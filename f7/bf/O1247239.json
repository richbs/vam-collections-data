The figures were bought in 1937 and are mostly made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto.\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nWe all know Mr. Punch's wife as Judy but in the earliest Punch &amp; Judy shows she was known as Joan. She traditionally fights with Mr. Punch because of his careless treatment of their baby. In Professor Bavister's version Judy calls Punch a 'wicked old scamp' when she hears that he's thrown the baby out of the window and hits him with a tin plate. Punch knocks her out with his stick and throws her downstairs.",
