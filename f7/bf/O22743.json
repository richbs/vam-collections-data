The Jason chair was designed by a Danish designer Carl Jacobs but was manufactured by Kandya, a British firm. The lightweight, stackable, chair has gently tapering splayed wooden legs that are typical of Danish design of the period.  The seat and back of the chair are folded from a single sheet of flexible plywood that wraps around the chair and joins below the seat in an expressive, though functionless, jigsaw puzzle type connection. In America the Eames and Eero Saarinen were experimenting with moulding single-piece chair seats and backs, but it required far simpler technology to bend plywood to achieve the same effect, as with this chair. Principally designed for domestic use, the Jason chair was in continuous production for almost twenty years, with metal legs as an option. In 1952 three hundred were installed in the South Bank Restaurant on the site of the Festival of Britain.",
