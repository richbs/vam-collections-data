            "public_access_description": "This medallion, representing the Judgement of Paris, is made by the Master of IO. F.F., in Italy in ca. 1490.\nIt is perhaps from the pommel of a sword, as in examples of the Wallace Collection and at Munich.\n\nAt the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, Eris threw a golden apple into the crowd of the guests. She stated that it should be the prize 'for the fairest'. Athena, Hera and Aphrodite each claimed it. Zeus told Hermes to lead them to Mount Ida, for Paris to judge about the matter. Each goddess promised him protection and special gifts if he would choose her as receiver for the apple: Hera guaranteed to make him ruler of Asia; Athena promised him wisdom and victory in combats; Aphrodite offered him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. Paris gave the golden apple to Aphrodite.\n\nThe medallion was acquired by the Musuem from the Soulages Collection in 1859. Jules Soulages was a collector of French and Italian Renaissance art. After his death his collection was acquired by the Museum. Born in Toulouse in 1803, Jules Soulages practised as a lawyer in Paris and was founding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Archeologique du Midi de la France. He created an extensive collection of French and Italian Renaissance decorative art from 1825. Soulages died on 13 October 1857, aged 54. The dealer John Webb was despatched to examine and report on the collection, which was purchased between 1859 and 1865 in installments for \u00a311,000 with the assistance of 73 subscribers.",
