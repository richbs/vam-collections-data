The crest pierced and carved with scrolling leaves and an inverted fan shaped motif in the centre. The arms of dog-leg form, meeting the rear stiles in a bird's mouth joint, and supported on each side by two turnings, the front turnings being a continuation of the front legs. The seat formed by two planks, with a central, circular cut-out (presumably when the chair was adapted as a commode seat) with modern fill. The front legs turned and linked (to each other and to the rectangular rear stiles) by rectangular stretchers forming a trapezoid; with the front and rear stretchers linked by a baluster shaped flat stretcher.\n\nReplacement parts\nPL and front rail may be replacement, copying the original pr rail\nSide stretchers\nBottom of rear legs\nRepair at front of pr arm\nSeat with circular commode cut-out seat and modern infill. The seat made of two planks (possibly originally, but this seems unlikely)\nThe crest may have been repegged, given tear out visible at front.\n\nNails below the rails on the rear stiles, possibly for a batten to hide the chamber pot?\nAxe marks on back panel\nSaw marks/toothing plane on inside of rails",

A certain number of legitimate repairs (cleverly matched) are apparent. Two discrepancies are: the back panel which appears to have been made from two pieces of wood, a most unlikely method for the 16th century; the poor joints between arms and rear stiles and the discrepancy in wear between these elements. The form of this chair is close to a number of other surviving chairs: notably a walnut example at MdAD (Blanc p.85), and the crest of a chair at Ecouen, 2006 (on loan from Louvre?)",
