            "public_access_description": "This coverlet is a striking example of the craft of patchwork, a popular pastime in the nineteenth century. In 'piecing' or 'patchwork', small pieces of fabric are sewn together to produce a decorative design. The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, such as the wide borders of alternating light and dark triangles seen here.A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.\n\nMany of the textiles seen here were printed in the first decades of the nineteenth century, at a time when the British cotton industry was rapidly expanding. The market was flooded with a new range of printed cottons for clothing and furnishings, which could also be used for the creation of light, bright coverings for the bedroom. Here, the maker has carefully selected from the enormous range of fabrics available, from simple floral repeats to abstract designs. The central section is pieced in the enduringly popular pattern known as 'Grandmother's Flower Garden'. To create one of the surrounding borders, the maker has carefully cut out a series of birds and flowers from fashionable printed cottons and appliqu\u00e9d them to a plain white ground; a technique known as Broderie Perse.\n\nThe technique of Broderie Perse became particularly fashionable in middle class homes between 1775 and 1840. Women were keen to produce finely worked items that signalled their aspirations towards gentility, while also declaring their access to the latest printed cottons. Broderie Perse displayed both to best effect. Many Broderie Perse coverlets of the period drew on printed fabrics produced in northern textile towns such as Manchester and Preston. The glazed cottons used here are reminiscent of (but not the same as) other coverlets in the V&A's collection, such as T.382-1960 and T.399-1970.",

It was important to use up-to-date patterns, and because they were expensive to buy, they had to be used to best advantage. Consequently Broderie Perse became a popular technique, as it showed the most fashionable details exactly as they had been printed.",
