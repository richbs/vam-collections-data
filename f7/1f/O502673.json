T. Lawrence (Lugt. 2445); S. Woodburn (sale Christie, 4-8 June 1860, unidentified lot, bought for the Museum) The attribution rests solely on the inscription and is uncertain. Another drawing from the Lawrence and Woodburn collections, bought evidently in the same lot at the Woodburn sale, is also inscribed Fontana in the same handwriting, but seems to be by a different artist and earlier in date (see no. 485). Both drawings were formerly attributed to Domenico Maria Fontana, the engraver, whereas Carlo Fontana, the architect, is probably meant in the inscription.",
