            "history_note": "Baron De Meyer is seen by many as the founder of fashion photography. In 1899 he married Olga Caracciolo, a professional beauty who introduced him to the highest levels of society. Once inside these glittering social circles, de Meyer was able to photograph many of the celebrities he met. His delicate, impressionistic idiom is characteristic of the photographic style most fashionable at the turn of the century. His images were published in Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s Camera Work in 1908, and he later worked for American Vogue and its rival magazine Harper\u2019s Bazaar.",
