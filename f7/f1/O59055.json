Most have been re-upholstered or at least re-covered at least three or four time.  This chair and its pair show both their original top covers and the plump, rounded shape of the back and seat that would have been fashionable in France in the 1760s.  \n\nThe top cover is a wool velvet.  The legs, seat and back all show the curving lines of the fashionable Rococo style and even the fabric uses serpentine lines of foliage to create a sinuous, trellis.   Underneath the chair you can see the original webbing.  This is set close together, as French webbing always has been, showing no gaps and requiring no base cloth to support the horsehair.\n\nThe original colouring of both paint and textile has changed with time.  The overall scheme was based on greens, with black details in the velvet.  Much of the velvet has now decayed and shows the linen ground.",
