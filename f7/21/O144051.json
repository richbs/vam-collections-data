He seemed different to other boys but last night he said if I really loved him I'd go all the way. I didn't want to and it wasn't like I dreamed it would be. And afterwards he said goodbye but he didn't say he'd call me. I stayed home all day and he didn't phone. I don't think he loves me like he said he did last night or how could he do this to me? I feel so ashamed I wanted to wait until I was married. Now I can't face anybody and all the boys will KNOW. I don't know what to do, I love Frank so much my heart will break if he won't see me. / PLEASE DON'T TELL. / Your friend / Sue.",
