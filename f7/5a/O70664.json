A satchel hangs at his left side from a strap over his right shoulder. He wears a robe ornamented with a vertical line of five whelk shells; round his shoulders and draped over his arms he wears a cloak. He is barefooted. His eyelids are carved. \n\nThe saint's head has been broken off and repaired. His nose has been damaged and part of his beard chipped. His right hand is missing. The panel is roughly cut away at the top. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Traces of red remain on the folds of the cloak. The satchel is black with a green strap. The hat is black. The back of the panel bears two lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

A satchel hangs at his left side from a strap over his right shoulder and he wears a robe ornamented with a vertical line of five whelk shells around his shoulder. \n\nSaints are the heroes and heroines of Christian faith. In the 14th and 15th centuries, they were a popular subject for alabaster carvings. Religious themes penetrated private life, so devotional images of saints were sculpted not only for church interiors, but also for individuals to contemplate within the privacy of their homes.",
