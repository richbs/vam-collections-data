They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nNormandy has the greatest variety of crosses, some so elaborate as to be almost unrecognisable.  The croix de Saint-L\u00f4, also called a croix quadrille from its lozenge shape, has a cast openwork frame decorated with five conical mounts set with rock crystals, with smaller stones set around them.  It is the earliest of the characteristic Normandy crosses to have stones.  \n\nCroix de Saint-L\u00f4 were sometimes made of gold in the 18th century, but by the mid-19th century they were only made of silver.  They were originally always worn with a matching slide, but these are often lost.  The slide on this cross was made in Normandy in the early 19th century, but does not match the cross precisely.",
