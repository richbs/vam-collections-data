The powerful, many-headed serpent Kaliya had poisoned the waters of the river Kalindi and all creatures merely breathing the winds bearing its moisture were dying instantly. Krishna vanquished Kaliya, dancing on his hoods. Kaliya\u2019s wives are seen offering Krishna salutations. Kaliya was sent away to the ocean, but would be protected from his enemy, the eagle Garuda, by the marks of Krishna\u2019s feet.",
