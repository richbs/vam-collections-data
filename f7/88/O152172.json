In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nIn 1853, Jones moved to Belgium with his wife and daughter and lived there until the death of his wife in Brussels in 1856. This photograph by Jones shows several of the guild houses which surround the square. The corner of the grandest of the buildings, the City Hall, provides a frame for the left side of the image. Although the 17th century guild houses dominate the frame, the choice of composition is unusual in drawing the viewer down the street between the guild house and the city hall.",
