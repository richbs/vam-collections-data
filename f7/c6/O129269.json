In 1950 Jeanneret moved to India to oversee the project and he designed this chair for his own house. As with the new city's buildings, the furniture made for Chandigarh tempered European modernist design ideals with Indian traditions of craftsmanship and materials.  The two-legged cantilevered frame relates the chair to tubular steel chairs of the 1920s and 1930s, but it is rendered here in timber. The seat, suspended on chains, is an original but somewhat awkward idea. Although Le Corbusier was seldom at Chandigarh himself, Jeanneret lived and worked there, as did the British architects Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry.  He gave them this chair and its pair, together with a related settee.",
