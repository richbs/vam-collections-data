The stands are carved in low relief with floral scrolling and are lacquered black. The vases are painted on a brick-red ground with a design of palaces and a bamboo grove among hills, executed predominantly in green and gold with touches of blue and scarlet. The scenes are identical. The interiors are roughly finished with the uneven termination of the brick-red lacquer visible.\nThe style imitates that of late Qing and 20th century 'bodyless' lacquers from Fuzhou on a fabric core, but these examples are clearly on wood, probably machine turned. A wood grain is visible through the lacquer and can be felt inside the neck of each vase. The rather perfunctory painting and poor quality of finish mark them as not the best quality of contemporary Fuzhou lacquer. They are evidence of the penetration of lacquer workshops by techniques of mass production. \nCompare W.462-1992, W.141-1928 and W.142-1928  for examples of the true Fuzhou fabric-core lacquer technique.\nThe objects are accompanied by half of a cardboard box, giving details in Chinese of the product type, but with no information on factory or price.\nThe donor, Sun Yiqing, Director of the Bureau of Cultural Relics led the Chinese delegation to the 1983 ICOM conference, and visited the Museum on 28th July 1983, when the vases were presented to the Director. See RPs for further details of the visit.",
