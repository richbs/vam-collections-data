On the death of his brother Federico, Duke of Mantua, in 1540, Cardinal Ercole became regent and Giulio Romano's principal patron.The inscription on the drawing is in a hand similar to Giulio's. An inscription on the back of the drawing states that the sheet was in the collection of the Duke of Argyll in 1798 and quotes the number P.77, no. 51.\n\nGiulio\u2019s greatest technical skill was demonstrated in his drawings, which are notable for their incisiveness and abundance of invention. His formidable talent as a designer was most successfully realized in his architectural projects and in the ensemble of his complex decorative programmes. The immediate influence of his work was marked in the architectural treatises of Andrea Palladio and Sebastiano Serlio and in the move towards an increasing elaboration of illusionistic fresco painting.",
