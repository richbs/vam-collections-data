During the Jacobite rising of 1715, he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle on suspicion of sympathy for the Stuart cause. The lid's interior holds a miniature on ivory of Venus, Cupid and a putto probably based on a painting by the Rococo artist Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741).\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
