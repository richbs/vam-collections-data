These necklaces could hang down as far as the bride\u2019s knees, and were decorated with heavy religious medallions.  The weight was so great that the bride usually tied the necklace to her dress with ribbons to make it easier to wear.  \n\nLike all traditional jewellery, the design of this necklace is very conservative.  The shape of the beads dates back to the time of Moorish rule in Spain.  Similar tubular beads with castellated tops were worn with traditional urban costume in Morocco up to the 20th century.  The religious pendants are 17th century in style, and some may be that old.  They each carry the attributes of different saints, or images of the Virgin from specific pilgrimage centres.  The wearer hoped they would support and protect her.",
