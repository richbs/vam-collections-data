Unlike in most other European countries, women were just as likely to wear them as men.  Both sexes wore them in extravagant quantities, along the seams of jackets and trousers and in bunches at the wrist, as well as to fasten clothes.  Although filigree buttons were the most typical, many regions used buttons made of sheet metal as well.   \n\nThey were rarely sewn directly on to the clothing.  In some places people fastened them to their costume with a strip of leather, which ran through the button loops inside the garment.  More commonly they used T-shaped toggles permanently attached to the button.  \n\nWomen's buttons tend to be larger and more decorative than those worn by men.  These heavy buttons were worn by women, in sets of three or more on each sleeve, at the cuffs of their jacket.  The long link was needed to stretch across the fullness of the blouse worn underneath.",
