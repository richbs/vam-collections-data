The scroll is an example of Korean folk painting (minhwa) and demonstrates the kaleidoscope of colour and exuberance of form typical of the genre. Found in the formal settings of palaces as well as in the homes of aristocrats and commoners, folk paintings have a strong connection with the lives of ordinary people. \n\nDuring the Choson period (1392\u20131910), folk paintings took as their subjects a wide range of motifs. The subject matter depended on the sex, age and social standing of the person in whose room the painting was to be displayed. Paintings of birds and flowers often decorated women\u2019s quarters, whereas images of books and scholars\u2019 utensils were appropriate for a scholar\u2019s study. The pine-and-crane motif occurs frequently in East Asian art and is associated with longevity. In this case, the paired cranes may symbolise a wish for a happy marriage.",
