The reasons why swaddling continued in use for so long are probably practical.\nIt held the infant\u2019s limbs straight as they grew, since they were fixed in position (sometimes with rigid materials such as a backboard) in a very similar way to a broken limb which has been splinted.   It was also affordable even by poorer families, and fitted infants of all sizes: the bands could be made from old sheets or clothing, the only fastenings were pins and tying tapes, and as the baby grew, it was simple to add extra bands.  And it kept the baby out of danger, because the lack of movement kept it safe in its cradle, and prevented it from falling out, falling into the fire, or being attacked by animals.\n\nSwaddling also kept babies contented \u2013 the firm wrapping and the warmth it produced were soothing. But doctors and midwives protested against the practice, alleging that it restricted growth and digestion.  And it certainly made it much harder to keep babies clean, since all the wrappings had to be removed just to change one nappy, and the dirty wrappings must have been very unpleasant to handle.",

She was given them by her mother and they have been in her possession ever since. \nIn 1957 when Mirella was 13 she moved, with her parents, to live in England. The shawl was hand crocheted by Mirella's mother, Italia Vella, and was worn around 1950 when Mirella was about 6 years old and so would have been worn when the family were still living in Alexandria.",
