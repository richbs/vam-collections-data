If you look closely you will see that it has twice as many corners on the rim as it does on the base. \n\nIt is a product of the San Lorenzo studio in Milan. Formed in 1970, the year before this vase was designed, the studio set out to create new contemporary designs in sterling silver. The small group of architect-designers that formed its nucleus aimed to produce high-quality designs. They created a select band of products in batch production runs, with a strong emphasis on finely detailed design and workmanship.\n\nThe husband and wife team of Tobia Scarpa (b.1935) and Afra Bianchin (b.1937), who designed this vase, both studied architecture in Venice. Their work shows a deep understanding of materials and empathy for traditional Italian craftsmanship. They have collaborated on designs for leading Italian manufacturers, including furniture for Gavina, lighting for Flos and cutlery for San Lorenzo. Their architectural commissions include showrooms and factories (one for Benetton in 1964), and public spaces.",
