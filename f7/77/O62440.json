New developments in commercial printmaking meant that her work could be reproduced directly by photomechanical means, as a colour half tone. This process became more widely available from about 1900, and her work was reproduced by this means and by monochrome line-blocks in a total of over 130 publications.\n\nPeople\nJessie M. King was a Scottish illustrator, painter, designer and writer. She studied at the Glasgow School of Art and taught book decoration there from 1899 to 1908. She was one of the most successful and productive practitioners of the Glasgow style and is best known for her book illustrations and covers.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe artist has used a stylised manner in her drawing, which emphasises the gentle fantasy of the subject. The drawing was eventually used as an illustration to Seven Happy Days, poems by her contemporary, the Scottish poet John Davidson, and others, published by The Studio as a New Year Supplement in 1914.",
