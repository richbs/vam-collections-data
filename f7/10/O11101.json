Backed with roller-printed plain weave cotton and faced with bias-cut woven silk.  Much of the ground has been re-worked in tambour stitch.  This means that the backing was not in placed while the tambour stitch was worked; it is probable that the roller printed cottons are of a later date.\nBlack ground with diagonal lines of 4-pointed stars each containing a swastika with a diamond centre.  The colours of the lines alternate.  From lower left to upper right: [1] blue star with white swastika and dark red star with white swastika; [2] pink star with dark blue swastika and orange star with cream swastika.\nBorder: blue ground with a line of pink cartouches and dark red octagonal stars.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; orange, blue, dark blue, dark red, pink, black, white, cream and possibly other shades of off-white.\nBacking: two pieces of roller printed cotton.  The larger section has a white ground almost entirely covered with grey leaves with small dark red flower heads.  The smaller piece also has a white ground with tiny flower heads with red centres and dark purple leaves and purple coral-like patterns.\nFacing: striped woven silk: [a] white ground with two types of small floral sprig in pink and green [b] red ground with two different small floral sprigs in green.  There are narrow yellow and green stripes between [a] and [b].",
