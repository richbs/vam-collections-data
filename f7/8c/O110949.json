The red 'zami' (field) is diapered with 'butis' comprising of rows of peacocks in alternate white and yellow with green and black bands on the tail. Both 'pars' (outer borders) and 'anchala' (end) have 'buttis' in stylized flower patterns in green and yellow. The inner borders of red 'anchala' (end) have motifs depicting a European couple seated facing each other in a horse-drawn carriage with a driver holding a whip. The carriage carries a 'mayur-dhvaja' (peacock flag) - a symbol appeared on a chariot in the mythology. The entire motif is repeated to form horizontal and vertical border processions, defined by another border system of repeating rosettes. In the centre of the section there is a 'butti' of 'naksha' (pattern) known as 'kalka' (paisley). The colour scheme of 'anchal' is purple, blue, yellow and white. This type of silk brocade sari is known as 'Baluchar Buttidar' sari.",
