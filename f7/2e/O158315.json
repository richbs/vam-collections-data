The Akalis were a militant sect easily recognisable by their tall conical turbans decorated with quoits and metal ornaments.  The artist, William Carpenter, was the son of William Hookham Carpenter, Keeper of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum, and the portraitist, Margaret Sarah Geddes. He went to India in 1850 to paint portraits and made studies of scenery and daily life, remaining there for seven years. He was in Amritsar in 1854 and there painted views of the Golden Temple. Carpenter exhibited his watercolours in the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) in 1881 and the Museum has a large collection of his work. This painting was one of 134 by Carpenter bought by the Museum in 1882. Other Carpenter watercolours had been acquired in 1881 and another was acquired in 1885.",
