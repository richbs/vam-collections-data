The following is the full text of the entry: GIARDINI, GIOVANNI (1646-1722) 706 Design for a hanging chandelier decorated with the armorial devices (star and cima) of Pope Clement XI (Albani; 1700-21) Inscribed in ink in an old hand 'D. Parodi' Pen and ink and wash 31 x 131 (787 x 336) D.1372-1891 PROVENANCE Bought 1891 The drawing, attributed to Domenico Parodi in the old inscription, was bought from the same dealer (a few years later) as a number of other drawings attributed to Parodi (nos. 1061-1083), and it may have belonged to the same collection. But it is different from the other Parodi drawings in handling. The design itself is very like some of those in Giardini's book of engraved designs Disegni diversi inventati e delineati da Giovanni Giardini da Forli Argentiere del Palazzo Apostolico ... Dedicata alla ... Papa Clemente XI. Intagliati in Roma da Massimiliano Giuseppe Limpach da Praga, 1714. (Schmitz, no. 1141. Another edition printed in Rome 1750 under the title Promptuarium Artis Argentariae, which is in the Department). A characteristic feature that the drawing shares with the engraved designs is the incense-burner on top of the chandelier. Apart from the dedication to the Pope, several designs in the book are decorated with his arms. Two of the designs for chandeliers are illustrated in P. Jessen, Meister des Ornamentstiches, Berlin, 1923, vol. 2, pis. 66-67. The Kunstbibliothek in Berlin has a series of preparatory drawings by Giardini for Disegni diversi. The most useful recent writings on him are C. Grigioni, Giovanni Giardini da Forli, Rocca San Casciano, 1963 and A. Lipinsky, 'Arte orafa a Rome: Giovanni Giardini da Forli' in Arte illustrata, 4 Nov-Dec 1971, pp. 18-35 (with extensive bibliography).",
