The character of Don Felix was one of David Garrick's best-loved roles and one that he first  performed with Ann Barry on 20 October 1768, and for that last time at Drury Lane Theatre on 10 June 1776. \n\nDavid Garrick (1717-1779) was one of the greatest actors of his age, and the manager of the Drury Lane from 1747.  Ann Barry (1733-1801) was the actress Ann Dancer who worked with the actor Spranger Barry in Dublin and became his second wife in about 1768. Her first London engagement was in 1766 at Drury Lane Theatre playing Desdemona to Barry's Othello and when Spranger Barry rejoined the company in 1767, Barry and Mrs. Dancer became a familiar partnership on stage. Before long, however, the familiar pattern of hostility between Garrick and Barry resumed, fuelled by the increasing unreliability of both Barry and his wife. She married after the death of Spranger Barry in 1777 but is buried in Westminster Abbey beside her best-loved husband Spranger Barry.",
