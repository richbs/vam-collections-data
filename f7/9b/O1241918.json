It was drawn and signed by the artist Ralph Geaver and was probably created for reproduction in The Illustrated London News. \n\nThe Coxcomb is a comedy written by Beaumont and Fletcher in the early seventeenth century and published in the first folio of their work in 1647. It was acted at court on several occassions and at least twice by the King's Men in March 1622 and November 1636.\n\nThe Illustrated London News was the world's first illustrated weekly  newspaper. Founded by Herbert  Ingram, in 1842 the first edition  was sold on 14th May 1842 at a  cost of sixpence per copy. Building  from an original circulation of 26,000 to in excess of 300,000 at its  peak, The Illustrated London News remained in print until 2003 and commissioned illustrations from many of the leading artists of the late nineteenth century.  Photographs were used alongside illustrations from the late 19th century onwards but illustrations were a major feature of paper until after the end of the First World  War.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
