Central and marginal string-holes are decorated but not pierced and on the obverse of each folio the central hole only is marked.  Folio numbers are written in the lower right-hand corner of the reverse of each folio but are defective from folio 85 onwards due to insect damage.

            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThis folio has an image on each side. The recto or front side (IS.46:13r-1959) shows  the goat- or antelope-headed divine general Harinaigamesin removing Mahavira's embryo from the womb of Devananda. It is labelled 'Garbhaharana' (carrying off from the womb). The verso (IS.46:13v-1959) shows Harinaigamesin  bringing the embryo to Rani Trishala, who was to give birth to Mahavira, and is labelled 'Garbhasamcaram' (placing the foetus in the womb). Mahavira, the 24th Jina, had been conceived by Devananda, a woman of the Brahmin (priestly) caste.  Indra (Shakra), king of the gods,  believed such a family to be unsuitable for a future Great Man. He therefore commanded Harinaigameshin to transfer Mahavira\u2019s embryo into the womb of Rani Trishala, a woman of the Kshatriya caste of rulers and warriors, who was considered a suitable mother.",
