The great cost of these trimmings meant that they were often specified in inventory descriptions of furniture.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSince the purpose of these  trimmings was to enhance the visual effect of furniture and hangings, they were usually made in eye-catching materials, gold and silver thread or brightly-coloured silks. Contrasts in pattern and texture were achieved by building up layers, often in quite complex three-dimensional forms. Sometimes the trimmings were imported from France and Italy, but they were also made in London.",
