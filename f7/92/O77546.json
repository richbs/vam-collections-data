Used for holding the large numbers of pins required to fasten clothing, they were often richly embellished.  Along with expensive combs, brushes, and scents, the pin cushion adorned a lady's dressing table.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis pin cushion is decorated in canvaswork.  Worked in wool, it was a popular form of embroidery, particularly for furnishings such as wall hangings, cushion covers and table carpets.  For smaller items, like this pin cushion, silk, silver and silver-gilt threads were often used on a ground of finely woven linen.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe pin cushion bears a pattern of thistles, gilly flowers (carnations), cornflower, rose, borage with a squirrel, birds and insects.  These naturalistic forms were typical of the period and match similar designs that decorated clothing.",
