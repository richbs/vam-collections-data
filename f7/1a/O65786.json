The Birth of Bodhisattva Siddhartha  in the Lumbini Grove, near Kapilavastu.  His mother, Maya stands beneath the Sala- tree, supported by her sister Mahaprajapati, whilst Indra receives the Infant upon a cloth. Behind him, somewhat squeezed in appears the worshipping Brahma.  In the sky are two celestial drums.\n2. Prince Siddhartha leaving Kapilavastu upon the horse Kanthaka in the company of his squire Chandaka.  Yakshas uphold the horse 's feet to avoid any noise which could wake the palace guards.  Mara and his tempters stand in front of the Bodhisattva attempting to turn him from his act of renunciation.\n3. The First Sermon or Turning the Wheel of the Law in the Deer-park at Sarnath bear Benares.  The Buddha is seated on a square throne in lotus position, surrounded by his five former companions (monks) with shaven heads.  His right hand rests symbolically upon the edge of a wheel.\n4. The Death of Parinirvana of the Buddha in the Grove of Sala-trees near Kushinagara.  In the centre the Buddha lies, turned on his right side upon a draped couch.  By his head stands the Vajrapani, and at his feet stands the aged Mahakashyapa with his hands resting on the Buddha's feet.   Behind the couch are the figures of two mourning Malla\nnobles.  At each corner of the socket is a square column with foliate capital.",
