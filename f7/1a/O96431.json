            "public_access_description": "Lady Armatrude Waechter de Grimston originally commissioned the toilet set from which this box comes. It was one of John Paul Cooper\u2019s biggest and most successful commissions in shagreen. (Shagreen was originally a species of untanned leather, but from about 1750 nurse sharkskin or the less expensive dogfish skin was used.) The chased decoration of the silver mounts has an aquatic theme, which recalls Cooper's description of shagreen:\n\na material possessing some of the qualities of both mother of pearl and leather. Its little nodules of concentric rings give one, when the skin is particularly translucent, the feeling of looking deep down into a pool of sea green water . . . One can't do much with a thing like that - put a silver bank round it, I mean a silver moulding, that is practically all.\n\nThe chased decoration on the Waechter service is a visual translation of this description. It shows how strongly marine imagery stirred Cooper's imagination. On the mounts he represented the shagreen's murky depths - fish, lobsters, crabs, shells and seaweed. He had made preparatory studies for the designs during a family holiday in Sheringham, Norfolk, in 1927.",
