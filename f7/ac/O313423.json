In the foreground a  scythe lies in a wheat field which has been partly harvested. At the left foreground wheat grows, in the middle distance the wheat has been tied in stooks and in the distant landscape graves marked by crosses are depicted.\nBaudichon's choice of the doubel-sided plaquette format for this medal may have been influenced by the work of Oscar Roty (1846-1911), whose revival of the Renaissance plaquette allowed compositions of a more pictorial treatment than was possible within the format of the circular medal. This, together with his use of both faces was a major innovation and by the end of the 19th century the tradition of a circular format was broken.",
