It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums. \n\nLeslie Caron trained as a dancer and then an actress, appeared in her first film An American in Paris, in 1951. She starred in the film Gigi and left Hollywood in 1956 to appear in England in the stage version of Gigi directed by Peter Hall, whom she later married.",
