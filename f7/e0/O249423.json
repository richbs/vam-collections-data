The objects of the Society were stated as being 'to promote improvements in the administration of Law, education, public health and social economy'. The inaugural meeting was held on 12 October 1857, Lord Brougham in the chair.\n\nBrougham was a man of exceptional talent and was renowned as a scholar, lawyer, philosopher, economist, wit, orator and clown. He was very much an individualist and because of this his public life was, perhaps, disappointing although he achieved high office. Despite his many interests he found time in 1838 to design the single horse close carriage which was named after him. It proved safe and economical and became widely used as a town carriage.\n\nJoseph Moore was a British engraver and medallist who already at ten years of age convinced his parents to let him earn his own living and entered the office of a then well-known silversmith.",

The objects of the Society were stated as being 'to promote improvements in the administration of Law, education, public health and social economy', The inaugural meeting was held on 12 October 1857, Lord Brougham in the chair.\nBrougham was a man of exceptional talent and was renowned as a scholar, lawyer, philosopher, economist, wit, orator and clown. He was very much an individualist and because of this his public life was, perhaps, disappointing although he achieved high office. Despite his many interests he found time in 1838 to design the single horse close carriage which was named after him. It proved safe and economical and became widely used as a town carriage.",
