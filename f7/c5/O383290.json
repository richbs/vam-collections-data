The protective (amuletic) properties of ironstone need to be investigated further and any information on them would be welcome.\n\nThe previous identification was toadstone.  The toadstone is a round, brownish-grey stone made from the fossilised tooth of an extinct fish related to the ray.  In the Middle Ages its source was unknown, and it was believed to come from the head of a toad.  From late Roman times until almost the 18th century it was considered a very powerful amulet against poison and wounds from venomous reptiles.  Although it could be swallowed (and subsequently retrieved) to counteract existing poisons in the body, it was more commonly mounted as an amulet, usually in a ring.  The back was often left open, as here, so that the stone would have contact with the wearer's skin.  The stone was believed to sweat in the vicinity of any dangerous substance, and could also be placed against a bite or other wound.",
