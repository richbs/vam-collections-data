It also challenges the idea that they may have been relegated to the nursery - Margaret Alsager\u2019s house is in the parlour, a relatively public space. \n\nIt is also interesting that a twelve year old girl was given enough status and agency to sign her own name on a contract with her father. This contract gave her responsibilities and checked her desire to light fires within the toy house, but it also conferred rights. It is reminiscent, in that way, of the Codes of Conduct often drawn up by and for schoolchildren today.",
