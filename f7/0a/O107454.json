            "public_access_description": "This bust representing Anne Churchill, Countess of Sunderland, was made by David le Marchand in England, in about 1699.\n\nDavid Le Marchand (1674-1726) was famed for his ivory carvings, particularly his portraits. He was a native of Dieppe, France, and came from a Huguenot, or Protestant, family. With the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and the consequent persecution of non-Catholics, he had to flee France. He was next recorded in Edinburgh in 1696, where he is documented as receiving official permission to open a shop and take on apprentices. He was in London by 1700, when he started to achieve a reputation for his portraits. Despite his  wide circle of important patrons and  his evident success, Le Marchand apparently died in poverty, though the exact reasons for this are unknown\n\nAnne Churchill was the second daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who was also portrayed by Le Marchand (see cat. no. ** A.5-1950). Three portrait busts of her are known (see Avery 1996, pp. 66-7). None is dated, and Avery has speculated they may date from around the time of her wedding in 1699. Avery has also compared this bust to a later bust by Michael Rysbrack (1694-1770) of Lady Margaret Cavendish-Holles-Harley (Avery 1999, loc. cit.). Horace Walpole recalled that Anne was the most beautiful of Sarah Churchill's 'four charming daughters\u2019, and that she 'was a great politician' (cited in Avery 1996, p. 66).",
