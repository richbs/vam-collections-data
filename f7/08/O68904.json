Above the Virgin and Child is a canopy, the curtains of which are held back by two further angels.  God the Father is shown in benediction at the apex of the scene.  The relief is made in one with its elaborate surround, which comprises an arched central section supported by pairs of spiral columns, with decorated spandrels.  Round the edges are strips of gothic tracery and in the centre at the bottom is a shield (argent, a moor's head erased proper facing dexter and wreathed with a band of the first charged with three letters T sable).  A further strip of decoration at the base is truncated by the wooden frame.  There are traces of gilding on the step of the throne and blue paint in the background.",

The name of Michele da Firenze is found in a document of 1436 recording payment for the reliefs in the pellegrini Chapel and it may be assumed he was the Master of the workshop, in the productions of which various hands are discernable.
