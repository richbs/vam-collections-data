Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability for improvisation and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest. Various visiting Italian troupes performed in France in the 16th century where their type of theatre was called the Com\u00e9die-Italienne. By the 17th century however their plays were being performed largely in French, and by the 18th century Commedia dell'Arte was a recognised part of the French theatre.\n\nThis figure is modelled after an engraving in the Balli di Sfessania, 1621, by the French artist Jacques Callot (1592-1635) who lived in Italy where he made numerous drawings of court entertainments and public festivities.",
