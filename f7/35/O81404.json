Copied works by George Morland, and studied watercolour painting with John Varley. Entered RA Schools 1805. Associated with William Henry Hunt, William Mulready, Dr Thomas Monro, and later William Blake. In a long and prolific career, he exhibited 176 works at the RA between 1807 and 1881, 91 at the BI 1808-59, and 52 watercolours at the OWS (Member 1812, Treasurer 1817). Subjects mainly portraits up to the late 1840s, then landscapes. Worked also in engraving, etching and mezzotint. Surprisingly, he submitted his name unsuccessfully for election to ARA 1821, and withdrew 1842; the RA later offered him membership, which he refused. Died Redhill, Surrey, 20 January 1882; a memorial exhibition was held at the RA 1882-3. Three of his sons (James Thomas, William, and John junior) were also artists, and his daughter married Samuel Palmer. \nLIT: \tRedgrave Cent; Art]oumal1882, p262 (obit); A T Story Life ofJohn Linnell 2  vols, 1892 \n\nLandscape - Driving Cattle \n1407 -1869 Neg Y1306 \nPanel, 29.5 \u00d7 38.1 cm (11 5/8 \u00d7 15 ins)\nTownshend Bequest 1869 \nNot identifiable with any exhibited work. Hamerton comments that: \nLinnell's method of painting is a modern development of that of Rubens. The 'Landscape, Driving Cattle' at South Kensington is begun in rich transparent brown, and it seems likely that the browns of the earth were painted into whilst wet with greens and other colours. The sky is painted with a full brush in opaque pigments undisturbed after application, so that they retain the expressional power of the brush which Rubens so greatly valued ...
