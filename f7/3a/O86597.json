It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nWalter Hackett's play The Gay Adventure opened in London at the Whitehall Theatre in December 1931, with Nora Swinburne as Fay d'Allary and Eric Maturin as George Aram. It ran for 350 performance and visited Brighton for the week commencing 21 May 1932 as part of the post-London tour, with the actor-manager and dramatist Seymour Hicks in the starring role and Elizabeth Vaughan as Fay. Seymour Hicks began as an actor in 1887 and during his long career he appeared with equal success in both straight plays and musical comedies. He was knighted in 1935.",
