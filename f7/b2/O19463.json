It was hand-formed from earthenware clay, covered in transparent glaze and fired to about 800 degrees centigrade before being removed from the kiln with long-handled tongs. The red colour is due to oxidation of iron in the clay body.\n\nBernard Leach (1887-1979), the well-known British potter at whose St Ives workshop this bowl was made, first became interested in ceramics when he saw Raku ceramics being made at a garden party in Tokyo in 1911. On returning to England in 1920 and setting up his workshop with the help of the Japanese potter Hamada Shoji (1894-1978), he made a  range of ceramics including stoneware, slipware and Raku ware. His seminal 'A Potter's Book', published in 1940, gives extensive information about how to make Raku wares and includes a drawing showing how he used the top shelf of his updraught kiln to fire them. This was different from the Japanese practice of using small, dedicated muffle kilns in which objects were fired singly or in small batches of two or three.",
