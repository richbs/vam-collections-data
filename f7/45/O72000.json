Characteristically, Neo-Romantic work focuses on landscape or on figures in a landscape with tendencies, more or less, toward abstraction. Vaughan was influenced particularly by the Picasso and Matisse exhibitions held at the V&A in 1946. Shortly after the Second World War had ended, a number of initiatives were developed to encourage contemporary artists to create colour prints. A demand for them grew, resulting in an explosion of popular printmaking in the late 1950s and 1960s. This is the first in a series of  nine lithographs by Vaughan published by the Redfern Gallery, London, between 1949 and 1956, by which time he had an international reputation.",
