Lerner and Frederick Loewe, at the Oxford New Theatre in December 1965.  It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nTony Britton was considered one of cinema's most good-looking actors when his film career took off in the 1950s, but when film roles weren't forthcoming, embarked on a two-and-a-half year stage tour of My Fair Lady in the 1960s.  He became best known nationally in the 1970s and 1980s in television's Robin's Nest and Don't Wait Up.",
