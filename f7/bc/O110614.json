A minute of 18 April 1903 signed A.B. Skinner recommends the purchase of this knife among several items of cutlery describing it as \"being of extreme rarity\" and likely to \"fetch a high price\".  The agents through which the knife was sold, Durlacher Bros. of 142 New Bond Street, estimated it would fetch \u00a360 although the Museum secured it for \u00a325.7s.1d (including agent's fee). The provenance of the knife until 1903 is not known.\n\nHistorical significance: Notation knives are extremely rare. A note in the Object Register refers to:\n\n\"Three knives from the same set in the Foulc Collection, Philadelphia Museum. Another (?one of these) illustrated in <u>L'Art pour tous</u>, Vol. XII (1873), No. 307, p. 1228: in collection of <u>'M. Allain de Pont l'Eveque'</u>.\"\n\n\"Two others were sold in the Bourgeois Freres Sale, Cologne 1904 (Cat. Vol. I, No. 867). Another knife with a similar blade but different handle was in the Spitzer Collection (Cat. Vol. III, P.239, No. 144). All appear to be French (c.f. Museum knives nos. M604, 624, 627-1710; 2132-1855)\"\n\nA further handwritten note by Claude Blair, former Head of Metalwork (1974-82), says, \"Another knife is in the Municipal Museum, The Hague. CB.\"",
