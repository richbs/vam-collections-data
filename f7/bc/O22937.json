Starting as a modernist in America in the 1960s he had, by the 1980s, acquired a reputation as one of the leading exponents of the 'English Country House' look in interior decoration. This artfully casual style seeks to recreate the cluttered look of interiors filled with a wide range of furniture and objects acquired by inheritance, all tied together by a lavish use of patterned textiles. Having emerged as an exclusive fashion in the 1950s, it was in the 1980s taken up by high street furnishing companies such as Laura Ashley, whose international marketing helped to establish it around the world as the essence of British design.\n[Stephen Astley, 'British Design at Home', p.163]",
