Off-white silk thread has been used for most of the quilting but blue silk was used through the facing.\nColours: two shades of red, blue, brown, black.\nThe central decorative panel has an off-white ground with a central medallion consisting of  eight lobed segments outlined in blue emerging from a central red multi-petalled flower head.  Each segment contains a blue flowering stem.  There is a diagonal cypress  tree and vase in each corner with two pairs of birds.  The rest of the ground is patterned with off-set bands of botehs and flowering stems.\nThere are four borders: the innermost is crowded with floral motifs; the main border has a floral meander with a blue stem and exotic blossoms in red, brown and blue.  The outer border is a repeat of the inner, and the outermost border has reciprocal trefoils in blue and white.\nA narrow sleeve has been added on the back along the top and bottom, for display purposes.",
