Although in outline the same shape as a drinking glass, the bowl is all but solid, allowing only a minimal lick. Made in the mid-19th century, at a time when cheap, press-moulded glass was beginning to become the most available type, a hand-made but undecorated  artefact such as this was still extremely marketable.\n\nOwnership & Use\nUsed in cafes, seaside booths and places of entertainment, a smear of ice was spread on the surface and licked off by the customer. The glass was then returned to the seller for immediate use by the next customer.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis 'lick' is made in strong, brilliantly clear lead glass.  Hand-blown and tooled, the 'bowl' is virtually solid. Each section of the foot, stem and bowl is made from extra glass added at various stages, and probably at least two people were involved in the making of this glass.",
