Under Yoshimitsu the Zen principles of restraint, understatement, economy of movement and frugality of expression became incorporated into the performance. By the early seventeenth century Noh had become an even more austere and formalised drama reserved almost exclusively for the military elite.\n\nThe Noh mask of Imawaka (literally \u2018now young\u2019) represents a young man of noble birth. In the carving of the mask the eyes look down, and furrows above the nose bridge evoke a melancholy nature. A black rim at the top of the mask indicates the base of a courtier's cap and parallel horizontal side hairs suggest hair pulled back and bound in the samurai style called chonmage. The mask is used for various roles in Noh including the ghost of the courtier and poet Ariwara no Narihira in the play \u2018Unrin\u2019in\u2019 (Unrin Temple) or the warrior-poet Yorimasa in the play \u2018Ominaeshi\u2019.",

From his studio in Kobe, Suzuki continued a tradition which stretches back over some 600 years creating Noh masks both for performance and exhibition. Suzuki has donated a number of masks since 1987 thereby enhancing the V&A\u2019s collections of masks which began in 1876 when we acquired 12 masks from Samuel Bing. \n\nDuring February and March 2002 in the Toshiba Gallery at the V&A, as part of the Japan 2001 Festiva, Suzuki displayed 12 masks in the exhibition \u2018The Spirit of Transformation: the Noh masks of Suzuki Nohjin\u2019 and subsequently donated six masks (FE.127 to 132-2002). \n\nIt was typical of Suzuki\u2019s friendship with the V&A that even on his death-bed that among his last thoughts he instructed a bequest of No masks \u2013 including a mask of Okina, a type that I had mentioned to Suzuki many years ago that we would dearly love to have in our collection.",
