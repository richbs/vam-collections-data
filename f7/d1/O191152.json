The leaf is labeled with the logo of the independent trade union Solidarity. The tree can be interpreted as a symbol of Poland ruined by the communist regime. The leaf, as a symbol of hope and the last remnant of life, represents Solidarity\u2019s opposition to the regime. In the context of the semi-free elections in 1989 when Solidarity was allowed to put its candidates forward for the first time, the message of the poster suggests that electing Solidarity is the last chance for Poland to avoid a complete decline.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
