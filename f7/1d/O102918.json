The family was originally French but moved to America in 1824. She married the Marquis (later Duc) de Choiseul in 1891 and moved to France. She enjoyed a close friendship with Rodin from about 1904 until he ended their relationship in 1912. Before then, she had dominated many aspects of his life, cutting him off from his friends and relations and taking control of his business dealings, especially with the U.S.A. She was responsible for introducing Rodin to the American millionaire Thomas Ryan, who was instrumental in introducing his work to the USA. (See Museum no. A.48-1914).  In effect, the Duchess became Rodin's agent, conducting negotiations with potential buyers. \nBoth this portrait and its companion (Museum no. A.45-1914) are close studies of an intimate friend. They were not commissioned and have a great informalilty and vitality. Rodin was able to observe and draw the Duchess in a very natural way, capturing her lively personality. In this earlier version she is pensive, with her head to one side, unlike the later version where she smiles. In both versions, hair springs up unusually from her forehead; Marcelle Tirel, employed by Rodin at the time, reported that Rodin noticed she wore false hair. These are amongst the most intimate and informal of all Rodin's portraits.",
