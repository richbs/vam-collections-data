The outfit reflected a style of dress worn by West Indian men in Britain in the 1950s.  \n\nIn creating the outfit Lilliard was advised by Caribbean fabric suppliers, the tailor Mark Savile and members of his own family who came to Britain in the 1950s. In the Caribbean it was common for men to wear brightly-coloured, generously-cut suits on an everyday basis and they continued to do so when they emigrated. In addition to their flamboyant use of colour the cut of suits made in the Caribbean was distinctive: trousers were high-waisted, had low seats and baggy legs which tapered to the ankle.
