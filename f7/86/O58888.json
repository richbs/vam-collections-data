The melody was played on the upper strings and the accompaniment on the lower ones at the same time. Dismissed by Michael Praetorius (1571 - 1621), a German organist and composer, as an instrument used by cobblers and tailors, and its sound described by Samuel Pepys as 'barber's music', nevertheless Paolo Vurchi (1574) and Anthony Holborne (1597) composed sophisticated music for it. These instruments came in different sizes and this example is comparatively small, making it easier for the player to achieve long stretches with his left hand, as the music often demanded.",
