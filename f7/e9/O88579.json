He tended to work in black and white after the First World War. He always painted from imagination, combining fantasy and a sense of drama.  \n\nPap\u00e9 first illustrated fairytales in the 1890s, but became famous for his satirical illustrations in the 1920s, starting with James Branch Cabell's Jurgen. Jurgen was an ironic fantasy novel set in the middle ages, which, because of its erotic symbolism, was subject of an obscenity trial in 1919. When it was eventually published, in 1921, it sold out on the first day. Pap\u00e9's illustrations sparked a cult following for his work.",
