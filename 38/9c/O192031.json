At the Volkskammerwahl (Public Chamber election) the Green Party ran for office in an alliance' with the Independent Women's Federation.\n\nThis was the first major poster produced by the Greens after their formation in 1979 and was sold to raise funds for the party, it became a best seller. Grafik-Werkstatt, Bielefeld, also designed the sunflower symbol adopted by the Greens in 1979. The significance of the sunflower lies in the fact that it derives from a small seed which grows into a large flower.\n\nThe Green Party was founded in November 1989 out of the GDR green movement.\nPolitically the party was close to the different alliances of the Citizen's movements.\nIn 1993 the Green Party merged with the party B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen ('Alliance 90/The Greens').",
