The publication contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces. \n\n\nThe text accompanying the illustration (in the publication) reads as follows: \n\n'<i>THE FOSSANE is rather smaller than the Martin. Its body is slender, and covered with hair of an ash colour, mixed with tawny; the sides of the face are black; at the hind part of the head there are four black lines, extending from thence towards the shoulders; the tail is long, and annulated with black; its eye is full, round, and black, which gives it a wild and mischievous aspect. \nIt inhabits the island of Madagascar, Guinea, Cochinchina, and the Philippine Isles. It feeds on flesh and fruits, but prefers the latter, and is peculiarly fond of bananas. It is very fierce, and not easily tamed. \nIn Guinea, it is called </i>Berbe<i>; and, by Europeans, the </i>Wine-bibber<i>, being very greedy of palm-wine. \u2013 When young, its flesh is reckoned very good to eat.</i>' \n\nTaken from: Beilby, Ralph and Bewick, Thomas. <u>A General History of Quadrupeds</u>. Newcastle upon Tyne. Third Edition, 1792.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.",
