            "public_access_description": "Ernest Nister (1842-1909) began his publishing career in 1885 when he acquired a lithographic workshop in N\u00fcrnberg and printed books for London publishers. In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nG. H. Thomspon produced this illustration for the nursery rhyme, Ten Little Nigger Boys, published by Ernest Nister in London and E. P. Dutton & Co. in New York, ca.1900. The nursery rhyme is a counting rhyme, beginning with ten little boys and ending with one. This drawing illustrates the verses:\n\n'Three little nigger boys walking in the zoo;\nA big bear hugged one, and then there were two.'\n\nThis genre, which also included Ten Little Nigger Girls, was popular at the end of the 19th century.  The term 'nigger' was used in Europe and America to describe a person of black (sub-Saharan) African ancestry from the 17th century. It began to gain pejorative associations from the 1800s but was used in book titles of the 19th century without racist intent. The term is repeated here in its original historical context.",
