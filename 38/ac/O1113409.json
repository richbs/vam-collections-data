Together with Michael English he created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, including this one for The Incredible String Band> He also designed for concerts held at the UFO Club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. His artistic influences combined the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions with the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, Indian and East Asian interests and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nThe Incredible String Band were a Scottish band, popular with the British counterculture in the late 1960s. They were pioneers in psychedelic folk (a fusion of folk music and psychedelic rock), incorporating medieval and eastern instruments into their performances.",
