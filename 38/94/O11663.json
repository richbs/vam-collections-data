The pattern consists of widely spaced bands of red on a ground of light brown with a small chequer pattern in brown and white.  The neck was cut with a slit along the shoulder, which is not usual in Guatemala, and was bound with red felt and the blouse was fastened with press studs (removed in 1995). There are more warp threads per inch than weft threads, so that the white lines of the checked pattern are stronger along the warp.  There is close blanket stitch embroidery along the edges of the sleeves in yellow and red floss silk.\n\nTechnical Details:\nWarp: 49 threads per inch. (i) brown cotton; Z-spun, paired threads; (ii) red cotton; Z2Z; (iii) white cotton; Z-spun, paired threads; (iv) green cotton; Z3Z; (v) yellow cotton; Z2Z. The white warp threads (and the brown ones where they appear next to a red stripe) have been carried over the adjoining block of colour during warping - giving a small diagonal line along one edge of the lower front of the huipil.\nWeft: 24 threads per inch. White cotton and brown cotton, both Z-spun, paired threads.  There is a band of loosely packed weft about 2.5\" deep: in the left hand panel it is 3\" from the edge and in the right hand panel it is 2\" from the edge; both are at the back of the huipil.\nFront Edge: paired weft.\nBack Edge: paired weft.\n\nRed cotton dyed with Alizarin, patented in London and Germany in 1871.",

            "public_access_description": "this is a huipil (blouse) made from two pieces joined down the centre front and back.  There is embroidery with yellow and red floss silk in blanket stitch along the edges of the sleeves. The brown cotton is Gossypium Mexicanum, also known as Cuyuscate or Ixcaco. It is naturally brown and produces shorter fibres than the more common white cotton, consequently it is more difficult to spin, more expensive and more highly prized. It was largely replaced by dyed cotton in the 20th century.  \nThe neck was cut with a slit which runs along the shoulder, which is not usual in Guatemala, and was fastened with press studs.  These facts, and the relatively coarse oversewing used to make this huipil, suggest that it was purchased as separate panels, was completed by the Maudslays (the donors) and may have been worn by one of them.",
