These playful embellishments are typical for a label known for their combinations of textures and use of natural materials.\n\nThis garment represents an updating of the classic white T-shirt, a staple of adult and children\u2019s wardrobes. Favoured for its easy fitting shape and easy cleaning, the cotton t-shirt emerged in the nineteenth century, worn as a bottom layer in the Army, Navy, and by industrial workers. In this item, the rows of sequins complicate the t-shirts informal and work-wear associations, incorporating embellishments typically seen in eveningwear. This was a wide trend in fashions in 2010 to 2011, with sequins making statements across daywear lines.",
