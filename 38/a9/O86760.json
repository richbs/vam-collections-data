This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums. The performers dated the drawing, but since the paper has been trimmed, it is impossible to read.\n\nComedy double acts were popular in the early 20th century. The Lorenzi Brothers, although never stars, were one of hundreds of similar acts that toured the country performing in a multitude of music halls. As in so many comedy double acts, we can see from their make-up that the act consisted of the \u2018straight man\u2019 and his more comical friend. The more sober partner here has orange hair, although he is wearing evening dress. His foolish whiskered sidekick has large black eyebrows, a smile created with black make-up and half of his face painted white.",
