Heeding the protests of SCAPA (The Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising) against poster hoardings and obtrusive signs along the roadside, Shell began to attach posters to the sides and backs of lorries. Jack Beddington, publicity director of the amalgamated Shell-Mex and BP Ltd, commissioned well-known artists as well as specialist poster artists to produce these lorry bills. These bills were changed every few weeks, so many artists were involved. This particular poster campaign claimed that a wide range of people, from scientists to footballers, used Shell. The slogan \u2018You Can Be Sure of Shell\u2019 aimed to promote good will towards the company, and to assure the motorist that Shell was available throughout Britain.",
