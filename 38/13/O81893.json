In the form of a Griffin, resting upon two feet with an extra decorative support underneath his tail. The beast faces forward with wings folded. A design resembling a heraldic shield adorns each wing. The ewer would have been filled through the hole in the creature's tail (the lid is now missing) and poured through the mouth of the beast.\n\nThe griffin is a fantastical creature that combines the head and claws of a lion with the wings of an eagle. The western form of the griffin was influenced by the eastern <i>senmurvs</i>, images of which were woven into ancient Sassanian and Byzantine sillks imported into Europe.\n\nIn antiquity the griffin held a positive image as a protector and guardian. This continued into the Middle Ages particularly in Romanesque art, where sculptural forms of the griffin act as guardians on the facades of churches and cathedrals. The image of the griffin appeared less frequently in Gothic art.",

A companion to this piece is in the Kunsthistoriches Museum in Vienna. It is in the shape of a dragon and has very similar technical finish.\n\nSince its acquisition this piece has been considered an important work of medieval art. Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, nineteenth century Art Refereree, architect and journalist wrote \"so fine and historical a piece of metalwork seldom occurs for sale...designed and executed by a master of his craft (with) admirable <i>hardiesse</i>.\"\n\nThis ewer's Viennese counterpart inspired  nineteenth century versions in silver and ceramic. It also influenced other nineteenth century objects. A Claret Jug (M.20-1986) made in 1877 is believed to have a form derived from a Vienna Porcelain Chocolate pot (eighteenth century) which in turn was derived from the aquamanile in the Kunstshistoriches Museum. There is no evidence however, that the V&A ewer ever influenced nineteenth century art.",
