These interests are evident here in his child-like disregard for perspective or proper proportions - the figure, with its oversized features, fills the paper. Drawn with a ragged uneven line over a surface that has been stained, scratched and abraded, it looks like graffiti.",

In his artistic production Dubuffet sought contact with the common man. He rejected the artifice and sophistication of the work labelled 'Art' by the establishment. An outsider himself without art school training, he developed a passionate interest in an unselfconscious art untainted by social concessions, cultural limits or taboos: the art of children, psychotics, mediums, amateurs. He sought to establish the validity of an 'individual creation without precedent', an art that was rough, raw, compulsive. These works he classified as <i>Art Brut</i>, and he adapted aspects of it to his own work, consciously exploiting its freedom and naturalism.\n \n<i>Pavois D'Oreilles</i> ('Emblazoned With Ears') is a relatively late work but it demonstrates Dubuffet's continuing debt to <i>Art Brut</i>. The image is 'primitive' in the best sense, direct and vital: it is part of a tradition for seeking authenticity and inspiration in the primitive, the naive, the untutored, that goes back to Picasso and Gauguin. Physical realities are depicted without inhibition. and scale is distorted. \n\nThis frontally orientated vertical figure, its limbs placed symmetrically, is obviously related to the <i>Corps des Dames</i> of 1950-1, but the emphasis has changed. The deliberately imprecise contours of the figures in the earlier series have been replaced by a clearly defined silhouetted form, and the focus here is on head and limbs, not torso. Like a child Dubuffet emphasizes those features which have caught his eye or his imagination, and which for him, constitute the essence of his subject. \n\nDubuffet preferred amateur spontaneity to professional skill. He was fascinated by graffiti on walls ('the art of the ordinary man'). When he worked with oils he often incized the image into a thick layer of paint in direct imitation of graffiti. Even here, with only wash on paper, he has managed to create a good deal of textural interest. In the background the wash is uneven, puddled and thickened; on the figure a pale grey wash has been applied and then scrubbed and scratched to create a mottled effect in which the ground shows through. \n\nGillian Saunders\"\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1964.</u> London: HMSO, 1965.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<b>DUBUFFET, Jean (born 1901)</b> \n\nPavois d'oreilles. \n<i>Signed and dated</i> J.D. 61. <i>Inscribed on the back with the title and the date</i> 26 Aout 61. \n<i>wash drawing</i>     P.9-1964 \n\n<i>Note:</i>This drawing was in the 'Dubuffet' exhibition at the Robert Fraser Gallery, April to May 1962, No.41 (repr. frontispiece).\"",
