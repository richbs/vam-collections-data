He was billed as \u2018The Great Creole Artist! Absolutely the Creator of the Cake Walk, Billy Farrell, the Best in his Own Peculiar Line\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nBilly Farrell introduced the \u2018cake-walk\u2019 dance into American vaudeville at the Grand Opera House in Brooklyn in 1886, and a few years later into British music hall at the Alhambra Theatre. He was also a singer, associated with the songs \u2018Little Black Me\u2019 and \u2018The New Cake Walk\u2019. His association with the dance explains this image of him dancing with a cake, and its title, \u2018The Man Who Made the Cake Walk\u2019.",
