            "public_access_description": "The organ was the gift of Sir John Sutton to Jesus College Chapel, Cambridge. Sutton designed the organ, which was made by J.C. Bishop in 1849.  Pugin restored the chapel over the period 1846-1849. The case of the organ is designed by Pugin and its design is of great interest (see the physical description). The design may have been influenced by an article in 'The Ecclesiologist', IV, 1845, where this design in terms of the placing of the pipes and the wings was recommended. This organ is possibly the only known existing example of painted furniture in Pugin's oeuvre.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In \u2018Contrasts\u2019, published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
