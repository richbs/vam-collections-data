The wearer would pass the bands over the shoulder and attach them to buttons on his trousers.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBraces were fashionable from 1787 onwards.  At first they consisted of a pair of straps, often of morocco leather, passing over the shoulders and attached to a single button on each side in front and behind, to support the breeches. From 1825 a double-tongued design, whereby each strap was attached by two buttons in front and behind, began to be used. By 1850 the two straps were joined at the back, at the point where they crossed under the shoulder blades.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBraces were often made of silk, cotton, canvas or velvet with leather attachments. The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine of 1860 reported 'Braces form a necessary adjunct to a gentleman's wardrobe and they are generally pleased to have them prettily worked.' From 1857 to 1866 many braces were embroidered in Berlin woolwork of many colours. They were often worked by young ladies and presented as gifts to their menfolk. India rubber braces were sometimes worn in the 1850s. During the second half of the century the brace made with plain elastic web and double sliding ends became the conventional mode.\n\nPeople\nR.S. Surtees, in his book Hillingdon Hall (1844), describes a particularly colourful man's outfit: 'The Marquis [threw] back his pea-green cashmere coat lined with silk, ...  displaying his embroidered braces, pink rowing shirt and amber-coloured braces.'",
