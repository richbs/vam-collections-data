However, this particular doll is the English version made by Rosebud in the 1970s, which was bought by Mattel in 1966. The English doll spoke different phrases from the American version and had different accents. She was also made from a completely different mold and does not resemble any of the dolls made by Mattel in America. \n\nRevolutionary for its time, Cathy spoke when a ring was pulled from its upper back. The talking mechanism relied on a simple system of a phonograph needle, a tiny record and a tiny turntable. The English Cathy has a variety of 18 phrases including 'Let's go shopping' and 'I like chocolate'.",
