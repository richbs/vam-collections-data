            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis jug is of entirely conventional type, having a globular body, cylindrical neck and strap handle derived from the ubiquitous imported German stoneware beer mugs.\n\nCollectors & Owners\nExtremely few pieces of early delftware have been traced as belonging to the gentry, other than as examples acquired later by antiquarians to furnish their country houses. This jug, however, was discovered at Browsholme, Lancashire, home of the Parker family since at least the 17th century. The house was something of a time-warp: stacks of 18th-century Chinese armorial dinner plates survived in the dining room, while weapons and buckskin riding boots from the English Civil War were found in the hall. It is possible, therefore, that the V&A is only the second owner of this jug, an object designed for display.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlthough the London delftware industry was still in its infancy in 1620, it is apparent that experienced Netherlandish potters were reproducing the sophisticated wares that they had made in their homeland. Nothing like this successful combination of contemporary print-designs, painted fruit and foliage copied from Netherlandish and Italian maiolica and a range of vivid oxide colours had been been seen in England before.",
