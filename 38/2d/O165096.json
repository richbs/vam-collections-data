The dress textile itself is beautifully embroidered, and the lengths may have been intended for an Empress's chaopao (ceremonial robe) or jifu (formal robe). However, the robe may never have been worn by an Empress. It is possible that the robe might have been assembled at a much later date than when the dress lengths were made: the construction of the robe does not follow standard design, and the trims used on different parts of the robe suggest a latter-day intervention.",
