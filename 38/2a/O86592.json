The designer Ossie Clark used shiny satinised cotton for the sharply tailored ensemble. Its form-fitting silhouette and diagonally placed pockets accent the waist and hips. Ossie Clark was one of Britain's most influential fashion designers of the 1960s and 1970s. He was among the first to produce trouser suits for women. This particular suit was called 'Lamborghini' after the luxury car. The trousers are made from a Celia Birtwell print called 'Chinoisery'.",

This suit, christened 'Lamborghini', was one of his most successful designs, being worn by a number of models, It Girls, and faithful clients. Twiggy was photographed wearing hers. It was also modified for ready-to-wear as part of the first \"Ossie Clark For Radley\" collection the following year.\n\nWhile the cream satin jacket and black-ground \"Chinoisery\" print trousers (designed by Celia Birtwell) are the most famous incarnation of the Lamborghini, other, rarer variations appear with printed satin jackets and plain trousers, or both pieces being printed satin.\n\nHistorical significance: The 'Lamborghini' is the best-known example of Ossie Clark's tailoring. This cream satin jacket and chinoiserie style printed trousers, created in 1968, were worn by a number of Ossie's fans and loyal clients. Twiggy was photographed wearing hers.",
