They were often highly coloured, even if the image was intended to be reproduced as a print in black and white. This example was probably the first stage of making an aquatint  in an expensive magazine or book.  An aquatint is a kind of high quality etching, often hand-coloured. (An etching is produced by biting lines in a metal plate with acid to hold ink).\n\nPeople\nMary Linwood's copies of  old master paintings in crewel wool (named from the crewel or worsted wool used), in which the brush strokes were  rendered by stitches,  achieved great fame from the time of her first London exhibition in 1787.   On one occasion her copy of a painting by the Italian artist Salvator Rosa (1615-1673) was sold for more than the original. Her exhibition in Leicester Square, London,  was the first art show to be illuminated by gaslight. The  first commissioned work of the landscape artist John Constable (1776-1837)  was to paint the background details in one of her works. Linwood's portrait of Napoleon, said to have been done from life, was bequeathed to the V&A  at the same time as this picture.",
