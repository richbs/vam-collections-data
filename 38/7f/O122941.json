He moved to Paris in about 1851 as overseer for the Dumas stove and tile firm, and in 1855 opened his own studio and, later his own retail shop, with his brother Xavier. Deck specialised in researching glazes and colours inspired by the ceramics of the Middle and Far East and he made earthenware in many of these styles including Persian and Chinese as well as imitations of  cloisonn\u00e9 enamels and 'Rhodian-ware'.  In 1887, only three years before his death, he became Director of the National Manufactory at S\u00e8vres.",
