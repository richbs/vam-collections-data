This painting was bequeathed to the V&A by Isabel Constable, John Constable\u2019s daughter, in 1888. Freud attempted to copy it when he was a student, but gave up because it was so difficult. This print, made decades later and titled After Constable's \"Elm\", can be understood as an artist\u2019s response to another artist\u2019s work, with Freud offering a comment on the Constable painting: the 21st century addressing the 19th. Freud, one of the most important British artists of his generation, is still actively working in his 80s. \n\nThe V&A lent extensively to a retrospective of the works of John Constable chosen by Lucian Freud, which was held in Paris in 2002. The French catalogue for this exhibition included a conversation between Freud and William Feaver, the exhibition curator. The British Council reprinted a translation of the conversation in the book Freud on Constable. Lucian Freud made this new etching specially for the book.",
