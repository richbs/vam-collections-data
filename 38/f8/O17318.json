The outer walls of the two houses at either end of the panel serve to mark each episode of the story. \n\nOriginally this panel formed part of a cassone. Dove tails cut into the front of the panel at both ends are partly concealed by side pilasters, which contain the (unidentified) arms of both panels. The 'feet' have been sawn off. The borders along the top and bottom of the panel are decorated with a gilt gesso scroll pattern alternating with gothic octofoils. A keyhole was cut into a central octofoil, probably at a later date. The cornice moulding at the top was nailed to the main panel, whereas the moulding at the bottom has been removed.",

This panel is from a cassone which is thought to have been made in Florence and would have formed part of a pair, one of which is now lost. It probably illustrates the events associated with marriage, rather than any particular story. The participants are shown in the contemporary costume of about 1430. The left panel depicts the exchange of rings, the central one the journey to groom\u2019s house, and the right-hand one the wedding feast. The female figure in the centre stands by a column, the symbol of fortitude, with the scrolled inscription \u2018don te io il cor meo\u2019 (I give you my heart). The two families remain unidentified.",

Furthermore it has come down to posterity in the form of long rectangular picture rather than the front of a marriage chest, as would have been its original function. <i>Cassoni</i> would have seemed increasingly cumbersome pieces of storage furniture as chests began to acquire drawers, but the fashion for all things connected with the early Italian Renaissance induced dealers and owners to salvage the front panels and sell them off as pictures to hang on walls.",
