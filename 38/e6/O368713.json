The outward-curving arms, terminating in scrolls, are supported on short balusters, each of which is pierced with a round hole, through which a bar or strap could be threaded to secure the child. The legs are of turned baluster form, the back ones slightly splayed, all having square blocks at the intersections. The front legs, linked by an arched stretcher similar to the top rail, are each pierced with three holes from front to back, to enable a foot rest to be placed at different heights.
