Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nOne of the most typical techniques in the south of Italy was the use of mixed colours of gold.  The goldsmiths often used yellow gold filigree as a base, and attached flat shapes of red gold to its surface, as here.  This technique was used for pendants and necklaces, as well as earrings, and is still in use today.  This earring comes from the Abruzzi.  Although the Abruzzi is in central Italy, it was formerly part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and the jewellery often has more in common with the south than with the rest of central and northern Italy.  \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
