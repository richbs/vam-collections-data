Daisy was launched in 1973 with the associated slogan \"the best dressed doll in the world\".\n\nThese Daisy paper dolls (made by the same manufacturer) and their clothes reflect not only the clothing and hair fashions of the day, but also the fashion model poses and the graphic style (in this instance shared with fashion journalism, dressmaking patterns etc) which tended to show girls as basically childlike, with large eyes, flat chests, large feet and disproportionately long legs.  The bouffant hair is perhaps more a reflection of the vinyl Daisy doll.",
