The cylindrical beads are covered with cloisonn\u00e9 imitation enamel, and have a circle of small filigree beads round each end.  The pendant consists of six pieces linked by jump rings and hooks.  The body, tail and two wings are made of silver-gilt filigree.  The lower feathers of each wing, and the border of the tail, are made of sheet silver, gilded, and engraved to look like feathers.  These engraved feathers are alternatively gilded in yellow and red.  The head is made of gilded hollow sheet silver, and the two legs are made of cast gilded silver.  All the pieces are set with gems (emeralds, rubies and pearls), and there is a string of seed pearls round the neck of the eagle, and a pearl hanging from each beak.  The filigree is all open work, and decorated with applied granules.",

While it is clearly related to the jewellery worn elsewhere in North Africa, it often retains a richness and sophistication, derived from the medieval Islamic culture of southern Spain, which is absent in many other countries.  \n\nThis necklace shows many of these characteristics.  The cylindrical beads, called qannuta in Morocco, are directly descended from a pattern used by the Moors of Andalusia before their expulsion in the 15th century.  The same design continued in use among Spanish Christians in such places as La Alberca until the 19th century.  The symbol of a double-headed eagle, representing power throughout the Islamic Mediterranean region as much as in Europe, may date from the same period.\n\nThere was no information about the origins of this necklace when it arrived in the Museum in 1902.  It may have been made in T\u00e9touan, a centre of Andalusian culture on the north coast of Morocco, where similar necklaces were worn in the 18th century.",
