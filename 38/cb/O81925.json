Many carry inscriptions relating to their function which vary in the content. Similar examples in the Khalili collection are engraved with the principle places of pilgrimage for Twelver Shi'is, namely Mecca, Medina, Karbala', Najaf, al-Kazimayn, al-'Askariyyayn, Qum, Mashhad and Imam 'Abd al-'Azim near Tehran; while others contain verses giving instructions on how to use the compass. The literature on the determination of the qiblah is extensive: it appears that the compass in the astronomical compendium <i>Sanduq al-yawaqit</i> ('The Chest of Rubies') made in 1365-6 AD by Ibn Al-Shatir is the first known with a pivotal needle, and of a qiblah compass. The introduction of the magnetic compass from China made it possible to manufacture small instruments which, when correctly orientated by means of the pivoted needle, would show the azimuth of the qiblah from a number of places marked on the compass plate.",
