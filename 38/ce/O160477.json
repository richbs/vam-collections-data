XLII, pp.101-106\n<u>Die Kunst zu Wohnen: Ein Augsburger Klebealbum des 18. Jahrhunderts</u>, Deutscher Kunstverlag, 2013. This privately owned album, recently exhibited and published (The Art of Living: An Augsburg Paste-Up Album from the 18th Century) reveals the interiors of an upper-middle-class burgher household in Augsburg of 1780-86 through means of detailed colour illustrations, part pen/ink and watercolour, part decoupage, part scrapbook. It may be the home of the goldsmith Johann Georg Walther, and the artist responsible for the album is possibly Balthasar Cornelius Koch. The page illustrating the kitchen shows the wall bays, one with pewter plates above a table with various dishes, On the top shelf, above the pewter-ware, is a row of spirally moulded salt-glazed stoneware jugs with twisted handles and simple blue sprig decoration, all displayed upside-down in graduated sizes, the largest in the centre. In a separate bay to the right, are moulds hung on the wall. Above these are tin-glazed earthenware jugs, plain white or with various types of decoration, hung by their handles on hooks in a row. They all have hinged pewter covers.",
