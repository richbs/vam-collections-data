Each building represents a style in the history of British Architecture.\n\nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME\nAll cards are placed face down in the middle of the playing area.\n1.  The first player takes 7 cards from the pile, all other players (in clockwise direction) takes 6 cards from the pile.\nEach player looks at his cards, decides which house he is going to `collect' and puts his cards face down in front of him.\n2.  The first player takes one card from the pile.  If he wants to keep it he puts it face down in front of him and passes one of his own cards face down to the second player.  The second player takes the `offer', takes one card from the middle pile and passes one of his unwanted cards to the third player etc.\nAfter the first round each player should have 7 cards, after the second round 8 cards etc.\n3.  The game ends when one player has completed a house.  He calls `stop' and turns all his cards face up.  All other players turn their cards face up.  \nThe first player to call `stop' gets 12 points for closing the game and 12 points for a complete couse.  All other players get 12 points if they have a completed house.\nIf a player calls `stop' by mistake and has not got a completed building, he gets minus one point for each card in his possession and all other players get 12 points for a complete house.\n4.  If there are more than 5 players, each player can collect one building only.  If there are 5 or less players, each player can collect two or more buildings.  Player should agree on the number of buildings to be collected before the start of each game.\nIt is possible to play an open game.  When all the cards in the middle pile are taken, players turn their cards face up.  Each player gets 12 points for a completed house.  Players without any completed houses get minus one point for each card.\n5.  the game can also be played by small children.  Houses joined together make up a picturesque street and when squares are put together at random, a skyscraper of different doors, windows and arches can be built.",
