In 1807 he entered the RA schools, and exhibited his first painting there. Made his name with 'The Disposal of a Favourite Lamb' in 1813; elected ARA 1814, RA 1820. Achieved great popularity with his landscapes and, particularly, rustic genre scenes in the 1820s; Ruskin highly praised his works in the 1840s. Married in 1822 the sister of the portrait painter Margaret Carpenter. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, especially in Italy 1836-38; these visits are reflected in the subjects he painted. Exhibited 124 works at the RA between 1807 and 1846, and 45 at the BI 1808-43. Librarian at the RA 1840-2. Died London 17 February 1847. His studio sale was at Christie's 31 May-5 June 1847. His two sons were the novelist William Wilkie Collins and the painter Charles Allston Collins. There are watercolours and a sketchbook in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: \tWilliam Collins 'List of Pictures and Patrons', two MS volumes 1808-27 and 1827-46, National Art Library, V&A (referred to below as Lists); <i>Athenaeum</i> 20 February 1847, p200 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1847, p137 (obit); W Wilkie Collins <i>Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq</i>, RA 2 vols, 1848 (referred to below as <i>Memoirs</i>); <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, p 141 W.

It was exhibited at the RA in 1844. Collins visited Seaford in September 1841 and made several outdoor sketches; the <i>Memoirs</i> note that the artist used them for this picture, described as 'perhaps as strikingly original a work of its class, as he ever produced'. The <i>Art Union</i> critic thought 'the line of water meets the sand in a manner too hard. This may be intended to show the tide flowing, but it is yet too severe. The group in the foreground is peculiarly happy - one of the artist's most felicitous copies of simple facts.' The artist James Smetham wrote to J H Hall on \n24 March 1862: \n\nHow well do I remember in 1844 the first sight of Collins's pictures and the others ... the picture I then saw of Collins's is now, I am thankful to say, in the South Kensington collection - the 'Seaford', with the cloud shadows chasing each other on the windy sands, and the lovely group of children in the foreground. \n\nHe discusses the painting further in a letter of 29 March 1875. Eleven drawings of Seaford were in the artist's posthumous sale in 1847. A drawing in pencil heightened with white for two of the three foreground figures in the painting is in the V&A collections also from the Sheepshanks Gift (FA10). A watercolour version, signed and dated 1837, was sold at Sotheby's 27 February 1985 (178, 26.5 x 71 cm).\n \nEXH: RA 1844 (141) \nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1844, p156; <i>Lists</i>; <i>Memoirs</i> II, pp197-8, 252-3; S Smetham and W Davies <i>Letters of James Smetham</i> . . . 1891, pp103, 309-10\"",
