It may have been worn by a mature man, as shown in the drawings of the artist Hans Holbein the Younger (1497/8-1543).\n\nA large number of 16th-century knitted caps, most of highly fashionable shape, have been discovered in Greater London in building sites. The location of the finds, allied to the fact that the caps are knitted, suggests that they were not intended for the upper strata of society, but rather for the middle classes.\n\nThis was found with eleven other caps in an old building in Worship street, London. All twelve caps were acquired by the museum in 1901.",

The 'Cappers Act' of 1571 stated that every person above the age of six years (excepting 'Maids, ladies, gentlewomen, noble personages, and every Lord, knight and gentleman of twenty marks land') residing in any of the cities, towns, villages or hamlets of England, shall wear on Sundays and holidays (except when travelling), 'a cap of wool, thicked and dressed in England, made within this realm, and only dressed and finished by some of the trade of cappers, upon pain to forfeit for every day of not wearing 3s. 4d.'. This act was intended to keep domestic production alive, as caps were outmoded by this date and there was a danger that a fall in demand for them would have a detrimental effect on the makers.

They may not therefore have been high fashion.\n\nKnitted or felted caps were designed to be warm and waterproof, some protected the neck, some had ear flaps and many were trimmed with ribbons to imitate expensive silk versions. Wealthy Londoners wore fashionable European bonnets / caps of silk velvet decorated with ostrich feathers, aglets and brooches.\n\nThe heavy felting of the knitted caps gave them a similar texture to velvet. Wool takes colour easily so these caps were often dyed in strong colours such as red and black which were fashionable at the time. A large number of 16th-century knitted caps, most of highly fashionable shape, have been discovered in Greater London in the early 20th century during building works. The location of the finds, allied with the fact that they are knitted, suggests that they were not intended for the upper strata of society, but rather for the middle classes.",
