This involves scooping and pouring the powdered tea from the caddy into a ceramic bowl. Hot water is added and the mixture is worked into a viscous suspension with a bamboo whisk. The one bowlful of tea is usually shared by four or five guests. Japanese ceramic tea caddies are small because they are required to hold tea for only one serving.\n\nPlace\nThe Takatori kilns are located in the northern part Kyushu, the westernmost of Japan's four main islands. They were founded at the beginning of the 17th century and have long been known for their elegant and finely potted tea ceramics.\n\n Historical Associations\nThis tea caddy was one of over 200 Japanese ceramics bought by the V&A after they had been shown at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in the United States in 1876. Some, like this piece, were old, but the majority were new or nearly new. The collection was assembled by the Japanese with funds sent from Britain.",
