            "public_access_description": "In his catalogue of the delftware collection in the Victoria and Albert Museum, Michael Archer relates the wonder, amazement and fear with which people greeted the intrepid Vicenzo Lunardi (1759-1806) on his balloon ascents in 1784 and 1785.  Lunardi was a Tuscan, though Secretary to the Neapolitain Embassy in London.  His first ascent took place from the ground of the Honourable Artillery Company at Moorfields in the City of London.  He was accompanied by a pigeon, a dog, a bottle of wine and a leg of chicken.  Lunardi touched down briefly at North Mimms where the cat ran off and finally landed near Ware in Hertfordshire.  The distance was twenty-four miles and it was covered in two and a quarter hours.  Describing the event the Gentleman's Magazine reported: 'The balloon was seen to rise, with all the majesty that the heart could wish, to the astonishment of millions, who, scarcely open to conviction, beheld it with a kind of awful terror, which rather closed their lips to stupid silence, then prompted them to rend the air, as might have been expected, with joyful acclamations'.  In his own account of the ascent, printed for the author in 1784, Lunardi wrote that after a sudden silence the crowd 'passed from incredulity and menace to the most extravagant expressions of approbation and joy'. On landing, some terrified labourers refused to help him until persuaded by a girl working with them, exclaiming that 'they would have nothing to do with one who came in the Devil's house (or possibly Devil's horse)'. Later in the same year he exhibited his balloon at the Pantheon. This flight and  subsequent ones made in the following year - one from St.  George's Fields, Southwark (close to the  delftware  potteries) aroused considerable interest, as did the flight by Jean Pierre Blanchard and Dr John Jeffries, his American patron, on 7 January 1785, when they crossed the Channel from England to France. In order to gain height they  desperately jettisoned all extra weight, including  Blanchard's trousers. Both Lunardi's and  Blanchard's flights are recorded on English delftware. Various prints were available to the potters to copy, including an aquatint by Jukes and an admission ticket from Lunardi's ascent.\n\nThe balloon ascent shown on this plate appears to be one of those made by Lunardi. The plate has typical characteristics of the London delftware potteries at the end of the eighteenth century. These include the manner of painting the foliage of the bushes and trees rather like layered palm fronds, the festoons and the feathered edge and simple leaf sprays on the border, made up of dots.\n\nInformation taken from Archer, Michael.

Garner found a number of  fragments of dishes showing a Lunardi ascent. The shape of the cage under the  balloon shown on the Museum's flask indicates that it is the one used on the first  ascent (The author is grateful to Charles Gibbs-Smith for information supplied for this  entry).\n\n\tArcher, Michael.
