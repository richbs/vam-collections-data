The eyes are brown and black glass embedded into the head (These are possibly a plastic material but it is not possible to be more definite). The nose is stitched with black thread. The body is a black mohair tipped with grey and stuffed with straw. Much of the surface is worn where the toy has been held but otherwise it is in good condition. \n\n*Although many Chad Valley soft toys retain there sewn on labels, few also have the metal button.\nIt is possible that the toy originally have a ribbon tied around its neck.",
