The embroidery consists of flowering branches, birds and butterflies. The design is roughly symmetrical either side of a centre seam. The embroidered design is framed with three lines of metallic thread in couched work. At one end, there is a spiral-shaped fastening with a loop and at the other a similar fastening with a knot, both made from the same black cotton as the piping. The band is lined with cotton in blue and white marl.\nIt seems that headbands like this were worn by marreid Punti women during the cooler months of the year. The were worn high across the forehead and secured aroung the back of the head with a chain. The decorated ones were made as part of the woman's wedding outfit. Plainer ones were used for everyday wear. Headbands were not confined to south China, variations being worn by older women elsewhere.",
