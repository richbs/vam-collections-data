The copied design was then painted in bodycolour.  This was a method of reproducing a design and its colour scheme. It was probably reproduced for reference purposes.  \n\nThe design is for a woven silk known as 'a tobine'. This was a weave known in France as cannell\u00e9. A tobine has transverse ribs formed by warp floats. A tobine is a textile with a textured effect made by a warp additional to the ground warp.  A tobine can be combined with other effects such as brocaded flowers as is probably the case in this example. A brocading weft is a weft participating in the formation of design effects in textiles that have a ground weft and whose movement is limited to the width of the design it produces. The flowers, leaves, and feather-like shapes in this design were probably intended to be brocaded with the coloured silk threads just taken across the width of the motifs.\n\nDue to technical innovations during the reign of Louis V, new ornaments in silk design became fashionable, weavers imitated lace and feathers in the 1760s. These feather-like flowers are similar in style to such earlier designs. Feathers were still seen in some French woven silks in the 1780s. This design probably dates to the early 1770s.",
