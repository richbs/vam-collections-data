As one of the largest of the Birmingham manufacturers which was revolutionising the silver industry, Gough and Co. had taken part in the Birmingham Exhibition of 1848, where its productions were praised by The Art Journal. This piece, along with two others in this case, may well have been designed by George Wilkinson (1819-1894), who worked for Gough and Co. in the years before 1854. Wilkinson later became the chief designer at Gorham's, the manufacturers of Rhode Island, New York, who pioneered electroplate in the U.S.A.",
