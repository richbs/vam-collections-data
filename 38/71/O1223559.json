The central scene is framed by a circular ridge outside of which is a border of stylised Greek shells separated by small raised bosses. Outside this is a wider border of running palms and leaves topped by a mask, the whole framed by a further raised reinforcing ridge. A hole for suspension has been drilled through the top border, probably some time after the plaque was made.\n\nThe front of the plaque is signed by both Elkington and Morel-Ladeuil (picked up in the electrotype of the original) and the back of the plaque has an applied plate recording the copyrighting of the design in 5 countries and 4 languages and a full set of Elkington's electroplate marks.",

ELKINGTON & CO., and if we could regard their display as representative of the craft to which they belong, other nations would be put far in the background. But the MESSRS. ELKINGTON in the vastness of their business, in the number and talent of the artisans whom they employ, occupy a position so far above the other firms engaged in the same manufacture, that their display is not representative of English silversmith work; it simply illustrates the excellence of their own productions, and in this respect it is representative of the highest achievements of the art in this century.\n\nIn one respect their exhibit differs from the others of the same class made by manufacturers of other nations. It is uniquely an art display. They have not attempted t to send examples of their manufacture in sterling silver and electro, for in this respect their work is of a character to defy competition, and their reputation is already world-wide. Hence they have excluded from their Court all articles which do not possess, in the strictest sense of the term, high artistic merit, both as regards design and execution; and for this reason their Court forms one of the greatest attractions in the Main Building. No-one should fail to visit it.\n\n\u2026 The ELKINGTON exhibit at the Centennial may be conveniently divide dinto four classes \u2013 artistic silver-work proper; repouss\u00e9-work in silver, iron or steel, with enrichments of gold and silver in damascening, inlaying and neillo; combinations of these methods with silver; and enamels \u2013 cloisonn\u00e9 and champlev\u00e9. To these are added electrotype reproductions of several of the famous examples from the South Kensington Museum, in silver and copper bronze.\n\nOur engraving on page 125 belongs to the second class. It is the latest work of the celebrated artist M. Morel Ladeuil, and in the opinion of competent judges, as a specimen of artistic metal-work of the highest class, it has never been surpassed either inconception of design or in the delicacy of manipulation. The diameter of the Pompeian Toilette \u2013 as the Plaque is called \u2013 is some twenty inches. The centre is oxidized silver; the rim is of steel of two colours, enriched with gold damascening and repouss\u00e9-work; yet it is almost impossible to believe that the scene which gives the name to the plaque also has been hammered out by the repouss\u00e9 process. Looking at the engraved picture, one would say it was after some fine painting \u2013 say byAlma Tadema \u2013 and was the labor of the brush and pencil rather than the mallet and chisel. An inspection of the piece itself rather increases than diminishes the wonder. The texture of the flesh, the drapery, the plants, the effect of distance, each and all are expressed with truly marvellous fidelity to nature; in brief, the technique is perfect. Looked at as an artistic conception, the work is not less remarkable. Here is a Pompeian lady, fresh from the bath, attended by her female slaves. The toilet is nearly completed:the necklets and armlets have been adjusted; one maid is fastening the sandals to the anklets; another stands holding the robe shortly to be donned, and a third finishes the adornment of the hair while her mistress contemplates the effect in a mirror. The pose and expression of each one of these figures are a study, but the central figure is a marvel of grace and loveliness. Accessory to this group are the room, the furniture, the ornaments, the flowers, and the recess beyond. All these details it will be observed have been carefully studied and combined to give a most harmonious whole. Except in the other works exhibited by the MESSRS. ELKINGTON, there is no metal-work of a like description in the Exhibition comparable with this fine plaque.\u201d\nAngus Patterson, \"The Pompeian Lady Plaque\", <u>The Journal of the Antique Metalware Society</u>, Vol. 19, June 2011, pp. 76-81, ill. p. 76",

            "history_note": "The item is an Elkington and Company electrotype plaque depicting 'A Pompeian Lady at her Toilette', originally produced in silver and  damascened steel by the great French artist Leonard Morel-Ladeuil and electrotyped contemporaneously for sale at the Centennial Exhibition in  Philadelphia in 1876. The whereabouts of the original are unknown.\n\nThe French designer, Leonard Morel-Ladeuil, began working for Elkington &amp; Co. in 1859. He was employed specifically to produce large,  intricately embossed pieces for presentation and exhibition. Exhibitions sought to encourage virtuoso displays of design and craftsmanship,  allied to industrial design and production. The electrotypes were formed using one of the 19th century's great technological advances in  metalworking production, electroforming.\n\nThe plaque was acquired by the Museum in 2011 from a private vendor, who remembered during her childhood the plaque hanging on her  grandmother's wall.\n\nHistorical significance: 'The Pompeian  Lady' plaque is one of  Morel-Ladeuil's masterpieces. He produced it as the principal feature of the  Elkington stand for the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876 (the equivalent of the Milton Shield in Paris in 1867). The plaque is very well  documented. The Elkingtons' Visitors' Books (which are in the National Art Library) itemise copies of the Pompeian Lady made for customers at the  Philadelphia Exhibition and at the Paris Exhibition two years later. In 1904 a book of his life and works claimed, \"\"For the Universal Exhibition of  1876, at Philadelphia, Morel-Ladeuil prepared an important artwork, a large, circular, figurative plaque in silver repouss\u00e9 bas-relief, The Toilette  of a Pompeian Lady ... 'Pompeian Toilette' quickly became very popular. The grace of the figures and harmony of the composition charmed the  public; other artists, critics, and people of taste admired the extraordinary control, which allowed the artist to shape the central figurative group in  repouss\u00e9 bas-relief. The press in America, England, and France pronounced the artwork one of the most beautiful in the exhibition. The original  artwork, at a price of 1500 livres (37,500 francs), was not sold, but numerous electrotype reproductions were acquired in England and America.\"  (L\u00e9on Morel, L'Oeuvre de Morel-Ladeuil, Sculpteur-Ciseleur, 1820-1888, A. Lahure, Paris, 1904, pp. 24-25). \n\nMorel-Ladeuil only produced four more works after this: the Bunyon shield in 1878, and the three Shakespeare reliefs, before he retired to  Bologne in France in poor health, where he died. At a retrospective exhibition of Morel-Ladeuil's work in London critics called him one of the  great artists of the century. Morel-Ladeuil's total output of mature artworks numbers only 35 pieces, of which the Museum only has one in silver,  the 'Milton Shield' (Mus. no. 546-1868) (and 4 electrotypes of the same shield).\n\nAs an electrotype this plaque is also interesting an example of a 19th-century commercial application of new technology. The Museum's  electrotype collection is so heavily weighted towards copies of historic objects that the significance and impact of the process as a means for  producing all types of contemporary objects from grand sculpture to table cutlery can sometimes be overlooked. Elkingtons combined  innovative, cutting-edge electrotyping technology with aggressive marketing and fierce protection of their work. The stamps, marks, signatures  and inscriptions on this plaque convey an unusually large amount of information about contemporary reproduction for the modern art market of  the late 19th century. The back carries inscriptions recording the copyrighting of the design in four languages and five countries as well as an  English Design Registry mark for 30th April 1877 (a year after it was registered in America). It also has a clear set of Elkington electroplate  marks and the date letter for 1877, an example of Elkingtons skirting close to the edge of hallmarking legislation. Elkingtons commissioned  works of art with electrotypes in mind: the original in silver and steel was used at the exhibitions to advertise the electrotypes. Elkingtons were  still featuring this electrotype in their trade catalogues in the early 20th century.",

            "historical_context_note": "This plaque is an electrotype, an exact copy in metal of another object. Electrotypes were a by-product of the invention of electroplating (silver plating by electrolysis).\n\nELECTROPLATING: Electricity revolutionised the trade of coating base metal objects with silver. Patented by Elkington and Company in the 1840s, this technique was the fulfillment of a century of research into the effects of electricity on metals. A negatively charged silver bar, suspended in a vat of potassium cyanide, deposited a coating of silver on a positively charged base metal (mostly copper, later nickel-silver) object immersed with it. Electroplated objects were fully formed in base metal before plating. \n\nELECTROGILDING exploited the same technique but used gold bars instead of silver. It was safer than traditional mercury gilding. \n\nELECTROFORMING transferred the metal deposits directly into the moulds in the plating vats. When enough metal had been deposited to create a self-supporting object the mould was removed. Developed by Alexander Parkes, electroforms so accurately mirrored the moulds in which they were created that multiple copies could be created (ELECTROTYPES).\n\nDuring the electrotyping process a mould was taken of the original object. In this mould a copper type pattern was electroformed. From this type pattern subsequent moulds were created in which electrotypes were formed. This plaque was therefore electroformed in copper from moulds made from a type pattern which itself was electroformed in a mould of the original. The copper electrotype was then electroplated, electrogilded and oxidised.\n\nEarly experiments in electroplating, often by amateur scientists using Elkington's home electroplating kits, involved coating fruit, flowers and animals in silver or gold \"with the most perfect accuracy\". They \"retained all the characteristics of the specimens before their immersion\" (<i>Penny Magazine</i>, 1844). The <i>Art Journal</i> enthused in same year, \"The electrotypes are perfect; the finest lines, the most minute dots are as faithfully copied as the boldest objections\". \n\nElectrotyping was an industrial technique whose application to the arts rapidly increased the supply of works of art to a broad section of society. Henry Cole, the first director of the South Kensington Museum (V&A), quickly grasped the educational potential of this new technique. He employed Elkingtons and Franchi & Son of Clerkenwell to take moulds of historic and modern objects in the Museum (at their own risk), create copies in a base metal and then electroplate them. These could be sold freely as reproductions, with a gold, silver or bronze finish, provided they bore the South Kensington Museum's official stamp. To avoid breaking English hallmarking laws, all marks were to be deleted from copies of silver objects. Copies were made of successful modern objects as well as historic works of art\n\nElkington's display of electrotypes at the 1867 Paris Exhibition proved extremely popular and prompted Cole to organise a convention at which 14 European countries agreed to exchange works of art. Representatives of Elkington's and the V&A sent staff to Germany, Sweden, France, Denmark and Hungary. The most ambitious trip, to Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1880, secured copies of over 200 items from the Kremlin and the Hermitage, including the celebrated Jerningham Wine Cooler and much Elizabethan and Stuart silver sent as ambassadorial gifts to the Tsars. By 1920 the V&A held over 2000 electrotypes. Copies toured the country as part of the Museum's educational programmes and were sold to the public and to museums and art schools.\n\nElkingtons were a commercial giant selling electrotypes for profit as well as instruction. A variety of finishes met a range of tastes and budgets.\n\nThe process of electroplating and electrotyping  favoured companies that could afford large factories and expensive technology.
