This slab, with 137 specimens of different Italian marbles, belonged to three different collectors, Dr. John Fothergill (1712-1780), Dr. J.C. Lettsom (1744-1815) and the architect George Gwilt (1775-1856). Gwilt was an enthusiastic collector of antiquities which he kept in his house in Southwark, London, and he acquired the slab before he visited Italy in 1824. Although slabs of specimen marbles were generally supplied with a diagram and list of the individual specimens for identification, these keys often do not survive. This slab has the original Italian key, handwritten in ink, which identifies each of the different marbles, including pieces from classical ruins in Rome. Like many collectors, Gwilt commissioned a stand for the slab so it could be used as a side table.",
