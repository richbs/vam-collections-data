The Cookes established a number of circuses in regional towns, particularly in Scotland where they ran circuses in wooden buildings in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Perth and Greenock. Since the printer's name on this image is T. Fife, it may be that this image was cut from a playbill advertising a performance at one of the Cooke family circuses in Scotland.",
