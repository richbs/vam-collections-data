            "physical_description": "[doll] Doll representing a caucasian female child, with head and outer limbs of poured wax on a stuffed white calico body.  Her light brown hair, which is human hair set in ringlets, is inserted at the top of the head in a central slit and down the sides and back with knife cuts running from top to bottom.  Her fixed glass eyes are blue, and her eyebrows and mouth are painted.  The arms are slightly bent and have hands with separate fingers and thumbs and moulded fingernails.  The legs are straight, extending just above the knee, and have separately indicated toes with moulded nails.  The head on its shoullder plate is stitched to the waisted body, and the limbs are attached in the same way.  The body is seamed at the sides, with a substantial dart in the upper back; the upper (cloth) legs are seamed at the centre back, with extra stitching at the top and middle (making 'extra' knees) to allow the doll to sit more securely.\n[Doll's clothing] Dress of royal blue muslin, the scoop necked bodice and short sleeves lined with white cotton.  The long full skirt is pleated to the bodice at the waist, and both bodice and skirt are finished with a flounce of pleated matching fabric; neck, sleeves and flounces are all edged with machine made lace.  The garment fastens at the back of the bodice with hooks and loops.\nThe dress has a separate matching two panel basque skirt with an attached bow-trimmed belt, fastening with hooks and loops.\n\nPlain white muslin petticoat, the long full skirt stitched to a waistband of cream tape which fastens with a metal hook and eye.\n\nLater (ca. 1890s) combinations of lace edged white twilled cotton, consisting of a bodice and drawers.  The garment fastens with cloth covered buttons and stitched buttonholes at the back of the bodice and the sides of the drawers.\n\nThe original record card records that at one time the doll was wearing an un-numbered chemise and drawers from the reserve collection; also the petticoat Misc.1:2- 1964.  The petticoat Misc.1:2-1964 was removed in July 2010 to be reunited with the remainder of its set.  According to the card this doll's remaining underwear consists of a flannel petticoat, a chemise, stays and drawers, not accessible in July 2010.  It is not known whether the chemise and drawers are those referred to as un-numbered above, nor whether the combinations which were on the doll in July 2010 came with her originally.",

In the 19th century the most immediate way of indicating that someone in the family had died was usually to wear black mourning clothes for some months after the death; a young child might wear white, especially if it was for the death of another child.  \n\nAfter the funeral there were a number of ways in which families and friends chose to commemorate those who had died, including memorial cards, paintings and photographs; jewellery made from their hair; and keepsakes (the preservation of their belongings).  This doll was owned by the donor's great aunt, Jane Wright Wearing, who had died in her second year in 1864: it was treasured in her memory within the donor's family.  While it is unlikely that Jane would ever have played with the doll, it may have been a Christening or other present intended for later use.",
