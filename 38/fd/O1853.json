This piece was made after 1885 when Leveill\u00e9 took over Rousseau's workshop.  The glass was made, possibly, by either Appert Fr\u00e8res or at Clichy to L\u00e9veill\u00e9's design and decorated in Paris with a repeating pattern of peacock's tail feathers. The unusually simple vase was bought from L\u00e9veill\u00e9 himself. L\u00e9veill\u00e9 exhibited in the Universal Exhibition, Paris, in 1889 and it is possible that this vase was included or that L\u00e9veill\u00e9's exhibit encouraged the Museum to approach him privately.",
