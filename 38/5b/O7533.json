            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nBy the 14th century heraldry had become a common theme for stained-glass windows. Many glazing schemes corresponded to 'occasional rolls' which had first appeared in England in the late 13th century. These documents recorded the coats of arms of those present on a special occasion, such as a military tournament or campaign. It is entirely possible that this panel was originally made for such a commemorative window.\n\nPeople\nThis shield bears the arms of Roger Beauchamp of Bletsoe, a baron of Edward III (1327-1377). Beauchamp's military career was long and distinguished. He fought for Edward III throughout the Hundred Years' War - a conflict sparked by the Edward III's revival of his hereditary claim to the French crown.  In 1372 Beauchamp was appointed Captain of Calais and, later on, was honoured with the prestigious title of Lord Chamberlain to the Royal Household (1376-1377).\n\nPlaces\nThis panel was possibly acquired from Strawberry Hill (Twickenham, Middlesex), home of Horace Walpole (1717-1797). Walpole, who pioneered England's 18th-century Gothic revival, transformed the property into a pseudo-Gothic 'castle' in which to hoard his celebrated collection of antiquities, prints and curiosities. His particular interest in heraldry was reflected in the Medieval stained glass with which he decorated his residence.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAn important stylistic development in the painted glass of this period is the 'diapering' (chequered pattern) of the coloured background against which figurative designs such as heraldry were set. These areas, previously plain, were now enlivened with intricate patterns of foliage, either painted on to the glass in black or masked out on a black enamel ground.",

(1961, Temple Newsam, cat entry) 6906-1860\nShield with Arms of Beauchamp of Bletsho\nEnglish, 14th century\nHorace Walpole collection at Strawberry Hill\n\nThe Beauchamps of Bletso are a cadet branch of the Beauchamps of Warwick. Roger Beauchamp (d.1379-80) was created 1st Lord Beauchamp (of Bletsoe). The arms of this branch are: gules on a fess or between 6 martlets or a mullet sable. However, there is a Walter de Beauchamp recorded in the Falkirk Roll (c.1298) with the arms: gule a fess or between 6 martlets or.\n\nThe crescent on the fess of this shield is a cadency mark and indicates a second son. Thomas was the second second of Thomas, the 11th Earl. The eldest son, Guy, died in 1360. The father died in 1369. This shield would have to date prior to the death of the latter and probably before the death of the former.\n\nJohn was the brother of Thomas, the 11th Earl, and a younger son of Guy, the 10th Earl of Warwick. He was born about 1316 and died 1360. He was created the 1st Baron Beauchamp of Elmsley. He was one of the principal captains at the siege of Calais in 1348 and was one of the founder members of the Order of the Garter, along with his brother, Thomas. His arms appear to have been: gules, crusily, a fess or, difference mullet sable. This would indicate that he was a third son.",
