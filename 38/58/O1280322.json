The head on this stick is made of leather, stuffed and hand-sewn, although jester's sticks were often entirely carved and painted. Metal beads were originally sewn to each of the points of the jester's head-dress on this stick, and would have made a noise when the stick was shaken.\n\nThis is possibly a theatrical prop. The tragic jester Jack Point in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1888 opera The Yeomen of the Guard carries a similar jester's stick and this may have been made and used in one of the many productions of that opera. Since the donor bought it as a curio without any provenance however, its origins are unknown.",
