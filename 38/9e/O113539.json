It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.\nThe flowers depicted on this silk are well drawn, and include dodecatheon meadia, from the primrose family, sometimes known as the American Cowslip.",

Comes from N. America and is known as American cowslip. The flower is the right colour and the centres of the flower are also correct. The spray is rather fancifully curved but the designer took botanical liberties with most of his stems. I do not think it is a cyclamen or dog-tooth violet because they are single stems and I think he would have used their rather distinctive and beautiful leaves in the designs. Also the centres of the dodecatheon are more vivid red and orange which the flowers on the silk are.'",
