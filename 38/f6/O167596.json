It was the standard type of seating - often fitted with textile or leather covers - from 1615 until about 1670, when fashionable chair-backs became higher and the back legs were raked backwards for greater stability. This chair is raked above seat level but the back legs are vertical. The sturdy construction and leather covers would have made it practical piece for regular domestic use.\n\nThe upholstery of such seats is simple in construction, with webbing and base cloth nailed to the frame, padding of grass or  horsehair (sometimes stitched to help keep it from forming lumps), and a top cover of leather nailed around the seat rails. Best quality 'Russia' leather (from calf or cowhide) had an impressed pattern and was found in red, green and yellow as well as brown.\n\nOn loan to Woolsthorpe Manor (National Trust).",
