Inscribed on the back: <i>Lord.Rich/S.C./ 1649</i> in a nineteenth-century hand.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Twentieth-century gilt-metal oval locket, with slip-in bezel at back, set with convex glass to show the old inscription; the sides half-round with a projecting rolled-edge bezel holding the principal glass, also convex; hanger of cosse de pais type with central tear-drop opening, two projections on each side, and small ball finial, with a tapering flat wire spiral of five turns on each side of it; engraved on the back: <i>Lord Rich</i>. \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an undisclosed source by the Hon. F H A Wallop before 1927 and lent to the V&A until 1949; given in 1933 to Alan Evans, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nLong wrote: 'This is an old miniature but very coarse for Cooper: the signature appears to me suspect and I think the miniature may be an old copy. It is boldly painted, much in Cooper's manner'. (1) Reynolds added: 'In my opinion the signature is not genuine. The S is composed of two strokes ... and the paint has a very recent look. I think the miniature is by Flatman.' (2)  \n \nRecent examination suggests that the miniature is basically a Cooper, though heavily overpainted and now of very poor appearance. The basic facial modelling, where it is visible, is of high quality and consistent with Cooper's style in the 1640s; the directional shading in the face is not by Cooper and would of course be anomalous. The signature and date are forged, though the date is plausible as an approximation on the early side if the miniature is by Cooper.  \n \nIt would be difficult to find any comparative pieces to substantiate the attribution to Flatman. Flatman was born in 1635 and his oeuvre emerged only at about the time of the Restoration. But Reynolds's remark that the paint was recent is surely right. The coarse work on the face and the long crude strokes in the hair seem to be by the same restorer as similar work on Hoskins, Cat. No. 25.  \n \nThis miniature may be the one cryptically referred to by Foster\" as 'Lord Rich, son of Henry Rich, Earl of Holland ... Mentioned in the Art Journal 1850, as being ascertained as one of Cooper's works'.(4)  \n \nWhether this is the same miniature or not, the fact that in the mid-nineteenth century the name Lord Rich passed unquestioned as associated with the Holland branch of the Riches (i.e, with Robert Rich, c.1620-1675, son of the 1st Earl Holland, who succeeded his cousin Charles Rich in 1673 as 5th Earl of Warwick) shows how unreliable the nineteenth-century inscriptions on this miniature are. The 5th Earl was never known as Lord Rich: his courtesy title was that of his father's Barony of Kensington, and Wallop was therefore technically correct to attribute the name Lord Rich to the 3rd Earl of Warwick. But for this identification the age of the sitter and his armour seem inappropriate: though Lord Rich, according to Cokayne 1900-9, joined the King at York, he 'never actually bore arms for him'. \n\n1 MS note, c.1928, in Wallop Loan Book. \n2 MS note in Wallop Loan Book, 20 September 1949.\n3 Foster 1914-16, vol.
