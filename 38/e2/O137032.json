            "public_access_description": "This is a study for a lithograph commissioned from the artist Phyllis Ginger (1907-2005) for the School Prints scheme. Set up in 1945 by Brenda Rawnsley, the scheme commissioned well-known artists to create lithographs, which would then be printed in large numbers and sold cheaply to schools for display in classrooms; the aim was to give 'school children an understanding of contemporary art'. Each lithograph had a drawn frame so that the print could be pinned to the wall. In the spirit of post-war optimism, artists responded enthusiastically. The scheme was a unique attempt at giving children access to original works of art in a period of austerity but ended in 1949 because of financial problems. Many of the prints depict a familiar world of everyday rural or urban life, some presenting a version of the pastoral idyll and others scenes of entertainment or leisure. Phyllis Ginger (1907-2005) was living near Bath at the time and chose Bristol Town Centre as her subject. Ginger is also known for her topographical watercolour landscapes painted as part of the Pilgrim Trust's 'Recording Britain' project, begun in 1939 with the purpose of recording aspects of British landscape that might be destroyed and lost under enemy bombing. Ginger was also a prolific book illustrator and designer, her work often featuring lively sketches of people in scenes of daily urban life.",
