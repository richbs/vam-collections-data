No. 87 [460-1892]); presently set within an oval window of a brown-coloured mount, with a card backing attached to the glass with gold-beater's skin. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Presumably some early history shared with the Coopers (Cat. Nos 88-91 [446-1892; 448-1892; 449-1892; 454-1892]), in the Rosse or Priestman families; eventually purchased by Edwin [Durning] Lawrence before 1862, and sold by him to the Museum, 1892. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> See Cat. No. 88; not noticed separately except in <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 p. 69. \n\nAlthough a miniature in the sense that it is executed in water-colour on vellum, this seems unconnected with any of the normal stages of production of finished miniatures and should be regarded as a sketch, perhaps made as an <i>aide-m\u00e9moire</i>, of a portrait in large, perhaps French. Table-book leaf was of course produced primarily for making such notes, and S P Rosse would doubtless have used it when visiting artists or the galleries of great houses. There is, however, nothing in the draughtsmanship to sustain an attribution of the present drawing to Rosse herself, though from its provenance it presumably belonged to her.\" ",
