Falstaff, being a fat man, required Richardson to be heavily padded and this drawing is a rare survival in showing how the designer envisaged the padding might be constructed.  The anatomy is carefully followed and measured, to give folds of 'fat' at the proper places and follow the muscular structure of chest, back, leg and stomach, and show how the layers fit over each other.  The red line indicates Richardson's body within the padding.  Because of the difficulty of padding out the face, Furse suggests making the collar high and stiff, so that any spare flesh is forced out onto the jowls, adding fatness to the face.  In spite of, or maybe because of, the costume, Richardson gave a performance which many considered definitive.\n  \nUnlike many designs, which are an evocation of a costume, this is a structured blueprint for the maker, although Furse is not dogmatic about the structure, noting that these are 'suggestions as to how it should be made'.",
