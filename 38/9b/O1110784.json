While he did not call himself a fashion designer, it is one of the capacities in which he first became known. \n\nThis outfit dates from the period when Bowery was still 'designing clothes' rather than when he was solely focused on his own creations for performance. It is likely that the ensemble was the only one made or is one of only a handful to survive. The ensemble was modelled in 1984 at a fashion show in Tokyo, organised by club personality Susanne Bartsch to promote new London fashion talent. This outfit, which could be worn by a man or woman, features floral and snake-skin prints and ruffles. These details lend themselves to fantasy and deliberate gender confusion, characteristics of much of Bowery's work.",
