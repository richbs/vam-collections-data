As a boy, drew plants for his father's engravings for Loddiges's monthly <i>The Botanical Cabinet</i> (1817-33). Also made preliminary drawings for his father's <i>London and its Vicinity</i> (1820-34) which were used by illustrators such as Stanfield, Prout, Cotman and Callcott, and worked on John Loudon's <i>Encyclopaedia of Plants</i> (1829). Etched his own illustrations for <i>Shipping and Craft</i> (1828-9) and with his father for Views of the Old and the New London Bridges (1833). Evidently made preliminary drawings for Stanfield. Painted in watercolours until 1834, when, after one lesson with James Stark, a family friend, he was inspired to paint in oils. Exhibited mostly marine and coastal subjects; 130 at the RA between 1835 and 1879,115 at the HI 1835-67, and three at the SBA 1835, 1838, 1876. Elected ARA 1851, RA 1863. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, most frequently in France from 1833, Holland from 1837, and Venice from 1850; also Italy 1845-6, Spain 1860-61, Egypt 1874. His inherited interest in natural history led to membership of several learned societies, notably FRS 1863, and his publication of <i>Grotesque Animals</i> (1872). Also published <i>Landscapes British and Foreign</i> (1874) and <i>Leaves from my Sketchbooks</i> (1876, 1877). Died Groombridge, Kent, 4 January 1880; his studio sales were at Christie's 22 May 1880 and 11 March 1882. \n\nLIT: Edited transcript of the artist's MS Diary, National Maritime Museum; MS Ledger of paintings completed 1829-78 (referred to below as <i>Ledger</i>), RA Library;<i>Illustrated London News</i> 13 August 1864, pp 173-4 (with engr portrait); <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, pp253-5; J Munday 'E W Cooke, Marine Painter' <i>Mariner's Mirror</i> (Society for Nautical Research) 1967, vol 53, pp99-113); <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1970, information also kindly supplied by John Munday \n\n<b>A Mackerel on the Seashore</b> \nFA44 Neg HB2563 \nPanel, 17.3 x 25.4 cm (7 x 10 ins) \nSigned and dated 'E W Cooke./May 1837.' diagonally bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857\n \nIn the <i>Ledger</i> with works of 1837, as painted at Barnes as a gift to Sheepshanks, who paid for the frame (\u00a31 4s).
