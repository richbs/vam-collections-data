This chair bears an imitation ivory label stamped EDWARDS & ROBERTS, 148-160 WARDOUR ST, 532 OXFORD ST. LONDON.  It is therefore likely that is was made after 1892, as this is when the firm occupied premises at these locations. The firm specialised in reproductions of earlier styles.\n\nThe chair closely follows a design by Thomas Hope illustrated in Household Furniture published in  1807.  As such it is an example of the Regency Revival in the decorative arts, popular in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Typical Regency features include the use of palmette and star motifs, in this case achieved using inlaid brass.",
