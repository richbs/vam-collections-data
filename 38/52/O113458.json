Wills, which opened at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 4 May 1895. The play was based on episodes in the classic novel Don Quixote by the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616), and starred the great actor Henry Irving.\n\nThis watercolour by Charles Green illustrates the second and final scene of the play, which in turn was based on part two, chapter 29 of Cervantes' novel. Don Quixote's friend Sancho Panza, Governor of an island city called Barataria, has accompanied the night-watchmen on their patrol of the streets. He stands on the left here, surveying a young woman dressed in male costume who has been caught breaking the curfew. The lines (in translation, Jarvis, 1840) from Cervantes' novel on which the scene is based read: 'They came to two archers holding a man by the arm. \"My lord governor,\" they said, \"this person who seems to be a man is not so: she is a woman and no ugly one either, in man's clothes.\"' The revealing effect of torchlight in darkness is used to dramatic effect here.",
