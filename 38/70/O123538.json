Windsor chairs are the best-known form of regional chair, produced in many areas of Britain. They were comfortable and strong, but also relatively cheap, and were therefore suitable for use in cottages, farm-houses and taverns. They were made in large numbers from the mid-18th century to the end of the 19th century. \n\nThe term 'Windsor chair' was first used in the 18th century but its origin is not clear.  Windsor chairs are defined by having a solid wooden seat into which the chair-back and legs are dowelled, or pushed into drilled holes, in contrast to standard chairs, where the back legs and the uprights of the back are continuous. The seats of Windsor chairs were often carved into a shallow dish or saddle shape for comfort.  The legs and uprights were usually turned on a pole-lathe, as in this chair.",
