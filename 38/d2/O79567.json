The chains hanging down at the front would have ended in small pendants or amulets.  These pendants were almost always set with a red coral, or some kind of imitation, in the centre.\n\nHeaddresses like this were probably common in the 19th and early-20th century, when Paul Eudel recorded one in his Dictionary of North African Jewellery, but were superseded soon afterwards by a more elaborate form, and are now rare.",
