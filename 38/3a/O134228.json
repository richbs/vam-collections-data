Apprenticed to the landscape watercolourist John Varley 1806; entered RA Schools 1808. Almost exclusively painted in watercolours, and very prolific. Exhibited 12 landscapes and two watercolours at the RA between 1807 and 1825, six works at the BI 1808-29, one at the SBA 1824, and nearly 800 at the OWS 1814-64 (elected Associate 1824, Member 1826). Despite his nickname of 'Bird's Nest Hunt', he painted a wide range of subjects, but especially fruit and flowers much prized by collectors. Elected Member of the RA at Amsterdam. Died London 10 February 1864; his studio sale was at Christie's 16-17 May 1864. Many watercolours are in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1864, pl14 (obit); F G Stephens 'William Henry Hunt' <i>Fraser's Magazine </i> October 1865, pp525-36 (reprinted in OWS XII, 1935, pp17-39); W Collingwood 'Reminiscences: William Hunt' <i>Magazine of Art</i> XXII, 1898, pp503-5; C Fry <i>William Henry Hunt</i> Maas Gallery exhibition catalogue 1967; T Jones <i>William Henry Hunt</i> Wolverhampton Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981; J Witt <i>William Henry Hunt</i> (1790-1864) <i>Life and Work, with a Catalogue</i> 1982 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>Landscape with Elm Trees and a Farm, Near Bayswater</b> \n440-1887 \nMillboard, 13.3 x 20 cm (5\u00bc x 7 7/8 ins) \nPurchased 1887 \n\nOne of Hunt's rare paintings in oil. Its authorship was challenged in 1915 by Sir George Clausen RA, who thought it more likely to be by a member of the Barbizon School, but the following correspondence in the Departmental file seems to confirm the attribution to Hunt. \n\nThe vendor, Frederick Piercy, wrote to Sir Frederick Burton, Director of the National Gallery, on 2 July 1887: \n\nI send you herewith a very rare specimen in oil by William Hunt. It cost me sixty guineas, but I am so anxious that the dear old man's name should be in the National Gallery catalogue that I shall be glad to accept whatever you think you would be justified in paying for it. When about thirty years ago I was professor of drawing on board <i>HMS Britannia</i>, I sent this picture to Mr. Hunt and received this letter. \n\nAttached is a copy by Thomas Armstrong (then Director of Art, South Kensington Museum) of Hunt's original letter. It is dated April 16 - no year is given, but presumably about 1860- and states: 'The sketch in watercolour as well as the bit in oil are by me, the one in oil must have been done almost fifty years back.' Sir Frederick Burton, writing to Thomas Armstrong 14 November 1887, notes that 'In another [letter] ... he [the vendor] said the view was at Bayswater'. \n\nThis evidence dates the oil sketch to around 1810; Witt dates it to 1806-10. It is similar in subject and treatment to works by John Linnell and William Mulready (for a similar subject by Mulready, for example, although larger and more detailed in handling, see FA135 p197) of about the same time. The subject is not distinctive enough in detail or character to be precisely identified as Bayswater, which was a favourite semi-rural area for painters to live and work in the early 19th century (see M Pointon <i>Mulready</i> V&A exhibition catalogue 1986, p21 etc). Grant suggested it could be Symond's Farm, near what is now Portobello Road, where Linnell also painted. \n\nPROV: Purchased 1887 from Frederick Piercy for \u00a331 \n\nEXH: <i>William Henry Hunt</i> Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1981 \n\nLIT: M H Grant <i>Old English Landscape Painters</i> 8, 1961, pp618-9, repr f 653;] Witt <i>William Henry Hunt</i> 1982, cat no 162\"",
