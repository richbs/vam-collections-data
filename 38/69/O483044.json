The embroidery on the broad ends consists of flowers and butterflies outlined with four rows of silver couching with a border of tiny fish against a cream ground. The central section has flowers embroidered in turquoise agains a black ground.\nThe band is lined with material resembling suiting in brown with a cream stripe. It is stiffened with card and paper which can be seen through the holes in the lining. Attached to one end is one half of a zip fastener with a small safety pin knotted onto it.\nIt seems that headbands like this were worn by marreid Punti women during the cooler months of the year. The were worn high across the forehead and secured aroung the back of the head with a chain. The decorated ones were made as part of the woman's wedding outfit. Plainer ones were used for everyday wear. Headbands were not confined to south China, variations being worn by older women elsewhere.",
