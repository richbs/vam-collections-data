The blackboard sides are decorated with white line drawings of named letters, for example A Apple, B Baby to Q Queen on one side and on the other from R Rose to Z Zebra and the numbers 1 one to 10 ten. There are two boxes of chalks houses in dents moulded into the plastic. The whole is sealed in plastic and contains a card label printed in colours to show the title and illustrations of the toy.",
