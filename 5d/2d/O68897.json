He wears a single crown on a cone-shaped hat and has long curly hair and a curly beard. Between his knees is the cross, bearing the beaded, long-haired Christ, head inclined to the left, wearing a loincloth. The Holy Ghost is perched on top of the cross. Two winged angels, wearing albs and amices, kneel at the base of the panel, holding a chalice beneath Christ's feet. On either side of the panel two archangels with carved feathered bodies, wearing tiaras, hold chalices beneath Christ's hands. The feathers on the wing of the archangel on the left are also carved. The base of a bracket is visible on the upper left of the panel and presumably held a censing angel, balanced by the one on the right.\n\nMuch of the top of the panel is missing. The hands of God the Father, presumably raised in blessing, and the left hand of the upper right-hand angel are missing. Part of the horizontal member of the cross is missing on the right. The head of the Dove is missing.\n\nSome green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. There are traces of gilding on the hair and beard of God the Father.\n\nThere are two lead-plugged holes in the back of the panel with latten wires attached.",

He wears a single crown on a cone-shaped hat and has long curly hair and a curly beard. Between his knees is the cross, bearing the beaded, long-haired Christ, head inclined to the left, wearing a loincloth. The Holy Ghost is perched on top of the cross. Two winged angels, wearing albs and amices, kneel at the base of the panel, holding a chalice beneath Christ's feet. On either side of the panel two archangels with carved feathered bodies, wearing tiaras, hold chalices beneath Christ's hands. The feathers on the wing of the archangel on the left are also carved. The base of a bracket is visible on the upper left of the panel and presumably held a censing angel, balanced by the one on the right.\n\nMuch of the top of the panel is missing. The hands of God the Father, presumably raised in blessing, and the left hand of the upper right-hand angel are missing. Part of the horizontal member of the cross is missing on the right. The head of the dove (the Holy Spirit) is missing.\n\nMany such alabasters were produced in Nottingham in the fifteenth century, since the cite was sited near alabaster quarries. A number of these were exported to the Continent.",
