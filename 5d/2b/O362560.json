Their father had been a painter and teacher of design, and their mother a lace maker. The sisters formed a Couture house making a variety of garments. Although their married names were different, they called their salon Callot Soeurs (Sisters). In 1914 they moved to grander quarters in Avenue Matignon. \nMadame Marie Gerber, the elder sister, was in charge of design. She had worked earlier for Raudnitz, a famous dressmaking house. \n\nThey worked with exquisite and unusual materials and Chinese silks, with Orientalism a favourite theme. Their clothes were known for their exotic detail, kimono sleeves, tasselled girdles, panels of embroidered satin or velvet, medallions, etc. They were among the first designers to use lame to make dresses.\nThe exotic detailing that marked many of their design is visible in this striking silk evening dress featuring a large scale Chinese-style floral motif.\n\nIn 1928 Madame Gerber's son Pierre took over, and for a decade continued his mother's standards, but the fashions had changed and their popularity waned. \nIn 1937 the house was absorbed into the house of Calvet.",
