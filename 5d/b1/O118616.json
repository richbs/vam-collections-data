In the ballet the young girl returns from a ball holding a rose given to her by a young man. When she falls asleep the spirit of the rose floods her dreams as she imagines herself dancing with him after he comes through her bedroom window. Karsavina's performance was celebrated for its lightness and waking-dream ethereality, and Nijinsky's for his stupendous elevation and androgynous sensuality.\n\nThe ballet was first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte Carlo in 1911 with designs by Leon Bakst and brought to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Chatelet in Paris by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes later that year. In Russia Fokine had attempted to revolutionise the Imperial Ballet at the Maryinsky Theatre by creating short, unrelated ballets that could be grouped for an evening\u2019s entertainment. The management of the Imperial Ballet did not support him, but the impresario Diaghilev did, and adopted the practice of programming shorter, separate works such as this.",
