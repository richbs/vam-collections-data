            "public_access_description": "This chair was designed by Koloman Moser as part of a commission for a wedding present in 1904. It was conceived en suite with a sofa and a writing desk with showcase (W.25-1982) above for the drawing room. In keeping with the Vienna Secession style, the lines of the chair are deceptively simple. However, the elongated oval and diamond shapes of the back make a bold decorative statement and add a sense of femininity. \n\nA sofa of about 1820 in Regensburg Museum has very similar geometric ornament in its back and sides, suggesting, perhaps, that Moser may have been consciously reviving aspects of the Biedermeier style which was fashionable in the early 19th century.",
