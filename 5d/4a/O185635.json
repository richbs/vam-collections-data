Tourists loved to buy coral jewellery in fashionable shapes, but it was also very popular with Italian women, who valued it for its colour and amuletic qualities.  Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces and earrings were always shaped.  The delicate carving of flowers and leaves on the pendant of this earring is typical of the work of Trapani, in Sicily.  \n\nIt was bought for \u00a32 (the pair) as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
