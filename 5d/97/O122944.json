In about 1892, he established his own studio-workshop there, with his brother Edouard-Alexandre, after lengthy experience in other potteries. Dammouse specialised in shapes and delicately-drawn decoration inspired by patterns and images from the Far and Middle East.  These were very fashionable in the late 1890s. In the early 1900s he began to work in glass, concentrating on that alone in his last years.",
