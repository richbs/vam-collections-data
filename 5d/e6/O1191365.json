It was based on designs developed by the Clissett family, as well as the Evesham-based chair makers the Kelly family. It was designed during the Arts and Craft movement, an international design philosophy instigated by the artist and writer William Morris (1834-1896) and inspired by  writer John Ruskin (1819-1900). This was an advocacy of traditional craftsmanship using folk styles, essentially anti-industrial in nature.\n\nAs a piece of furniture, the high chair is designed so that the seat is raised a distance from the ground, so that an adult may feed the seated child from a standing position, or so that the child can reach the table top.",
