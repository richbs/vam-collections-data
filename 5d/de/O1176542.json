To celebrate their triumph, the band arranged a five night residency at Earl's Court. These were the only Led Zeppelin concerts in the country in this year, and so the events sold out their entire run of 100,000 tickets.\n\nThis t-shirt uses the image of the poster advertising the special train services organised by British Rail, arranged in association with the promoters of the event, Mel Bush. The Mel Bush company would have been aware that this kind of advertising and service creates a publicity stunt. The promotional value would not only boost sales of tickets, but raise the profile of the band to even higher levels. It is likely that there would have been enough room on normal service trains for those visiting the capital, but arriving on a special chartered service creates more excitement and willingness to travel from as far away as Glasgow.\n\nWith t-shirts becoming a staple fashion item for youth and rock 'n' rollers in the 1960s, promotional t-shirts printed to advertise products also became common place. This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.",
