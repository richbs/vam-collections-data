James of Bow Street, London during his second London period when he lived in Bow Street, Covent Garden, from 1795 to 1800.\n\nIt advertises animals in Pidcock's menagerie at Exeter Change, an exhibition hall in London's Strand. The menagerie was divided into three rooms and included African lions, tigers, beavers, emus and ostriches. An advertisement referring to the two-headed heifer, or young cow on this token appeared in the 29th January 1791 edition of the London Chronicle. According to The Morning Chronicle in 1808, the animals could be viewed for a shilling a room, or all three rooms for two shillings and sixpence. Gilbert Pidcock began with a small travelling menagerie, but in 1793 bought the stock of Thomas Clark, a dealer in wild birds and animals who had the lease of Exeter Change. Pidcock kept his animals there but toured them to London fairs and the provinces during the summer. Pidcock died in 1810 aged 67, and was succeeded by Polito and then Cross. All the animals were removed to the Surrey Zoological Gardens in about 1828, after which Exeter Change was demolished.",
