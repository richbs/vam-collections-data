In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nJones made many maritime photographs. This carefully framed group of three beached fishing boats is reminiscent of Jones' earlier watercolours and drawings. The distinctive wooden capstan and long turning handle, lying across the foreground, forms an integral part of the group. The triangular shape formed by the support at the left of the capstan, a shape which is echoed by the meeting of the handle meeting the shadow of the small boat, and by the dropped masts of the fishing boats.",
