Intricate decoration added novelty to the costly raw materials used on tableware and jewellery. At New Year courtiers presented gifts to the King and received a gift of gold or silver in return. The exchange demonstrated mutual loyalty and reinforced hierarchy at court. Portrait miniatures were a new, highly personal way of showing favour. Of Henry VIII's 2000 pieces of gold and silver, almost none has survived.<br><br>\n\nA grace cup was passed around the dinner table after prayers. This ivory cup is traditionally associated with the saint, Thomas Becket (about 1120-1170). It was mounted in silver-gilt during the ownership of Catherine of Aragon (1485-1536), the first of Henry VIII's queens. The cup is an outstanding example of Tudor goldsmith's work, with the antique heads and scrolling foliage making it an early surviving example of Renaissance influence on English silver."

Turned ivory bowl.\n[Cup] Turned ivory bowl with separate foot on a silver-gilt base, the lip and lining of silver-gilt. The base has a continuous band of applied beads in two in two-bead strips with a rotated angled wire above. Soldered to the base is a swaged strip with a lozenge repeat; above this is an openwork band cast in four sections, each 5.75cm long and 2 cm high. A concave  planished band is pierced with sixteen irregularly spaced holes. Two retain gems, held by split strips and two contain cast devices (a winged head growing from a pair of leaves). A rotated wire and a milled wire are surmounted by a cast trefoil  cresting. Inside the base a quarter-inch diameter rod terminates in a silver screwhead, its wing nut snapped off; within the bowl the dome-head nut is visible.\nThe lip-mount is in two parts. The lower section clasping the ivory bowl is chased in triangles and a cabled wire surrounds a swaged strip. Above this the bowl lining extends aas a broad burnished area chased with an inscription, VINUM TUUM BIBE CUM GAUDIO, within a chased border on a wriggled backgound. A punched swaged strip rises to the thickened applied rim.\n(P. Glanville, <font -u>Silver in Tudor and Early Stuart England</font>, No. 7.)\n[Lid] The turned ivory cover applied with an inscribed silver-gilt band; also a silver-gilt lining with a central shaft supporting three shaped sections, terminating in a figure group of St George and the Dragon. The lip of the cover is double, a cast openwork band enclosing a plain band; within this is a silver-gilt sheet to which the central shaft is soldered. The band is cast in three sections, each 10 cm long and 2 cm high, and is composed of seven urns between paired foliage scrolls; in the centre of the foliage are quatrefoils, set alternately with three garnets and four pearl clusters (three pearls are missing). The openwork band rests on a rotated wire surmounted by a cast pierced border. The turned circular ivory lid is chipped at its outer edge and has been recut in the centre; it may have originally been fitted with an ivory finial. An inscribed silver-gilt convex circular band attached  to it by pins bears the chased inscription, ESTOTE SOBRII. The words alternate with a mitre, between the linked initials TB and two pomegranates, twice repeated.\nOn the stem are threaded three graded components and a ring: the lowest and largest is a vertical cast openwork band, of the same design as that of the foot, through which four irregularly spaced holes are pierced. Three contain double or single pearls in split pins; one is empty. The upper surface is gadrooned and pierced with eight holes at irregular intervals, two with table-cut garnets, two with pairs of pearls, one with a paste in a cabled wire setting and three empty; on both surfaces the location of the gems is unrelated to the design. \nThe middle component is raised from sheet, its lower part shaped into lobes and with a central applied swag strip on the upper concave surface two square-cut gems seperate seven and eight pearls held by twelve split pins. The ring is formed of a soldered strip, chased and engraved: + FERARE GOD. The smallest component is raised from sheet, its lower part shaped into lobes and with a central applied swaged strip. Four square-cut gems with pairs of pearls between pierce the concave upper surface. Each of the finial elements has a series of pin-holes on the shaft.\nThe cast figure group, St George in contemporary armour spearing the dragon (height from base 5 cm, of dragon overall 3.2 cm), is soldered to a screw with a hand-made right-hand thread. The group is cast in at least four parts: the dragon, the figure, the plume and the spear.\n(P. Glanville, <font -u>Silver in Tudor and Early Stuart England</font>, No. 7.)",

            "public_access_description": "Object Type\n'Grace' cups were passed round when a traditional grace (a prayer of thanksgiving) was said to give thanks for the food eaten. Robert Burton, in his  Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) described their use as 'a corollary to conclude the feast and continue their mirth, a grace cup came in to cheer their hearts and they drank healths to one another again and again'.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe silver mounts have London hallmarks for 1525-1526, but the ivory bowl may date back to the 12th century. The bowl has long been associated with the martyred medieval saint Thomas \u00e0 Becket (born about 1120, died 1170), although this is impossible to prove. Becket was Archbishop of Canterbury under Henry II (ruled 1154-1189). After a lengthy quarrel with Henry, he was murdered by four knights as he knelt praying in Canterbury Cathedral. The initials 'TB' and a bishop's mitre appear on the cover mounts, but the initials cannot be matched to any bishop in the 1520s, when the mounts were made. It is therefore possible that they refer to Becket. The cup has been passed down through the Howard family since 1614.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis cup is an extremely interesting example of the work of Tudor goldsmiths. It combines Renaissance and  Gothic ornament, and is one of the few objects in  precious metal that shows the transition between the two styles. An interest in classical ornament can be seen in the cast frieze of masks and ornaments. These were taken from the designs of the painter Hans Burgkmair I (1473-1531), which were circulating in England in the 1520s. There are, however, still signs of Gothic ornament in the pierced cresting around the foot and cover.",

The physical evidence is as follows: an X-ray revealed that the ivory stem does not fit tightly to the body and may be a later replacement. The shaft of the finial has been resoldered through the cover  plate, with some loss of metal on the underside; this has the effect of shortening it. The cover plate is now in tension and bowed, compressing the components; the turning on the underside of the ivory cover has scored the silver-gilt plate; on two of the three larger components the centre portions have been compressed until they are concave; and on the third the gilding on the gadrooning has been worn by the rotating action of screwing down the finial. The collar on the largest component no longer has a structural function. None of the components (except the middle one) fits the shaft tightly. The location of sets of pin-holes on the shaft and on each component indicates that, from the early nineteenth century (1818, 1849), the ring was set between the largest and the next component; the pins were presumably inserted as a strengthening device subsequent to the shortening of the shaft. However, this  differs from the 1741 drawing. Later illustrations (1862, 1901) of the cup show the components stacked in a different order again from that indicated by the pin-holes; South Kensington Loan Exhibition, 1862 and Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition, 1901. The present arrangement of the finial is an attempt to get closer to its original appearance, as indicated by the 1741 Society of Antiquaries drawing and by the principles governing Renaissance art, which found a tapering form more agreeable.\n(P.
