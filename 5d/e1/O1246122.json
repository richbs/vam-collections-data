First produced in 2003, this deck is a 2001 re-release. The characters, therefore, relate to episodes of the popular TV show that are nearly a decade old; this testifies to the popularity and endurance of both the Top Trumps format and the Simpsons TV show, a combination that has given Winning Moves their best-selling pack to date.\n\nThe Simpsons family appear in many guises including vampires and witches, alongside other characters from their hometown of Springfield, including Mr Burns and Ned Flanders.  Players compete in the categories Stupendous Strength, Sheer Evil, Blazing Speed, Graveyard Compatibility, Brains and Fashion Sense.\n\nThe game:\nTop Trumps is a competitive card game which first became a craze in school playgrounds in the mid 1970s. The game developed from \u2018quartets\u2019, which had a similar objective: to beat your opponents and win all the 40 or so cards. \n\nSold for pocket money prices, in the early days Top Trumps was marketed mainly to boys, and the military-focused subjects included cars, planes and trucks. In 1982, Waddingtons took over the brand and determined to broaden the game\u2019s appeal, introducing decks featuring cats and dogs as well as horror characters, football teams and prehistoric monsters.\n\nIn 1999 Winning Moves relaunched the brand, producing smaller decks of only 30 cards and tying the games in to popular culture. They now produce packs for every major event, TV series and film release.",
