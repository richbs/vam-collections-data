In the middle is a medallion with the Virgin and child, standing on a cloud with a landscape behind her. In her left hand is an instrument with two robes and two 'bags'. Above her a tester in silver with drapery, also in silver, with blue lines all around, and below her a white ribbon which might be of a later date. On either side of the medallion is a bunch of flowers, painted in naturalistic colours (combinations of blue, red and white). Similar flowers are depicted on the four sides. Below the medallion is the coat of arms of the Chigi-family of Siena and Rome: 6 bee-hives, above these a six-pointed star and below the two crossed axes. In the four corners are a wavy pattern with scrollwork in the so-characteristic early 18th century forms. All the ornaments and the scrollwork (not the medallion or the bunches of flowers) have been decorated with small punches in eight different forms ('feathered compass', diagonal cable, block with cables, plain lines, squares with a centre, double circle with knots, double circle with rays, feather).",

            "public_access_description": "As their name suggests, altar frontals are hangings of leather or rich textiles, used to decorate the fronts of altars. Different altar frontals may be used at different times of the liturgical year, to follow the pattern of liturgical colours and emblems for times of festival or penitence. This frontal almost certainly formed part of a set with another surviving frontal that bears the same coat of arms and is now in a private collection in England. This example is decorated to imitate richly embroidered Italian frontals of about 1700. It appears to have been made from one hide, although, in fact, it was assembled from different pieces of leather in such a way as as to conceal the joints. The coat of arms is that of the Chigi family, who were based in Siena and Rome, and were bankers to the popes. The exact provenance of this piece remains unknown, but it would have originally come from a private chapel at one of their properties or from a church connected with their family.",
