The photograph, which was made by the albumen print process, was taken by an unknown photographer in 1867. The photograph shows a model by James Redfern (1837-1876)  for one of the figures of the Virtues for the base of the fl\u00e8che of the Albert Memorial, Hyde Park, London. The base of the model is inscribed around the base of the plinth 'Girded about with Truth'. This model was not made into an electroformed figure and erected on the fl\u00e8che.  The figure of Temperance which was executed and installed on the fl\u00e8che is similar. It also holds a girdle in two hands although only one is lowered.",

This model was not made into an electroformed figure and erected on the fl\u00e8che.  The figure of Temperance, which is on the fl\u00e8che, is similar because it holds a ribbon in two hands although only one is lowered.\n\nAttribution note: This photograph is of a small-scale plaster model of the figure which is squared up for transfer to a larger size. The larger plaster model was intended to be electroformed in copper. This was done by making the plaster model electroconductive through the application of a paint that contains metal particles. Elecroforming is a process of metal fabrication using electrodeposition in a plating bath over a base form or mandrel which is subsequently removed.  A metal skin is built up on the surface of the plaster model, that has been made electroconductive. Once the metal skin is built up to the desired thickness, the electroformed part is stripped off the base form or mandrel, in this case the plaster model.  This photograph was taken nearer to the model and is more in focus than the same figure photographed in E.399-2006.",
