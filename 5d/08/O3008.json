The decoration, in gold leaf and painted enamels, was applied after the goblet had been shaped and cooled. The glass then went back into the mouth of the furnace, where the enamels would melt and fuse with the glass surface. Once fired, the enamels cannot be rubbed off.\nFinely decorated glass from Murano was a luxury product, much more expensive than glass made for daily use at other local Italian glass workshops. \n\nLeading families thoughout Italy and also beyond, ordered their finest glass from Venice. Single dishes and goblets, decorated with family arms, have survived from the Renaissance period, but it is possible that they were once part of more extensive sets.\n\nThe Salviati were one of the leading families from Florence. They are known to have ordered several sets of decorated tin-glazed earthenware (maiolica) bearing their coat of arms. This goblet is the only surving glass with their arms.",

They are known to have ordered several sets of decorated tin-glazed earthenware (maiolica) bearing their coat of arms. This goblet is the only surving glass with their arms.",
