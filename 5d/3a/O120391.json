By the pillars at the back so not be led into error, nor by the red chalk) Pen and brown inks and red chalk on laid paper, watermark Briquet 4950. 42.9 x 31.5 cm\nVAM D.199-1888\n\nPresumably both iron-gall and carbon inks were used in this drawing. It is an interesting example of the design process of 16th century stained glass manufacture, the architectural elements and the armorial shields appear to be drawn in a hand different from that which drew the figures, and it is likely that they are by a draughtsman from the glass workshop which had been commissioned to make this panel. The draughtsman thus provided the structural framework within which Baldung was to work in supplying the figures of the six nuns, and it is probable that the written instructions are from him to Baldung also. The red chalk lines were often used to show the cutting lines but here they are used to indicate the general layout of the design.\n(C.

It is thought to have been commissioned by Veronica of Andlau when she became Abbess of the convent, in about 1508 (although Butts and Hendrix date the drawing to about 1510). Veronica of Andlau is identified as the woman at the fore of the group, holding a rod-like object. The window does not survive, having been destroyed in a peasant's revolt of 1525 or in a fire some decades after that.\nA partner to this drawing is in the colllection of Gottingen University (Koch, cat. 72). It shows kneeling male donors, led by Knight Veltin of Andlau.  It is difficult to know how the two designs fitted into the greater scheme for the window.\n\nHistorical significance: Hans Baldung trained under Durer and is regarded as one of his most talented followers. Many of Baldung's stained-glass designs survive. This drawing, and its partner in Gottingnen, are among the few that relate to large windows.",

            "historical_context_note": "The designer and glass-painter were two separate roles. The designer, Baldung, would have passed this drawing to the glass-painter in order for the latter to carry out the work. Certain details are drawn very clearly and there are written instructions and colour notes to assist the glass-painter. The red chalk lines indicate the position of the leads. These are the elements the designer felt he needed to specify to the glass-painter. At the same time, the upper right section of the drawing has been left unfinished. This is because this section would be a direct mirror of that on the left. Such economy is typical of drawings produced by designers for makers, and shows a working-familiarity between the two: the glass-painter would never have been in any doubt about what was intended to fill the blank section.",
