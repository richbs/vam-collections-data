Barrie's 'Peter Pan' at the Barbican Theatre,  from 1982 until 1985. It was not the hook worn by the villainous pirate Captain James Hook but a larger one, designed to be regurgitated by the crocodile at the end to indicate that all the edible parts of Captain Hook have been consumed. In the play we learn that Hook is terrified of the crocodile since he lost his hand to it so the final appearance of this hook is a nice touch, added by the director, after the crocodile finally gets his man.\n\nThe hook, a very well-made and sturdy theatrical prop, was given to the museum by the actor Stephen Moore.  He played the Storyteller, Mr Darling and Captain Hook in the 1984 and 1985 revivals of Peter Pan which Trevor Nunn and John Caird adapted for performance at the Barbican Theatre when it was the London home of the RSC.  The museum doesn't own any other examples of hooks used by any other Captain Hooks over the years, but has costumes worn by Pauline Chase and by Zena Dare, both notable early Peters.",
