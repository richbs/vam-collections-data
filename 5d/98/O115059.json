Multicoloured abstract shapes are appliqu\u00e9d on the sleeves. \n\nThis dress might have been designed by Natalia Goncharova, a Russian artist who emigrated to Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution. Natalia Goncharova (1881-1962) had a long career with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. She produced astonishing costumes that were inspired by her Russian background and her work as an avant-garde artist. Like many Russian refugees in Paris, she also designed dresses. These strongly reflected her work for Diaghilev. Between 1922 and 1926, she worked for the Maison Myrbor (House of Myrbor). This exclusive shop was owned by the Italian Marie Cuttoli. It sold fashion, rugs and curtains designed by the international avant-garde.",

She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nAt the time of acquisition, Miss Grigsby's friend, Miss Chisholm said that the patchwork on this dress was similar to the work of Madame Coutoli, who had workshops in Algeria.",
