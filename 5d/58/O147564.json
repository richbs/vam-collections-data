A small number of these five medals were made up into sets and presented to the twenty-four Commissioners who were responsible for the organisation of the exhibition. The president of the Commissioners was Prince Albert, whose set is now in the V&A and an additional set, presented to Queen Victoria, is in the Royal Collection.\nThe medals are housed in a presentation box bound in red leather with heavy brass hinges and clasps with gilt tooling and lined with blue velvet and watered silk. The silk inside the lid is inscribed with gold lettering naming the recipient",
