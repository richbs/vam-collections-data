She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nHistorical significance: Night life became the focus for post-war exuberance and gave birth to the most glamorous evening fashion of the new century.
