Even when girls' schools began to be founded some experts advised that domestic skills were preferable for adolescent girls (enabling them to care for their homes and families) but that academic work would be harmful to them.  \n\nThe earlier boys' schools taught the classical subjects such as Latin, Greek, rhetoric, logic, grammar and mathematics, which were considered suitable for the education of a gentleman's son (who would not need paid employment), or for those who would go into the professions of law, medicine or religion. \n\nThe broader-based curriculum in use for much of the twentieth century was only introduced gradually, although what was perhaps rather adventurous was the introduction of swimming lessons in school time by the London School Board toward the end of the 19th century.",
