Behind these scenes are the more diminutive Betrayal, the Mocking of Christ, the Crowning with Thorns, Christ presented to the people (Ecce Homo), the Deposition, the Descent into Limbo, The Three Maries at the Sepulchre, Christ appearing to St Mary Magdalene (Noli me tangere) and Christ appearing to the Three Maries.

            "public_access_description": "The altarpiece was originally made for the collegiate church at Lirey, near Troyes. The donor, who kneels in the robes at the foot of the Cross in the central panel , was Jean Huyard l' Aine (d.1541): his coat of arms appears in the spandrel between the two arches on the left panel, while a variant, quartered with other arms is shown on the right-hand side.\nThe donor was qualified as a lawyer and became canon of the church of St Peter and Paul in Troyes some time after 1487 and in 1504 he was elected Dean of the chapter of Lirey. The church in Lirey was consecrated in 1526. This retable probably decorated the high altar, was ready by then. No documentary information about the commission or the sculptor is known.\n\nThe style of the altarpiece is transitional between the late Gothic and Renaissance forms which is typical for the altarpieces in limestone produced in Troyes and are to be found in the regions of the Champagne and Aube. The scenes of the Flagellation, the Betrayal of Christ, Christ carrying the cross and Christ presented to the people are based on Albrecht D\u00fcrer's engravings of the Small and Large Passion of 1511 and 1512 respectively.",

The scenes of the Flagellation, the Betrayal of Christ, Christ carrying the cross and Christ presented to the people are based on Albrecht D\u00fcrer's engravings of the Small and Large Passion of 1511 and 1512 respectively.",
