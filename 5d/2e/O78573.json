Coconuts were more easily and cheaply available in Britain than other imported materials that were considered exotic, such as ostrich eggs. By the mid-16th century they had declined in popularity, as more unusual materials became available in Western Europe. The mounts on coconut cups of this date are usually much plainer than earlier ones. There is no decoration on the mounts of this example, but the shimmering, smooth surfaces of the plain mounts make an elegant contrast to the highly-polished dark bowl. \n\nOwnership & Use\nFrom the 13th century coconuts and other organic materials such  as shells and ostrich eggs were highly valued in Western Europe for their rarity and exoticism. Easily turned on a lathe and polished, coconuts were transformed by the addition of silver or silver-gilt mounts to form an intrinsic part of the 'Curiosities' of a princely collectors' cabinet. Although often taking the form of functional vessels, mounted coconut cups were intended as display pieces. Coconut cups continued to be produced in the 17th century, but they  were no longer considered as 'curiosities' unless they were intricately carved.",
