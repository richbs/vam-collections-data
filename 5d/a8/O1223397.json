The actors are said to be Hannah Pritchard and her daughter,  James Quin and Lavinia Fenton, with  the author Henry Fielding. It has been pointed out that neither Quin nor Lavinia Fenton were members of the Drury Lane company and, given that the action of the painting is supposed to take place during the period 1728-1732 and Barry did not make his first stage appearance until 1744, the identification of the players is suspect. According to a printed caption on the print, the painting is in the collection of Lord Glenconner. It is now held by the Mellon collection at Yale University.",
