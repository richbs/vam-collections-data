The front-flap is decorated with breaking waves upon which float a lozenge and jewels. A pavilion stands upon pierced rocks, enshrining a vase from whose mouth issues a trail of cloud which expands to support a two-handled vase of flowering peony. A sacred fungus bearing the ch'ing or musical stone of jade is also inserted in this vase. Upon the seat is a quatrefoil compartment filled with a cross-shaped scrollwork device of flowers and buds.\n\nThe back has a design of two pheasants standing upon pierced rockery rising from waters with a flowering peony in the background and a butterfly, whilst a flowering branch of magnolia projects from the right. On the overhanging back-flap is a large musical stone suspended on strings and a swastika. On either side are branches of peach and clouds. Bats and floral sprays are scattered over the whole of the gold ground. A border of key-fret is punctuated at regular intervals by small dragon heads in gold on a deep-blue ground and runs round the whole hanging.",
