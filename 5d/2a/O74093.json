The bodice and sleeves are lined with natural linen. Hooks for attachment to the stomacher.\n\nThe petticoat includes pleating on the hips to accommodate a small rounded hoop. The back and front are flat. The front is bordered with a pierced furbelow to which is attached a matching braid to that of the bodice, and about it there is a deep curved frill trimmed with the same braid. Looped above is a further braid, trimmed and pierced frill with pieces of braid stitched between. Pocket slits. Silk waistband hooks and ties at the back.\n\nThe stomacher is triangular in shape with a rounded point and to which is gathered a trimming of yellow silk ribbon matching the gown.
