Her sister Jessica donated Crouching Youth and a work by their father, Mother and Child, to the V&A. Jessica 'was content to assist her father', but Winifred attended the Royal Academy Schools in London between 1924 and 1929. She was elected Fellow and Associate of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1930; she exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1924 and 1962.\nThis highly stylised figure reflects Turner's interest in ancient sculpture and also her passion for dance.
