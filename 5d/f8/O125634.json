            "public_access_description": "Great Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMozart\u2019s opera Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) (1786)  was performed to celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1955.  Critics praised Messel\u2019s exuberant pastiche of 18th-century art and design \u2018The d\u00e9cor by Oliver Messel was in his richest and most inventive vein, fully emphasising the unique blend of sharp satire and human understanding for the folly and unhappiness of the characters which Mozart so perfectly caught in his music\u2019 (The Tatler, 22 June, 1955).  \n\nMessel\u2019s costume for Susanna is a pastiche of 18th-century dress, a period which particularly inspired Messel, and was appropriate for Mozart\u2019s period.  Carl Ebert (1887-1980), Glyndebourne\u2019s artistic director from 1934-1959, endorsed Messel\u2019s approach to theatre design.  The pair collaborated on a number of Glyndebourne productions during the 1950s.",
