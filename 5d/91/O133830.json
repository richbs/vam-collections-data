The artist was part of the 43 Group, an art group which took inspiration from international art movements based in Paris and London as well as Santiniketan. Members of the group included painters George Keyt and Richard Gabriel. The 43 Group artists were able to create a more secular painting tradition than the one supported by the Ceylon Society of Arts. The artist died in 1969.\n\nIn this painting, we see a sombre landscape consisting of a black sky, two white abstract trees and a monk. The monk, who is dressed in a red robe sits in the foreground and looks towards the seashore.
