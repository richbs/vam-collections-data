Sarazin was a leading figure at the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise between 1729 and 1759, so it seems likely that the production was staged by this company between these dates.\n\nUnfortunately it is unclear which 'Mr. Rousseau' is depicted and although the philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) was alive during the period at which this production is likely to have been performed he does not seem a likely candidate for the actor depicted, having published treatises protesting about the immorality of the theatre. There are however numerous references to actors performing under the name of 'Mr. Rousseau' including a description of a benefit performance advertised in the Journal de la Basse-Normandie, 18th January 1789, in which two comic operas are being performed to raise money for the actor 'Sr Rousseau'. \n\nThe print is part of the Harry Beard Collection.",
