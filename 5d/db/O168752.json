The stem has a spherical, ivory knop, the surface carved with a series of fishes and stylised waves, held between two moulded collars, the lower collar embellished with a wavy edge.  The stem, knop and bowl are held together by a threaded rod, secured by a rectangular, silver nut, bearing the lion passant mark.  The planishing marks are still evident.  Round the base of the foot is an engraved Greek text, the words forming an acrostic for the Greek word FISH.  Interspersed with this text is an applied Greek cross.  The early Christian theme is repeated in the motif of the three fishes carved round the ivory knop.\n[Paten] Circular plain disc, slightly domed, silver with gilding on one side.
