The fillings are varied and very finely worked.\nThe lace is worked in light and darker brown hair, with both the edge and pattern outlined by the use of buttonhole stitches over a thicker hair  (horsehair ?). The stitches have been stabilised - they appear to have been gummed together with something akin to wax.",

            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nBecause of their fragility very few pieces of needle lace worked in hair survive from the 17th century. They are usually in the shape of a narrow band, like this, and one example has loops at the ends, suggesting it was meant to be fastened around something. It seems most likely that they were worn around the wrist, as a bracelet.\n\nOwnership & Use\nA reference in John Donne's early 17th century poem The Relique, suggests that bracelets worked in hair were given and worn as love tokens:\n\nWhen my grave is broke up againe\nSome second ghest to entertaine ...\nAnd he that digs it, spies\nA bracelet of bright haire about the bone,\nWill he not let us alone\nAnd thinke that there a loving couple lies...\n\n[the poem continues]\nWho thought that this device might be some way\nto make their soules, at the last busie day,\nmeet at this grave, and make a little stay ?...\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis piece of lace is worked in light and darker brown hair, which is probably human, but the pattern has been outlined with a thicker hair which may be horsehair. The stitches have been secured with a gummed substance, possibly wax, as the hair with which they are worked is more naturally springy and elastic than the linen or silk thread in which needle lace was usually worked in this period. The stitches used to make needle lace in England were part of the embroiderer's repertoire, being taught as a basic part of a young girl's needlework education.",
