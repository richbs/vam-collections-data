Inc. Salem. Mass. USA Patent Application No.  6958/53\nManufactured by England by John Waddington Ltd Makers of Monopoly\n\nFolding playing board dark green outer with label showing title and details, which are also on playing surface.  Surface shows 82 squares each of blue, pink, yellow and green, a block of colour in each square crossed with single squares of the other colours and edged on 2 sides by single squares of the other colours.  In the centre of the board are 29 beige and 4 purple squares in the shape of a + and the word Keyword horizontally and vertically in centre squares.\n\nTHE OBJECT OF THE GAME\nEach player by playing his letter blocks to the cross word layout on the board tries to spell the Keyword or other words, and to play his letters on the squares that give him the largest score.  A player should try to play out all his letters before his opponents, for letters left in a player's hand at the end of play are counted against him.  The highest score wins the game.\n\nBOARD AND KEY SQUARES\nIn the centre of the board there are three gray squares runningdown and three across.  These are starting squares; the first htree letters of the first word placed on the board must be placed in these squares either down or across.  The following players then build from this word in any direction they wish.\nThere are four colour areas on the board which correspond in colour to the players' letter block racks.  Thus if a player is using the Red rack, his colour area is all the Red squares.  He tries to place as many letters as possible in his own colour area, for letters placed by a player on any square of his own colour Count Double.  If a player places a letter on any of the Key squares he receives 20 points additional score plus 5 points for the letter played.  This score is doubled if the Key square is his own colour.\n\nKEYWORD CARDS.\nThere are a number of Keyword cards.  These cards are placed at the side of the board face down.  At the start of the game the player keeping score tuns one of the Keyword cards face up.  Any player, at any time in the game, when it is his turn to play, who is able to spell this Keyword on the board receives 50 points additional score.  After a Keyword has been spelled on the board by a player, another Keyword card is turned face-up.\n\n\nFURTHER FULL DETAILS OF THE RULES ARE GIVEN IN THE PHOTOCOPIES AVAILABLE \nAS ARE THE RULES FOR KEYWORD PATIENCE\n\nRules placement: separate sheet",
