            "public_access_description": "John Smart was based in Madras for the decade he was working in India, and although he left India in 1795, his connection with the Binney family was clearly resumed in London, where this double portrait was painted. Charles Binney had been Secretary to an Indian ruler who lived near Madras. Harriet and Elizabeth were Binney\u2019s daughters. Harriet (on the left) married Andrew Trevor in 1797, surgeon to the 33rd Regiment of Foot, the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. (Andrew Trevor was an ancestor of Miss Joan Gwladis Trevor, who gave this wonderful watercolour to the V&A.) In the 1780s Smart began to paint small oval watercolour portraits on paper, offering clients a quicker and cheaper alternative to his miniatures on ivory. This double portrait is a superb elaboration of this style of work, which would have been very laborious for Smart to have painted on ivory. However, the disadvantage of paper is its tendency to discolour with age, which is what gives this picture its slight brown tinge.",

            "bibliography": "<i>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</i>London: V&A, 1985, p.96\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"John Smart c.1742-1811\n<i>British School</i> \nMISS HARRIET AND MISS ELIZABETH BINNEY \nSigned and dated <i>John Smart pinxt 1806</i> \nWater-colour, oval 22.3 X 24.2 cm \nP.20-1978 \n\nThe miniature portrait enjoyed a revival during the later 18th century; it did not, however, regain its former status as a court art. There were still aristocratic patrons, but also many new clients amongst the wealthy middle class. John Smart, one of the outstanding miniaturists of the period, found most of his sitters amongst the ranks of the military and colonial classes. \n\nThis double portrait is exceptional in several respects. It is unusually large for a miniature. In this it reflects its date: by the 19th century the miniature was no longer designed as a keepsake or piece of jewellery to be worn by the owner. Miniature painting was simply another form of portraiture, and its practitioners began to adapt their techniques and format to compete with the conventional wall-hung portrait in oils. The large size probably explains why this picture was painted on card, and not on the ivory base which was more commonly used for miniatures. However it had always been Smart's practice to make preliminary drawings on paper so he was well able to adapt his techniques. Instead of the usual head and shoulders view, the two girls, seated at the harpsichord, are shown three-quarter length. \n\nThis is a remarkably sophisticated portrait for Smart whose work was usually simple and direct, focusing on the personality of the sitter and avoiding elaborate costume or accessories. He has used the lateral oval skilfully, making a positive virtue of the empty spaces. The curves of the girls' arms, and their shallow d\u00e9colletages echo the shape of the frame. The cool restrained Neo-Classicism of colour and style is in keeping with the fashionable costume and elaborate Empire-style hair ornament of the sitters. A typical feature in Smart, each girl smiles slightly. The whole is very finely detailed, with brilliant handling of flesh and fabric. \nThe water-colour is applied in the soft stippled manner characteristic of Smart. \n\nIn fact Smart's style changed very little through his career: works of the 1760s bear all the hall-marks of his maturity. This was perhaps due to his modest and isolated practice. \nHe spent ten years in India from 1785, painting members of the British community, and the household of the Nawab of Arcot. He painted Charles Binney, Secretary to the Nawab, in 1797, after Binney's return to London. This gentleman was obviously well-pleased with the result, and commissioned this portrait of his daughters Harriet (on the left) and Elizabeth (right) in 1806.\n\nGillian Saunders\"",
