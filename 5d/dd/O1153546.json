He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.  \n\nRing Round the Moon, a translation of Jean Anouilh's play L'Invitation au Ch\u00e2teau by Christopher Fry, was first performed at the Globe Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre), in 1950. Fry described as a 'charade with music'. It is a poetic fantasy of love and confusion with a fairytale ending. Margaret Rutherford played a formidable dowager who, said The Times, 'doubles the parts of fairy godmother and wicked fairy, with some assistance from a cheroot as long as her romantically snobbish memory'. In the published text the character was called Madame Desmermortes, but in production the name was simplified to Desmortes.",

The production, presented by H. M. Tennent Productions Ltd, was directed by Peter Brook, with a cast that included Paul Scofield, Claire Bloom and Margaret Rutherford.  \n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
