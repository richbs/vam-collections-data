Contemporary usage of the designation is generally confined to situations in which the term is considered relevant in an historical context, and is today generally archaic in its usage due to its association with slavery, colonial and racial oppression. Accepted modern terms in place of \"mulatto\" include \"mixed race\", \"biracial\", or \"multiracial\".",
