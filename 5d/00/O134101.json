Articled to a legal attorney; taught himself painting. Exhibited seven works at the RA between 1836 and 1855, 28 at the BI 1828-63, and 194 at the SBA 1833-70 (elected Member 1842, and later Vice-President). Subjects principally landscapes, mainly river and lake scenes; his style was much influenced by J M W Turner. Travelled in Switzerland and Italy 1846, and Germany and Italy 1851. Published 'Windsor, With Its Surrounding Scenery' nd [1838-40], 'The English Lake District' (Manchester 1853), and 'The Lake Scenery of England' (1859). There are also several drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. Died 29 July 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 25 February 1871. \n\nLIT: MS <u>Picture Memoranda</u> 1840-1868 National Art Library collection, V&A; <u>Art Journal</u> 1856, pp205-8; 1870, p276 (obit); <u>Athenaeum</u> 13 August 1870, pp217-8 (obit); \n\n<b>The Bay of  Naples</b> \n498-1870 Neg E760 \nCanvas, 67.3 X 101.6 cm (26\u00bd X 40 ins) \nSigned and dated 'JBPYNE 1868 No 721' br \nParsons Bequest 1870 \n\nThe number inscribed on the work refers to the artist's manuscript <u>Memoranda;</u> the work does not seem to have been exhibited, and may have been commissioned directly by Parsons. \nThe view is recorded as seen from the Villa Rocco Romano, Strada \tNuova. It seems to have been a popular view for artists; Joseph Wright of Derby, for example, painted a moonlight version, but seen from further down and to the right (private collection, see B Nicholseon <u>Joseph Wright of Derby: Painter of Light</u> 1968, I, cat no 267, repr II, pl 291). The work is also similar, particularly in composition, to certain early works by J M W Turner, such as 'Lake of Geneva' (exh 1810, Los Angeles County Museum), 'Lake Avernus' (1814-5, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA), and 'Bay of Baiae' (exh 1823, Tate Gallery). \n\nEXH: <i>Paesaggio Napoletano nella Pittura Straniera</i> Palazzo Reale, Naples, 1962 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
