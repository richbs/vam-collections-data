The firm of  Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot was one of the most important and influential Parisian silversmiths at the beginning of the 19th century. Skilful practitioners of the neo-classical style, Odiot were patronised by the aristocracy of Europe. J.B. C. Odiot's son, Charles Nicolas studied English technique and style at Garrards and took over the family business in 1827. Tea drinking after dinner became fashionable in the early 19th century, even in France. In 1827, Domestic Economy and Cookery for Rich and Poor  reported that  \" In France, now, the tea-table is partially introduced to accommodate the English, which serves to show off their nice cakes and bon bons\u2026\"",

This is part of a composite tea service, made up from pieces marked for Jean-Baptiste (master 1785) and his son Charles-Nicolas Odiot (mark in use from 1826).\n\nHistorical significance: The Odiot workshop was one of the largest, most prestigious in Paris, supplying the court and aristocracy. It was quite usual to make up sets of tea, coffee or other services from stock. Designs and casting patterns were kept and re-used as necessary.\n\nThe bowl is characteristic of Odiot's production and the so-called \"Empire\" style, popular in France in the early 19th century. The use of classical motifs and figures applied to plain surfaces, and for pouring vessels, spouts ending in animal's heads are typical. It was considered the epitome of French stylishness in England. The French craft, on the other hand, looked to England for technical developments; Charles-Nicolas spent some time working as a modeller for Garrards in London.",
