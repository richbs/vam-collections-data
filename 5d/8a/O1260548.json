This example is a version of a positional puzzle where squares have to be moved around within a confined area and put into order. Numerical and alphabetical ones are the most common of this type but there were also examples that used pictures and people. These hark back to the nineteenth century fascination with misfit cards where one could put people or characters together from a sequence of picture cards, or make up one's own versions by mixing up the cards.",
