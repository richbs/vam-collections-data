It would have been used for curtains and loose covers on chairs and beds.\n\nHistorical Association\nThe cotton was printed by one of the leading Lancashire printers and exhibited in the Great Exhibition of 1851 by one of the top London furnishing shops, such as Jackson & Graham. In 1852 it was exhibited by Henry Cole  in his 'False Principles in Design' exhibition (catalogue no.16) at the Museum of Ornamental Art at Marlborough House, London, and the sample still retains part of its original label for the exhibition.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis particular design was singled out as bad decoration by Henry Cole because of the 'imitation of ribbon upon chintz, direct imitation of moss roses, want of symmetrical arrangement'. In the introduction to the section on chintz in the exhibition catalogue Richard Redgrave  (1804-1888), one of Cole's colleagues,  warned that 'the use of imitative floral ornament is peculiarly unsuitable on account of the folds ... The present mode of ornamenting these fabrics seems to have arisen from the false spirit of imitation -  a desire to rival the richness of silk.'",
