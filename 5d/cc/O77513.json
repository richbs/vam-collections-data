It was an apt subject for Copeland's new statuary porcelain, which imitated marble.\n\nMaterials & Making\nCopeland and Garrett claimed to be the first to develop statuary porcelain on a commercial scale in about 1845.  This unglazed bone china was vitrified through the use of feldspar, which gave it its marble-like appearance.  The Great Exhibition juries awarded Copeland's 'statuary porcelain' a coveted prize medal for 'general excellence'.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Taylor Copeland became the owner of the Spode porcelain factory in 1833 and Thomas Garrett joined him as partner until 1847 when the company became W.T. Copeland & Sons. The firm produced unglazed porcelain until about 1930.\n\nThe artist, William Theed (1804-1891), trained in Rome and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1842.  He often produced works based on classical and biblical subjects.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe antique head from which Copeland's Juno was modelled was originally part of a colossal statue, the body of which is now lost.  Scholars of classical sculpture now think that she may represent a real person - probably a Roman noblewoman of the 1st century BC, such as Mark Antony's daughter Antonia, or Livia, the wife of Augustus.",
