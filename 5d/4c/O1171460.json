This example features a portrait of the American new wave/punk group, Blondie, and was most likely to have been produced for a teenager's bedroom.\n\nThe picture features the band's logo as it appeared on the cover of the 1979 album Eat to the Beat. Blondie were at the height of their fame when this album was released, although it was a bigger hit in the UK than in the US, with the single Atomic reaching number 1 in the music charts. The photograph on the mirror relegates Debbie Harry, the singer and global sex symbol, to the bottom right corner rather than centre stage. Around this time Blondie had been running a badge campaign with the slogan \"Blondie Is A Band\", to keep the focus of attention on the band as a whole and not just on Harry.",
