(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 69, 75-77\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"This is a preliminary study, presumably from nature, for the cottage and lane seen in the composition known as \u2018The Glebe Farm\u2019, of which there are two versions in the Tate Gallery (Nos. 1823 and 1247), and another version, the authenticity of which is open to question, in the Barber Institute (see the <i>Catalogue of Paintings\u2026in the Barber Insitute</i>, Cambridge, 1952, pp. 18-19; and for the two pictures in the Tate Gallery see M. Chamot, \u2018The Constable Room at the Tate Gallery\u2019, <i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. CXXXVII, 1956, pp. 260-1).  Constable used also to call the composition \u2018The Green Lane\u2019.  That Langham Church does not figure in No. 111 [161-1888] is accounted for by the fact that \u2018The Glebe Farm\u2019 shows a composite view; Shirley (L. ed. S., pp. 215-16) says that the composition of the two pictures in the Tate Gallery seems to combine two viewpoints and that the church cannot be seen from the path at the bottom of the hill shown in No. 111 [161-1888].  Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 372) remarks that he visited Langham in 1840 \u201cwhere all is so much changed excepting the church, that we could scarcely recognise it as the scene of the \u2018Glebe Farm\u2019\u201d.  Shirley reproduces the two paintings in the Tate Gallery on Pl. 102 and Pl. 103a.\nShirley (S.: L., pp. 181-2) says that No. 111 [161-1888] is apparently the original sketch from which Lucas began his first plate of \u2018The Glebe Farm\u2019, which was subsequently changed into a composition called \u2018Castle Acre Priory\u2019 (S. 22).  This plate, however, seems to have had the church in it from the beginning, and the basis of the engraving may have been a version resembling the Tate Gallery\u2019s painting No. 1823.  A farmhouse similar to that shown here, but placed by the water\u2019s edge, is seen in the large sketch \u2018On the Stour\u2019 in the Kennedy Memorial Gallery, Los Angeles, but this composition is more nearly related to our No. 403 [141-1888] and is discussed in the note on that sketch.  Shirley (L. ed. S., p. 223) dates No. 111 [161-1888] <i>c.</i>1826, basing his opinion upon the year when the finished version of \u2018The Glebe Farm\u2019 was exhibited, in 1827, but this must be held on grounds of style to be far too late.  Badt (<i>John Constable\u2019s Clouds</i>, 1950) reproduces No. 111 [161-1888] on Pl. 6 with the Tate Gallery\u2019s \u2018Mill Stream\u2019 (No. 1816) and implies in his text, p. 52, that he regards them as having been made at the same time, in 1811, that being the year assigned by Holmes to Tate Gallery No. 1816.  Whether or not Constable\u2019s methods changed after 1820 as a result of the publication of Luke Howard\u2019s <i>The Climate of London</i>, the stylistic deduction is perfectly valid.  The clouds here are rather angular in form and painted with conspicuous bristle marks.  Both these features are to be seen in No. 103 [135-1888], here assigned tentatively to <i>c.</i>1811.  As with No. 110 [166-1888] then, the analogy with Tate Gallery No. 1816 may be held to justify a dating of <i>c.</i>1810-15.\n\nNote on Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888]\n\nNos. 109-113 form a miscellaneous and somewhat unhomogeneous group.  Most of them have either been assigned to a date near 1811 or may be compared with another oil sketch assigned to that date.  Accordingly, though their general character hardly warrants a dating more exact than <i>c.</i>1810-15 or within even wider limits, they are grouped together here.  Their relationship to Nos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888], the earliest oil sketches in the Museum to show the full effect of the revolution in Constable\u2019s style, helps to justify this grouping.\"",
