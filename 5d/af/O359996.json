At the top of the medallion is a crest consisting of a hand holding stag's horns, which may allude to the Rangership of Whaddon.",

Its border would hang down vertically from the table's edge. The carpet would be covered up or removed if the table was used. 'Foot carpets' occasionally appear in contemporary paintings, in which case they are intended to indicate the high social standing of the sitter who can afford to have such an object underfoot.\n\nAlthough embroidered furnishings were sometimes made in the home in this period, this carpet would have been produced in a professional workshop. It contains the initials NA, GG and GP, worked discretely at the ends, which may be those of the embroiderers.The tension of the embroidery stitches has pulled the canvas from a rectangular into a parallelogram shape.",
