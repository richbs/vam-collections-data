In 1929, he became principal art director of the publishing house Dru\u017estevn\u00ed pr\u00e1ce (Co-operative Work), which had in 1927 opened a shop and gallery in Prague under the name Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 jizba (Beautiful Household), selling domestic objects of Modernist design including those of the Bauhaus. Finding it problematic to source appropriate products to satisfy their vision, Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 jizba began to organise the production of its own tableware from 1929, with Sutnar contributing a number of designs.\nThis glass tea set was among such designs, and was produced for Dru\u017estevn\u00ed pr\u00e1ce from 1931 by the Czech firm Kavalier, who were the patent holders for the new heat-resistant glass pioneered in America. The set was made in large quantities and was widely used in Czechoslovakia. The earliest sets were fitted with Bakelite handles, though this was replaced by wood on sets from 1934-35 onwards. The design is exactly contemporary with the better-known heat-resistant glass tea set by William Wagenfeld, examples of which can also been found in the museums collection.",
