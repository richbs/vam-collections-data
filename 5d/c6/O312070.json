            "history_note": "This imposing marble bust shows Cardinal Gian Carlo de\u2019 Medici (Florence 1611- Villa di Castello 1663), son of the Tuscan Grand-Duke Cosimo II and brother of Ferdinando II de\u2019Medici.  Initially intended for a military carreer Gian Carlo entered the church and was appointed cardinal in 1644. \nThe bust is part of a series of eight busts of Medici family members, preserved at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The National Gallery of Art, Washington; Private Collection, Florence; Museo Storico della Caccia e il Territorio of Cerretto Guidi, Florence.\n\nThe Florentine sculptor Giovan Battista Foggini (Florence 1652-1725) was sent by the young Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo III de\u2019 Medici, to study in the newly instituted Accademia Fiorentina in Rome in 1673. Foggini, the foremost Florentine sculptor of the late Baroque period, began to receive commissions for sculpture from the Medici court as early as 1676. After Fernando Tacca's death in 1687, Foggini was appointed grand-ducal sculptor and within the decade also became the court architect.\n\nMolesworth (1954) was the first to assign the portrait busts to Foggini and this attribution was confirmed by later critics. Details of the commission are unknown, but Lankheit (1974) suggests that Vittoria della Rovere (1622-1694) commissioned the eight Medici\u2019s family busts to Foggini for their villa at Poggio Imperiale. This proposal is generally accepted, including by Pope-Hennessy (1964). It is based on the transcript of an inventory of the Villa (see Galletti 1883, op.cit). However, no portraits in marble or busts are listed, only paintings. Therefore, other scholars such Langedijk, Civai, Vison\u00e0, Spinnelli and De Luca have expressed doubts about this provenance. \n\nSpinelli (2003) suggests instead that Vittoria della Rovere\u2019s son, Francesco Maria, might have commissioned  the busts during the renovation of the Villa Lappeggi, which he had inherited from his uncle and was improving so as to surpass the Villa at Pratolino belonging to Ferdinando. \n\nAccording to Stefano Bardini (in the Christie\u2019s sales catalogues of 1899 [<u>Catalogue des Objects d\u2019Art\u2026provenant de la Collection Bardini de Florence</u>, London, Christie\u2019s, 1899, June 5, nn. 385, 387] and 1902), the busts were formerly at Palazzo Capponi-Covoni in Florence. In his description of the Palace, Carocci mentions baroque busts of members of the Medici family (G. Carocci, 'Palazzo Covoni', in <u>L\u2019Illustratore fiorentino, calendario storico per l\u2019anno 1881</u>, Florence 1880). However, he does not specify which members of the family or the material from which they were made. Plaster casts of the busts of Ferdinando II, Leopoldo, Giovan Carlo, Francesco Maria and Marguerite-Louise d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans exist in Palazzo Corvoni and these could be the ones which Bardini refers in 1899  and 1902 calalogues. This connection has been called in to question by Lankheit, as the bust of Vittoria della Rovere is missing from the set.  As noted by De Luca (2006), there may have been more than one series of Medici busts made to decorate these noble palaces. \n\nFrom Stefano Bardini.\nThe bust was in London at the second Sale at Christie\u2019s 27 May 1902; 1938 Mortimer Schiff Sale; purchased by the Museum at Sotheby\u2019s, London (13.06.1947, lot 95) under the terms of the John Webb Trust.",
