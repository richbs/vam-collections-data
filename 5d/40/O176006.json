Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  These earrings come from Tuscany.  Large hoop earrings with rectangular fronts, often decorated with rows of pearls, were common in Tuscany in the first half of the 19th century.  The shape seems to have gone out of fashion by around 1860, and few examples have survived.\n\nThese earrings were bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
