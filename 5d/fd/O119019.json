Domitian seems to have been a sound and respected ruler whose main interest was preserving order in the Empire. However, he had many enemies amongst Rome's senatorial class, possibly because he appointed persons from the lower classes to positions of authority.  In 96 A.D. he was stabbed to death in a plot, allegedly involving his wife Domitia. On the other side of the coin is Domitia. Domitia Longina was the daughter of the famous general Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo and was taken from her husband and married to Domitian in 70 A.D. In 83 A.D. She was exiled for her affair with the actor Paris. But Domitian apparently then forgave her, as ancient sources indicate her as a part of the plot that ended the emperor's life. She died in the reign of Trajan or Antoninus Pius.\nThe aureus was an ancient Roman gold coin, issued from around the 1st century BC up to the 4th century AD. One aureus was worth 25 silver deinarii. The denarius was a small silver coin and the principal silver coin issued in the ancient Roman currency system from the late 3rd century BC until the early 3rd century AD.\nThe coins bequeathed to the V&A by George Salting include examples of silver coins from Syracuse of the 4th century BC, a set of gold imperial coins of Rome, and some fine specimens of bronze denarii of the Roman Empire.",

Domitian seems to have been a sound and respected ruler whose main interest was preserving order in the Empire. However, he had many enemies amongst Rome's senatorial class, possibly because he appointed persons from the lower classes to positions of authority.  In 96 A.D. he was stabbed to death in a plot, allegedly involving his wife Domitia.\n\nOn the other side of the coin is Domitia. Domitia Longina was the daughter of the famous general Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo and was taken from her husband and married to Domitian in 70 A.D. In 83 A.D. She was exiled for her affair with the actor Paris. But Domitian apparently then forgave her, as ancient sources indicate her as a part of the plot that ended the emperor's life. She died in the reign of Trajan or Antoninus Pius",
