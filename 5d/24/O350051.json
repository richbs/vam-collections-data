It can be identified as him by comparison with another bust of the same sitter in the Usimbardi Chapel in Santa Trinita, Florence. That bust, together with another of Pietro Usimbardi (d. 1612), Bishop of Arezzo, were carved by the Tuscan sculptor Felice Palma, who also made a life-size bronze crucifix for the same chapel. Palma was trained in bronze and marble by the Paduan sculptor Tiziano Aspetti (about 1559-1606), and he also studied the works of Michelangelo in Rome. His portrait busts were particularly influenced by the work of Alessandro Vittoria (1525-1608), the leading sculptor in Venice in the second half of the 16th century.",
