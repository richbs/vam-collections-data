Sconces were usually made of silver but were also made in copper and brass.\n\nPeople\nMargaret and Frances Macdonald were two of the most original artists working in Glasgow in the 1890s. They attended evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art together with Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert Macnair (who worked with Mackintosh from 1889 at the architectural practice, Honeyman & Jeppie).  They became known as The Four.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe group created a distinctive decorative style that was disseminated internationally through exhibitions, in particular the fifth exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society in London (1896), the eighth exhibition of the Vienna Secession (1900) and the Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa in Turin (1902).  Their work was published in contemporary periodicals, notably The Studio, Dekorative Kunst, Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration and Ver Sacrum. In this way, they provided substantial impetus for the development and recognition of a distinctive Glasgow style in Britain and on the Continent, although they had few direct imitators.",
