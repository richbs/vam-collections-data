The panels are divided by narrow pilasters with central, sunk panels, those on the upper part carved with swags of foliage.  The screen is set on the top edge with a central brass lectern, and with three brass arches, with twisted uprights.. The two large ones are surmounted by the figure of a Lutheran swan and were set above the side entrance to the enclosure behind the screen. The small arch was originally set on the pulpit of the church and has been re-set on the screen.  The top edge is also set with two brass candlesticks with Jewish inscriptions",

The screen enclosed an area dominated by a high, central pulpit, typical of Protestant churches, where preaching the word of God was considered of prime importance.\n\nThe screen would originally have been painted and gilded. The inscriptions in the centre of each panel include the names of the first pastor of this church (Laurentius Lange) and the two churchwardens serving in 1682 (P. Harboe and Jan de Roode). The lectern carries an inscription indicating that it was a present from Margareta Hobbe, whose husband Henricus van Born had been pastor in the town between 1658 and 1662.\n\nThe screen was sold from the church in 1879 and may then have been used in a synagogue in The Hague, because the candlesticks carry Hebrew inscriptions identifying them as belonging to The Hague congregation.",

            "history_note": "This screen has been identified as the screen from the Lutheran church at Alkmaar in the The Netherlands.  The church was built in 1692 and consecrated on 14 September in that year by the Rev. Laurentius Lange, whose name is on the screen. The churchwardens for that year were Pieter Harboe and Jan de Roode, whose names also appear on the screen.  The screen remained in the church until 1875 and in 1879 it was sold for Fl. 285 (\u00a324).  The screen enclosed an area where the central pulpit stood, and a table, between pews for the churchwardens, the elders and the deacons. The central lectern was used by the reader or parish clerk. \n\nThe reading desk was presumably a gift from Mrs van Born (Margareta Hobbe).  Her husband, Henricus van Born was a clergyman in Alkmaar from 1658-1662 (his first appointment as a clergyman) and his wife may have been born in the town. Laurentius Lange, who consecrated the church in 1692, was in Alkmaar from 1691-5.  He was a German who had been born in Ratseburg in Holstein.  He was a pastor in Deventer in 1679, in Zwolle in 1680, in Leiden 1684-91 and, after leaving Alkmaar in 1695, in Gouda, until his death in 1697.  Nothing is known about the two churchwardens whose names also appear on the screen.\n\nThe Gemeentachief, Amsterdam holds a watercolour drawing of the church in 1736 (reproduced in Charles Tracy's catalogue), with the screen and pulpit in place.\n\nWhen the screen was sold in 1875, a small portion remained in the church.  The main part was said to have been sold to a synagogue.",
