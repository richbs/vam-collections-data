            "public_access_description": "During the sixteenth century the diet of the elite expanded. New ingredients were available from a widening global market and lavish recipes proliferated in the period. For the first time, gastronomic literature became part of the food culture of the wealthy. What was eaten and drunk mattered as it reflected and constructed an individual's social status. New ceramic forms for holding the growing variety of types of foodstuffs and for accommodating the stylish modes of eating were developed; such as crespine (moulded dishes for holding fruit), piatte detti da carne (meat plates) and rinfrescatoio (coolers). Knowledge of the specific functions of the new forms also formed part of the self-conscious preoccupation with discernment and decorum. During the century a number of codified philosophical ideas on manners, cleanliness and hospitality that reflected this concern were written. The production of clear glass (cristallino) tazze from Murano is a good example of the self-conscious interest in fine manners.  The shape of the glass made drinking difficult, it demanded due attention to avoid spillage. \nThe introduction of individual vessels, cutlery, napkins, tablecloths and place settings at table also signaled a development in the elite modes of eating and drinking.  It marked a change with the earlier medieval practice of sharing implements. For the first time dining \"services\" were produced with individual flatware or plates for those at table. Sets were produced in standard quantities, plates were sold in by six or twelve. As luxury items, however maiolica services were however also specially commissioned and often decorated with the appropriate heraldic devices and imprese linking the individual service with the patron. However, it is likely that these items were reserved for occasional use or display purposes only.\nFrom the end of the fifteenth century maiolicaware was often painted with antique narratives known as \"istoriato\".  The depiction of these ancient myths and histories, painted in perspective, echoed the intellectual interests of the period. Indeed, the idea behind such decoration on vessels for eating and drinking may have been that guests would have been able to recognize the stories and characters, which reflected on and flattered their classical learning and erudition.",
