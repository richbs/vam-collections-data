(born 1851)</b> \n \nAlbert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864-1892) in military uniform and Garter robes, supporting on his right arm Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (1867-1953) (later Queen Mary) who is in a wedding dress.  Portraits, half-length, facing slightly right.  The head and hands of Queen Mary have been drawn separately and added to the composition. \n<i>Signed and dated</i> T. Walter. Wilson. R.I. 92. \n<i>Water- and body-colour.</i>  56.5 x 41.6 cm.         E.809-1959  \n \nGiven by Mr James Laver, CBE \n \n<i>Note:</i> The Duke of Clarence was to have been married on 27 February 1892 but died on 14 January 1892.
