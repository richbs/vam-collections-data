The slot was simply cut with a knife.\n\nOwnership & Use\nNo pottery money box that has survived intact can have been used for its original purpose. The tiny slot (designed for thin, stamped, low-denomination copper coins such as pennies, halfpennies and farthings) would not allow coins to be extracted without breaking the pot open. In the 16th and 17th centuries these humble objects were probably owned by some of the poorest members of society. By the 19th century, however, country potteries were making elaborate money boxes of slipware  (wares of coarse red clay decorated with a white liquid clay known as slip). These were often decorated with modelled birds and sometimes had several superimposed compartments. They were probably intended as presents for children. As with so many types of object in the Victorian period, tin plate and cast iron largely took over the role of pottery.",
