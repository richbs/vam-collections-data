'Salts' were therefore the most common items of silver (after spoons) to be found in lists of household possessions. They  often became heirlooms. The most elaborate salt was placed before the head of the household or the guest of honour. Smaller plain salts were provided for the other diners.\n\nDesign\nThis is known as a bell salt because of its shape. Bell salts form the largest surviving category of Elizabethan or Jacobean salts. By 1607, they were mocked as simple objects which even an unskilled journeyman could make. \n\nIt is made up of three sections with a pierced cap which acts as a pepper or spice caster. The upper section can be removed, making it into two separate salt containers. One would be kept by the guest of honour and the smaller one placed at the other end of the table. \n\nPlace\nThis salt and several other pieces of domestic silver were found in 1891 by a boy chasing rabbits at Stoke Prior, near Leominster, Herefordshire. It is a particularly interesting group as this sort of relatively simple household silver rarely survives.",
