The sweeping lines of the case follow the fashionable curves of the Rococo style. However, the decoration of clocks was often rather old-fashioned in comparison with that of other furnishings. In this example the tight, symmetrical scrolling pattern of the boulle marquetry \u2013 which combined brass and dark tortoiseshell and was named after Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle, cabinetmaker to Louis XIV \u2013 is closer to designs of the period before 1720 than to those of 1740. The dial is more up-to-date in style, with 13 separate plaques of enamel set into a gilt-brass framework.",
