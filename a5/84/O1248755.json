The figures were bought in 1937 were made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960), except the two boxers and the ghost, whose maker is not known.\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nIn the Punch and Judy show written by Professor Bavister, Joey the clown and Mr. Punch start hitting each other with Punch's stick. When Punch wants a proper fight, Joey calls his boxer friend Bill Bailey to fight for him. Mr. Punch refuses to fight him and calls his friend Jack Begonia, the black boxer, to fight for him. Punch and Joey exit while the boxers fight. When Punch returns, finding his boxer knocked out on stage, he knocks the white boxer out before more fighting business with Joey the clown.",
