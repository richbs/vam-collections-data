This was probably the first range of commercially produced toys designed for the disabled. \nBase; rectangular block of 3/4in. plywood with the top and sides varnished; on the base are mounted two metal hoops and slotted onto the poles are ten balls each with a hole drilled through the centre; the balls are painted blue; orange; green; yellow and red. The Abbatt catalogue describes the Beads on Frames Toys as follows: The\nbeads of these toys are large and easily held by the child; who moves them along the wire. The teacher observes how he does this. Does he use one hand only or does he steady the frame with one hand and move the bead with the other? By encouragement; co-ordination of hand and eye can be developed.",
