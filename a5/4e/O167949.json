Using concrete poetry as a kind of springboard Hou\u00e9dard developed a way of making more purely abstract or pictorial images with the typewriter keys. He wrote that \"During 1945 I realised the typewriter's control of verticals and horizontals, balancing its mechanism for release from its own imposed grid, (and) offered possibilities that suggested (I was in India at the time) the grading of Islamic calligraphy from cursive (naskhi) writing through cufic to the abstract formal arabesque, that 'wise modulation between being and not being'\u201d. \n\nThis is one of a number of so called typestracts by Hou\u00e9dard in the museum\u2019s collection. Some of which contain a legible arrangement of words, others are abstract, often resembling the drawings of Russian constructivists.",
