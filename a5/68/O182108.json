            "physical_description": "A set of 8 bed castors of black-japanned cast iron, each with a fully swivelling wheel turned from a cross section of hardwood, probably <i>lignum vitae</i>.  Each castor is currently screwed to a short section of beechwood board stained dark brown. \n\nOne each the cast-iron fitting is made in three sections, riveted together. A base plate, with rounded ends and in-curved sides, is cast on its lower surface with a central, circular socle, approximately 2 cm deep, which provides the housing for the upper end of the castor shaft. On either side of this, and cast in one piece with the base-plate, are two curving supports, which flank the socle and run down to meet in a second socle or collar, through which the castor shaft runs. Three screw holes, with counter-sinking, are cast into each end of each base plate, to allow fixing to a wooden strut which fixes across the corner of the bed frame. \n\nThe wheel bracket of each castor consists of a central rod or tube, which acts as the pivot. The lower end of the rod locates in a deep (2.7 cm) block, with one moulded side, and is riveted under this.  The block is cast in one piece with two flat side extensions which are of similar height and run forward, perpendicularly with the main castor rod, and provide a housing for the wooden wheel.  The downcurved ends of each extension are pierced and joined through the centre of the wheel by a riveted iron rod, which forms the axle of the wheel. All the metal sections of the castors are japanned black but none show marks on the outer surfaces.\n\nThe wheel of each castor (approximately 7.7 cm or 3\" in diameter) and 2.5 cm or 1\" in thickness, is turned from a cross-section of <i>lignum vitae</i> with an irregular patch of dark wood in the centre and considerable pale wood on the edges. The rolling edge of each wheel is slightly rounded in section.  The side of each wheel is turned with two narrow framing fillets and a cushioned inner part (diagram in file for object).  The centre of each wheel is sect with a metal disc, possibly iron, providing the seating for the axle. \n\nEach castor is screwed to a plank of stained beechwood, the ends cut at an angle to fit across the corners of a frame. The angled sides show long tongues of wood which must have fitted into the frame. In each case, the castor bracket is fitted at one end of the plank. The planks are drilled horizontally through their thickness at either end of the end to which the brackets are set and were attached originally with screws through these holes (1 screw survives on :2. :3. :5, :6 and :8 and 2 on :1, :4 and :7).  These screws would have to have been inserted after the 'tongue' of the other end of each plank had been located, but before the castors were attached to the cross-corner planks. Some of the planks show evidence of old worming.",

From the 16th century, inventories and other documents record 'truckle beds', which were low beds with wheels, often stored under larger beds and used for children or servants.  By the second half of the 18th century, castors could be found on all sorts of beds and on other heavy pieces of furniture.\n\nThese castors date from the 1860s or 1870s. At that time several of the historic oak beds shown in the Museum were fitted with modern castors, attached to boards forming a bed base.  This allowed the beds to be moved around more easily. Old photographs show this arrangement on a number of beds, but the castors were later removed, and it is no longer possible to say for which bed they were purchased. They are, however, now of interest for study in their own right.",
