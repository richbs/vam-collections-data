There is a  large scale  female portrait (Nutan) on the bottom left hand corner, the bindi on her forehead and her sari indicate the 'traditional'  nature of her character and  this along with the title indicate that her role is one of the devoted, self sacrificing wife. Placed next to her on the bottom right hand corner is a young boy,  the position of the boy and the peaceful expression of her face indicate that he is her main concern and the reason for her contentment. At the top of this triangular format is a male figure, smallest in scale and set in the distance, thus indicating that he is important to the narrative but not central to it.  The whole poster is coloured in shades of green and blue. The English title runs across the bottom with the Hindi and Urdu titles on a much smaller scale in the bottom right hand corner.",
