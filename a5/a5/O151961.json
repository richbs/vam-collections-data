It is carved in relief with Adam and Eve on either side of the tree of Life. Behind the root of the tree is the figure of a stag. The figures of Adam and Eve are derived from an engraving of 1504 after D\u00fcrer (1471-1528). The quartered arms, accompanied by the initials I.Z.W., are probably those of a member of the zu Welsberg family, of the Tyrol (quarterly argent and sable). The eagle displayed near the bottom is also probably that of the Tyrol. The flask is therefore likely to be Austrian, or perhaps South German. The use of the D\u00fcrer engraving as a source for the figures implies that this piece dates to the time of the D\u00fcrer revival in the early seventeenth century.",

The use of the D\u00fcrer engraving as a source for the figures implies that this piece dates to the time of the D\u00fcrer revival in the early seventeenth century. Because the family for whom this powder flask was almost certainly made was Tyrolean, it is likely to be Austrian, or perhaps South German.",

The figures of Adam and Eve are derived from an engaving after D\u00fcrer. The quartered arms, accompanied by the initials I.Z.W., are probably those of a member of the zu Welsberg family, of the Tyrol (quarterly argent and sable).
