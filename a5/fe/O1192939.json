They complement the Museum's current range of character toys in the collection, which includes character dolls, plates and a puppet. The Museum has a variety of character dolls including Dismal Desmond, Mickey Mouse, and more recently, Buzz Lightyear. Andy Pandy was first screened in July 1950, firstly by himself and later he was joined by a friend, Teddy and a rag doll called Looby Lou. Only 26 episodes were originally made repeated over and over again. In 1970, 13 new episodes were made in colour. It was due to a major shift in the 1950s, when people could access television at home, that characters such as Andy Pandy began to appear on children's programmes. As a result, many toys were manufactured from popular characters.\n\nThese figures were manufactured by Sacul. It was established in 1951 by Mr. Lucas, a former Timpo employee. The brand name 'SACUL' being his surname spelt backwards. Their specialism was TV and promotional characters, although the company closed in 1955 resulting in Sacul figures becoming quite scarce.",
