In this particular photograph, the thinness of paper and dullness of albumen indicate an early example of that photographic process dating from the 1850s to the 1860s.  It shows bolts, locks, door hinges, and door knockers made in the Victorian metalworker Francis Skidmore's (1817-1896) firm.  The door fittings may have been made at his premises in West Orchard, where his firm was in 1853, or Alma Street, Coventry from 1859.  There are similar printed designs for such fittings in a pattern book lettered 'Skidmore's Art Manufactures Co. Book of Designs' in Coventry Public Library. Skidmore's firm had this title from 1865. \n\nThe photograph is thus a record of the work done and it comes from an archive of designs and photographs from Skidmore's firm. In addition, he produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork of which this roof crest is an example.",

Peter Howell (see References) has some printed designs for door hinges in his private collection which are from a later date than the ones in Coventry because they are lettered 'BIRMINGHAM' as below. In the 1872 Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company went into liquidation and was taken over by Winfields of Birmingham so it appears that Skidmore was still producing similar door hinges for more than seven years from 1865 because the pattern book in Coventry Library is lettered with the title that Skidmore's firm used from this earlier date. The page of designs in Peter Howell's collection is lettered 'VANES, FINIALS and HINGES.'  and 'F:A:SKIDMORE: COVENTRY and 24 HUNTERS Rd BIRMINGHAM.'",
