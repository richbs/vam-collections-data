The literature on the determination of the qiblah is extensive; it appears that the compass in the astronomical compendium Sanduq al-yawaqit ('The Chest of Rubies') made in 1365-6 by Ibn al-Shatir is the first known example with a pivotal needle, and of a qiblah-compass. The introduction of the magnetic compass from China made it possible to manufacture small instruments which, when correctly orientated by means of the pivoted needle, would show the azimuth of the qiblah from a number of places marked on the compass plate.",
