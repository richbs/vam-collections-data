Many of these were made in Germany by companies such as Bing and Marklin. It was not until the turn of the century that companies started to make whole systems, where you could buy parts to add to your collection allowing you to make your train set as big or small as you wished.  Companies like Distler, who made this railway station started to produce cheap accessories that could be added to these toy sets.  This train station was played with alongside a table top set made by Bing.",
