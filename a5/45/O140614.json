The porterage along the quai lies in their hands.  They are the noisiest workmen in the world.  They do not talk to each other but shout.  [...] the extravagance of gesture which accompanies their words is simply wonderful, it is impossible to caricature it. A very favourite gesture of theirs is to tap the forehead with the first finger & thumb pinched together -",

The words `In search of Miss Stone' in the inscription on the back of the drawing refer to a sensational event in September 1901. Miss Ellen Stone, an American missionary, was kidnapped near the village of Bansko and held to ransom by a band of twenty armed men affiliated with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), led by Yane Sandansky and Hristo Chernopeev.  Eventually the ransom was paid, and Miss Stone and her companion Mrs. Katarina Stefanova Tsilka were released unharmed.",
