            "production_note": "The type of veneer used (mahogany), the monumental architectural character and the decorative recessed panelling covering the front of the secretaire, especially the recessed arch forming part of the fall-front and the sophisticated overall design, are indications that the secretaire is North German, probably from a larger city, the Berlin area or possibly from Berlin itself.\n\nAttribution note: The secretaire is of high quality. The veneer used is mahogany (rarer in Biedermeier furniture than indigenous woods) and the gilded wood and gesso elements are finely detailed. The carcase is of oak - not unusual for northern German Biedermeier pieces - however, the oak is of high quality and finely finished. It appears both ebonised (pear?) and real ebony have been used in the construction of the temple interior; the ebonised parts now show signs of deterioration while the pieces of ebony have kept their deep black hue. The wood finish on the oak drawer carcases is very smooth and the inside top drawer rails are finely beaded. The drawer bottoms slide into the side rails for support, a technique only recently adopted in Germany at this time, and the undersides are constructed with central raised square panel sections which allow for easy opening, even when the drawers are filled (Roentgen sen. and jun. had used similar constuctions but it is in the Biedermeier period that this construction is first applied in central Europe; in 1826 a Viennese journeyman obtained a patent for drawers of very similar construction).\nEqually, the secretaire contains an unusually large number of secret drawers and compartments; there are five secret drawers, twelve secret compartments, one secret mirror compartment (now largely missing) and two secret flaps hiding two cupboards on top of the secretaire. Clearly, a large amount of thought and ingenuiety has gone into the piece; it is of high quality.\n\nThe piece is a carpenter's apprentice's 'Meisterstueck' or masterpiece. Many apprentices chose to build secretaires like this one for their examination prior to being admitted into the guild of master carpenters- the motif behind which being that the apprentice would build a commercially desirable piece to recoup his costs and make a profit. The rules for constructing such a masterpiece (and for obtaining the master title) were, among others, that the masterpiece had to be designed by the journeyman, constructed entirely with hand tools, and that it had to be completed within a specified period of time (varying from four weeks, it appears, to several months). The masterpiece was to be constructed in the old master's house or workshop (not in the accommodation of the prospective new master!), and construction was supervised by an old master (not necessarily the master in whose workshop the piece was constructed).  All of the required materials and costs had to be calculated by the prospective master craftsman as well and a perspective construction drawing, normally showing the front and side of the piece, was normally  required for examination prior to commencing the construction work. Once examined and approved, the craftsman could start building his piece.The inset compartment may have been bought by the prospective master craftsman as a separate piece; contemporaries do not seem to have regarded the inside secretaire compartments as integral with the overall structure; the masterpiece was to illustrate primarily the craftsman's ability to construct carcases well and veneer over wooden surfaces.\n\n.......has pointed out that fine seasoned oak was used in the construction of carcases for masterpieces in Berlin.\n\nThere are no obvious signs of machine work on this secretaire, however, the veneer is relatively thin - c. 1mm on the main carcase, some of the beadings being veneered to a thickness of only 0.3-0.5mm. Either this indicates high quality hand-sawing, or it could be an indication that, inspite of the above, the veneer was cut by one of the new veneer cutting machines. \nThere is also evidence of an all-over light reddish-brown stain. New stains were being investigated and mixed around the time this piece was made; recipes for these were published in contemporary woodworking journals.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Although the piece is primarily a Biedermeier piece, its stylistic elements are clearly indebted to the earlier Empire style.  The use of gilt gesso and the mahogany veneer, as well as the strongly architectural and classically-inspired carcase might be found on an Empire piece. The ebony panels with eagles in gilt metal on the inside of the writing part of the secretaire are also part of the Empire style repertory. \nHowever, the vertical emphasis of the piece and its solid, cubic character -  the carcase appearing as if constructed from interconnecting cube shapes -  and the concentration of ornament at the front of the secretaire (the sides being very plain), are Biedermeier characteristics. \nThe gilt enrichments seem to constitute a frame for the flame wood veneer which, in turn, is cut from one tree. It is matched carefully and is laid over the carcase and drawers in one direction and in continuous flow. This is in keeping with Biedermeier practice.\n\nThe cabinet was given in 1942 by Mr Frederick Henry Leonard, Esq. of Westcombe Park Road, Blackheath. He died in 1947, his wife, Clara Caroline Julia Louise Leonardt (ne\u00e9 Hoeltzer),  having pre-deceased him. They had two children, Erica Leonard  (later Thorne) and Frederic Charles Leonard.\nClara Hoeltzer and Frederick Charles Leonard were married in 1898. Their son was born in 1899, their daughter in 1903.  Clara Hoeltzer herself was born in 1871; her parents (Anna Holtzer, born c 1838 in Prussia, and Carl Hoeltzer, born c. 1833 in Saxony Gotha) had moved to England sometime before 1871; in 1881 the household, living in Charlton, consisted of the two adults, four children and two domestics (also German).\n\nThe secretaire was made either by Anna Hoeltzer's (ne\u00e9 ?) or Carl Hoeltzer's father. Perhaps it was taken to England by the Hoeltzer's when they emigrated from Prussia, sometime before 1871.",
