Her training began at Wolverhampton Polytechnic, (now the University of Wolverhampton), 1992-1995,  where she undertook a 3D design course involving wood, plastics and metal.  Particularly intrigued by the  possibilities of metalwork, she did a year at the Bishopsland Educational Trust, (1995-1996) a post graduate training  program for silversmiths and jewellers which led to her completing an MA in silversmithing and jewellery at the  Royal College of Art (1996-1998).  \n\nShe has had several prestigious residencies since completing her full time education including a year at the Crafts  Council in 2004 and her association with Bishopsland continues where she is now a senior fellow.  Her work  characteristically combines traditional silversmithing techniques with innovative design.  Born in Manchester to  Nigerian parents, her inspiration stems from a combination of the British urban landscape and her African cultural  heritage which gives a formal drama and a richly, textured surface quality to her silver.  Her work is already  represented in important public collections of contemporary craft throughout Britain including the Ashmolean  Museum, Oxford, Aberdeen Art gallery, Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery and the Shipley Art Gallery, Gateshead.   She is represented in several institutional collections including the Goldsmiths\u2019 Company, the Grocers\u2019 Company,  the Weavers\u2019 Company and Winchester Cathedral.",
