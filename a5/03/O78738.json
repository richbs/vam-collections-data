They have until recently been generally attributed to England and France, although the sophisticated court style of dress of this particular piece makes a French attribution for it very likely.  There is also some evidence that similar items may have been produced in Scotland, partly because of the survival of a number of examples there.\n\nMakers & Making\nAlthough French in style and in the case of this embroidery probably actually made in France, most embroideries of this type with secure provenances were presumably  made either in England or Scotland or for the English or Scottish markets. They would certainly have been produced in professional workshops which had access to the design sources and materials.",
