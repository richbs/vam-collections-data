The design of this one only dates back to the beginning of the 19th century, when similar necklaces, made from fine gold chains, were the height of fashion throughout Europe during the reign of the Emperor Napoleon of France.  Similar necklaces survive in use in some regions of France, but the yellow gold filigree pendant on this necklace, with red gold facings, is uniquely Italian.  Gold filigree jewellery like this was worn throughout southern Italy in the 19th century, and is still being made and worn there today.  This necklace is marked in many places with a gold mark used in southern Italy in the 1830s. \n\nIn the 19th century, Italian women usually fastened their necklaces with silk ribbons.  The two loops at the ends of this necklace may originally have held ribbons, but they may also have been used to fasten the necklace directly to the wearer's costume.  \n\nIt was bought for \u00a34 as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
