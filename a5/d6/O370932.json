They are held with the index finger and thumb of the left hand and struck with fingers, palm or  fist of the right hand. The Daira is usually formed from a wooden hoop but this example is made of tortoise shell inlaid with mother of pearl. It was almost certainly intended as an intermational exhibition piece rather than a working musical instrument. It was displayed at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867 before being acquired by this Museum two years later.",
