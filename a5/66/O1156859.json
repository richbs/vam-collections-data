Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, her loyal clients included European aristocrats and wealthy North Americans. This dress was worn by Lady Minoru Foley, (around 1888 to 1968), wife of the 7th Baron Foley.\n\nIn Vionnet's hands, finishing details such as hems, seams and applied decoration are executed with precision and finesse. This dress was designed by Vionnet in 1935. By this year, Vionnet had operated her own couture house for 23 years and had worked for nearly 50 years in the dressmaking and couture trades. The dress is crafted from organza and fine tulle. Its delicacy is underlined by the scattering of appliqu\u00e9d velvet swallow motifs across the skirt.",

Lady Foley was among the women of privilege who could afford the finest quality textiles, meticulously crafted designs and highly personal attention offered by couture houses such as Vionnet's.\n\nLady Foley purchased a number of dresses designed by Madeleine Vionnet between 1929 and 1938. This dress is one of four acquired by the Museum in 2009. They form part of a larger group of nine dresses stopped at export and secured for the nation. The other dresses are held in the collections of The Bowes Museum and The Fashion Museum, Bath. \n\nLady Foley was born Minoru Greenstone, the daughter of mine owner Harry Greenstone of Johannesburg, South Africa. She married the seventh Baron Foley (1895-1927), a former flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force who became Baron in 1918. Lord Foley died in 1927.\n\nMinoru Foley\u2019s marriage introduced her to British society. During the early to mid-1920s, the couple is listed in the Times Social Register as attending events of the London season and travelling to Paris on several occasions. Lord and Lady Foley\u2019s son was born in 1923. Photographs of the couple taken by Bassano Ltd are held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Lady Foley was among the women of privilege who could afford the finest quality textiles, meticulously crafted designs and highly personal attention offered by couture houses such as Vionnet\u2019s. \n\nThe nine dresses together comprise a remarkable record of a decade of designs for a single client by one of the 20th century\u2019s most important couturiers. In addition, the objects date from the last decade of Vionnet\u2019s career, and represent Vionnet at her most sophisticated and complex, at the height of her design powers.",
