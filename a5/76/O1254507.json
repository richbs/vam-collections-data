Emile Littler (1903-1985) was one of the country\u2019s most influential 20th century theatrical impresarios who also wrote and directed over fifteen productions on his own account. He was born in Ramsgate, Kent, to Jules and Agnes Richeux, one of their six children, of whom one died in infancy. Jules Richeux became the lessee of the Artillery Theatre, Woolwich, in 1909, but following his death in 1911 at the age of 48, his wife took over the running of the theatre. In 1914 she married Frank Littler who adopted the five remaining children, including the eldest Blanche (b.1899), Prince (b.1901) and Emile, all of whom took their stepfather\u2019s name.\n\nThe artist Osbert Lancaster (1908-1896) was an author, critic, illustrator and stage designer, as well as one of Britain's most distinguished 20th century cartoonists, best known for his legendary 'pocket cartoons' first published in The Daily Express in 1939. He was fondly summarised in his Times obituary as: 'The most polite and unsplenetic of cartoonists, he was never a crusader, remaining always a witty, civilized critic with a profound understanding of the vagaries of human nature.'",
