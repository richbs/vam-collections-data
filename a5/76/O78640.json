Nothing is known of its owner, Joan Bacon, except that she supported the monarchy.\n\nDesign\nThe box bears the coat of arms of Charles II, who reigned from 1660 to 1685. \n\nMaterials &  Making\nBoxwood is a close-grained hardwood particularly suited to small and intricate carving. Its colour ranges from yellow to orange-brown and when polished it develops a shiny surface. Box was then grown in south-east England and John Evelyn, in Silva: or A Discourse on Forest-Trees (1662), said it was 'of special use for the turner, engraver, carver who give great prices for it by weight, as well as measure'.",
