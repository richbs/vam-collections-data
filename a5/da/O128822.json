This painting depicts the prominent abolitionist and author Granville Sharp (1735-1813). The painting refers to an event in 1765 which triggered Sharp's interest in Abolition. In 1765 Sharp met Jonathan Strong, a slave seeking treatment for injuries sustained at the hands of his owner. Sharp took up Strong's case and secured his release from prison when he was arrested as an escaped slave. Following this success Sharp began to research the legal status of slaves in Britain (as opposed to in British colonies) and argued on behalf of a number of slaves in court, hence the legal setting of this painting.",
