The teapot form, which evolved in Europe, began as an imitation of the Chinese wine pot. Although the first silver teapots date from the late 17th century, by the time this teapot was made in about 1800, the object was a familiar one in many households. A wide choice of material, including cheaper ceramics and glass as well as inexpensive metal products such as Sheffield plate and tinned copper, expanded the market for tea wares. This oval shaped, Sheffield plate example has a wooden handle and knob on the lid.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
