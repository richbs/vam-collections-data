London : South Kensington Museum, 1874.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'ENGLISH SCHOOL.\n...\nJAMES GILLRAY. \nEminent Caricaturist, Etcher and Engraver. \nBorn about 1757, died in London in 1815. \n\nSix SKETCHES made for the Caricature \"Connoisseurs examining a collection of George Morland's,\" where portraits of Angerstein, Mitchell, Caleb, Whitefoord, G. Baker, and Mortimer, are introduced. - (Wright and Evans's Catalogue, No. 551.) With numerous notes, and among them about a dozen suggestions for the title: \"An Admirer of Rembrandt ;\" \"Struck with a grand effect,\" &c. \n\n(1.) First idea for the principal figure, said to be John Julius \tAngerstein. Slight; sketched in black chalk. \t765 \n<i>Height,</i> 9 4/12 <i>inches.  Width, </i>7 7/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\n(2.) The same figure. In black chalk and pen. Squared for transferring to the copper. \t766 \n<i>Height,</i> 8 10/12 <i>inches.  Width, </i>7 3/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\n(3.) The same, the background with pictures introduced. Black chalk and red ink, squared for copying; notes in reference to the title. 767 \n<i>Height,</i> 8 10/12 <i>inches.  Width, </i>7 2/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\n(4.) The same. Mr Angerstein is drawing a curtain from over the picture he is looking at. The notes for title, &c. are still more numerous. Black chalk, squared for copying; corrected with red ink.  768\n<i>Height,</i> 8 10/12 <i>inches.  Width, </i>7 2/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\n(5.) The entire composition. The pictures on the wall merely sketched in. Drawn with the pen in black and red ink, with numerous notes.  769\n<i>Height,</i> 19 <i>inches.  Width, </i>11 6/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\n(6.) The entire composition. The copy ready for transferring to the copper. The pictures against the wall more distinctly made out. Drawn with the pen and washed with Indian ink. Many interesting notes, \u201cPoor Corregio died wretched, and Morland,\u201d &c. Squared for copying.  770\n<i>Height,</i> 19 <i>inches.  Width, </i>12 9/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nThe great pains which have been taken in the studies for this caricature are noteworthy, and, in parts, appear quite unnecessary. The repetition of the principal figure is an instance. Probably this was due to the caprice of a patron.'",
