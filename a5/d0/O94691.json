The design appears in the firm's pattern books, although no acknowledgement is made to the source. We do not know whether this is an unofficial copy or whether it was made under licence to Puiforcat.\n\nJean Puiforcat (1897-1945) was born in Paris, the son of a goldsmith. He was self-taught as a designer, although he studied sculpture under Louis Lejeune. From 1922 he worked as an independent goldsmith. He designed his own works, mainly in a geometric Art Deco style. Puiforcat was addicted to geometry and the golden section (a ratio in which the smaller section is to the larger section as the larger is to the whole). A friend of Raymond Templier, he showed at the Paris exhibitions of 1925 and 1937. At the exhibition of 1925 his silver was displayed in Ruhlmann's H\u00f4tel du Collectionneur. Ren\u00e9 Herbst published a life of Puiforcat in 1949.",
