This was thanks in no small part to the sultan\u2019s own enthusiastic patronage. While many of the artworks he commissioned were mosques and the furnishings to go with them, some objects appear to have been made for him personally. This beautiful deep-sided basin is inlaid with an inscription that reads: \u2018Glory to our lord, the Sultan, the just ruler, the holy warrior, the guardian of the frontiers, the one aided [by God], the victorious, sultan of Islam and the Muslims, al-Malik al-Ashraf Abu'l-Nasr Qa'itbay\u2019.",
