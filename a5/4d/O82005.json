Dated in gold, lower centre left: <i>1629</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century copper-gilt locket, the back flat set into straight sides, the bezel toothed over the glass; the hanger a plain, nearly circular loop of D-section soldered on; packed out with cut-up playing cards of c.1680.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Bought by George Salting from an unrecorded source for \u00a3188; bequeathed by him to the Museum, 1910.  \n  \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1930, p. 92 ('probably painted in the eighteenth-century or early nineteenth-century'); Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 9 (as by A Cooper); Reynolds 1988, p. 61 (as by A Cooper). \n\nThe miniature was attributed by Salting to Peter Oliver, an intelligent suggestion since the style is in some respects close to his, but one which no other scholar has endorsed. Long, who began by thinking the miniature was possibly French, reached the extreme point of scepticism when he concluded that it was an eighteenth- or nineteenth-century fake - 'The texture of the blue background, the modelling of the features, the cracked gum in the hair ... and the treatment of the hair do not seem to agree with seventeenth-century technique.' (1) Graham Reynolds, however, on the basis of comparison with the signed Ferdinand HI (Cat. No. 54) attributed it firmly to  Alexander Cooper.(2) Until recently, this judgement has seemed right, and it connects elegantly with Salting's perception of a resemblance to the style of Peter Oliver, since in 1629 Alexander Cooper's hand should have been close to that of Oliver who, with Hoskins, was his master.  \n \nWithin Alexander Cooper's own oeuvre, Signed works of this date are extremely rare. Cat. No. 54, datable on costume to the late 1620s, should indeed be comparable in date and, apart from its circular format, in general approach to the sitter. But the latter offers no parallel to the gumminess of this miniature, which does, on renewed inspection (as Long found), begin to look more and more like a nineteenth-century fake. Moreover, the costume is wrong: the falling ruff was intended to fit closely around the jaw, and was supported in that position by a high stiff collar beneath it: it was never worn as here, showing an inch or two of naked neck. The effect is of fancy dress, not of the high fashion one would expect of a sitter in 1629 having his portrait painted for posterity. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the miniature is indeed a clever nineteenth-century fake.  \n \nThe portrait was formerly described as John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol (1580-1653) .This identification is earlier than the period of Salting's ownership and probably originated in the trade, where it led Durlacher the dealer into a confusion between this miniature and a portrait of Digby with a TB monogram said to be by Thomas Bettes. (3) This latter miniature was in the Propert and Pierpont Morgan Collections and is now in that of the late Sir Ralph Clarke in Sussex. It is not by Thomas Bettes but is an eighteenth- or nineteenth-century derivation through an intermediate anonymous engraving4 from the titled engraving attributed to Renold Elstrack. This engraving seems to be the most authoritative image of Digby. A portrait by Cornelius Jonson said to be of him, signed and dated 1632, is inscribed <i>Aetatis Suae 40</i>. (5) This disqualifies it as an image of Digby, who was two years older, but in point of likeness it might have been compatible with the present miniature, more so than another portrait by Jonson in the National Gallery of Ireland. (6) The Digby portraits at Sherborne Castle are various in appearance and provenance and do not constitute a reliable index. \n\n1 MS note in department files. \n2 MS note in department files. \n3 Dr Williamson and his generation believed in Thomas Bettes as a miniaturist. \n4 An impression is in the NPG archive. \n5 Sotheby's 19 March 1975, lot 105,repro.\n6 No. 584, signed and dated 1628.\"",
