THE PRINCE CONSORT. / These experiments ere conducted over a period of about two months, from 11th March to 17th May 1861, and in order to superintend the process of them H.R.H. The Prince Consort visited the South Kensington Museum where they were carried on upwards of eight times.  This sketch was taken of one of the Prince's visits when General Grey, Mr. Cole, Mr. Redgrave, and Captain Fowke were present.  The Prince is viewing the Model from a hole which was dug in order that the eye of the spectator should be brought to the right level.  The background presents the Sheepshanks Gallery now about to be altered, and the Iron Museum now removed.  Instead of the statue of the Queen surmounting the monument as in the sketch, it was the will of Heaven that the Prince's own statue should be there.",

As well as being crucial records of the history of the V&amp;A, and an important element within the National Art Library's visual encyclopaedia, these photographs are also significant artefacts in the history of the art of photography.",
