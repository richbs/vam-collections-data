In 1401, the Arte di Calimala (the guild of the merchant dealing in foreign cloth and export) decided to commission a second bronze door for the baptistery of Florence, to accompany the door completed by Andrea Pisano sixty-four years earlier. A competition was held for which seven competitors submitted trial reliefs of the Sacrifice of Isaac. The copy here is of Ghiberti's competition entry which was chosen in preference to that of his nearest rival, Filippo Brunelleschi. On the strength of this, Ghiberti was awarded the commission for the Baptistry. The original of this relief is now in the Museo Nazionale (Bargello) Florence.",

A competition was held for which seven competitors submitted trial reliefs of the Sacrifice of Isaac.  The copy here is of Ghiberti's competition entry which was chosen in preference to that of his nearest rival, Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446).  On the strength of this, Ghiberti was awarded the commission for the Baptistry doors, which he executed between 1403 and 1424.",
