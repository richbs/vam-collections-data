As Prefect of the Seine from 1853 he completely remodelled the capital. The maze of narrow streets gave way to straight wide boulevards, with macadam surfaces which could not be turned up to make barricades. During the suppression of the Commune they were to prove a magnificent field for artillery fire. Although the new water supply and gigantic system of sewers could only be beneficial for the Parisians, the glittering new city had its darker aspects. Rents in the centre rose astronomically. Previously the proletariat had lived alongside the rich; now they were pushed out of town to districts like Belleville, Menilmontant, La Villette and Montmartre, forming areas where discontent was concentrated, and in which it was easy to organize revolts.
