            "physical_description": "Bureau cabinet consisting of an upper section with central mirror flanked by fluted Doric pilasters and a lower section with a writing slope enclosing an elaborate prospect, with two small drawers and two long drawers below. The whole surmounted by a pediment.\nThe cabinet is constructed of oak and pine. The larger drawers  and compartments are lined with oak; their side edges are chamfered. The niches are lined with walnut. The dust boards between the lower drawers and at the base are standard 11\" deals.  They are edged with cockbeading which camouflages any gaps in the carcase. The lower drawers are supported on side runners - a practice which is characteristic of mid-17th century manufacture - but is curiously outdated for metropolitan work of the second quarter of the 18th century. The carcase walls are thus thicker in order to support the oak side runners. The bracket feet are constructed of three separate oak blocks and veneered with burr walnut.\nThe bureau cabinet retains its original steel keys.\n[Bureau cabinet] The central mirror is flanked by fluted Doric pilasters. The door is decorated above and below the mirror with panels of  arabesque marquetry.\nThe mirrored section forms a door which opens out to the right. It is released by a latch mechanism operated from a key hole  which is concealed in the upper carrying handle on the left. The inside of the door is bordered  by doric pilasters inlaid with burr wood creating an effect similar to marble.  The bases of the pilasters are inscribed 'SAMUEL BENNETT' and 'LONDON FECIT'.  There are further panels of burr wood veneer across the top and bottom of the inside of the door. The interior of the upper section consists of a central door also flanked by doric pilasters. The door opens to reveal a compartment containing two drawers. The lower drawer conceals two holes in either side of the outer wall of the compartment. The holes provide access to the oak springs which release the secret compartments concealed behind the Doric pilasters. These have sliding lids on the outer sides creating a dust free container for important documents. Above the central door, an upper section embellished, like the spandrels of the door, with arabesque marquetry,  with a central lunette decorated with a fan motif, forms a concealed drawer  which is released by an oak spring from a hole in the top of the lower compartment. The central compartment is flanked at the lower level by adjustable vertical shelves with waved edges and above by circular headed pigeon holes.\n[Bureau cabinet] The lower section consists of a writing slope enclosing an elaborate prospect, with two small drawers and two long drawers below, supported on the original bracket feet.  The burr walnut veneer within the prospect is darker in colour and indicates the extent to which the exterior woods have faded with time. Within the prospect, the central cupboard is flanked by pilasters outlined in sycamore and ebony stringing; they have plain walnut capitals and bases. Both the cupboard and pilasters pull out as a separate unit  revealing six concealed drawers.  (Both this unit and the five small drawers on each side are temporarily held in place by screws from the back).  They are flanked by  pairs of  niches with arched tops, the edges marked with blind purfling. The drawers have small brass handles.  That on the top left drawer appears to be a later replacement. The writing slope is supported on oak lopers (their handles are missing) which have a cut out section on the underside when stretched to their full extent thus causing the writing surface to slope downwards slightly for the convenience of the writer.  A dry mortice and tenon in the centre of the underside of the writing slope provides additional central support when the slope is open. The felt writing surface is a later replacement. The borders of the writing surface are veneered with a burr walnut and have re-entrant corners.  The key escutcheon on the outside of the fall front may be a later replacement. The interior hinges have been replaced although the baluster hinges on the inner doors of the upper and lower sections are original. The key escutcheons and handles on the lower drawers are original as are the two pairs of carrying handles.\n[Pediment] The cabinet is surmounted by a swan-necked pediment with a central giltwood cartouche flanked by giltwood acanthus scrolls.\n[Drawer] Small drawer at the top left of the lower section.\n[Drawer] Small drawer at the top right of the lower section.\n[Drawer] Large middle drawer in the lower section.\n[Drawer] Large bottom drawer in the lower section.\n[Drawer] Concealed drawer above the the central inner door of the upper section.

The Baroque character is reflected in the interior prospect with the incurving of the lower tiers of drawers and gentler curve of the upper tier of drawers and niches. The form of the giltwood cartouche with its cresting and distinctive lion mask at the base is characteristic of giltwood furniture c.1725.\nA bureau cabinet in burr elm with a bombe base formerly in the Donaldson Collection (sale, 1925) bears the same maker's inscription.",
