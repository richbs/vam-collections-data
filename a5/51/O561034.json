At this time most biscuits were supplied to retailers in large tins and then sold loose. The branding was therefore for display in the shop, identifying the goods. Huntley & Palmers used a distinctive \u2018girdle and buckle\u2019 trademark, which was soon imitated by other companies. \n\n\nSubjects Depicted\n\nBy 1900 Huntley & Palmers was the largest biscuit manufacturer in the world selling their  products in 172 countries. This international reach was exploited in series of advertising leaflets featuring scenes from around the world. This poster shows a scene in India and the end of a tiger hunt, in which the European participants have stopped to take refreshments.\n\n\nPeople\n\nThomas Huntley, who had previously helped his father Joseph run a confectionary shop in Reading, founded Huntley & Palmers in 1822 with his cousin engineer George Palmer.  The company pioneered the use of the biscuit tin in the 1830s, manufactured by tinsmith and ironmonger brother Joseph (whose firm became Huntley, Boorne and Stephens). Tins allowed their products safe transport initially to supply stage coach travellers staying at the Crown Inn in Reading but also enabling transport further affield.",
