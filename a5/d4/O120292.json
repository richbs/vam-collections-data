At one point it would also have had a label with red edging indicating the title of the photograph. There is evidence of this being torn off the mount. This type of label and mount suggests inclusion in an exhibition, possibly the Paris exhibition of 1867 or the subsequent South Kensington exhibition for which no catalogue has been found.\n\nHistorical significance: This photograph shows the inside of the Jami Masjid, the principle building of Fatehpur Sikri. It comprises an open courtyard or shan which measures 130m by 165m and is surrounded  with pillared  cloisters on three sides. In the photograph the building on the right hand side is the Jamaat Khana (Tomb of Islam Khan) and in the middle is Shaikh Salim Chishti\u2019s white marble tomb. On the left hand side of the courtyard, the western end is dominated by an iwan (large arched recess) containing the entrance to the central prayer chamber. The great dome of the prayer chamber is just visible behind the iwan. The archway of the iwan is 14.63 meters high\n\nNorthern and Eastern cells were intended to accommodate the Shaikhs senior disciples \u2013 where they performed their devotional exercises. \n\nThere are several figures in the courtyard which indicate the great scale of the building. There are also some trees which are no longer on the site.",
