The abstracted designs, rendered in shades of blue, yellow and silver/grey, are computer manipulated enlargements of details of two objects in the Silver Galleries.\n\nThe glass squares are of mouth-blown 'antique' glass painted in enamels and with etched design filled with lustre and enamels, and with further surface treatments worked by hand (the etched dedication was strengthened with a diamond point, and the Museum has been in discussion with the artist about the possibility of emphasising it further). These glass squares are mounted on larger glass panels held in a hinged frame with nine compartments. The designs were based on enlargements of digital photographs of two objects in the Silver Galleries (silver and glass epergne C.158-1928). These enlargements, rendered in a half-tone pattern of twelve-pointed stars, were digitally manipulated, and the cutting of the stencils was computer.",
