This was largely owing to the enthusiasm of Princess Charlotte (1796-1817), daughter of the Prince Regent, for such instruments. This example has eight strings and was probably played much like a Spanish guitar, but with two extra strings in the bass. It was made by Clementi & Co, a firm founded by Muzio Clementi (1752-1832) who came from Rome and settled in London in the early 1790s, where he set up a highly successful music-publishing and instrument-making business.",
