            "public_access_description": "This Punch is one of a set of figures used in his Punch and Judy show by Will Judge (1882-1960), billed variously as 'the Norfolk Comedian' and 'Refined Comedian and Patterer'. Although he performed all over the British isles, he was best known in East Anglia and the North of England.  He played Dame in pantomime and married Gertrude Orchard, who played Principal Boy. The figures were a gift from his son, along with an archive relating to Will Judge's career, although it contains no reference to him working as a Punch and Judy man.\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nMr Punch has had a cone-shaped hat for a long time.  A 17th-century ballad referred to his conical hat, his amorous character, and to someone who: 'kissed like Punchinello or a sucking pig.' He also had his characteristically squeaky voice for hundreds of years, and directions for a 17th-century play note that a character should 'speak in Punchinello's voice'.  An account of a performance by Punch and the Devil in 1699 noted that their dialogue was: 'conveyed to the ears of the listening rabble through a tin squeaker, which was thought by some of 'em as a great piece of conjuration as was ever performed by Dr. Faustus'. This is a reference to the Italian 'pivetta' which contemporary Punchmen call a 'swazzle'.",
