            "public_access_description": "The seated figure in the centre of the bowl is identified as a saqior cupbearer. They are frequently depicted on the incised or sgraffito wares of the medieval eastern Mediterranean. These figures, typically seated cross-legged, are expensively dressed in fine caftans and hold what may be a glass or metal goblet, presumably full of wine. A bottle or ewer, filled with wine, is often depicted alongside the figure. The saqi was usually a carefully chosen servant, who was handsome and well-educated. Universally, the position or office was held in high rank. They were employed at court where they gained the confidences of the nobility. The image would thus have appealed to Islamic courts (examples have been found was found in the citadel in Hama, Syria), as well as Christian markets, perhaps ordered through Italian maritime traders.",

Excavated in 1936-37 by Sir Leonard Woolley, it yielded significant ceramics of the ninth through the thirteenth centuries. Quanitities of imported wares from Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Levant were found;  but more significant were the kiln wasters indicating that the \"al Mina Ware\", the lively, white slip, clear glazed sgraffito ware with green and yellow or brown underglaze decorations, was indeed made at this site.",
