It was therefore probably made as a single religious image rather than as part of an altarpiece. Christ sits with his hands bound together and his head crowned with thorn branches. The thorns themselves consisted of nails and a good number of them remain. The architect and designer A. W. N. Pugin originally owned the figure. When the V&A bought it, records state that the bench was gilded and that 'Christ wears a dark-bluish black robe with ochre'.  A later hand-written addition to the records (dated April 1933) states: 'Paint & gilding (modern) removed by Art Work Room'.",
