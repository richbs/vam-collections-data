Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). \nThis example is a three-dimensional carving in the form of Daruma, the founder of Zen Buddhism. In his search for religious enlightenment, he is believed to have meditated in a cave for nine years, during which his arms and legs atrophied. It is for this reason that he is often shown as a rounded form of head and body without any limbs. During the Edo period (1615 \u2013 1868) in Japan, he is often depicted as a roly-poly toy that rights itself when knocked down.\nBoth wood and ivory were traditionally the most widely used materials for making netsuke. Since trees grow abundantly throughout Japan, wood is not only readily available but many varieties are comparatively cheap. There is also a long tradition of expertise in wood carving in Japan. \nFrom the 18th century onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed with the artist\u2019s name. This example is signed Sukenaga, short for Matsuda Sukenaga (1800 - 1871).",
