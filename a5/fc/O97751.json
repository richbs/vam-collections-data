The shaft tapers slightly and is of rectangular section terminating in a spirally fluted wooden grip, at each end of which is a brass collar and washer decorated with radiating grooves. All the iron parts are decorated with silver overlay picked out with small parts of gold on the head. The designs included foliage and strapwork with on the head figures of Adam and Eve. On one of the two wider faces of the shaft there is a battle scene of charging cavalry attacking from opposing towns and on the other a man leading dogs into a hunt of deer, boar and hare.",

Drinkwater (R.F. 56/3722) for \u00a380 using funds from the Farquharson Bequest of 1927. Its provenance before Drinkwater's ownership is unknown.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a finely decorated example of a war hammer. It is unusual for such a weapon to be inlaid with silver and gold and it is possible that it was used primarily as a signalling baton for the leader of an army. Although the wear and tear on the hammer head and point of the fluke suggest it has been used in anger, it is possible this damage was sustained by later collectors.",
