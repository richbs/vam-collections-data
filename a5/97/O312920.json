Apparently too small to adorn the centre of a book-cover - the plaque was perhaps mounted on one side of the head of a metal tau-cross of similar design to the contemporary St Heribert tau-cross in Cologne. Alternatively it may have been set into a small reliquary or formed part of a pendant, held in place with metal sheets overlapping the stepped border.\nThe figure style, the depiction of the fluttering folds of drapery below the left knee of the figure and the general type of Christ in Majesty with the tall, thin diptych book, link the plaque to Anglo-Saxon images in walrus ivory and manuscripts of the first half of the 11th century. It can be compared with the mid-eleventh-century stone relief of Christ in Barnack Church in Cambridgeshire.",
