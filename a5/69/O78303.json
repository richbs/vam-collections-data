Even the Southwark-based immigrants from The Netherlands adopted this form for their painted delftware mugs; it was simple to make in thick earthenware and provided a large surface area for decoration. As they had no colours available apart from red and white clays, the slipware potters developed simple designs of dots, dashes, zigzags and scrolls.\n\nTime\nAs it was considered nutritious, beer was not among the luxuries despised by the Puritans. However, such typical inscriptions as 'OBEAY GODS WORD', 'FEAR THE LORD THE GOD' and 'REMEMBER THY END TRULY' found on these mugs were certainly not designed to aid conviviality.\n\nPlaces\nSince potters working in London were disadvantaged by having to import all their materials, local country potteries with suitable clay supplied the capital with cheap utilitarian wares. The fine white clays of the Surrey/Hampshire borders were suitable for drinking and cooking vessels, while the more common red clays were used for coarser slipwares. Until the kilns at Harlow were discovered and excavated, these brash red and white slipwares, found in large quantities in London, were called 'Metropolitan'.",
