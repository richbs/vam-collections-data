            "public_access_description": "This is a campaign poster issued by and launching the PDS ('Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus' - Party of Democratic Socialism') for the first and only free parliamentary elections ('Volkskammerwahl') in East Germany (GDR-German Democratic Republic) on the 18th of March 1990. The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe PDS was the immediate successor party of the SED ('Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands - 'Socialist Unity Party of Germany') \u2013 the party that had ruled the communist GDR. The renaming of the party (in December 1989) expressed a new beginning. This poster advertises the process of renewal and reform through stating 'Das Herz schl\u00e4gt Links - Wir sind die Neuen', meaning 'the heart beats left - we are the new ones'.\n\nNevertheless, at first, the party constituted a shelter and reservoir for the former SED cadres. The idea of a new beginning was incorporated into the messages of the election campaign which adopted a stance of innocence and renewal. Additionally, the PDS demonstrated its new beginning through a new party leader, Gregor Gysi.On this black and white image Gregor Gysi and Hans Modrow are standing in the street talking to citizens of East Berlin.\n\nGregor Gysi was elected communist party leader after Krenz's resignation in December 1989, when the SED had begun to lose its grip on power and, in the face of popular pressure, had acknowledged the need for democratic change. He was president of the national lawyers association, had defended several prominent dissidents and had worked to obtain legal recognition for the New Forum. The party sought to disassociate itself from the communism of the previous regime, although its philosophy remained firmly rooted in the principles of democratic socialism.",
