The largest of the fifteen joined pieces which make up this cover, shows complete repeats of the pattern, which is composed of a silver flowering tree against a faint trellis formed by lines of flush weft and trefoils of fris\u00e9 silk beside a silver rock from which spring flowers brocaded in coloured silks. The rock is a chinoiserie rock, full of hollows, and the small four-petalled flowers in yellow, olive green, white lilac and lilac-pink springs from its base. On the top of the rock is a plant bearing flowers in shades of lilac, brown, tan and yellow, and with green stems and leaves. The repeat is 10.5 inches wide by 19.5 inches deep, and alternate rows of trees and rocks are reversed in direction and in order.\n\nRibbed tabby ground in cream silk, part of the weft being used to form a flush pattern, and brocaded in coloured silks and silver thread, fil\u00e9 and fris\u00e9.",
