The glassmakers of Venice had an excellent and wide spread reputation for high-quality colourless glass and fine workmanship in gilding and enamelling. \nAccount books and inventories of the time sometimes mention small numbers of 'worked' or 'gilded' glass and often this is stated to have come from Venice or Murano, the Venetian island on which the glass industry was concentrated. The value of such items was often many times as great as that of ordinary beakers and bottles which were used in much greater quantities for daily use at the dinner table.\nThe more valuable enamelled and gilt glasses were almost certainly used for special occasions only. Their shapes were also more varied, including footed beakers and bowls, cooling vessels, dishes, ewers, basins and salts. The fact that such items were specially mentioned in inventories showed how they were treasured by their owners from the start.\nEnamelled glass went out of fashion in Italy, from about 1520 onwards, but it remained popular in Central Europe. Venetian glassmakers continued supplying German patrons with finely enamelled wares, often decorated witht the arms of the patron.",

In his 15 years at the Museum, Robinson created the first public collection of medieval and Renaissance decorative art in Britain.",

The glassmakers of Venice had an excellent and wide spread reputation for high-quality colourless glass and fine workmanship in gilding and enamelling. \nAccount books and inventories of the time sometimes mention small numbers of 'worked' or 'gilded' glass and often this is stated to have come from Venice or Murano, the Venetian island on which the glass industry was concentrated. The value of such items was often many times as great as that of ordinary beakers and bottles which were used in much greater quantities for daily use at the dinner table.\nThe more valuable enamelled and gilt glasses were almost certainly used for special occasions only. Their shapes were also more varied, including footed beakers and bowls, cooling vessels, dishes, ewers, basins and salts. The fact that such items were specially mentioned in inventories showed how they were treasured by their owners from the start.\nEnamelled glass went out of fashion in Italy, from about 1520 onwards, but it remained popular in Central Europe. Venetian glassmakers continued supplying German patrons with finely enamelled wares, often decorated witht the arms of the patron.",
