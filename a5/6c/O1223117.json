Its original name was St Petersburg but it was changed to Leningrad in 1924 after the death of the creator of the Soviet communist party Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. It reverted to St Petersburg in 1991 after the collapse of the USSR.\n\nThe circus depicted on this brooch is the Circus on Fontanka, the first purpose-built stone Russian circus designed by the architect V.A. Kenel which opened on 26 December 1877. Unlike some other permanent circus buildings in Europe such as the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris, it does not look completely round from the exterior but has a flat theatre-like portico, behind which there is a circular building. It was built by the Italian circus peformer, rider and trainer Gaetano Ciniselli, the head of a large circus family who originally came to St.Petersburg on tour in 1847. With its perfect proportions and elegant interior decor with red velvet and gilding, the new circus was considered one of the most beautiful circus buildings in Europe. The building underwent major renovations which were completed by the 2003-2004 season, and now operates as The Bolshoi-St Petersburg State Circus.",
