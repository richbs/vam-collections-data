In the wake of its privatisation, the company wanted to move away from its image as a faceless, state-owned telecommunications system and instead stress the human aspect of its activities. Although the logo was a critical failure, Stephen Bayley famously describing it as \"Wolff Ollins at its blustering, mature worst\", it did remain in use until 2003.",
