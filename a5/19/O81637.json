Several publications, notably <i>Materials for the History of Oil-painting</i> (1847), and translations of German art treatises. Married the author Elizabeth Rigby 1849; died Pisa, Italy, 24 December 1865; his wife refused a public funeral for him in St Paul's Cathedral.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1855</i>, p277, 1865, p60 (obit); Lady Eastlake <i>A Memoir of Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</i>; 1870 W Monkhouse <i>Pictures by Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</i> 1875; D Robertson <i>Sir Charles Eastlake and the Victorian Art World</i> 1978 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>A Peasant Woman Fainting from the Bite of a Serpent</b> \nFA70 Neg L1862 \nCanvas, 55.9 x 47.6 cm (22 x 18\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'C L Eastlake/1831' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1831, and listed by Lady Eastlake as painted for John Sheepshanks in the same year. The back of the canvas is inscribed by the artist: 'No.2. Nina Ranieri, a young peasant woman of the Roman State, while kneeling before a chapel of the Madonna was bit by a viper: she sank into a lethargy in a short time and, it is said, died two days after. C L Eastlake 1831 '. The <i>Examiner</i> critic thought it 'choice ... carefully drawn after nature, in the purest taste, and forcible without violence ... the expression and action ... are singularly appropriate'. \n\nSheepshanks wrote to the artist Andrew Geddes in Rome 17 May 1830: \n\n'If you happen to be acquainted with Mr Eastlake, now, I believe, residing in Rome, and who was elected Academician last month, I should be obliged if you would mention that, by an ancient arrangement, I am to have a Picture painted by him, at some period (but not very long hence), when it is convenient. The dimensions or subject are neither of them very material, provided the latter is an agreeable one, and provided it is calculated for engraving, so that I may be enabled to forward the views of my little friend in that line, the more desirable; a large picture would be objectionable, as I am not likely to settle in a house soon' (quoted in D Laing <i>Etchings by Sir David Wilkie ... and by Andrew Geddes ARA</i> ... Edinburgh 1875, p25). \n\nSheepshanks had already bought a painting by Eastlake in 1823 (see FA 71, p. 76); presumably his letter refers to the present work, although it does not appear to have been engraved. \n\nAcademic art-historical references are made in the poses of both principal figures: the older woman's features and turn of head probably to the figure of St Elizabeth in Raphael's 'Canigiani Holy Family' (1507, Alte Pinakotek, Munich), while the injured peasant is adapted from Giulio Romano's 'Sleeping Psyche' (1528, Palazzo del T\u00e8, Mantua) which had also inspired Sir Joshua Reynold's 'The Death of Dido' (1781, Royal Collection). \n\nEXH: RA1831 (125); <i>Italian Art and Britain</i> RA 1960 (230); <i>Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</i> City Art Gallery, Plymouth, 1965 (14) \n\nLIT: <i>Examiner</i> 1831, p309; <i>Art Journal</i> 1857, p240; G Waagen <i>Treasures of Art in Great Britain </i>1854, Il, p 302; Lady Eastlake, <i>A Memoir</i>... 1870, p195\"",
