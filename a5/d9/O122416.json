The exterior of the bowl is unglazed, revealing the red pottery body. There are some areas of dark discolouration and a line of slip around the outside of the top edge, but none on the rim of the bowl. The interior has been covered in an off-white slip. A fine tool, a stylus, has been used to incise a design through the white slip to expose the red surface of the clay. The motif incised inside the bowl is of a large waterbird, a crane or a heron. The bird is in profile. Its head points upwards and its feet are set apart as if it is walking. It has plumage across its body drawn in lines and dashes, long legs and large feet. The twofalconer's lures at each side, together with the central bird, occupy the whole floor of the bowl's interior. The branches are palmette-like leaf-scrolls. There is no visible glaze on this dish (the museum registers state it had been burned off).",

Many production centres in the Near East and the islands of the Aegean made such ceramics and highlighted them with coloured glazes thus producing a much more colourful ware. Ceramics like the bowl here with an uncoloured simple but finely executed design  seem to be more characteristic of the Greek areas in and around Constantinople, Corinth and Thessalonika.\n\nDepictions of wading water birds was common in the Eastern Mediterranean and is part of a shared iconography between Christian and Islamic ceramic producers and users.",

Then incisions were made through the slip to reveal the red body of the clay underneath. The striking effect achieved by the contrast of the red and white is the end result of refinements that had been made to this technique which had been used to decorate pottery from very early times. By the 12th century engraved slipware was at its high-point.\n\nThe subjects depicted on this type of 12th century incised vessel often relate to the social status and wellbeing of their owner.
