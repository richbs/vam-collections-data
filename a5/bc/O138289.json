He asked at the fish and chip shop and was told that the horse could be sold for \u00a35, and subsequently wrote to the V&A with the owner's contact details urging that it be acquired.  Leigh Ashton, the V&A's then Director, followed it up with a letter to Mrs May Crampton, the owner, offering to buy the horse.  Mrs Crampton asked for payment in cash before handing over the horse, but accepted a promise of a money order through the post afterwards.",
