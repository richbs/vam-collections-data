From around the 7th century in the Western church it was seen to be as much the insignia of pastoral office - the symbol of the Good Shepherd - as a sign of episcopal authority. It is also used by archbishops, as the inscription on this one clearly indicates, although their sign of office is an archiepiscopal cross. The spiral-headed crozier, of which this is an example, was the most popular type in the medieval Western church and from the 13th century many terminated in a monster's head. By the late 15th century the crook or head had assumed the shape seen here, resembling a question mark.",

From around the 7th century in the Western church it was seen to be as much the insignia of pastoral office - the symbol of the Good Shepherd - as a sign of episcopal authority. It is also used by archbishops, as the inscription on this one clearly indicates, although their sign of office is an archiepiscopal cross. The spiral-headed crozier, of which this is an example, was the most popular type in the medieval Western church and from the 13th century many terminated in a monster's head. By the late 15th century the crook or head had assumed the shape seen here, resembling a question mark. \n\nThe Reformation of the Catholic church which followed the Council of Trent (1545-63), reinvigorated its spiritual message and artistic patronage. Architects and craftsmen were commissioned to design bold, dramatic new churches and furnishings to reflect this resurgence of Catholic self-confidence. Cardinal Giovanni Ricci was a great patron of the arts during this period, having commissioned frescoes showing scenes from the life of David from Francesco de' Rossi Salviati (1510\u20131563) for the Gran Salone of his palace in Rome (Palazzo Sacchetti). This crozier head reflects the elegant Mannerist designs that were highly fashionable in the 2nd half of the 16th century.",
