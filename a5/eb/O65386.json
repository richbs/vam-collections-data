Many of the mounts, including this one, are in styles that date from the late 18th century, but are impossible to date precisely since the same patterns continued to be in use for many years. They remained in manufacturer's stock and during the 19th century some of the styles periodically came back into fashion. This mount takes the form of a stylized honeysuckle-flower (or 'anthemion') with decorative scrolls.\n\nCope & Timmins was established soon after 1900 from two much older firms, Cope & Collinson (based in London since at least the 1840s) and Clarke & Timmins (who had premises in both London and Birmingham in the 19th century). In the second half of the 18th century Birmingham and London became the two principal centres of the ornamental metal-working industries, making locks, hinges, handles and decorative mounts for furniture, among many other products--all of which were widely exported.",
