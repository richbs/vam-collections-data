The other turned uprights are dowelled into the seat at the and the top rail and pass throught the arm-bow.  The arm-bow, which scrolls out at the ends of the arms, is cut to shape and joined by half-lap joints rather than bent, as would be usual with Windsor chairs. The front arm-supports curve backwards. All four legs are turned with the same pattern and are joined by an H-shaped stretcher with turned parts.",

A Windsor chair is characterised by its construction; the seat is of solid wood, with legs and arm-supports dowelled into it.
