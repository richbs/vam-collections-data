The calendar roundels and historical initials of the St Albans Psaltar of around 1130 are particularly close in style and some display the same type of beaded border decoration as on the tablemen. The connection with St Martin is not necessarily of relevance for the place of production as this particular saint had widespread appeal.\nThis piece clearly belongs to an ensemble of over thirty stylistically related gaming pieces, usually with either beaded - as here - or channelled borders. The present piece may have come from the same set of three other discs in St Petersburg, Basel and Oxford, which share the same beaded borders, dimensions and figure style.\n\nThe only medieval gamesboard to survive is for backgammon, and was found recently during excavations in Gloucester with a complete set of thirty pieces. Backgammon appears to have been a favourite game amongst the nobility and game sets were taken on the Crusades. Interest in the game may even have been stimulated at this period because of the contact with the East where it was very popular.",
