            "public_access_description": "Germany and Switzerland had a long tradition of ecclesiastical embroidery of this type. It was either 'white on white' or employed a combination of pale colours such as beige or cream, occasionally using a blue background. It was usually worked in linen or sometimes silk thread. In this example linen is used on a linen ground. \n\nThese materials were in contrast to the rich gold and silk embroideries that were also worked for the church but made in professional workshops. The richer materials were usually seen on church vestments (ceremonial garments worn for services) rather than on large hangings such as altar-cloths.\n\nThere was probably more than one reason why the materials used in this hanging continued in use. The religious communities that produced these embroideries often existed in isolation. Their products were therefore less subject to change than works of art produced in areas more in touch with current artistic developments. In addition, the materials they used were cheaper and more easily available than the costly silks and gold threads used by professionals. \n\nAt the top left and right the scenes show two saints with their attributes (conventional symbols), St Catherine of Alexandria with her wheel (on which pagans tried to kill her) and St Barbara with her tower, and the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary, in which the Angel Gabriel announced the birth of Jesus Christ. At the bottom left and right are the Crucifixion of Christ and the dead Christ with emblems of his Passion (the instruments used to torture him).",
