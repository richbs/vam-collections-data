As a child he shared his sister's passions for drawing and natural history and it was he who first encouraged Beatrix to publish some early rabbit drawings as greetings cards in 1890.  \n\nThis etching is one of several originally stored in a portfolio inscribed by Beatrix Potter, 'Bertram Potter etchings (good)'.  It is possible that the pencil annotations around the edge are Beatrix's own comments on her brother's work. His work certainly informed her own. On 25 July 1905 Beatrix wrote to Frederick Warne & Co. to suggest the cause of some 'spottyness' on the printing blocks of her book illustrations: 'I have seen my brother's copperplate etchings go exactly the same way, especially if using a mixture of hydrochloric & nitric acid. I think H.Cl. feels the heat most & they split'.  Beatrix later based several of her illustrations to The Fairy Caravan (1929) on Bertram's etchings of rocky Lake District landscapes.  \n\nAlthough overshadowed by the success of his sister, Bertram became an artist in his own right. He produced much larger scale oil paintings and etchings and exhibited work at the Royal Academy.",
