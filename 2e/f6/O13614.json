From the little evidence that survives it appears that the industry may have been first introduced into Italy, and then spread into Germany and other neighbouring countries. \n\nThis textile, which is part of a border from a hanging, has a design of exotic birds and other motifs in a style which suggests that it may relate to the patterns of woven silks made in Italy at around the same time. However this textile was found in Germany and it seems likely that it was made there.\n\nLinen was very difficult to dye, compared with silk, but as a cheaper material, and with a pattern made by printing a motif repeatedly from woodblocks, it could produce a relatively inexpensive hanging with an interesting design.",
