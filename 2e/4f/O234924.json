Behind him stands the bearded Joseph of Arimathea holding a fur-trimmed cap in his left hand and the crown of thorns in his right. He wears a voluminous mantle over a tunic, and round his shoulders a chain with a jewelled clasp.",

            "public_access_description": "These figures are from a group of Lamentation over the Dead Christ. St John kneels on the right holding his mantle with his left hand over his eye in a gesture of grief, while his right arm is outstretched to support the head of Christ. He wears a long robe which is buttoned at the cuffs under a mantle, the latter buttoned on the shoulder. There is a scribe's pen case and an ink bottle suspended from his belt. Behind him stands the bearded Joseph of Arimathea holding a fur-trimmed cap in his left hand and the crown of thorns in his right. He wears a voluminous mantle over a tunic, and round his shoulders a chain with a jewelled clasp. The group is carved from one block of wood and the back is flat.",
