In 1934 he published the caricature The Origin of the Nazi Salute which credited the salute as a tribute to an image of Hitler holding up n a paintbrush. During the war, whilst serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, Hopper's artistic talent led to his providing artwork for the Army Medical Department, notably to warn soldiers of the dangers of malarial mosquitoes. He returned to teaching after the war and continued producing caricatures for publication, especially of actors and entertainers.",
