Their use originated in Umbria in the later fifteenth-century. The irons were greased and heated, batter was poured on and they were pressed together, so that the decoration in relief transferred onto the  cooked wafer. The grease used to make the wafers may well have helped to prevent rust on the irons. \nThe decoration consists of an incised pattern of bands with a symbol in the middle of each plate, with lettering in the outermost band which may have been punched in using stamps. The centre of one plate has a large shield with arms showing a there towered castle. The inscription when reversed reads : ELSERVIRE.MAI.SEPERDE.EVNO.PERFCTO.AMORE.SEMPRE.E.PIVVERDE [Service is never lost and a perfect love is ever more green]. In the centre of the opposing plate is a mortar with two pestles, within a star. The inscription reads: RENZO.PACCA.M.CCCC.LXXXI.LUCA.PACCA [(Lo)Renzo Pacca 1481 Luca Pacca]. It is possible that Lucca refers not to Luke  but to Lucy or Lucia  and that the irons were therefore used to make cialde for the couple's wedding.",
