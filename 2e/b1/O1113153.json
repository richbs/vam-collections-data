They were musical clowns and also adept jugglers, performing juggling feats with conical hats and a plum pie 'canon ball'. The Huline Brothers also made 'The Broken Mirror' act famous, the act in which one clown stands within a frame and mirrors the action of the other, afraid to admit he has broken the mirror.\n\nComedy musical double acts were popular in late 19th century circus and variety, performed by clown duos in white-face make-up such as the Hulines and the Musical Webbs. Musical clowns played a range of instruments and made comical mistakes and funny noises while actually being expert musicians. The Hulines' instruments included the violin, the concertina, the banjo and hand bells. They were English, but became well known on the continent during the 1870s, and were on the bill at the Folies Berg\u00e8res in Paris in 1888.",
