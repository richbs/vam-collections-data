The case is ornamented with gilt brass mounts representing the themes of Time and Love.  Below the dial is a figural group with Venus clasping Cupid's bow, and at the four corner edges, draped female figures.  Inward-scrolling leaves rise towards a female mask at the centre of the cresting. Behind this rises a removable pediment, in part formed by a pierced, ribbed dome of brass surmounted by a finial mount in the form of a winged figure of Time seated on a globe.  The case is set at its lower corners with four further female masks and stands on four scrolling brass feet.   \n\nThe inside surface of the door at the back of the case is decorated with a panel of inlaid brass in the same materials as the clock case, depicting Bacchus astride a barrel holidng a glass of wine and a pouch, surrounded by leafy scrollwork, grape vines and masks. \n\nThe movement has a verge escapement.  The pendulum and silk suspension are missing.  The brass dial plate is set with enamelled plaques with a white ground, showing the hours in blue Roman numerals with the minutes in black Arabic numerals in smaller plaques around the edge, and has hour and minute hands of pierced blue steel.",

The ornate case would have been ordered from Paris by Salles, the Caen clockmaker who signed the movement. Two clockmakers named Salles were recorded as working in Caen in the 1750s, although by then the clock would have been rather old-fashioned in form.",
