Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\n\nThe subjects of the pictures deal mainly with the early life of Mahavira. Mahavira was was born a wealthy prince but is preparing for his renunciation of the householder\u2019s life when he will embark on his search for enlightenment as a homeless, naked ascetic. Here he gives away his ornaments to the poor.",
