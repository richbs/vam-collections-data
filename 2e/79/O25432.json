Joseph Nash, a draughtsman and lithographer of architectural views, was one of the artists who contributed to Dickinson's large folios. They were so successful that the project expanded to 55 views and took 3 years to prepare for publication. The folios considerably enhanced the reputation of the Dickinson brothers as lithographers, in particular because of their large size and blended colourwork.\n\nPlaces\nAt this stage in its history Germany was not one unified state. The various states however joined together to form two separate representations for Germany: North Germany and the Zollverein. North Germany included Hanover, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Nuremberg and Oldenburg. While the Zollverein included Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Wurtemberg, the two Hesses, Th\u0081ringen, Baden, Nassau and the free city of Frankfurt, as well as Prince Albert's home state of Saxe-Coburg. Zollverein's contribution was the larger one. There were fine displays of metalwork, textiles, furniture and ceramics and characteristic smaller German ware such as bird cages, gilded frames and Wurtemberg toys. Over 12,000 Germans were recorded as having visited the exhibition.",
