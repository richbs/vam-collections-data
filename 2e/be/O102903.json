Recent research, however, suggests that the wood is contemporary with the 16th-century silver-gilt mounts. \n\nThe mounts are decorated with the 'Instruments of the Passion' to recall Christ's suffering before and during his Crucifixion. They include his five wounds (in his hands, feet and side), the nails, the pillar against which he was scourged and the 30 pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed him. The sides of the cross are inscribed with Latin phrases relating to particular church services. The cross has an original case richly embroidered with gold stars and a figure of an angel on each door.\n\nThe legend of the True Cross begins in the year 326 when it was allegedly discovered in Jerusalem by Helena, the mother of the Roman emperor Constantine I. It was kept in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem until the year 614, when it was captured by Chrosroes II of Persia. Thirteen years later the Roman emperor Heraclius retook the relic, keeping it first in Constantinople and later in its original Jerusalem. In 1009 the Christians hid the relic and only produced it again in 1099, during the First Crusade.\n\nThe True Cross then remained in Christian hands until 1187, when it was captured by the Moslem leader Saladin.

            "public_access_description": "This cross was once thought to contain wood from the True Cross, the cross upon which Christ was crucified. However, the wood appears to be much more modern. The silver-gilt mounts are decorated with the Instruments of the Passion. On this cross, Christ\u2019s five wounds (from the nails in his hands and feet and the spear in his side) are shown with the nails themselves, the pillar against which he was scourged and the 30 pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed Christ. The sides of the cross are inscribed with Latin phrases relating to particular church services. The cross has an original case which is richly embroidered with gold stars and a figure of an angel on each door.\n\nThe legend of the True Cross begins in the year 326 when it was allegedly discovered by the mother of Constantine I, the Empress Helena in Jerusalem. Upon Helena's return, the True Cross was kept in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem until the year 614 when it was captured by Chrosroes II of Persia. Thirteen years later the Roman Emperor Heraclius defeated Chrosroes and retook the relic, keeping it first in Constantinople and later, in  its original Jerusalem. The True Cross is believed to have been hidden by the Christians in 1009 AD and remained hidden for ninety years only to be produced in 1099 during the First Crusade.\n\nIt remained in Christian hands until the Battle of Hattin in 1187, when the Moslem leader Saladin captured the relic. Despite the valiant efforts of Richard I during the Third Crusade, the True Cross remained in Muslim hands. The beam itself disappeared, but fragments of the cross that came off were collected and brought back to Europe after the Crusades where they were highly valued as relics.",

This iconography would have been clearly understood in the past but it may be less familiar to modern eyes. \n\nThough often decorative, the symbols used on religious metalwork also refer to the function and significance of the objects. The contemplation of religious motifs can draw   believers into a deeper understanding of their faith. Complex theological themes can be represented in a visual form. A chalice, for example, might be adorned with the tools used in the Crucifixion (the 'Instruments of the Passion') to direct the viewer's mind towards Christ's sacrifice and his death on the cross.\n\nThe use of images has caused controversy throughout Christian history. While supporters held that imagery glorified God and helped believers understand their faith better, critics attacked its use as superstition and idolatry.\n\nSaints\nChristians venerate saints as men and women who, through the holiness of their lives, became especially close to God. The saints include martyrs who suffered and died for their faith as well as great teachers and preachers. Their lives provide an example and inspiration for the faithful. Roman Catholics also believe that saints can intercede on their behalf with God. In Christian iconography, saints are usually depicted with a distinctive object or 'attribute' associated with their martyrdom or works. For example, St Bartholomew, who was skinned alive, holds a flaying knife, and St George is shown with a dragon.",
