It was probably done when he was performing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties and Circus, Hanley, during the week of 3 March 1895. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the graphic artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums. It is the earliest caricature in Cooke\u2019s collection and the only uncoloured line drawing.\n\nJ. Gar Kiddie was a comedian and pantomime producer. He had his own comic sketch company by 1907, when J. Gar Kiddie & Co. appeared at the Grand Theatre with their \u2018funny absurdity\u2019 \u2018The House of Tinn\u2019. Kiddie was the leading comedian in this. The caricature of him comes from the first of several albums that Cooke compiled. It features performers working in music hall in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5, although this drawing dates from 1895, when Cooke started sketching at the back of the album.",
