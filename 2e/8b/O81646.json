They are the earliest known\nsketches by Vanbrugh, the only developmental sketch\ndesigns for the house and the only design drawings\nto show the building with dome and domed pavilions\nin place. The drawings confirm that the domes were\nindeed Vanbrugh's idea and not Hawksmoor's,\nalthough the later development and much additional\nornament were probably Hawksmoor's. In the first\nphase, the house was conceived as a simple, rather\nlow structure of six bays in each range [see \nE.421-1951]. The sketches here show the\nintroduction of the idea of a central dome and \ndomed pavilions.\n...\n<u>Literature</u>: Kerry Downes <u>Vanburgh</u> 1977\nCharles Saumarez-Smith <u>The Building of Castle\nHoward</u> 1990\n\n            Early design for the elevation of the East range of\n            the South or garden front of Castle Howard, showing\n            nine bays of the central structure, and nine bays\n            of the wings, with the prominent chimneys.
