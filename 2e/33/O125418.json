            "historical_context_note": "Originally described as German and attached to the Hildesheim School on the ground of its resemblance to a pair of candlesticks with allegorical figures in the treasury of Hildesheim Cathedral. Count Borchgrave d'Altena strongly maintained that all these pieces must be Mosan for stylistic reasons and that they belong to the period of the Stavelot portable altar (ca.1150). Von Falke ascribes both the cross and the candlesticks to the \"master of the Stavelot portable altar\", dating them all to the third quarter of the twelfth century and making the important point that the Hildesheim candlesticks only reached their present resting place in the nineteenth century and they have no known historical connection with the town.\n\nThe Crucifixion constitutes the single most important event in the legend of the True Cross, a legend popular in the Mosan region. References to the legend occur on several works from the locality, most impressively on the Stavelot Triptych now in the Morgan Library New York. The portrayal of the present cross as \"Ragged\" -i.e. not cleanly finished, retaining knots along the shaft and arms provides a visual reference to the legendary previous existence of the wood as the tree of life in the Garden of Eden. \n\nThe earliest documentary evidence for placing a cross on an altar is canon III of the council of Tours held in 567 : \"Ut corpus Domini in Altari, non in armario, sed sub crucis titulo componatur\". It was placed on the altar to recall to the mind of the celebrant, and the congregation, that the sacrement offered from the altar was the same as was offered by Christ on the Cross.",
