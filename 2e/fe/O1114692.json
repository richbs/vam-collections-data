It was worn with tights of cream silk jersey dyed and painted in tones of pink with green tendrils on thighs, the body covered with silk petals in tones of pink, purple and red and a sleeveless silk leotard painted in tones of deep pink and violet with green tendrils, overlaid with silk petals in graduated tones from pink to purple.\n\nThe Ballets Russes premiered this ballet on 19 April 1911 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte Carlo. It was first performed by the Ballets Russes in London on 24 June 1911 at the Royal Opera House. \n\nThe ballet was choreographed by Mikhail Fokine and L\u00e9on Bakst designed the scenery and costumes. In the original performance Nijinsky danced the role of the Rose and Tamara Karsavina appeared as the girl dreaming of her first ball. Audiences were astounded by the grace and agility of Nijinsky as he performed his famous 'leap' out of the window as the girl begins to wake. His popularity was such that his dresser used to sell petals from his costume to his enthusiatic fans.",
