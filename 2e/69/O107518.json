The heat in this valley was intense, and I shall not soon forget the broiling I got in taking a picture of the deodar bridge by which we crossed the river.'",

Below is the relevant section for this photograph.\n'At Narkunda we had to leave the high level road which we had travelled for forty miles from Simla, and descend by a rugged path to the Sutlej, about 3000 feet below. The heat in this valley was intense, and I shall not soon forget the broiling I got in taking a picture of the deodar bridge by which we crossed the river.'\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, November 26 1869, pg 570.",
