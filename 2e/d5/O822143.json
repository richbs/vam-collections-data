The most clebrated interior at Fontainebleau was the Galerie Francois I, named after the then king, which featured fresco paintings set into elaborate plaster frames. This black and white print translates this idea into a form which was both much more affordable and portable, and thus enabled the influence of Fontainebleau to travel right across Europe.",

Oxford University Press [9/12/05], http:///www.groveart.com/\nThe Flemish painter and draughtsman Thiry worked as Rosso Fiorentino's assistant in the Galerie Francois I at Fontainbleau and later under Primaticcio. He was active as a designer of prints in the 1540s and although he died in 1550, his most important work 'Livre de la conqueste de la toison d'or' was not published until 1563. The style of this is dependent on Rosso Fiorentino of whom Thiry was a close follower. As a designer of ornament, Thiry was inventive but somewhat monotonous.\nOsborne, Harold /Jordan, Harold <u>Fontainebleau</u> in Hugh Brigstocke, ed. <u>The Oxford Companion to Western Art.</u> Oxford University Press,2001. Grove Art Online. Oxford Universiry Press, 2005 [9/12/05], http:///www.groveart.com/\nThe interior decoration of Fontainebleau was the most brilliant expression of the ambition harboured by Francois I to emulate the great humanist princes of Italy to glorify the prestige of the French Crown by bringing about a national revival of the arts under the aegis of  lavish court patronage. Lacking an indigenous tradition of mural painting adequate to his conceptions he brought Italian masters beginning with Rosso Fiorentino in 1530 to lead the work....\n\nAn elegant, refined, sensual, and highly idiosyncratic style invented by Rosso and Primaticcio. The Gallery Francois I intact but much restored is usually attributed to Rosso, and is one of the two most magnificent examples of the style. It employs a combination of fresco painting set in elaborate high relief stucco frames over a high plain dado ... the overwhelming abundance, high relief, elongated proportions of the figures, fruit garlands and strap work have no direct parallel in 16th century Italy. Prints by Pierre Milan and Boyvin ensured the dissemination of the Fontainebleau style to painting, tomb sculpture and the decorative arts.\nRobert-Dumesnil, A.P.F. <u>Le peintre-graveur fran\u00e7ais</u>.

Each scene is framed by an ornate border, thus reproducing the model given by Rosso Fiorentino in the Gallery of Francis I at Fontainebleau. L\u00e9onard Thiry, of Flemish origin, was one of Rosso's best assistants, as his salary at Fontainebleau, and Vasari's comment on him suggest. \n\nThe set was published in Paris in 1563, in both Latin and in French, and it was preceded by a letterpress text including a privilege, a dedication to the king, and four pages on the story of Jason written by Jacques Gohory. In most editions, we also find quatrains by the same poet, printed in a cartouche, and used as captions for each plate. Thanks to the privilege and dedication, we know that it was Jehan de Mauregard, an officer of the Crown, who had this set made in order to present it to the young Charles IX. The album kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum is an impression of the Latin edition and misses the poetic caption, as well as the numbers that seem to have been added in a second state. It is therefore very probable that it belongs to the first state, except for the last print. Indeed the 26th plate is numbered and must belong to the second state. The V&A also keeps scattered prints of this set: see E.2019-1908 to 2028-1908, 26595 A to 26595 F and E.88A-1891 to E.88B-1891. \n\nAll but one of the original drawings have survived. Twenty-two of them are kept in Leiden (Library of the University) and the other three are in Paris (Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-Arts).\n\nMedea sacrifices a ram to Hecate and Hebe, the goddesses that will help her rejuvenate Aeson.",
