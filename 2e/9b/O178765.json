            "public_access_description": "Walter Bertram Potter (1872-1918), known as Bertram, was the younger brother of the children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter (1866-1943). As a child he shared his sister's passions for drawing and natural history and was joint custodian of a menagerie of exotic pets, including salamanders, bats, rabbits, mice, lizards and snails.  It was Bertram who first encouraged Beatrix to publish some early rabbit drawings as greetings cards in 1890 and she continued to seek his advice when illustrating the Peter Rabbit books.  Although overshadowed by the success of his sister, Bertram became an artist in his own right. He produced much larger scale oil paintings and etchings and exhibited work at the Royal Academy.\n\nBertram and Beatrix were frequent sitters for their father's photographs.  Rupert Potter (1832-1914) took up photography in the 1860s when it was still a relatively new art form. An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he was elected to the Photographic Society of London in 1869 and later contributed to photographic exhibitions.  It was his delight to photograph his family during the long summer holidays to Scotland and the Lake District. Photography was an expensive and laborious process yet both Beatrix and Bertram appear to have endured patiently the elaborate choreography and the camera\u2019s uncomfortably long exposure. Rupert's prolific legacy of several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial account of their lives from infancy to adulthood.  \n\nRupert was also a skilled landscape photographer.  He photographed in particular the countryside around Eastwood in Dunkeld, Wray Castle near Ambleside and Lingholm on the edge of Derwentwater.  In 1890 the Potter family rented Coniston Bank, a house overlooking Coniston Water; his photograph of Bertram captures the misty stillness of the lake on a sunny autumn afternoon.",
