He wanted the Museum to be extended further in a similar style, so he scribbled his ideas down on this piece of writing paper, knowing that his draughtsmen in the Museum Design Office would turn its content into an attractive presentation drawing. The subsequent drawing included all the information contained in Cole's sketch, and showed how the proposed chimney for the boiler house, with its spiral exterior staircase, would have formed a distinctive and imaginative landmark. [See E.2034-1921].  Unfortunately, the Treasury did not approve of more expenditure, and the museum extension was finally built much later, to designs by Sir Aston Webb, and not completed until 1909.",
