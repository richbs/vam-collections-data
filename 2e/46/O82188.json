This medium is more durable than paper. Although these portraits were called 'plumbagos', meaning black lead, they were usually drawn in graphite and sometimes in ink. This portrait is done in graphite.\n\n\u2018Plumbagos' developed in the Netherlands in the late 16th century within the print trade. They developed from the printmakers\u2019 original drawings on paper, from which a print would have been engraved. 'Plumbagos' were introduced into England when the monarchy was restored in 1660, by printmakers who returned home from exile abroad. As the taste for 'plumbagos' became established, artists who were not printmakers also began to produce them.\n\nA few artists continued the art of the 'plumbago' into the early 18th century. John Faber was born at The Hague in the Netherlands about 1650 or 1660. As well as drawing 'plumbago' portraits, he was also a mezzotint portrait engraver. He came to England about 1687 or later and settled in London. His son, John Faber (about 1684\u20131756), was a well-known engraver.",
