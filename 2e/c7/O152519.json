The original \"dot matrix\" print was produced on the Atlas Computer at the University of London in 1963. At the time, Atlas was one of the world's most powerful supercomputers.\n\nColin's computer pictures were included in Cybernetic Serendipity, an exhibition held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. The same image is reproduced in the book accompanying the exhibition, along with the following explanation: \n\n\"These pictures are essentially action paintings. The programme which generates them has a \"repertoire\" of five standard shapes: the circle, the ellipse, the triangle, the square and the rectangle. Before generating any pictures, the programme selects subsets of these shapes at random. It then generates examples of each shape... The different shapes are distinguished by the use of different symbols.\" (p.95)\n\nThe photographic reproduction of Colin's print was donated to the Museum by the Computer Arts Society, which organised a number of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
