            "physical_description": "Chest, with panelled oak front, the sides back, bottom(?) and lid of elm, boarded (nailed). \n\nDesign:\nThe panelled front of the chest has three similar panels, chip-carved, with a lozenge with 'flaming' finials, containing a flower-head. The stiles and muntins chip-carved with stylised leaf pattern. The bottom rail carved with a guilloche pattern. The top rail carved with lunettes. Below the bottom rail, the stiles are cut with mortices, possibly mis-placed, or suggesting that there was an apron underneath the bottom rail, which however seems unlikely. The top rail fitted with an internal iron lock possibly of 17th century date (held with modern screws), and external escutcheon, thought to be original. The key (refound 2013) is apparently of 17th century date. The lid moulded along the front and back edges, and attached with two iron paired-ring hinges (original). The sides plain but with a notched v-shape cut-out forming two feet. The back is plain. At the left side is a till missing its lid.\n\nConstruction:\nThe chest front is of frame and panel construction with double pegging. It is pegged to the chest sides through both stiles with three large pegs, and appears to be attached to the bottom using the same pegs that join the muntins to the bottom rail. The body of the chest is of conventional boarded construction, using large hand-wrought iron nails.\n\nCondition:\nThe right side split down the middle, due to cross grain shrinkage, with a repair batten nailed inside at the top. The left side repaired with a vertical strip along its front edge, and a triangular block at its back edge. The lid with worm losses at its front left corner. The lock ring on the lid has been remounted on a backing.",
