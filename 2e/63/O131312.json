            "public_access_description": "Hubert Salentin (1822-1910) was born in Z\u00fclpich. He became the pupil of Wilhelm Schadow (1788-1862), Carl Ferdinand Sohn (1805-1867), appointed Director of the Kunstakademie in 1826, and Adolph Tidemand (1814-1876) in D\u00fcsseldorf. He subsequently definitively settled in D\u00fcsseldorf where he specialised in genre paintings. He won a medal in Vienna in 1873.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Salentin's genre scenes of the rustic life in West Germany. It depicts a young mother in traditional costume with her new born child in her arms leaving the church after the baptism. This painting is characteristic of the D\u00fcsseldorf school, one of the main artistic centres in 19th-century Germany, which favoured an extreme naturalness of representation and carefully staged compositions. The subject matter derived here from the Biedermeier painters who praised sentimental and anecdotal genre scenes.",

Biedermeier painters were ideologically opposed to academic and religious painting and favoured such subject matter as portraits, landscapes and genre scenes, with still-lifes, especially of flowers. They share a similar technique in the use of separate, clear tones and a high degree of finish, reminiscent of Neo-Classicism while they tend to convey a greater sentimentality. By the 1880s, the influence of this artistic movement was on the wane and was even used pejoratively to characterize the reactionary bourgeois elements in society, which remained quite indifferent to social problems and cultivated a sense of order and sobriety, especially in the private sphere and the domestic realm.",
