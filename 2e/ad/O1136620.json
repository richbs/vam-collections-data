Some of these are double-sided like the present one. Dated around 1575, the present work shows a Nigella (Love-in-a-mist) on the recto and a field Cow-wheat on the verso. Although Lemoyne has long been considered as an obscure artist providing designs for simple woodcuts, his botanical watercolours which were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century have earned him a place in history as one of the most remarkable early botanical painters.",

            "bibliography": "Gill Saunders, <u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u>London: V&A, 1985, p.46\nThe following is adapted from the entry: \n\n\"This is one of a remarkable series of fifty-nine paintings on thirty-three sheets of flowers, fruits, butterflies and moths, which were painted by a 16th-century artist whose life, both in the New and the Old World, had in its narrow escapes from death, and dramatic vicissitudes of fortune, the quality of an epic adventure story. \n\nBorn in Dieppe in 1533, Jacques Le Moyne De Morgues was a Hugenot. In 1564 he was selected as cartographer and artist to accompany an expedition to relieve an earlier settlement of French Hugenots in Florida. His account of the ill starred expedition makes gripping reading. It tells of warring tribes of Indians, mutiny amongst the French camp, of famine, and the providential arrival of the English privateer Sir John Hawkins with supplies. His story culminates in an exciting account of his escape from Fort Carolina during the massacre of the garrison by the Spanish fleet. \n\nOn his return to France Le Moyne was commanded by Charles X to lay before him his maps and paintings of the Indians. These pictures (in engraved form) and his story were published after his death by Theodore de Bry in 1591 in <i>Les Grands Voyages</i>. \n\nIn 1572 Le Moyne made his way to London to avoid the growing hostility to the Hugenots which was to culminate in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. There he was taken into service by Sir Waiter Raleigh, and came to know Sir Philip Sidney, Hakluyt, and the botanist Gervais, author of a famous <i>Herbal.</i> \n\nIt was in London that Le Moyne published in 1586 his own <i>La Clef des Champs</i> illustrated with botanical woodcuts with which the fifty-nine paintings in the Victoria and Albert Museum are closely connected. He died at Blackfriars two years later in 1588. \n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum's water-colours by Le Moyne are outstanding botanical illustrations, remarkable for their directness and truth to nature. But ironically they were initially acquired in 1856 as one of the first purchases of the Museum, almost by accident, and solely because they were bound up in an extremely fine French late-16th-century brown calf binding. Since the discovery of the importance of the water-colours in 1922, they have been mounted separately, and can be studied in the Print Room.\n\nLionel Lambourne\"\nPaul Hulton, <u>The Work of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, A Huguenot Artist in France, Florida and England</u>, vol.

            "historical_context_note": "The present drawing belongs to an album of 59 botanical watercolours depicted on 33 sheets of paper, some of these being double-sided like the present one, and attributed to Jacques Lemoyne de Morgues. The present work shows Nigella (Love-in-a-mist) on the recto and a field Cow-wheat on the verso.\n\nThe drawings from this series were acquired in 1856 as one of the first purchases of the V&A, almost by accident, and solely because they were bound up in an extremely fine French late-16th-century brown calf binding.\n\nAlthough Lemoyne has been long considered as an obscure artist providing designs for simple woodcuts, he was recognised at the beginning of the 20th century as one of the most remarkable early botanical painters.\n\nThe V&A binding and the inscriptions on the drawings in both French and Latin suggest that the series was probably made in France around 1575. Lemoyne left the Continent to London where he settled shortly before1580. The V&A album can be compared with another album, reputed to have been made around 1585 in England, and now in the British Museum.\n\nAnother group of 27 sheets stylistically close and on similar paper to the V&A watercolours appeared on the market in 2004, followed by a bound florilegium with eighty drawings in an 18th-century French mottled calf gilt and lettered \u2018anno 1770\u2019 in 2005.(See Sotheby's, New York, 21 January 2004, lots 29-55 and Sotheby's, New York, 26 January 2005, lot 46.) A highly finished group of six gouaches on vellum on blue and gold background were sold from the Korner collection in 1997 (Sotheby's, New York, January 29, 1997, lots 55-60).\n\nThe interest in plants for their medicinal properties and religious symbolism was well anchored since the Middle Ages in Western Europe. A great number of manuscripts were beautifully illuminated with flowers and plants, echoing an interest that goes back to the Antiquity. However this impressive album of botanical watercolours shows a renewed curiosity for the flora from both a scientific and an aesthetic point of view. \n\nIn this respect, Lemoyne de Morgues\u2019 representations of plants and insects, which show a particular attention to details and a great sense of realism, can be seen as a forerunner of such projects as the Museum Chartaceum (Latin for \u2018Paper Museum\u2019), made by Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657) who commissioned to minor and major artists a vast collection of drawings recording, among others, natural history subjects (see V&A E.731-1949 to E.735-1949, E.2776-1962 to E.2777-1962, E.426-2009 to E.428-2009, and E.1026-2011 \u2013 and also Royal Library, Windsor Castle, and British Museum, London).",
