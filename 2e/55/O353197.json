The cap is formed with an outer layer of glazed linen hardened/moulded around a layer of wool or other fibre (possibly linen?) and then lined with another hardened layer of linen. From the inside it appears to a continuous, flat layer but from the outside  there is a definite small, skull cap attached to a wide head band (90mm). The outer linen is glazed. It has white threads alternating with blue threads. Some of the threads have metal gilt remaining. A floral pattern has been painted onto the fabric. It is of a single flower with decorative stem. The flower seems to have a light wash of yellow stain over it. There is one flower and stem over the skull cap and three around the head band (although half the head band is missing). There is a thin layer of fibrous padding and then an inner layer of blue linen (poorly dyed); plain woven; approx. 15x15 tpc. A continuous running stitch in undyed linen thread (s-spun) can be seen circling up from the base to the top of the lining. It is also visible from the outer side of the cap. There is some staining.\n.",

            "public_access_description": "Half of a head cap of linen and wool/fibre? Painted design and metal threads. Egyptian, ca. AD1000-1400. From a tomb. The cap is formed with an outer layer of glazed linen hardened/moulded around a layer of wool or other fibre (possibly linen?) and then lined with another hardened layer of linen. From the inside it appears to a continuous, flat layer but from the outside  there is a definite small, skull cap attached to a wide head band (90mm). The outer linen is glazed. It has white threads alternating with blue threads. Some of the threads have metal gilt remaining. A floral pattern has been painted onto the fabric. It is of a single flower with decorative stem. The flower seems to have a light wash of yellow stain over it. There is one flower and stem over the skull cap and three around the head band (although half the head band is missing). There is a thin layer of fibrous padding and then an inner layer of blue linen (poorly dyed); plain woven; approx. 15x15 tpc. A continuous running stitch in undyed linen thread (s-spun) can be seen circling up from the base to the top of the lining. It is also visible from the outer side of the cap. There is some staining.",
