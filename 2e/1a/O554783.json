(1892-1980)</b>\nDesign for an oak chest of drawers. Front elevation, side elevation, part plan of top and feet, sacle 3 inches to 1 foot. Full scale details of handle and parting rail.\n\nSigned and date in ink <i>GR. 6.27</i>. Inscribed with title, constructional details and <i>for drawings, line white mahogany or Spanish chestnut, laburnum or mulberry handles drawer front with incised and painted numerals 1-50, 51-100,101-150 etc.</i> Numbered <i>No.617</i>. Stamped <i>Designed by Gordon Russell, Copyright of the Russell workshops (Russell &amp; Sons) Broadway Worcs. Please return.</i> Stamped in red <i>Despatched.</i>\nPen and ink on tracing paper.\n33.6 x 41.5 cm\nGiven by the designer\nE.333-1977\n\nGordon Russell began his career as  manager of the repair shop of his father's antique business. He started designing furniture in about 1910 working in the Arts and Crafts tradition. In 1926 he founded Gordon Russell Ltd and from about that date began using mechanised methods of construction. Around 1930 his firm's designs took on a simpler 'modern' appearance. During the Second World War he headed the team that designed Utility Furniture.\n\nThis drawing has been selected from nearly fifty by the firm in the Department's collections. It is the working drawing from which the chest of drawers, thought to have been made to house the firm's drawings, was constructed. It is a traditional piece: its overall lines are simple but the decorative use of a variety of luxury  woods and the attention paid to detailing, including chamfered edges and decorative as well as constructional dovetailing are in keeping with the firm's earlier work. The drawing shows the type and dimensions of the various joints in the chest and also draws attention to the two roles of the dovetailing.'",
