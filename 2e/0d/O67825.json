He commissioned the silversmith Fuller White to make him one in 1755.\n\nArgyles were most popular between 1765 and 1800, when they were made in silver, porcelain, earthenware and Sheffield plate, like this example. They were one of a number of specialised items that evolved when people became increasingly preoccupied with elegant dining. There were two ways of keeping the liquid hot. There was an external jacket, filled with hot water, that enclosed an inner gravy reservoir. Alternatively, a hot iron was placed in an internal socket. \n\nThe user poured hot water into the 'jacket' through the aperture at the back.  The wicker handle protected the user\u2019s hand from the heat.  Most argyles had a spout rising from the base, as you can see here. This was to avoid pouring out the fat, which separated and rose to the surface as the gravy cooled.",
