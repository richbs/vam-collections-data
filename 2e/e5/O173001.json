Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Venice.   Venice had been famous since the Middle Ages for its fine gold and filigree work.  The type is called 'a mandorla' in Italian, meaning almond-shaped, and it probably derives from a French pattern commonly worn by fisherwomen.\n \nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
