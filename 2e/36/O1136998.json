The text is as follows: <i>school of </i> VERONESE, PAOLO 411 A mythological scene Inscribed in pencil in a later hand \u2018P. Veronese\u2019; an older inscription in ink along the upper edge on the left side if cut and illegible Pen and ink and wash 7 3/8 x 13 7/8 (187 x 351) Dyce 250 PROVENANCE Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 250 (as by Paolo Veronese); Tietze and Tietze-Conrat, no. 2204. Tietze and Tietze-Conrat attribute the drawing to Paolo Veronese\u2019s son, Carletto Caliari, suggesting that it might be connected with the frieze which (according to Ridolfi) Carletto and his brother Gabriele painted round the dining-hall of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi at Venice (Le maraviglie dell\u2019arte, Venice, 1648, von Hadeln edition, Berlin, 1914 and 1924, I, p. 357). Among the subjects represented were \u2018favole di medea, che ringiovenisce il vecchio Esone\u2019. The rejuvenation of Aeson, Jason\u2019s father, is not the scene represented here; but the drawing may well represent some other episode in the story of Medea and Jason, as there is a fleece hung up in the portico of the temple on the right and the dragon may be its guardian. Even so, it is doubtful whether enough is known about Carletto\u2019s drawing style to justify our attributing this drawing to him. In style and handling it is rather close to Paolo Veronese himself and my possibly be by his hand. Even if it is connected with the frieze in the dinning-hall of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, it is not necessarily by Carletto: for according to Boschini (Le ricche minere della pittura veneziana, Venice, 1674, p. 110) and Zanetti (Descrizione di tutte le pubbliche pittura della Citt\u00e0 di Venezia\u2026, Venice, 1732), the frieze was by Paolo Veronese.",
