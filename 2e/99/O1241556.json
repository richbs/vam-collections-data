The ballet was adapted from David Garnett's 1922 novel.\n\nFour female guests appeared in the first production of Lady into Fox. At the Mercury they were danced by Olivia Sarel, Joan McClelland, Helen Ashley and Rosemary Young. However the design is inscribed 'Sally' in pencil. Sally Gilmour took the leading role of Silvia Tebrick.\n\nArtist Nadia Benois (1896-1975) studied painting in Russia, first under her uncle, stage designer Alexandre Benois, and later at St Petersburg Academy. She married the international journalist Jona Ustinov and the couple moved to London, becoming British citizens. Her theatre designs include The Descent of Hebe, Dark Elegies and Lady into Fox for Marie Rambert and, for the Vic-Wells (now Royal) Ballet, the first British production of the full-length The Sleeping Princess (The Sleeping Beauty) in 1939.",
