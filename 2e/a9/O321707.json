Here, then, are six of the very, very best. Interviews by Flynn Sarler. Photographs by David Harrison\"\n[...]\nRoland Dawson\nMahogany model staircase (anon)\n\nRoland Dawson has worked here for 16 years. He is a shift supervisor, in charge of the warders who look after the objects at the museum.\n\n\"I'm not a great do-it-yourself person. Once I tried to fix a shelf for my wife while my mind was elsewhere (with my beloved Arsenal - I was about to go to a match.) I just hammered these two ginormous nails into the wall. Every single person that came into the house after that was shown this shelf. \"Come in\", my wife would say. \"Look what Curly's done.\" It was horrible. I have got a bit better, but when I look at my little shelves now and think \"It's not bad\", I remember this balcony and staircase. It drives me insane to know someone can be that brilliant. It's so perfect.\n\nWhen I started here it was in the woodwork gallery. I looked after that part of the corridor and I used to stand next to it for hours, looking backwards and forwards to find a fault in it. Because it was hand-done and it was so intricate I thought there had to be something wrong somewhere. I even thought of it when I was in a different gallery: I'd think \"I must have a look at that part next time, because I'm sure they couldn't have got it right.\" But they had.\n\nIt was put away about, oh, a dozen years ago, when the woodwork gallery became the shop. Then I became a fireman and didn't visit the stores so much. When I became a supervisor I opened the store doors one day and there she was. It must have been all of seven or eight years since I had last seen her. Still gorgeous. It's coming out again this month. It should be out - it's too beautiful to put away.\n\nIt annoys me sometimes that someone can be so clever as to make that, but if it was ever in danger, like from a fire or something, I'd be the first one passing it out the window, making sure it was safe.\"",

It does not relate to any known staircase, although a wooden staircase of similar design can be seen at Chevening House, Kent. The Chevening staircase, on a circular and self-supporting scheme, was designed by the architect Nicholas Dubois in 1720 for James, first Earl Stanhope.\n\nThe model staircase originated in the collection of Queen Mary's sister in law, Margaret, Marchioness of Cambridge, who died in 1929. After her death, Queen Mary donated it to the V&A.\n\nIn 1996, Roland Dawson, a shift supervisor at the V&A who had worked there since 1980, chose this staircase as his favourite exhibit for an article in the Sunday Times, October 1996. He was photographed with the staircase for the magazine.",
