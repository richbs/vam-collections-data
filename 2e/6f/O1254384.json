The other favourite actress of the day, Madge Kendal, played Mistress Ford, and together they delighted audiences with the comic business. Tree had made a success with his production, and his portrayal of the rotund Falstaf, in 1889, and revived it with two of the greatest actresses of the day in honour of the coronation of King Edward VII, which was due to take place in June 1902 but was postponed until August.\n\nThe original image was drawn by the artist Pamela Colman Smith (1878-1951) and her her characteristic mark of an interlaced P, C and S is included in the bottom left hand corner. The print is dated April 1905. \n\nPamela Coleman Smith (1878-1951) was an artist and illustrator who became closely involved with the Lyceum Theatre Company, and the actress Ellen Terry (1847-1928) in particular, from the late 1890s. She was best known for her work as an illustrator but she also worked in the field of stage design and exhibited her paintings.",
