The Brownies were one of the youth movements started by Robert Baden-Powell in 1914 as the younger version of the Girl Guides. They were originally called Rosebuds but the name proved unpopular and  was changed to Brownies, named after the helpful little creatures that appeared in fairy story, 'The Brownies And Other Tales' written in 1879 by Mrs Juliana Ewing.\nThe Brownie uniform has gone through several changes over time. When this belt was worn by Ellen in the 1970s, the uniform comprised a brown dress with yellow necktie, this purse belt and a beret or cap. Recent incarnations of the uniform have been designed to be more practical and have moved away from the wearing of dresses. Fashion designers Jeff Banks and Ally Capellino redesigned the uniforms in 1990 and 2002 respectively. Capellino's design includes a selection of mix and match practical garments such as a pair of shorts with a flat front like a skirt.",
