Under the cap, the upper end of the instrument is partially cut away, presumably to make a space to contain a sponge for absorbing condensed moisture, leaving the full length of the wind-way intact.'\n\nAnthony Baines, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-Keyboard Instruments</i> (London, 1978), p. 85.",
