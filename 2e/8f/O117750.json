It is after a print by the wood-engraver Tobias Stimmer (1539-1584) illustrating Johann Fischart's broadsheet known as Malcho Papo, published in 1577. It was a Protestant broadsheet of the type that contains images of Protestant Reformation propaganda critical of the practices of the Catholic Church at that period.  The glass painter, Hans Rudolf Lando (1584-1646) from Bern, Switzerland, signed this stained glass design which was in his collection and probably used as a model in his glass painting workshop.  His signature can be seen in the bottom right corner of the painted frame.",

St. Peter is barefoot, and simply dressed; the Pope, abetted by the devil, is in full regalia.' Protestant pamphlets and broadsheets contain startling images of propaganda that remained current.
