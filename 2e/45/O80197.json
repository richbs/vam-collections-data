Edwin Landseer (1803-73)\nThe Eagle's Nest\nOil on canvas, 25.4 x 35.6 cm (10 x 14  ins)\n\nLandseer became the most famous painter of animals of the nineteenth century. As a precocious youth he had been heavily influenced by the realism of George Stubbs's animal painting, but he added an extra element of anthropomorphism; that is he often gave the creatures he depicted almost human expressions and situations. Landseer grew to love Scotland after his first trip there in 1824, when he visited Sir Walter Scott. He then frequently returned to the landscape of Scotland and the wild creatures he had seen there. This work is a fine example of Landseer depicting birds in a vast natural setting. The wild mountains and the bleak rocks, the few bare sticks of the great bird's nest, have a romantic melancholy which appealed to those who admired the poetry of nature in its untamed state. \n\nGiven by John Sheepshanks, 1857   (FA 102)"

Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n\n<b>The Eagle's Nest </b>\nFA 102 Neg GA1204 \nMillboard , 25.4 X 35.6 cm (10 X 14 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nListed by Graves under the year 1833, and exhibited at the BI in 1834. The work is a fine example of Landseer depicting birds in a vast natural setting, and may be compared with 'Ptarmigan' (also early 1830s, repr Ormond p80) and 'The Ptarmigan Hill' (late 1860s, repr Ormond p217). A crayon sketch of the same subject was in the studio sale at Christie's 11 May 1874 (537, described as a cartoon, 179 X 106 cm/70\u00bdX 41\u00be ins), and was shown at the commemorative RA exhibition in the same year. \nWaagen thought 'the grand melancholy solitude of the Highlands is here well expressed, though the tone of the colouring is too heavy'. Lennie, writing about the 1869 'A Swannery Invaded by Sea Eagles' as an expression of Landseer's personal psychological condition, commented that the presented work 'had shown the grey, bleak and uncompromising landscape that was the great bird's home: that, too, had been a landscape totally without rest or pity which seemed to reflect the beginnings of Edwin's <i>angst'.</i> \n\nEXH: BI 1834 (276); <i>Paintings and Drawings by Sir Edwin Landseer</i> RA RA 1961 \n\nENGR: Woodcut, W Thomas, for <u>Illustrated London News </u>1861 \n\nLIT: G Waagen <u>Treasures of Art in Great Britain </u>1854 II, p305; Mann II, p131 (With photograph of Thomas woodcut); <u>Graves </u>no 195;<u> Lennie </u>p225 \n \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nRichard Ormond, <u>Monarch of the Glen: Landseer in the Highlands</u>.
