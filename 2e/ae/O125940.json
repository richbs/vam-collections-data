Its shape indicates that the clock it was made to house was squat and square, suggesting a date in the mid-seventeenth century.  \n\nThe case is made of wood, lined with pink silk and covered with a thin layer of very fine hide, probably calf skin, dyed red.  It is likely that the hide was decorated before it was applied by damping it down and impressing it with a variety of heated tools. Rollers and stamps were used to create a recessed pattern which, once the hide was dry, would last indefinitely. The pattern was then filled with gold leaf and polished.  The decorated hide was glued to the wood and the corners reinforced with round-headed nails.\n\nThe two side handles are formed as dolphins flanking a mask, and the escutcheon features two cherubs holding an oval cartouche surrounded by swags of drapery.",
