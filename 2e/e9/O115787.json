The latter regularly expands longitudinally to form a lobed cross with a red diamond centre; in the top band the diamond frames a cream rosette, in the bottom it frames 4 outward-looking yellow flowers in profile.  Where the central band overlaps a pair of six-sided, horizontally joined figures are produced; they are also red and each of the pair contains a yellow flower.  The central band runs a zigzag course across the fragment expanding at each point into a lobed 'palmette' outline which overlies the upper and lower bands.  In all the strapwork there runs a green stem with predominantly yellow buds and flowers which expand into vigorous floral sprigs and where the bands thrust up or down.  The field is equally filled with slender green-leaved stems bearing either cream or light yellow carnations or clusters of jasmine.",
