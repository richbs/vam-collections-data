Silks in dark and light green, yellow, blue, brown, beige, cream and red.

Background of gold thread laid and couched with red silk in three different small geometric patterns in the three scenes. Outlined in woven gold braid, and lined with modern red material. \n\nCross or back orphrey: Foliate decoration above ogee arches over pillars, under which are (reading downwards) God the father and the Holy Family in the form of a Dove; Christ Crucified with six angels, two to the right and two to the left of Christ and two at the foot of the cross, and each angel holds a chalice to receive the Holy Blood except for one; and the figure of St Mary Magdalene with a palm branch in her right hand and book in her left. At the bottom is an incomplete figure of a saint, possibly St Nicholas of Myra.\n\nFront orphrey: Three separate applied figures within borders of woven gold braid to form a pillar orphrey, reading downwards: The Virgin Mary, an unidentified saint, and the Lamb of God. The embroidery and design of these figures are much coarser than those of the back orphery, and not associated with it.",
