It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nIsobel Elsom was a well-established actress by 1932 when she was touring in The Painted Veil, an adaptation of a Somerset Maugham story about an adulterous wife in colonial Asia. Isobel Elsom made her first stage appearance in London in 1911 at the Adelphi Theatre in The Quaker Girl and in 1914 took over Gladys Cooper's roles in My Lady's Dress. She started her film career in 1921 and appeared in silent films, 'talkies' and a host of plays in the West End, in the regions and abroad. The Painted Veil was made into a film in 1934, starring Greta Garbo.",
