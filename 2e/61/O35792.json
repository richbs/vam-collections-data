It is mounted on a rectangular wooden block which has four small round feet. Complete with a seam edge guide the machine sews a chain stitch. The wheel is turned by a large wooden knob painted black. At one end of the wooden block is a metal slot and at the other a hinged clasp. Attached by a piece of string to the wheel is a small ring of green felt which would normally be at the base of the cotton reel spindle. \n2. lid; wood and plywood semi-circular box with a metal hook at one end to fit into the metal slot on the base and a metal swivel bracket to hold the clasp at the other end. On the top is a metal handle. The box's condition is poor with the plywood lifting and missing in places and the sides of the box sprung. This damage was probably caused by dampness. \n3. key; flat metal strip attached to the handle of the lid by a piece of string.",
