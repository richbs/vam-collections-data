The relief shows these influences. His work is the sculptural equivalent of the paintings of his close friend Simon Vouet, who studied with him in Rome. One of the founders of the Academie Royale, Sarazin assisted Charles Lebrun in its organisation. The leading sculptor in Paris in the first half of the 17th century, he was the teacher of many of the generation of sculptors who were to work at Versailles (Girardon, Marsy, Le Hongre), exerting a decisive influence on the special development of French Baroque sculpture and architectural decoration.",
