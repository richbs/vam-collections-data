Maudgalyayana was one if the Buddha Shakyamuni's closest disciples. He was most accomplished of all the Buddha's disciples in the various supernatural powers. He appears to be portrayed here with a bowl which might refer to when his mother needed water and food. So he used his magical powers to conjure up a bowl of rice and a cup of water.\n[figure] The Buddha is attended by two disciples, probably Sariputra on the left side and Maudgalyayana on the right side. Sariputra was one of the two princicpal  disciples of the Buddha. He became an Arhat renowned for his wisdom.\n[figure] Represents the Buddha in <font -i>bhumisparsa-virasana mudra</font> right hand in earth-touching or witness gesture with the right leg over the left leg position). His left hand rests upturned on his lap. His monastic robes are draped over his left shoulder and flow onto the pedestal and combine the traditional open mode of bare right shoulder with a partial covering. His curly hair held by a narrow band rises to a <font -i>unisha</font> (topknot) surmounted by ?\nHe sits on a tiered triple pedestal. Central tier depicted with a pair of flying figures bearing branches of lotus flowers and ornamented at each corner with <font -i>manok-thi-ha</font> (a creature with two bodies in the form of seated lions with a single human face).\n[part] A sacred tree supposed to shade The Buddha in the figure group. It is made of a long metal rod of which the top end has got metal discs attached to the rod, spaced out evenly, to which metal wires are knotted through holes in the discs.
