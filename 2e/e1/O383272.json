Before the development of modern medicine, fevers, cramps and toothache could be painful and dangerous. Childbirth could kill mother or child.  Many people believed that the supernatural powers embodied in an amulet could promote fertility and good health and offer protection against malign forces or the 'evil eye'.  Although the Catholic Church was opposed to the pagan nature of many amulets, it was powerless to prevent their use.\n\nThe \u2018fig\u2019 amulet, shaped like a clenched fist with the thumb protruding between the first and second fingers, is a very ancient amulet against the evil eye.  It dates back at least to Roman times, and probably much earlier.  In Italy it is still very popular, particularly in the south, but it seems to have gone out of use in Spain towards the end of the 19th century.",
