Trevor Nunn, the director of this production starring Peggy Ashcroft as the Countess of Rossillion, said that the poster needed to inform the public that the production was going to take place in the society of the 'Belle Epoque', and that since the play challenged the traditional social roles of men and women, the ritual and sexuality of the dance was an important visual image in the staging.\n\nGinni Moo-Young's design reflects John Gunter's arching white-pillared, glass-roofed set which became the Countess de Rossillion's conservatory where she took tea, a gymnasium and ballroom at court, and the Florence railway station round which battle rages. Trevor Nunn added: 'RSC posters must be informative, decorative and evocative, and as souvenirs they must capture the essence of the production they advertise; but have little or nothing to do with selling.'",
