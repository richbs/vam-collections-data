The silk has a yellow plain woven ground with a supplementary weft of white silk making the pattern, which is of floral trails including honeysuckle and rosebuds.\nThe front of the gown is decorated on each of the open sides with a long strip of silk about four inches wide which has been tightly gathered along one edge and pinked and scalloped along the other. Both edges are left raw. The gathered band has been arranged in a serpentine scroll by twisting the band backwards and forwards down each front. This has been rearranged at some stage. Additional trimming in the form of a fly fringe and narrower bands of silk add to the decorative effect. \n\nThe single ruffles on the sleeves and the waist seam at the front of the gown are typical of 1760s style. The narrowness of the front panels and the slight awkwardness of their join with the bodice may indicate that the seamstress was inexperienced in accommodating recent alterations in the style of the sack-back, adapting to a narrower hoop and the newly introduced waist seam.",

Adorning the front are wide strips of silk, the raw edges pinked and scalloped. These have been gathered and sewn on in serpentine curves. A narrow strip of gathered silk and an elaborate white silk braid further enrich the decorative effect. The curvilinear arrangement of this appliqu\u00e9 reflects the principles of Rococo design. \n\nThe gown has been made from a floral patterned silk woven in Spitalfields, London. In the article on silk designing from a contemporary handbook to art and manufacture, George Smith's Laboratory or School of Arts, the author recommends that pattern-drawers should take advantage of the seasonal variety offered by nature. 'Every season of the year produces .... plants, flowers and shrubs, as afford greater varieties than we are able to imitate. Summer will in like manner furnish a manufacturer with a vast variety of new and beautiful objects...and the produce of flowers thereof...will charm the eye.'  The naturalistic drawing of the flowers in this dress fabric, including honeysuckle and rosebuds, illustrates this characteristic of English silks very well.",
