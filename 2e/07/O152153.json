Winter' and 'The Alexandra Rooms, Midland Road, Derby'  possibly because it was made in the photographic studio of W. J. Winter.  This photograph, was made in the 1860s and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from Francis Skidmore's (1817-1896) firm Skidmore & Co., at Alma Street, Coventry.  Skidmore was a leading Victorian metalworker in the Gothic Revival style, which was an architectural movement the nineteenth-century practitioners of which sought to revive medieval forms.  He produced the screen for Lichfield Cathedral in 1861 and this photograph forms a link with his work for the building.",
