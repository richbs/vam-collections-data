Field;  light blue ground with long, rectangular panel in dark green with triangular niche at lower end.  Outlined by a white border with a line of dark yellow sprigs.  From the niche rises a 'tree' of 3 columns of dark yellow star-like blossoms with white centres.  From the sides and along the top spring lillies (3 flowers on a dark brown stem).  Outside the panel, the field is decorated with bands of small light green triangles 'capped' with dark yellow (debased bowls of flowers?).  These form a single column on either side of the panel and 2 bands along the upper edge.  There is a band beyond the field's lower edge, it contains 5 stems each bearing 3 dark yellow lillies on a dark green ground.\n\nBORDERS: There are seven, described from the inside:\n(1) which also isolates and surrounds the lower panel: yellow ground with angular paired S-motifs in various colours.\n\n(2) black ground; on the 2 sides it has an arabesque meander in various colours; at the ends there are paired angular S-motifs in various colours.\n\n(3) and (5) white ground with small dark yellow floral sprig.\n\n(4) and (6) black ground with similar sprig.\n\n(7) same as (2) including the variations at the ends, but on dark yellow ground.",
