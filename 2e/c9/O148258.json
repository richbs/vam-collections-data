The colours used for the enamelling were limited to matt black, white, blue, green, yellow and red and the cast work is usually roughly finished. Some have Royalist associations including badges decorated with the Royal arms.\n\nThe items in the group are distinguished by their method of production: the fields to be enamelled were cast in the original moulds and not, as was more common, engraved (champl\u00e9v\u00e9) or enclosed (cloisonn\u00e9). They were for a long time referred to as Surrey Enamels after the author Charles R. Beard ascribed their manufacture to a factory in Esher, Surrey, but documentary evidence makes a strong case for their reattribution to the London workshops of Anthony Hatch and Stephen Pilcherd.\n\nHatch, a prominent member of the Armourers and Braziers Company, supplied an enamelled brass chimney piece to the Company, which was placed in the Court Room. This was presumably similar in style to the other enamelled wares from this group, which of course included other wares associated with fireplaces. Hatch worked with Pilchard, another member of the Armourers and Braziers Company. \n\nThe comparatively small output of work and the repeated use of identical moulds for the stems of candlesticks, firedogs and cups suggests these objects are the products one workshop. Even domestic wares decorated with enamel would have been expensive, which implies that the workshop that produced them would have had a small but comparatively wealthy clientele.",

            "history_note": "Probably made in the London workshop of Anthony Hatch (active from 1632, died, probably in London, 1689) or Stephen Pilcherd\n\nThe objects were formerly in the collection of the great collector and MP, Ralph Bernal, and subsequently belonged to the Duke of Hamilton, who gave them to the Museum in 1861.\n\nIn the sale catalogue of the Bernal Collection in 1855 they were described as:\n\n\"MEDIAEVAL METAL WORK, Lot 1305\n\nSIR THOMAS MORE'S CANDLESTICKS:  they are of brass with flowers and leaves enamelled in blue and white, the stems of globular form.  Under the foot is inscribed \"Sir Thomas More, Knight, 1552 \u2013 5 1/4in high (See illustration)  232\u00a3 1s  Durlacher for the Duke of Hamilton  \n\nThese were not Candlesticks, but a pair of flower vases as is proved by a portrait of Sir Thomas More at Hampton Court, in which these identical vases are represented standing on a table beside him, each containing a flower.\"\n\nHistorical significance: The items in the group are distinguished by their method of production: the fields to be enamelled were cast in the original moulds and not, as was more common, engraved (champl\u00e9v\u00e9) or enclosed (cloisonn\u00e9). They were for a long time referred to as <i>Surrey Enamels</i> after the author Charles R. Beard ascribed their manufacture to a factory in Esher, Surrey, but documentary evidence makes a storng case for their reattribution to the London workshops of Anthony Hatch and Stephen Pilcherd.\n\nHatch, a prominent member of the Armourers and Braziers Company, supplied an enamelled brass chimney piece to the Company, which was placed in the Court Room. This was presumably similar in style to the other enamelled wares from this group, which of course included other wares associated with fireplaces. Hatch worked with Pilchard, another member of the Armourers and Braziers Company. \n\nFew examples fo these enamelled wares survive and along with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the V&A has the largest holding in the world at around a dozen examples. The comparatively small output of work and the repeated use of identical moulds for the stems of candlesticks, firedogs and cups suggests these objects are the products one workshop. These are significant fragments as they add considerable weight to this idea. The V&A also holds a pair of candlesticks (285&A-1896) with double baluster stems cast in the same moulds as these fragments. The Metropolitan Museum in New York also owns a pair of firedogs (64.101.1615 & 1616) and Norwich Castle Museum & Art Gallery owns an unusual mounted strombus shell cup (1938.149.2: shown also in the painting of before 1679 of the Paston Family heirlooms in the same museum) with stems also cast in the same moulds as these fragments.\n\nEven domestic wares decorated with enamel would have been expensive, which implies that the workshop that produced them would have had a small but comparatively wealthy clientele.",

            "historical_context_note": "These stems are from a group of cast and enamelled brasswares that include stirrups, candlesticks, mirror-frames, fire-dogs, sconces, badges and sword-hilts. The colours used for the enamelling were limited to matt black, white, blue, green, yellow and red and the cast work is usually roughly finished. Some have Royalist associations including badges decorated with the Royal arms.",
