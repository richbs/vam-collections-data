She took up what she called \u2018Sir John Herschel\u2019s beautiful process of cyanotype\u2019 as soon as it was invented in 1842. At that time she was already skilled at drawing shells and other natural specimens. Her motivation for taking up photography was surely aesthetic as well as scientific. This is probably the first photographic portrait of a dandelion. (It could even be called a self-portrait, in that the dandelion was placed on light sensitive paper and imprinted its own image under the rays of the sun, without the use of a camera.) It comes from Atkins\u2019s finest album, which she presented to her friend and co-photographer Anne Dixon in 1854.",
