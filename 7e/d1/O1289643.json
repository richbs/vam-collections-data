Behind are the yurts and the low hills of the Steppes.  Signed \u2018Allinson\u2019 in the bottom left hand corner.\n\nThe Polovtsian dances from Prince Igor was a key ballet in the repertoire of Serge Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes as it was performed at over a quarter of all the performances they gave. It was a superb showcase for the virility of the male dancers and was re-arranged by successive choreographers. The Polovtsian dances were a highlight of Diaghilev\u2019s 1909 Saison Russe and first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet on 19 May 1909 (having been seen at the r\u00e9p\u00e9tition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale the day before.\nThe production when this drawing was made was credited music by Borodin, choreography by Mikhail Fokine and sets and costumes designed by Nicholas Roerich. It was first presented at the London Coliseum on 16 September 1918.\n\nThe synopsis given in the London programmes 1918-1919 reads\n\u2018The story of Prince Igor is one of the oldest of Russian legends. The hero, who lived from 1151 to 1202, was Prince Seversk, a petty state of Russia of those days. In 1185 he led an expedition against Polovtsi, a Tartar tribe, in the plains of the Don. He was taken prisoner with his son Vladimir, but the mighty Khan Kontchak, ruler of the Polovtsi, was magnanimous and hospitable. Instead of treating the two Princes as captives, he gave a banquet in their honour, followed by dancers in which the warriors and their womenfolk took part.\u2019\n\nAllinson's drawings appear to have been intended for a volume in the series Impressions of the Russian Ballet which never appeared. Possibly there was too little narrative to the ballet to justify Prince Igor\u2019s inclusion in the series. Allinson nevertheless produced a print of the ballet which was marketed.",
