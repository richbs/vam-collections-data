From about 1350, it became customary throughout Italy, for young men to give their fianc\u00e9es boxes decorated on the theme of love or marriage. The lid of the box is inscribed \u2018amor vincit omnia\u2019 (Love conquers everything) and the sides are decorated with processions of musicians and bearers of gifts, such as might have appeared at a wedding at this time. Boxes made in about 1500, as this one was, were commonly decorated with a scented white lead-based material called pastiglia moulded with figures and motifs, but on this example, plain moulded gesso has been used, imitating carved stone. This technique is very rarely seen.",

This was often scented and described in contemporary inventories as <i>pasta di muschio</i> (musk paste). The <i>pastiglia</i> figures and motifs were shaped with a lead mould and then glued to the gilt surface of the box - hence their frequent recurrence on other boxes. The boxes are decorated with legends of Ancient Rome and the scenes copied from woodcuts such as Jacobus Argentoratensis' <i>Triumph of Caesar</i> (Venice, 1504) or illustrations of Livy's <i>Roman History</i>.\n(Label text, circa 2000, from old Medieval & Renaissance Galleries)",
