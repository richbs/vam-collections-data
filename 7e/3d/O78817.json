Tambouring is a type of embroidery in which chain stitches are worked with a hook through the surface of a fabric usually stretched taut in a frame ('tambour' is the French for drum). This hook has a sharp enough pointed end to have been used for tambour work, but would also have been suitable for fine crochet.\n\nOwnership & Use\nTambouring and crochet were both needlework skills which were practised at home, although tambouring was also organised on a commercial scale in the late 18th century, taking advantage of the speed it could be worked to produce quantities of embroidered muslin. Crochet developed out of tambouring, as the tambour hook was used to create a series of loops, free from a ground fabric, which could then be used as a separate trimming, like lace. Crochet was thus added to the varieties of fancy needlework available to ladies, and instructions for making it can be found in manuals from the 1820s onwards.",
