When wound the horse rears; drops down and appears to run. At the same time the tail spins. \n*The mark is DAIYA in a diamond shape with MADE IN JAPAN.\nIt is on the underside of the horse. The rider is of thin celluloid in the shape of a cowgirl; pink; painted light and dark blue; red; yellow and silver. The arms are very loose and the elastic poor. It is also a smaller version.",
