Although he was attainted for treason and stripped of his titles in 1702, he was recognised as James III by the Catholic powers of Europe and made several attempts to regain the throne. Rings set with his image and those of his Stuart ancestors were worn by his supporters and those of his son Charles, popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie. Pendant miniatures, medals, cameos, slides, lockets and rings were all worn by Jacobite sympathisers. \n\nThe image on this ring may be based on a 1712 portrait by Alexis Simon Belle, in which James is shown wearing the blue sash of the Order of the Garter, worn by the exiled Stuarts as a sign of their legitimacy. James Francis had been invested with the Garter by his father James II in 1692 at the age of four, prior to an unsuccessful attempt to invade England.",
