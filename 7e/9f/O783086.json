No date, but may be about 1770. Water marks :   A crown with G.R. under ; a crown with a lion rampant in a border ; in the folding plates, a fleur de lys ; an heraldic device ; L.V.G. ; W ; and Amsterdam (?). In original mottled board with leather back.  E. 2324-1910.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>\u2014Handles, escutcheons, and fittings for furniture.   Details practically as in M. 60. e.   A few items call for special mention : Brass headed nails on square tapered shanks, (plate 47) \"princis\" metal nails, tea box handles, wrought rings and plates for drawers, wrought rings and roses, picture nails with fancy heads, and brass coffin rings.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>\u2014The drawing is sketchy except in the case of some of the folding plates.   A feature peculiar to the handles shown on some of the plates is the method of fixing with wire staples which form the loop in which the drop part hangs.   This is passed through the plate and the wooden front, the ends being then turned back inside the drawer. Two good examples of this method are on plate 40. \" Princis\" metal may have been a special bronze.   The nails, which were sold by number, not dimensions, had taper pins and ball or mushroom (cup) heads.   The wrought rings and plates are among the best things in the book. Why they are spoken of as wrought is not clear, but the word suggests that they may have been chased with a graver.   The plate had a keyhole in the centre, with an escutcheon plate to cover it.   Plate 105 shows what constituted a \" compleate commode sett\" namely 6 handles, 3 escutcheons, 1 frontice piece, 2 large ornament pieces 2 short do. and 2 strips.   Prices throughout are written in with ink.   <i>See illustrations, plates IV. and V.</i>\"",
