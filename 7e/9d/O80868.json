This image on the printing plate was the reverse of the final image. The grooves were then filled  with ink and the image was transferred onto a blank sheet of paper.\n\nSubject Depicted\nWilliam Kent employed a variety of ornamental details in this design, including female masks, scrolling foliage and stylised flowers. The chimney-piece incorporates one large lion mask and two smaller animal masks lower down. The frieze below the mantelpiece is decorated with a Greek key pattern.\n\nThe two paintings on either side of the chimney-piece look like 16th-century family portraits. In long-established aristocratic families these would have been prized heirlooms. The painting above the fireplace, however, was probably obtained more recently, by a member of the family who had visited Italy on the Grand Tour. Kent has shown that he could design a harmonious architectural framework for paintings that might range from historical portraits to contemporary souvenirs of the Grand Tour.",
