The intelligent and alert turn of the horse's head and the energy of its well-muscled body is testament to the immense skill of the Tang potter. Emperors of the Tang dynasty (618-907) kept their horses in special stables and parks that occupied large tracts of land around the Tang capital Chang'an (present-day Xian in Shaanxi province). Important tombs held models of these desirable animals.",

London: V&A Publishing, 2008, pp. 32.\nMasterpieces entry\nThe brown glaze running down the neck of this powerfully sculpted and amazingly lifelike horse suggests that it is of the 'blood-sweating' type, bred in the Ferghana valley, in what is now Uzbekistan, and brought to China along the Silk Road. It is a magnificent example of Tang sancai, which can be translated literally as 'three-colour' ware. In fact, such wares frequently feature more than the three colours implied in the name - in this case ivory, green and two shades of brown. Blue and amber are also common, and occasionally, though infrequently, all five can be seen on a single piece. Some sancai wares were exported to the Middle East and similar effects were also achieved by Middle Eastern potters.\n\nTang sancai horses were made for burial with the dead, a tradition that can be traced to the third century BC, when a large number of terracotta warriors and horses were made for the tomb of the first emperor, Qing Shihuandi. Following the excavation of his royal mausoleum, the construction method of the horses has been thoroughly studied, revealing that the head, neck and body were made separately using two-part moulds. These were then joined together and solid moulded legs were inserted into holes in the body. Smaller parts such as eyes, ears, lower jaws and tail would be attached and the entire model smoothed over. Tang horses were probably made in a similar manner. This sancai horse differs from its Qin predecessors in having more details, such as the saddle and trappings, and hence more finishing by hand would have been necessary.",
