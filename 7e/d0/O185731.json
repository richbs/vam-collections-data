She was the elder daughter of James, Duke of York and Anne Hyde, who had converted to the Roman Catholic faith. Mary was brought up as a strict Protestant by order of King Charles II.  In 1677 she was married to her cousin William of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands, an important political alliance intended to frustrate French and Catholic influences in England.  Following her father's abdication in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Mary returned to England from the Netherlands to rule alongside William as joint sovereigns.  \n\nAlthough she played no meaningful role in political affairs, Mary championed Protestantism and helped foster the acceptance of her unpopular husband among the English people.  She was an enthusiastic patron of court designer Daniel Marot, and took great interest in the decoration and furnishing of her houses and gardens.  Queen Mary introduced the fashion for 'China Mania' at Kensington Palace, where her extensive collection of Chinese and Japanese porcelain and Delft, assembled during her eleven years in The Netherlands, was elaborately displayed.",
