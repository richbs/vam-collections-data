We do not know the pantomime in which this character featured, but it would have had a scene relating to the death of Cock Robin since the beetle is the character in the traditional nursery rhyme Who Killed Cock Robin?who offers to make a shroud for Cock Robin. In an article of 1867 the playwright T.W. Robertson described Dykwynkyn as 'the presiding genius of all theatrical Christmas revels.'\n\nFor his pantomime work Keene used the name Dykwynkyn which he characteristically signed on an artist's palette on the ground. He was also responsible for designs for a number of other lavish productions of the day, and for these he was billed as Mr. R.W. Keene.",

'I,' said the Fly,\n'With my little eye, I saw him die.'\n'Who caught his blood?''I,\" said the Fish,\n'With my little dish, I caught his blood.'\n'Who'll make the shroud?'

'I,' said the Rook,\n'With my little book, I'll be the parson.'\n'Who'll be the clerk?' 'I,' said the Lark,\n'If it's not in the dark, I'll be the clerk.'\n'Who'll carry the link?' 'I,' said the Linnet,\n I'll fetch it in a minute, I'll carry the link.'\n'Who'll be chief mourner?' 'I,' said the Dove,\n'I mourn for my love, I'll be chief mourner.'\n'Who'll carry the coffin?' 'I,' said the Kite,\n'If it's not through the night, I'll carry the coffin.'\n'Who'll bear the pall?' 'We,' said the Wren,\n'Both the cock and the hen, we'll bear the pall.'\n'Who'll sing a psalm?' 'I,' said the Thrush,\nAs she sat on a bush, 'I'll sing a psalm.'\n'Who'll toll the bell?' 'I,' said the bull,\n'Because I can pull, I'll toll the bell.'\nAll the birds of the air fell a-sighing and a-sobbing,\nWhen they heard the bell toll for poor Cock Robin.",
