Almost indestructible, many of these block-moulds have survived.  This particular example represents one of a number of designs for sauce boats, probably used mainly for gravy on the dining table.\n\nTime\nThis mould, shown together with a Longton Hall porcelain sauce-boat of the same design, combines the Rococo style copied from luxury goods such as silver with techniques of mass-production developed in Staffordshire by enterprising potters and block-makers. As an experiment in introducing commercial porcelain production to Staffordshire, the factory at Longton Hall established by William Littler (1724-1784) was perhaps premature, for Littler's rather brittle porcelain body could not compete with the more refined porcelains of Chelsea, Derby and elsewhere. After Longton Hall's closure in 1759, it was not until the founding of the New Hall factory in 1782 that porcelain, rather than pottery, was mass-produced in the Staffordshire Potteries.\n\nHistorical Associations\nAs part of the collection of Enoch Wood (1759-1840), the major earthenware potter in Burslem, Staffordshire, in the early 19th century, this block-mould formed part of his factory museum, which he had opened by 1816,  if not earlier.",
