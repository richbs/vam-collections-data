The panel exemplifies the high quality of glass-painting in the Gothic period. Using fine brushwork, artists were able to portray characters in a far more naturalistic manner than had previously been possible using the traditional method of leading pieces of coloured glass ('pot-metal') together.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe painting of white glass with a yellow silver-based stain became widespread throughout Europe in the 15th century. Windows made in this way let through a great deal more light than the earlier 'pot-metal' windows. The 'seaweed' pattern of the background is also characteristic of the period. The design was painted onto the surface of coloured glass in black enamel with the foliage masked out - a technique called 'diapering'. The small dots visible in some places are corrosion caused by the exposure of the window back to weather.\n\nProvenance\nThis panel and its companion piece depicting St Stephen, the first Christian martyr, came from the chapel at Hampton Court, Herefordshire. It is thought to have been built around 1434 by Sir Roland Lenthall, reputedly from the proceeds of booty he won during the Battle of Agincourt (1415). Whether the stained glass used to decorate the chapel's windows was original to the building is disputed, but it all seems to have come from the same workshop.",
