The gemstones are carved in the form of two birds in a tree, above which are three Chinese-style clouds. The scene painted in enamel on the back showes a male, turbanned figure mounted on a horse with a spear in his hand, riding past rocks and a city, towards a lion.  In front of him are cranes and ducks in a river. There are several plant forms engraved in the gold under the translucent green enamel of the river; the landscape and rider at the upper part of the scene are enamelled in opaque white, with outline details painted in black and yellow. The back has two lugs and the scene enamelled on the back is the opposite way up from the pattern on the front.",

The scene on the back of the pendant is painted in enamel and shows a horseman and a lion in a landscape. Instead of the more usual colourful designs it is enamelled in opaque white as in a line drawing. In the foreground is a river in green enamel with cranes and ducks.",
