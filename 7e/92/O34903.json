Belter emigrated to New York from his native Hanover, Germany in 1833 where he set up as a cabinet-maker.  He was an advocate of the Rococo Revival, evidence of which can be seen in the flowing curved outline of this chair and the use of naturalistic flowers, fruit and foliage for its carved decoration.  \n\nBelter was also a pioneer in the use of laminated construction.  He took out patents related to this technique in 1856, 1858 and 1860.  The entire back panel of this chair is made of 5-ply laminated wood, wrapped around the seat.  It is made of rosewood ply and other woods painted to look like rosewood.",
