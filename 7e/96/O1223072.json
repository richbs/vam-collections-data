The 1862 exhibition building was, however, badly received in the press: the structure was pulled down in 1864, to make space for the Natural History Museum.",

The medal shows a perspective view from south west of the long main front along Cromwell Road, a view recorded in a drawing in the V&A\u2019s collection (Museum no. E.928-1976). The building was, however, badly received in the press, and the structure was pulled down in 1864, to make space for the Natural History Museum.",
