The bodice areas (covered by the corselet in performance) are of heavy cotton, to make the costume more comfortable for the wearer and reduce bulk under the corselet.  The skirt is pleated onto the bodice, and the hanging sleeves are ruched to elbow length; pulled up inside and held by stitched tape; he skirt is full at the back, flaring into a train.  Sleeves and skirt are decorated with meandering lines and circles and appliqu\u00e9 felt shields with a central decoration of gold painted adhesives.  \nA panel of muted blue velvet, is appliqu\u00e9d with a white plastic fabric heraldic beast; the blue velvet is appliqu\u00e9d in lozenges over a half panel of pink beige satin, the other half being decorated with gold painted adhesive fleur de lys.  At the bottom a further panel of the blue velvet appliqu\u00e9d with white plastic fabric stylized hunting horns, with chains of gold painted resin.  Separating the panels are gold self embroidered braid and an oyster satin strip appliqu\u00e9d with the blue velvet.  Over the shoulders, the shaping is beautifully suggested by piping.  The high collar is of rich brown velvet and the side panel is buckles to the main skirt.  Attached at the back of the full skirt is a wrist band to pick up the train when dancing\n[Theatre costume] Corselet of brown suedette, with a beautifully cut tiny 'bustle' at the back, the shape formed by double stitched seams and boning to just above waist at the back and centre front.  Circular quilted padding has been added to the front lower curve and a circular pad between the breasts, to give a 'period' figure.  At the front sides are piped stepped zig-zags and over the front are fleur de lys emblems and crosses to the sides of gold painted resins.  The corselet is laced down sides and buckled over the shoulders.",

It was an unenviable task following Oliver Messel's iconic 1946 production and the only solution was to create something entirely different from his dreamy English lyricism.  She and the producer, Peter Wright, rejected all previous concepts for an the quasi- Tennysonian feel of a medieval romance seen through the eyes of 19th century neo-Gothic. The women's hunting costumes in Act II had elegance and weight, reflecting the aristocratic origins of the characters in the heraldic symbols executed in traditional and 'new' materials - the felt appliques of the 1950s mixing with the adhesives and resins for the fleur de lys.  The muted browns and blues suggested autumnal shades reflecting the fallow years of Princess Aurora's sleep.",
