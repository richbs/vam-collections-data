            "public_access_description": "John Smith was a mezzotinter mostly occupied with reproducing oil portraits, particularly those of Kneller. \nThis print demonstrates early solutions to the twin problems of producing tone and colour in a printed image, problems which in later years were to result in many technological breakthroughs.  One way of producing a colour intaglio print is to ink the plate selectively with different colour inks, but close inspection shows this was not the case here.  The regular marks, made on the plate by the mezzotint tool, have printed dark grey and the colours have been applied over them filling the spaces between.\nContemporary hand-colouring in the work of a conventional monochrome printmaker is likely to turn up, if at all, in the more unusual or experimental subject matter away from the main field of his activities. \n\n(Miller, Elizabeth.
