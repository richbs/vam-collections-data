            "public_access_description": "Doublets formed part of the fashionable ensemble of clothing worn by men in Europe until the late 1660s. The very short length of this example is characteristic of the extreme style of doublets at their final appearance in the male wardrobe. From 1650 to 1665, doublets shortened so that there was a gap between doublet and breeches through which the shirt could be seen. The centre back and front sleeves were left unstitched for further exposure of the shirt, which in the 17th century was considered underwear. More conservative members of society considered the result rather untidy looking. Such a radical fashion, usually worn by young men, attracted the attention of cartoonists and the condemnation of moralists.\n\nThe spectacular golden effect of the fabric of this example was created by weaving with silk and with threads wrapped with strips of silver gilt. This splendid material was probably imported from Italy, as there was little in the way of silk-weaving in Britain at this time.  Adding to the luxurious effect is the lavish use of bobbin lace also made of silver-gilt thread.",

Purchased 7 October 2003 at Sothebys.\n\nHistorical significance: This is an example of the short-waisted doublet worn by men in Britain between 1650 and 1665.  It is a particularly lavish example of fabric and lace made of silver gilt metal thread.  Portraits of the period show these doublets exposing the fine linen shirt worn below through the open seams of the sleeves and the doublet at the back as well as at the waist.",
