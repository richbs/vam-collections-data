Behind him, propped on his elbows, is a barefooted brown-haired boy wearing a green fisherman's smock over a white shirt with a red and green neckerchief, a broad-brimmed straw hat, and rolled-up trousers.  At the back stands a barefooted boy wearing a red, white and turquoise-coloured stocking cap over his black curly hair, with a blue jumper and rolled-up khaki trousers.  He is festooned with fishing net and line with cork floats, and carries a large net on a semicircular frame with a handle.  A home-made toy boat floats in the rock pool below the boys.",
