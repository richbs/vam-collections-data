There is no attempt to dress up the repeat of the simple pattern with its free-standing clumps of meadow flowers on a grass-like ground. Nevertheless, <i>Daisy</i> was one of the most consistently popular of the firm\u2019s papers, still selling well nearly fifty years after it was issued. \n\nThe first three wallpapers - <i>Trellis, Daisy</i> and <i>Fruit</i> - were all, from an early date, offered on a light, a medium and a dark ground. Further colourings were added later. This colourway was called <i>Light Daisy</i>. \n\nThe source of the pattern can be seen in a wall hanging illustrated in a fifteenth-century version of Froissart\u2019s Chronicles (BL Ms 4380, fol. 1). The hangings embroidered for the bedroom at Red House, 1860, used similar flower groups though on a larger scale (cat.No.M.6).' \n\n\u2018Mackail\u2019 refers to: Mackail, J. W. <u>The Life of William Morris</u>. London, 1899\n\n\u2018cat.
