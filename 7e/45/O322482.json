They acted as indicators of the sort of trade being carried out, or the goods being marketed within the premises.  Signs also allowed private houses and institutions to be readily identified in a large town or city - particularly necessary before the 19th century introduction of house numbering and street signs and in an age when illiteracy was still widespread. \n\nThis particular example is a brewer's sign. Appropriately, it incorporates a malster's ladle and shovel, encircled by a wreath of hops. The malster was responsible for malting the grain; converting the grain into malt so that it could be used to brew beer. This sign is made of wrought iron and has been painted and gilded.",
