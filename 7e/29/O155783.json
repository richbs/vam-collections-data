This reflects the light in a different way. There is a framing band along the top and down the sides.  It has a wide light green meander carrying spiky crimson red blossoms, buds and leaf infills, with small grey [faded purple] buds.  This wide band is edged either side, and once along the bottom, by a similar but narrower meander of green stems, crimson lozenge shaped blossom and grey [purple] buds.  At the top end this band outlines a square infilled with a tri-stemmed flowering plant including one cream [faded coral pink] blossom. The central panel has a lobed arch at one end delineated in crimson and light green.  The infill, as with the bands and squares, is decorated with a quilted pattern of irregular lozenges and rhomboids using yellow silk.  It is further decorated with offset isolated green stems with red, grey [purple] and faded pink blossoms. Near the apex of the arch is an embroidered roundel with an embroidered inscription in red on an embroidered green ground. In the spandrels there is a broken lattice in red and green with touches of white and yellow; in the centre of each small lozenge is a small flowering stem in red or grey [faded purple]. The embroidery is worked through a layer of cotton.\nEmbroidery Thread: light green, red, faded purple, faded pink, yellow, green, white silk; 2Z\nBacking: pieced and patched; plain weave red silk [and cotton?].\nFacing: bias-cut, woven silk; narrow white, purple and light green stripes with small lozenges outlined in white.",
