The horse is \u2018pantomime \u2013style\u2019, or a 'cheval dress\u00e9', that is with two men within a costume. During the rehearsals, before the first performance in Paris, the dummy fell off the horse and it is generally claimed that Picasso bowed to popular concensus and decided to keep the horse unmounted. However the dummy was remade before Parade was presented in London and there is evidence, including White's illustrations, that it was used for performances there. The horse may well reference the music hall act by Footit and Chocolat. The horse\u2019s head is in the style of an African mask. Goli and Baule helmet masks and Fang masks of the Cameroon have been suggested as influences as well as ape masks of the Senufo tribe of Sudan. The background evokes the setting of the ballet.\n\nParade was created by Jean Cocteau (who had the idea and wrote the libretto), Pablo Picasso (designing his first ballet) and Erik Satie (composer), with choreography by L\u00e9onide Massine. It received its premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, on 18 May 1917. This drawing was probably made by White when the ballet was first performed in London in 1919. \n\nThe drawings by Ethelbert White were commissioned by the bookseller and publisher Cyril Beaumont and appear to have be intended as possible illustrations for a small book in the Impressions of the Russian Ballet series. Beaumont published twelve volumes documenting eleven ballets between 1918 and 1922.\n\nThe Theatre &amp; Performance collection of the V&amp;A holds eight glass plates by Lachmann showing the horse without the dummy on its back at the time of the premiere in Paris.",
