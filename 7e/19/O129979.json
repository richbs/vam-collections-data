It adopted the medieval guild structure, with pupils progressing from apprentice to journeyman to assistant master, and finally to master when they qualified for a place on the Council. The Weaving Workshop was the only workshop to consist entirely of female students and had low status in the organisation, despite the fact that the dyers and weavers brought in considerable income. Gunta St\u00f6lz  was by 1926 the only woman on the Bauhaus Masters' Council of 13.\n\nIn 1928 the new director, Hannes Meyer, set out to make the workshops commercially productive and their output socially responsible. He urged the Weaving Workshop to develop prototypes for manufacture rather than continue making hand-crafted pictorial experiments. The increasing demand for sample fabrics from textile mills in Germany and abroad led to the establishment of the Bauhausstoffe (Bauhaus Fabrics) brand. This sample shows the new possibilities that opened up through the use of new machinery and experimentation with synthetic materials, including cellophane.",
