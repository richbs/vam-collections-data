He has worked extensively in both Japan and the West and is known for the lavish and highly decorative nature of his work.  The two halves of this box were made by blowing molten glass into metal moulds. The rich surface decoration was achieved by the application of small pieces of red and white glass in combination with silver and gold leaf. Mattness and texture were provided by masking out the areas covered in metal leaf with wax resist before dipping in an acid bath.  This decorative scheme and the title of the box, 'Red and White Plum Blossoms', allude to a famous pair of screens by the painter Ogata Korin (1658-1716), demonstrating the enduring vitality of traditional Japanese artistic styles in late twentieth century Japan.\n\nA graduate from Tokyo University of Arts, where he studied metalwork, he worked for a brief period at the Iwata Glass Company. He became independent in 1949, using the facilities of various glass-making workshops to realize his designs, and held his first solo exhibition in 1957. He has since been involved in a large number of domestic and international events. Along with Iwata Hisatoshi, he played a major role in the establishment of the Japan Glass Artcrafts Association in 1972.",
