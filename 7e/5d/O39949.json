But this type of lacquer decoration was imported from Iran only in the reign of Sultan Ahmet III (ruled 1703-1730). The motifs are largely European, but Iranian lacquer workers also used roses in this period.\n\nThe huge expansion of the Ottoman empire in the 16th century was followed by a period of crisis after 1600. Patronage of the arts did revive after 1650, but on a more modest scale. At first, the revival of 16th-century Ottoman traditions and the adoption of Iranian artistic ideas were the main sources of change. From the 1740s, however, an Ottoman Baroque style developed in which artists applied non-figurative European motifs to Ottoman forms. The Ottoman Baroque flourished until the 1820s, when designers introduced new types of European ornament.",
