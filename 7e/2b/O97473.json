            "public_access_description": "Ormolu, adapted from the French word or-moulu. Literally meaning ground gold, is used to describe decorative objects and mounts for furniture and porcelain in copper, brass and bronze which has been gilt by the process of fire or mercurial gilding.  The word, which was introduced into England in the early 1760s, is usually only used to describe pieces dating from after the mid 17th century.\n\nIn order to gild by this method the gold is reduced to a powder and amalgamated with mercury at a high temperature.  The proportions are usually six parts of mercury and one of gold.  On cooling, the gold amalgam is squeezed through a chamois leather in order to remove any superfluous mercury.  This leaves a paste of about the consistency of butter which is roughly two parts of mercury to one of gold.  \n\nThe surfaces of the metal to be gilt are cleaned thoroughly with nitric acid and smeared with mercuric nitrate.  The amalgam is then applied with a brush or gilding knife, and the object heated until the mercury has evaporated, leaving the gold bonded to the surface.  Surfaces that need to coloured further can be reheated or treated with various chemicals and areas matted or burnished as desired.\n\nBecause mercury vapour is toxic, mercurial poisoning among the work force was alarmingly high.  The average life expectancy for a gilder in the 18th century could be as low as thirty years.  For this reason fire gilding is forbidden today except under carefully controlled conditions, and gilding is normally achieved by the process of electrolysis.",
