Printed borders were used to conceal the heads of the tacks and to give a neat and finished appearance to the papered wall. The fashion for using borders continued even when methods of hanging wallpapers changed and borders were no longer strictly necessary.  By the early 19th century borders were available in elaborate designs to use as a frieze decoration around the upper part of the room.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis design imitates drapery. The effect is enhanced by the use of flock to give a textured surface that looks like velvet. Wallpapers that were designed to imitate textile wall hangings, curtains and other draperies were fashionable in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\nTrading\nThis border came from the stock of Thomas Avery, a builder and decorator from Tenterden in Kent. In the late 18th and 19th centuries wallpapers were often supplied to customers by builders, or by upholsterers, who dealt with all aspects of the house-furnishing business.",
