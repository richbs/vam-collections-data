The mouths of the three putti heads originally held taps and contain the remains of metal pipes. The fountain was bought in Florence from the painter, dealer, restorer and collector, Stefano Bardini (1836-1922), and when acquired it was said that the fountain was Venetian and had been in a church. The limestone from which it is made comes from the Istrian peninsular, now part of Croatia but then part of the Venetian empire, and was commonly used in that area.",

            "history_note": "This wall fountain was acquired from the Italian painter, restorer, dealer and collector, Stefano Bardini (1836-1922). It was described at the time to have come from Venice, and to have been in a church.\n\nIstria, now part of Croatia, was at the time this piece was made part of the Venetian empire. Limestone was regularly exported to Venice for sculpture, and this supports the assertion that the fountain came from Venice originally.\n\nThe faces of the putti have been worn away by the water issuing through the pipes in their mouths, indicating it was extensively used. \n\nThe classical motifs represented on the fountain are connected with water and reflect the function of the fountain - the dolphins and the shell pattern most clearly seen in the basin. The basin has no outlet, indicating that the flow of water was controlled by the user so that the basin did not overflow.\n\nHistorical significance: On the acquisition of 67-1882, a Venetian cistern for a lavello, Robinson noted that these \u2018washing fountains\u2019, fed from a cistern in the wall, served the daily bathing needs of the inmates, as well as many other purposes in palaces, convents and other domestic interiors: \u201cthey were often highly ornate structures, containing basins projecting from a niche in the wall, carried on brackets or supported on a shaft or pedestal\u201d.\n\nIf this fountain was said to come from a church, it could be that it was placed so that the priest could wash his hands before consecrating the host.",
