            "public_access_description": "This ceremonial staff is by an unknown artist from Scandinavia, dated 1670, but might be a historicising confection of ca. 1850.\n\nIt is made of different sorts of ivories and bones - from different animals: the head is from the upper part of an ox's tibia, the shaft is part of a narwhal's horn, the point is of walrus-ivory with an intermediate piece of elephant ivory.\n\nThe staff is carved with the arms of Norway and Denmark united, surrounded by the collar of the order of the Elephant, and supported by two salvage men. There are also carved various shields with the Norwegian arms, the name 'Dannemarck', the initials 'C. V.' (for Christian V, King of Norway and Denmark, 1670-1699) and the date 1670. There is also another insiced inscription that translates 'God be my helper', the motto of Christian's son, King Frederick IV (1671-1730; ruled 1699-1730), a fact that makes the inscribed date of the staff curious.",
