The patterns were considered particularly appropriate for textile design because of their repetitive symmetry and natural beauty.\n\nMegaw\u2019s idea caught the attention of Mark Hartland Thomas from the Council of Industrial Design. For the forthcoming Festival of Britain in 1951 Hartland Thomas put together a group of manufacturers known as the Festival Pattern Group who produced textiles, china, carpets, linoleum and wallpaper decorated with crystallographic patterns. The project combined science and design and was perfect for the theme of the festival, which had been conceived as a platform for British ingenuity and creativity in science, technology and the arts.  \n\nThis carpet was shown as part of a display in the \u2018Regatta Restaurant\u2019, South Bank (one of the main restaurants at the festival), where Crystal Structures were the theme of the furnishings. The pattern was based on a crystal structure diagram of resorcinol, a chemical compound and was designed by Robert Anderson. It is one of a group of samples made by the carpet manufacturers James Templeton & Co for the Festival Pattern Group.",

Photographs were then taken of the diffracted X-rays, and the resulting lines or spots were used to plot diagrams indicating the relationships between atoms. For the first time ever it enabled scientist to work out the structure of atoms within molecules. Britain was a world leader in the field of crystallography and during the post war period this was one of the most significant and stimulating branches of science.",
