It illustrates the skill of artists and craftsmen in interpreting fashionable styles for a domestic object. The decoration is carefully designed to allow some of the detail to be visible even when the tray is in use.\n\nPeople\nJennens & Bettridge, the firm run by Theodore Hyla Jennens and John Bettridge between 1816 and 1864, was famous for the range of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 goods manufactured in its factory at 99 Constitution Hill, Birmingham, West Midlands. They also had premises at 6 Halkin Street West, Belgrave Square, London. The firm produced a range of products including writing boxes, trays, fans, and larger pieces of furniture such as chairs, tables and sofas. The bottom of this tray is stamped with the firm's name.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was made by pasting layers of paper over moulds of the required shape, a job mainly done by women and girls. The object was then oiled and baked at very high temperatures. The shape of this tray would have been finished by a cabinet-maker before it was varnished and dried in a stove. The mother-of-pearl was applied before the painted decoration, which was followed by a final coat of varnish, further stove drying, and polishing.",
