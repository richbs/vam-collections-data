On the sloping front is printed a typewriter keyboard in red, cream and lilac on black; and on the semi circular top front parts with gold stars and lines on a cream base. At the top centre front is the mechanism for producing the type. It has a disc with red plastic band around its outside with the letters of the alphabet both small and capitals together with numbers and symbols. The top of the disc is metal printed with the letters etc. in black on white; in its centre is a circular dial with an arrow and the letter M in the middle. To select the letter wanted turn the dial's arrow to it. The disc is support by a black metal block which is hinged to a lever with a dent along its front edge. When the lever is depressed the disc and its block move back against the patten to print the letter. Below the lever to the right is a small lever marked with an arrow which operates as the space bar; to the left are two small levers marked 'a' and 'A' which move to adjust for capital letters or small ones. At the back top of the typewriter is the 'patten' made of metal but it does not rotate; the paper is turned by a metal rod which passes through it and has two rubber grips. (left hand knob of this rod is missing). At the front is a metal strip marked with lines and numbers to form the measure. At each side are the clamps for the ribbon to be held and also a bar to help align the paper. Instructions for use; the trademark and MADE IN GT. BRITAIN are printed on the back of the toy with the name\nof the machine ELEGANT on the right front. The body parts are held with tongues and crimping.",
