The men at the entrance to the tent appear to be parleying or striking a bargain over something. Their costumes and weaponry are predominantly lndo-Persian. but the scene is more fanciful than authentic, and creates an opportunity for a display of colourful and exotic objects. Heath, as 'Paul Pry', was one of the most successful caricaturists of the Regency era. He is best known for his illustrations to the early work of Charles Dickens. His illustrations to other authors included military subjects, some with a vaguely oriental veneer, such as those to his own poem The Life of a Soldier (1823).",
