Binns in the early 20th century.  As well as theatrical subjects, Binns drew cartoons of political figures, and had associations with two predominant caricaturists of this period, Sir Francis Carruthers Gould and Harry Furniss.\n\nThe subject of this caricature, Paul Cinquevalli (1859-1918), was born in Poland, ran away from home aged 14 and joined an Italian acrobatic troupe led by Giuseppe Chiese-Cinquevalli, from whom he took his stage name. He trained on high wire and trapeze but took up juggling when recovering from a fall.  His first performance in London in 1885 was a great success, and he went on to become the most celebrated juggler on the British Music Hall and Variety stage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  He was considered one of the first gentleman jugglers, because he performed with everyday objects such as bottles, plates, glasses and umbrellas.",
