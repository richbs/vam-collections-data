(1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 178) now hardly seems tenable and, indeed, the picture's dubious appearance has led to its being described as a 19th century work. However, the crudity of the treatment at the neck and collar is due to repainting and, if this is taken into account, it remains possible that it is a work of the early 18th century as the costume suggests. The monogram has not been identified. \n\nCondition. Area of restoration on left side covers the lower part of the face, neck and collar; smaller areas of re-touching on the coat. \nProv. The Rev. C. H. Townshend; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868.",
