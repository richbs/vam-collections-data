The top has a central rectangular section with slightly rounded smaller ends, the two flaps each a partial elipse. The central section of the top is attached to the frame with 'trenails' or wooden nails that were hammered into pre-drilled holes.  On this table, they are extremely long and the lower edges can be seen at the lower edge of the frieze.  The legs and stretchers are fully turned with balusters and with rectangular sections at the joints.  Each of the gate-legs is set at mid-height with two stretchers with, between them four turned spindles forming a panel. Each end frieze is carved with scrolls and set at either end with split baluster motifs. The lower edge of the frieze all round shows a moulding applied, probably a later addition to the table.  The table shows considerable wear, particularly to the stretchers at each end, and has undergone restoration, including the replacement of hinges.",

The design of the gate-leg table developed to allow for this kind of room usage.  When not in use, they could be neatly stowed against the wall, yet could be swiftly brought forward and set up for a meal.  This table is unusual in having on both gates an additional mid-section of turned spindles, added, it seems, purely for decorative effect.  The wear on the stretchers shows that this table has had heavy use.  It has been restored at various times and the metal hinges underneath have been renewed.",
