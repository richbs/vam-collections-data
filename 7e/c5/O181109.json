The mace sits on a plain circular, native hardwood base made up of two dovetailed disc sections.

In the centre is a small silver flat topped dome, stamped with the lion passant and date letter for 1965-6 which supports a hardwood rod surmounted by a plain hardwood finial to  which five sheets of hand made paper along its length by a glued, light blue cloth strip.  These sheets of paper have the names and addresses of all the Spirax-Sarco employees who subscribed to the presentation gift of the tray and jewel by Louis Osman (M.40:1-5,-1994) and this mace.  The first sheet has the following heading, printed in cursive script:  <font -i>Mr and Mrs L.G. Northcroft.  Receive this staff with our gratitude and affection.  Knock with it upon our door and hospitality will be yours all the days of your life</font>.  The mace, of silver, is a circular sleeve which swells to a spherical head and attaches to the base by a bayonet fitting.  It is made in two sections;  the sleeve and the bottom half of the head form one sheet of silver while the domed top has been raised from a silver disc.  The seam is barely visible around the middle.",
