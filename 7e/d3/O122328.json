In his enthusiasm for ceramics, Picasso successfully challenged traditional divisions in the arts world and made a major impression on a new generation of potters.\nPicasso (1881-1973) worked at the Madoura Pottery, run by the Rami\u00e9 family in Vallauris, inland between Cannes and Antibes on the French Riviera. The area has a long tradition of pottery-making, mostly of the useful, country variety. Picasso first visited the Madoura Pottery in 1946 at the age of 65, and continued to work there at intervals for many years. Having discovered the possibilities of this new medium, he produced decoration on vases and moulded dishes and small-scale scuptures, for all of which he made the original models. Most of these were painted by Picasso himself. In his book 'Picasso's Ceramics', published in England in 1975, George Rami\u00e9 lists over 700 different designs. Over 200 examples are illustrated in the Royal Academy's 1998 catalogue to their exhibition 'Picasso: Painter and Sculptor in Clay'."

The mouth is painted with a face at the front and with black and brown striping; the neck is decorated with black and white diagonal check on a brown ground, and the impression of a rider is conveyed by painted 'legs' continuing down the sides of the vessel and terminating in spurred boots.",
