This is an early example of his interest in combining type and image. Gill was later to become a founder member of the Society of Wood Engravers, for whom he designed their burin and box tree device in 1921. The Hampshire House was a working men's club in Hampshire Hog Lane and was founded both as a social centre and to provide opportunities for cultural improvement including art and craft workshops. Outside the workshops Gill carved a Hampshire Hog in stone and then used the hog in various printed devices in 1915-16.",
