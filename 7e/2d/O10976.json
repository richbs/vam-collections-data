It was introduced into English silver by Huguenot craftsmen in the late 17th century.\n\nEwers were used to hold water and were usually accompanied by basins. They were set out  on the sideboard in a dining room, or formed part of a large, elaborate toilet service. The female triton, or mermaid, forming the handle and the shells on the body of the ewer are appropriate to its function as a water vessel.\n\nStyle\nThe decoration of the ewer is typical of the Baroque style. It includes foliate cut-card work around the bottom of the vessel, with a scrolling arcade above and a helmeted mask below the lip. The use of gadrooning, as seen in the bands on the foot, stem and body, is also a noted feature of Huguenot work.\n\nThis French-inspired style was popular throughout Europe. It became known from the many prints by such masters of ornamental design as Jean B\u201arain, Daniel Marot and Jean Le Pautre. The style was successfully applied to interior design, garden design, plasterwork, ironwork, furniture, ceramics, upholstery as well as silver.",
