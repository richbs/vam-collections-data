The vivid colour in this watercolour landscape scene is typical of his style. Testa enjoys using watercolour because of its unpredictable qualities and the blotches and run-ins add character to his work. He began his career as a children's book illustrator in 1971 but he is now known as a landscape artist, generally of abstract mountain scenes. He pays great attention to his materials, using the finest hand-made paper which adds to the textural quality of his work.",
