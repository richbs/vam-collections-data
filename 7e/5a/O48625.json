They were all influenced by advanced French post-impressionist painting.  The Omega Workshops produced ceramics, printed and woven textiles, and painted furniture, but the medium of the folding screen was perhaps best suited to the skills of the artist-designers.  The painters treated screens as if they were artists' canvases rather than utilitarian furniture.  This screen, for example, depicts a flock of about twenty sheep penned together, bizarrely but expressively rendered in bright blues against an ochre bachground (Fry admired Grant's 'exquisite use of colour'). Grant has paid no heed to the hinged breaks between the three folding panels - breaks which by necessity must be always visible in order for the screen to stand up - and the joins slice through many of the sheep. Only the suggestion of  a wicker pen approximately fits the canvas.",
