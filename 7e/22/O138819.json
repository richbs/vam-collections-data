The lining, in flower-printed fine silk, also forms the fabric of the sleeveless dress bodice. The skirt is lined in the same silk, a luxurious detail which only the wearer would have been aware of. The jacket has faux blouse sleeves below the wool cuff to make it appear that the wearer is wearing a long-sleeved blouse underneath. The fabrics are extremely lightweight, in tune with Chanel's design philosophy that clothes should be elegant, comfortable, and easy to move in.",
