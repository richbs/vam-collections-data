            "public_access_description": "Vittore Crivelli (1444-1502) was the youngest brother of Carlo Crivelli under whom he probably trained. Around 1465, he followed his brother to Zara, Dalmatia where he took on a pupil and by 1481 had moved to the Marches. He settled in Fermo with his brother and spent there most of the rest of his life. \n\nThis panel painting originally attributed to Carlo Crivelli was later accordingly recognised as by Vittore and part of the altarpiece commissioned in 1481 by the Vinci family in Fermo. The present work, along with 765A-1865 is one of the four panels that flank the tabernacle in the upper part of the altarpiece. It shows, set against an elaborate gilded background adorned with an intricate pattern of acanthus leaves, griffins and crowns, the half-length figure of St Jerome traditionally wearing his red cardinal mantle and hat, and holding a model of the Church as he is considered one of the four Fathers of the (western) Church. The open book in his left hand alludes to his activity as a translator of the Bible into Latin.",

Before 1800</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 79-81, cat. no. 78\nAlthough 765A-1865 and 765-1865 were attributed to Carlo Crivelli in the Soulages Collection, Crowe and Cavalcaselle attributed them to his brother Vittore. F. Zeri (1961) confirmed the attribution to Vittore and associated the two panels to an altarpiece painted by Vittore for the Vinci family in Fermo. He reconstructed the altarpiece as follows:\nthe main register, consisting of the Virgin and child enthroned, surrounded by Saints John and Bonaventura on the left and Saints Francis and Louis of Toulouse on the right, is in the Philadelphia Museum; the upper register consists of a Pieta in the Arizona University Museum, and four saints : Anthony of Padua and Bernardino of Siena in Holland, and then 765A-1865 and 765-1865 in the V&A. The main register and a Pieta were still in the house of the Vinci family at Fermo when seen by Crowe and Cavalcaselle (1871), but at that time the two saints were already in the South Kensington Museum.\n\nKauffmann points out that Zeri does not take into account that Crowe and Cavalcaselle mentioned \"twelve predella panels comprise amongst other subjects the Pieta and the Resurrection, the rest being figures of saints\".\nHe is also able to show that part of the reconstruction made by Zeri is not conclusive, and accepts that only 2 panels in Holland (Van Heek Collection), Saints Anthony and Bernardino, are likely to have come from the same altarpiece as 765A-1865 and 765-1865.\n\nThe church held by St Jerome is similar to those held by him in other paintings by Carlo Crivelli (P.Zampetti, CArlo Crivelli, 1961, plates 50,135, and with variations 70), and by Vittore (L.Serra, L'arte nelle Marche, il periodo del Rinascimento, 1934, fig. 499). This type of church, therefore, should be seen as a standard attribute of St Jerome, rather than as a naturalistic portrayal of a particular building.\n\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Vittore CRIVELLI (active c. 1440-1501/02) \n<i>Venetian School </i> \nHe was the younger brother of Carlo Crivelli, whom he followed to Zara, where he lived from 1465-c. 1480. From 1481 he is recorded in the Marches, where he was active until his death in 1501. \nHe must have been a pupil of Carlo, on whose style he is completely dependent. \n\n78 \nTWO PANELS FROM AN \nALTAR-PIECE: \nST JEROME, ST CATHERINE \n<i>Tempera and gilt on panel</i> \neach 24 1/8 x 15 1/8 (61.3 x 38.4) \noriginally in arched frames \n765/65A-1865 \n\nAlthough these panels were in the Soulages Collection as by Carlo Crivelli, the attribution to his brother Vittore, made by Crowe and Cavalcaselle (1871), has been widely accepted. Recently this attribution has been confirmed by Federico Zeri (1961), who published the two panels as part of an altar-piece painted by Vittore in 1481 for the Vinci family in Fermo. The altar-piece was reconstructed by Zeri as follows: the main register, consisting of the Virgin and Child enthroned, surrounded by Saints John and Bonaventura on the left and Saints Francis and Louis of Toulouse on the right, is in the Philadelphia Museum (Wilstach collection); the upper register consists of a Pieta in the Kress Collection, Arizona University, Tucson, and four Saints, of which Anthony of Padua and Bernardino of Siena are in the Van Heek collection, S'Heerenberg in Holland and Jerome and Catherine in this Museum. The main register and a Piet\u00e0 were still in the house of the Vinci family at Fermo when seen by Crowe and Cavalcaselle (1871) but at that time the two saints were already in South Kensington. \nSupporting this interpretation is an inscription on the back of the St Jerome panel: <i>Originalis Carolis Crivell[i] Veneti MCCCCLXXXI[.].</i>It is a 19th century inscription, but probably copied from an earlier one, and, although the attribution is to Carlo rather than Vittore, the date 1481 is the same as that on the Philadelphia altar-piece. \nHowever, there are certain difficulties in accepting this reconstruction, arising out of Crowe and Cavalcaselle's description. Having described the central register of the Vinci altar-piece, which fits perfectly with the painting now in Philadelphia, they go on to say: 'Twelve predella panels comprise amongst other subjects the Piet\u00e0 and the resurrection, the rest being figures of saints.' \nThey thus describe a predella which Professor Zeri does not attempt to reconstruct and make no mention of an upper register which does figure in the reconstruction. According to Crowe and Cavalcaselle, the Piet\u00e0 (as well as the Resurrection) formed part of the predella; in the reconstruction the Piet\u00e0 now at Tucson is placed in the upper register. Yet the main drawback as far as 765/65A-1865 are concerned is that these two panels were in the Soulages collection in c. 1840 and were known by Crowe and Cavalcaselle to be in the South Kensington Museum in 1871 (p. 98, n. 3). This would imply, if the proposed reconstruction is accepted, that the Vinci family sold the upper register of the altar-piece in the early 19th century and retained the central register and predella until after 1871. This is possible (Crowe and Cavalcaselle imply that the painting was no longer in its original frame), but seems somewhat unlikely. According to Marchese Amico Ricci, <i>Memorie storiche delle arti e degli artisti della Marca di Ancona,</i>i, 1834, p. 214, Carlo Crivelli and his brother were commissioned to paint several altar-pieces for the Vinci family alone and he cites one that was sold recently to a dealer (i.e. before 1834). The possible homes for the Museum's two panels would seem to be numerous. Professor Zeri stresses the stylistic relationship between the various panels of the altarpiece he reconstructs, in particular the close similarity of the gold tooling, but it must be admitted that the evidence supporting the reconstruction is not, at this stage, conclusive. Only the two panels in the Van Heek Collection (Saints Anthony and Bernardino) are likely to have come from the same altar-piece as 765/65A-1865. \nThe church held by St Jerome is similar to those held by him in other paintings by Carlo Crivelli (P. Zampetti, <i>Carlo Crivelli,</i>1961, pls, 50, 135 and, with variations, 70) and by Vittore (L. Serra, <i>L' arte nelle Marche, il periodo del Rinascimento,</i>1934, fig. 499). This type of church, therefore, should be seen as a standard attribute of St Jerome, rather than as a naturalistic portrayal of a particular building. \n\n<i>Prov.</i>Jules Soulages collection, Toulouse (probably acquired in Italy c. 1830-40); his whole collection bought by a body of English subscribers in 1856 and subsequently acquired in stages by the South Kensington Museum. \n<i>Lit.</i>J.

Originally attributed to Carlo Crivelli, this painting has been accordingly recognised to be by his younger brother Vittore (Crowe and Cavalcaselle, 1871) who formed his style in Carlo's workshop and developed a very close manner. \nThis panel, along with 765A-1865, belongs to the upper part of an altarpiece dated 1481 and commissioned by the Vinci family in Fermo where Vittore has settled in the 1480s and spent most of the rest of his life. This altarpiece was identified on stylistic ground, especially because of the peculiar tooling on the gilded background representing an intricate pattern of acanthus leaves, griffins and crowns never found again in Vittore's prolific oeuvre. \nThe present work shows the half-length figure of St Jerome traditionally wearing his red cardinal mantle and hat, and holding a model of the Church as he is considered one of the four Fathers of the (western) Church. The open book in his left hand alludes to his activity as a translator of the Bible into Latin. \nF. Zeri (1961) suggested that this panel along with St Catherine of Alexandria (765A-1865), St Anthony of Padua and St Bernardino of Siena (both Van Heek collection, s'Heerenberg) flanked a tabernacle representing the Piet\u00e0 (Kress collection, University of Arizona Museum of Art, Tucson). This hypothesis was taken over by Sandra di Provvido in her monograph on the painter (1972). The lower part of the altarpiece is formed by five panels from the Wilstach collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art representing the full-length figures of St Bonaventure and St John the Baptist on the left, St Louis of Toulouse and St Francis on the right, the central panel showing a lavish Madonna and Child enthroned with four angels and cherubs.  \nVittore Crivelli is considered as a minor artist compare with his elder brother Carlo. His style appears somehow more provincial and lacking of the prolific fantasia that characterises Carlo's output. He borrowed from his brother a certain angularity in drawing the faces and hands, which he accentuated without reaching similar expressive results. Nonetheless, Vittore succeeded in providing most of his compositions with a sweetness and a grace that gave them a character of their own, mostly distinguishable from his brother's hand. The Vinci altarpiece was already considered by his contemporaries as his masterpiece.",

            "historical_context_note": "In Italy, the altar became a primary setting for painting on panel - hence the appellation 'altarpiece' - a format developed in Western art from the example of Byzantine icons. An early format consisted in gabled vertical panels representing a full-length saint flanked by scenes of his or her life and soon developed to include several individual compartments to form a polyptych which frames could become increasingly elaborate. They eventually transformed the altarpiece into an architectonic structure resembling in detail and spatial principles the fa\u00e7ades of contemporary full-scale Gothic architecture. In Italy such altarpieces were usually made of wood and painted, while in northern Europe they were commonly executed in stone. A new type of altarpiece soon appeared in 15th-century Italy, known as <i>pala,</i>, and was closer to a framed picture. In the interest of clarity and unity, numerous medieval screens separating the choir and high altar from the nave were removed.\nThe religious reforms of the 16th century brought new attention and some important changes to the form and function of the altarpiece. Under Protestant auspices, the altarpiece iconography was restricted to subjects well-suited to the sacrament celebrated at the altar, such as the Last Supper while the dynamic qualities that characterize Baroque art brought important changes to altarpiece design. Important altarpieces consisting of a single painting or relief continued to be made, but increasingly architecture was used as the theatrical setting for the three-dimensional display of the altarpiece's subject in sculpture. \nAltarpieces adorned both high altars and side altars. High altars often carried large altarpieces with elaborate programmes while side altars served a more private piety and their altarpieces were often endowed by private individuals.",
