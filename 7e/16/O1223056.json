In 1878, Irving became manager of the Lyceum Theatre, London and opened his first season by playing Hamlet. This production was also his first with Ellen Terry who went on the be his long-term acting partner.\n\nBernard Partridge (1861-1945) was a painter and illustrator who became the principal cartoonist of Punch magazine.  He acted at the Lyceum in his youth, using the name Bernard Gould, and made many drawings of Irving, some which appeared in the theatre's souvenir programmes. His work has provided both a record of costumes and scenery and of the dramatic effect of Irving's performances",
