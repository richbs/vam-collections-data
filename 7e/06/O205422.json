The six main stones on the cross, and one at the centre of the bow, are backed with rose-cut clear pastes (the lowest paste on the cross is missing).  At the back of the bow are two vertical bars, which would originally have been used as a slide for hanging the pendant from a ribbon.  It now has a pin fitting added, which has converted the pendant to a brooch.",

In the south, Christian symbols such as the cross and rosary were widely worn as jewellery.  The crosses worn with traditional costume often followed out-dated aristocratic examples.  Many were based on 17th and 18th century patterns, but over time local differences became fixed, and patterns became characteristic of a particular place.  \n\nThis pendant is 18th century in design, but the detail is typical of 19th century traditional jewellery.  Its original owner would have worn it as a pendant, with a ribbon strung through the two vertical loops on the back of the bow at the top, and tied at the back of her neck.  It has now been converted to a brooch, by the addition of a brooch fitting at the back of the bow.",
