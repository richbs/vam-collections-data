The purple 'zami' is diapered with 'butis', placed in diagonal rows, alternately coloured in yellow, red, white and green. Both 'pars' (outer borders) and 'anchal' have 'butis' in stylized flower patterns in red surrounded by white decorations. The inner borders of the red 'anchal' (end) have motifs depicting a ruler on a horseback, with two attendants, one bearing a 'pankha' or fan and the other a 'chatra' or umbrella. This motif is repeated to form horizontal and vertical border processions, defined by another border system of repeating rosettes. In the centre of the section ('anchal') there are two 'butis' of 'naksha' (pattern) known as 'kalka' (paisley), both being decorated with rosettes. This type of silk brocade sari is known as 'Baluchar Buttidar' sari.",
