Sykes created these designs while employed by the architect Francis Fowke (1823-1865).  Fowke also contracted Sykes to design the terracotta columns, stained glass, bronze, ironwork, decorations in majolica and mosaic, and tile pavements for the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A), beginning in 1861. Neither Sykes nor Fowke lived to see the finished construction of the Royal Albert Hall in 1871.\n\nThe present cast is one of a group of 25 reproductions of Sykes's shields for the Royal Albert Hall: from REPRO.1901-4 to REPRO.1901-27, and REPRO.1904-9.",

Sykes was trained by Alfred Stevens (1817-1875) at the Sheffield School of Art in the Renaissance Revival manner. He created these designs while employed by the architect Francis Fowke (1823-1865).  Fowke also contracted Sykes to design the museum terracotta columns, stained glass, bronze, ironwork, decorations in majolica and mosaic, and tile pavements for the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) beginning in 1861. Neither Sykes nor Fowke lived to see the finished construction of Royal Albert Hall in 1871. Sykes's many assistants continued using and modifying his designs after his death.",
