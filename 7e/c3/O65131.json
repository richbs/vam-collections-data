A constant supply of fashionable new designs from which to create new lines was required, so patternmakers and master weavers like Leman supplied a wide range of designs for different weavers. The album contains some of his work from the period 1706-1716, as well as five designs from the 1730s.\n\nThis design was produced by Christopher Baudouin for James Leman. Baudouin was born about 1665. He was a Hugenot refugee, possibly from Tours, and was active in London from the 1680s, being naturalized in 1709. He lived in Paternoster Row in Spitalfields in London. \n\nJames Leman was born in 1688 into a weaving family of Huguenot descent. In 1702 James Leman was apprenticed to his father, Peter, and lived with his family in Stewart Street, Spitalfields in London. Leman's inscription on this design reveals that it was commissioned by Mr Matthew Vernon, a mercer who commissioned two designs from Leman between 1707 and 1726.",

The inscription appears to be in James Leman's handwriting but the drawing is executed in a more sensitive manner than that exhibited by Leman at this period. The colours are also more subdued. It may therefore be by the 'Mr Baudewine' referred to in the inscription (<i>see </i>Introduction p. 31 for a note on the designer Baudouin.)

Natalie Rothstein catalogued the designs before the album was bought by the Victoria and Albert Museum. She gave each design a VS number (for Vanners Silks) in her catalogue <u>Silk Designs of the Eighteenth Century</u>. The designs have been subsequently numbered by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department, however, a concordance exists.\n\nHistorical significance: The designs collected in the album are, with the exception of some fragmentary medieval examples in Italian collections, the earliest silk designs known to exist.",

The colours are also more subdued. It may therefore be by the 'Mr Baudewine' referred to in the inscription.'\nNatalie Rothstein compared design E.1861.46-1991 (VS.40) which is a copy of a Christopher Baudouin design with this one.",
