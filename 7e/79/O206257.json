Charlene's design was one of many art works made by the children, using card etching plates and coloured-tissue-paper collage. The design was transferred from etching and collage to half-tone line-block through the intervention of computer. The artist's name is Charlene, but she spelled in 'shalrene' when signing her art-work.",
