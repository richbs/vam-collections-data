            "public_access_description": "Men throughout Europe wore silver buttons with their traditional costume in the 19th century. Silver filigree buttons had been synonymous with rural dress since at least the 16th century. Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status. They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats. Few women wore decorative silver buttons, but theirs are often the most spectacular. \n\nIn the Balkans, buttons were used to fasten the waistcoat or jacket, for both men and women.  Most buttons were made of metal thread, in the Ottoman tradition.  Silver buttons, usually made of filigree, were mainly found in the west, along the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia, and in Albania and northern Greece.\n\nThese buttons are typical of those worn by men in Dalmatia, from their pyramid-shaped knops to their toggle fittings.  They were acquired in Dalmatia in the early 20th century, when they were described as worn with peasant costume.",
