They demonstrate a typically conservative style of the period, favoured by the middle classes and priced at mid-range. Their highly decorative motifs seem outdated when placed in the historical context of early Modernism, when designers sought to reject history and applied ornament but rather to mirror cultural changes like industrialisation in daily life. This design reflects the popular British taste for furniture which had little to do with the cultural avant garde.",
