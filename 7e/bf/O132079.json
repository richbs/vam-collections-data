In 1807 he entered the RA schools, and exhibited his first painting there. Made his name with 'The Disposal of a Favourite Lamb' in 1813; elected ARA 1814, RA 1820. Achieved great popularity with his landscapes and, particularly, rustic genre scenes in the 1820s; Ruskin highly praised his works in the 1840s. Married in 1822 the sister of the portrait painter Margaret Carpenter. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, especially in Italy 1836-38; these visits are reflected in the subjects he painted. Exhibited 124 works at the RA between 1807 and 1846, and 45 at the BI 1808-43. Librarian at the RA 1840-2. Died London 17 February 1847. His studio sale was at Christie's 31 May-5 June 1847. His two sons were the novelist William Wilkie Collins and the painter Charles Allston Collins. There are watercolours and a sketchbook in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: \tWilliam Collins 'List of Pictures and Patrons', two MS volumes 1808-27 and 1827-46, National Art Library, V&A (referred to below as Lists); <i>Athenaeum</i> 20 February 1847, p200 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1847, p137 (obit); W Wilkie Collins <i>Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq</i>, RA 2 vols, 1848 (referred to below as <i>Memoirs</i>); <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, p 141 W.

His attention \n\nwas principally turned to the scenery and inhabitants of the sea-shore. For the former, he carefully explored the Coast, for many miles, on each side of Boulogne; and, in the latter, the differences in physiognomy, manners and habits, between the French fishermen whom he was then studying, and the English fishermen ... These men, with their wives and families, formed the subjects of many of the most highly finished water-colour drawings that he ever executed (<i>Memoirs</i> I, p327).\"",
