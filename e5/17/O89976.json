The base of the kettle was soldered on afterwards. The tradition of dragon-head spouts goes back 300 years.\n\nBrass is an alloy or mixture of copper and zinc: 83% copper produces a golden lustre; 90% gives a reddish glow. Brass melts at 850\u00baC and can be cast into patterned moulds or into sheets which are hammered into shape.\n\nThe V&A\u2019s brass collection covers a wide range of dates and styles \u2013 from medieval water jugs with lion-head spouts to sleek warming dishes of the early 20th century. The market for brass was large. It included mass-produced goods, lighting for middle-class houses and clocks for the aristocracy. Most of these items were not for display, but were functional. People used brass fireguards, soap containers and tobacco boxes in their homes. Brass candlesticks and holy-water buckets played their part in church services.\n\nBefore 1600, European brass manufacture flourished in Nuremberg, where councils protected local trade zealously.

The market for brass was large. It included mass-produced goods, lighting for middle-class houses and clocks for the aristocracy. Most of these items were not for display, but were functional. People used brass fireguards, soap containers and tobacco boxes in their homes. Brass candlesticks and holy-water buckets played their part in church services.\n\nBefore 1600, European brass manufacture flourished in Nuremberg, where councils protected local trade zealously.
