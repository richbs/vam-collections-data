Since leaving Argentina in her 20s she has travelled widely and her work addresses themes of homelessness and itineracy. \n\nFrom 2002 to 2004 Mandrile made a set of \u2018ID\u2019 cards. She sees the letters \u2018ID\u2019 as standing not for \u2018Identity\u2019 but for \u2018Intensively Displaced\u2019, referring to the way in which many migrants are under pressure to leave their homeland and are constantly forced to move from place to place. \n\nThe cards imitate tourist snapshots and feature home-made dolls incorporating computer-manipulated self-portraits (see Museum no. E.214:1-2005). Their sorrowful, shadowy features, bandaged heads and bleak surroundings remind the viewer that these snapshots show neither comfortable homes nor exotic holiday resorts but simply places where migrants make do with scant resources.",
