The Lady Delia Peel and Major Arthur Penn were in atttendance.'\n\nThe evening's programme began with Frederick Ashton's Capriol Suite, designed by William Chappell, with music by Peter Warlock based on tunes by Arbeau, followed after the interval by Frederick Ashton's Cinderella, designed by Jean-Denis Malcl\u00e8s to music by Prokofieff. Cinderella was danced by Margot Fonteyn and her Ugly Stepsisters by Frederick Ashton and Robert Helpmann.\n\nThe Sadler's Wells Ballet started in 1931 at Sadler's Wells Theatre. By 1946 the original company became the resident ballet at Covent Garden while a second company took its place at Sadler's Wells Theatre where its principal aim was to provide a training ground for young dancers and new choreographers. The Vic Wells Ballet Fund (later to be called the Sadler's Wells Benevolent Fund) was established in 1936 to help the struggling company at the Sadler's Wells Theatre surmount its financial difficulties.",
