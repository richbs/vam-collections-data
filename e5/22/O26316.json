The player is to lay down as many of these as he is ordered to wait turns, and when it comes to his turn to spin again, instead of spinning he must take up one Marker, and so on, till they are all taken up.\nThe person who plays first, places his Traveller according to the number given by the totum, for instance, if you turn up No. 7, you place the turned Pillar upon St. Malo, and there let it remain until it is you turn to spin again; f at the second spinning you turn up No. 4, let it be added to 7, which being 11, you proceed on your journey in removing the Traveller to Bordeaux, and so on till you arrive at London, No. 103, which is the end of the Game and the Journey.  But as it may very often happen that the Traveller should be carried beyond this last number, by the chances of play, in such a case he is to return to Hanover at 89 and then spin again his turn, to take his departure from that town.\nThe Traveller, which is overtaken by another, must go back to the stage left vacant by the former.\n\nThe rules are followed by a descriptive passage for each of the 103 stages.  This also gives any forfeits and rewards\n\n\nAt the bottom of the rules and explanation is the following text:\nLONDON:  Printed for Robert Sayer and Co., Fleet Street.  Where may be had just published,\nA collection of new maps dissected for the instruction and amusement of youth, comprehending the world and the quarters, England, Scotland, Ireland and all the Empires, Kingdoms and States in Europe.

Price 7s. 6d.\nThe same, with the sea coasts, etc, larger 10s 6d. each.\nAlso a new Geographical Game of England and Wales; with an excursion to France, Scotland and Ireland, being a companion to this.  \n\nRules placement: printed sheet with descriptive text of each stop",
