London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Charles George LEWIS (1808-1880) after Sir Edwin Henry LANDSEER (1802-1873)\nThe Hawk, 1843.\nLettered with title and <i>Painted by E. Landseer R. A./Engraved by C.G. Lewis\n</i>Mezzotint, stipple etching and engraving coloured by hand.\nCut to 61 X 41cm.\nE.313-1905\nBryan Bequest. \n\nIn 1837, Landseer exhibited at the Royal Academy a pair of paintings on the panel<sup>1</sup> entitled 'Falcon and Hooded Falcon'.  Both pictures were engraved almost life size by C.G. Lewis under the misleading titles 'The Hawk' and 'The Falcon' in 1843.  The original paintings are very brightly coloured and in the one corresponding to this print, the lower half of the wall is draped with a scarlet cloth.  This print, like the Bonington discussed earlier (see E.481-1903), poses a problem in that here is a print that one would not expect to encounter hand-coloured and yet the quality of the colouring makes it difficult to dismiss it out of hand.\nC.G. Lewis was one of a number of reproductive engravers who made their living from engraving the latest works of painters, on commission from print publishers.  The function of the engraver was to translate the painting into blacks, greys and whites.  From around 1830 onwards, the publishing of reproductive engravings became an increasingly profitable and highly structured business, organised for the benefit of the artists, who earned enormous copyright fees, and the publishers, who made large profits.  The Printsellers Association was founded in 1847 to afford a measure of trade protection by recording edition sizes of prints declared to them, in terms of artists' proofs, presentation proofs, proofs before letters, lettered proofs and ordinary prints.  Their publishing records seemed to make no provision for the publication of hand-coloured impressions.  One plate could take the engraver years to complete.  Lewis broke with the publisher Henry Graves in 1849 over an incident concerning the non-completion of the plate for Landseer's picture 'Shepherd's Bible'.  After a delay of six years the owner of the picture tried to repossess it at pistol point.<sup>2</sup>\nThe nature of the engraver's art can be seen by the great variety of lines and marks in the printed part of this image, used to convey the textures of feathers, stone and leather and to increase the print's visual interest.  In places, the hand-colouring obliterates the print underneath, nullifying the engraver's efforts, but in a far less crude way than occurs in prints of a hundred years earlier.  The colouring is confidently applied but the fact that it runs over the bottom margin would seem to count against it being a print for sale.  It almost looks like a master copy for other colourists to follow but the only statement that can be made about the colouring with certainty is that it is not later than 1905, the year it entered into the Museum's collection.\n\n1. <i>Sir Edwin Landseer</i>, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1981, no. 95A and B.\n2.
