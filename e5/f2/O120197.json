Its technique is also very interesting, as transfer-printing is rarely found on low-fired terracotta. Terracotta was used for wine coolers because of its porosity, which enabled the coolers to be immersed in chilled water before use. A royal order placed with Davenport in 1807 included \u201824  Egyptian porouse Wine Coolers, Embossed & C\u2019 at 10s 6d each, but these are thought to have been painted  (rather than transfer-printed, as here).\n\nDavenport was one of the big four English ceramic firms during the early-mid 19th century, alongside Minton, Spode and Wedgwood, and was generally at the cutting edge of design, but not always innovative in terms of materials and techniques. However, the firm left no archive, and in part because it did not pioneer a new ceramic material with which the factory\u2019s name became synonymous (as with Wedgwood with Jasper and Minton with Majolica), and because it left no archive, its importance was largely forgotten until the 1970s.",
