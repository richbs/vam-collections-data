Despite the lack of detail of the painting, the style of decoration would have appealed to an audience interested in the exotic East. Commonly known as 'Chinese blue-and-white', vases like this were used to decorate the interiors of many British homes in the 19th century.\n\nChinese blue-and-white wares had been imported into Britain since the 16th century. Although by the 1870s they were no longer rarity items, they continued to feature prominently in interior design. Rooms were filled with blue-and-white porcelain of different shapes and sizes to create a sumptuous effect. Older pieces were displayed alongside newer products.",
