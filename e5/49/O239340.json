It took two years after this design was drawn to publish the book because Pugin had difficulty getting E. J. Willson to write the text. In the preface to the book he described this frontispiece as 'This composition represents an artist of the fifteenth century seated in his study amidst his books and drawings making an architectural design. The furniture of the room is altogether agreeable to the fashions of the supposed period; and the inscriptions, and other ornaments of the border, are also designed in corresponding style'.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In \u2018Contrasts\u2019, published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",

The drawing is dated 1834 whereas the book was not published until 1836 because Pugin had the greatest difficulty in getting E J Wilson to write the text. In the preface to the book, which he wrote at St. Marie's Grange, Salisbury in July 1836, Pugin described his frontispiece thus: \"This composition represents an artist of the fifteenth century seated in his study amidst his books and drawings making an architectural design. The furniture of the room is altogether agreeable to the fashions of the supposed period; and the inscriptions, and other ornaments of the border, are also designed in a corresponding style'.",
