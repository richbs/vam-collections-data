It functions as a type of semi-formal court robe for a woman, and the turquoise colour suggests this may have been worn by an imperial consort of a lower rank. \n\nIn general, in the court system of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), a more limited dress-code appeared to have been available for women ranking down from the Empress and Imperial Consorts to wives of officers of the Seventh rank. (Men had a range of court dress for specific occasions). Not all Imperial robes will be ornamented with the symbol of the dragon, as this one demonstrates. Even the Emperor's wives and concubines did not necessarily always wear robes decorated with dragons. Women also had sets of clothes made for auspicious celebrations such as weddings or the birthdays of older wearers, and the clothes made for these occasions were worn for future events of importance.However, most formal imperial attire will bear the signature motif of the multi-layered rocks emerging from a sea of many-coloured waters.",
