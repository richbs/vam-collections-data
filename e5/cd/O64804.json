Founded in 1480, the abbey was closed down in 1802. The stained glass windows had been removed and are believed to have been bought by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Many were subsequently purchased by Lord Brownlow and installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park, Hertfordshire, between 1811 and 1831. In 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction. A private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the V&A. \n\nEach cloister window was composed of two openings (\u2018lights\u2019). Each light was composed of three large panels, plus one small tracery panel. So each window had eight panels. Two panels depicted scenes from the Old Testament and two panels scenes from the New Testament. Above the biblical story panels were two smaller prophet (or \u2018messenger\u2019) panels with half-images of Old Testament prophets. The prophets held the biblical text relating to the Old and New Testament stories. At the base of each window were donor and patron saint panels. The donors helped finance the cloister glazing.\n\nThis type of narrative arrangement is known as \u2018typological\u2019. Each Old Testament story was a \u2018type\u2019 or a prefigurement of a New Testament story (\u2018antitype\u2019). This panel shows the Old Testament story of the sons of the prophets greeting the prophet Elisha as successor to Elijah. It is seen as a prefigurement of the panel which appeared below in the window. This showed the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem on the day we now call \u2018Palm Sunday\u2019.",

From the surviving panels and the existing windows it can be seen that the programme was made up of paired Old and New Testament scenes arranged typologically one above the other (New Testament at the second level, Old Testament in the third), as in the Biblia Pauperum, with donor panels placed on the lowest level. A prophet with a scroll occupied the cusped head of each light.\n\nBelieved to be from the eighth window in the cloisters at Mariawald.",

            "historical_context_note": "Mariawald was a Cistercian abbey founded in 1480. The Cistercians were a monastic order established in 1098 in Burgundy at Citeaux. The founder of the Cistercians had broken away from the Benedictines which had been the first monastic order to be established in Europe, in the 6th century.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napoleon, many monastic institutions on the continent were \u2018secularised\u2019 and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Mariawald was closed down in 1802 but fortunately its buildings, including the cloisters, remain  largely intact. However, the stained glass windows had been removed and it is believed that they were purchased by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Mariawald panels to various churches and to private collectors. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nThis panel is one of many in the V&A that comes from the cloisters at Mariawald. These panels come from ten windows on the west and north sides of the cloister, plus one from the north end of the eastern part. The glazing of these cloisters began about 1510 and seem to have been completed in the 1530s.\n\nAs the cloisters were never dismantled we can reconstruct how the panels were placed in the architectural structure. The window openings in the cloisters were each composed of two openings (\u2018lights\u2019). Each light was composed of three large panels, plus one tracery panel. So there would have been eight panels to each window.\n\nFrom the surviving stained glass panels we can determine the theme of the cloister glazing. Each window had two panels depicting scenes from the Old Testament and two panels with scenes from the New Testament. Above the biblical story panels, were two smaller prophet (or \u2018messenger\u2019) panels. These contained half-images of Old Testament prophets holding scrolls with text relating to biblical passages connected with the scenes below. At the base of each window were donor and patron saint panels. These donors were the ones who contributed to the financing of the cloister glazing.\n\nThis type of narrative arrangement is known as \u2018typological\u2019. Each Old Testament story was a \u2018type\u2019 or a prefigurement of a New Testament story (\u2018antitype\u2019). For example, the Old Testament story of \u2018The Sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham\u2019 was a prefigurement of the New Testament \u2018Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross\u2019.\n\nThe typological arrangement was popular in the Middle Ages. The stories were reproduced in manuscripts and in engravings from woodcuts and collectively became known as \u2018Biblia Pauperum\u2019 (\u2018Bibles of the Poor\u2019). At the end of the 15th century the Biblia Pauperum were printed in book form and sold in their thousands. These books were used as design sources for artworks including stained glass panels. \n\nElisha (Eliseus) was the disciple of Elijah (Elias) whom the prophet called from the plough to be his successor. When Elijah was taken up to heaven, Elisha caught his mantle as it fell from the fiery chariot (a prefiguration of Christ\u2019s Calling of the Apostles). He healed Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, of leprosy by telling him to wash 7 times in the Jordan (a prefiguration of the Baptism of Christ).\n\n2 Kings 2: 3 There (Bethel) a company of prophets came out to Elisha and said to him, \u2018Do you know that the Lord is going to take your lord (Elijah) and master from you today?\u2019 \u2018I do know\u2019, he said, \u2018say no more\u2019. Elijah said to stay but Elisha followed him to Jericho where more prophets came out and asked him the same thing. This also happened at Jordan. Fifty of the prophets followed them, and stood watching from a distance as the two of them stopped by the Jordan. Elijah parted the Jordan and as they were crossing Elijah asked Elisha what he could do for him. Elijah was then taken up to heaven, his mantle falling and was caught by Elisha who then parted the Jordan and crossed back. The prophets from Jericho who were watching proclaimed him Elijah\u2019s successor (a prefiguration of the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem).",
