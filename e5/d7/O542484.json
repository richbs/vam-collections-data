The original tapestry was an exercise in creating simple, spatial planes through form and colour. During the late 1960s there was a general reassessment and interest int he work of the Bauhaus Workshops. Susan Collier and Sarah Campbell were particularly interested in the vivacity that the Bauhaus brought to their textiles through their use of bright colour and abstract forms. As a homage to the Bauhaus they adapted the tapestry, which they saw in a catalogue in the late 1960s, into a repeat pattern for a printed fabric. The designers wanted to keep the shape of the hand-painted lines and fomrs of the design in the finished product. This was innovative at the time as printers had been in the habit of straightening 'wobbly' lines, making the printing process easier.",
