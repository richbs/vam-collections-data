They were often carved with fantastic monsters and grotesques, like this example, which belonged to Jules Soulages (1803\u20131856), a lawyer from Toulouse. His collection was exhibited at Marlborough House between December 1856 and January 1857, and subsequently bought piecemeal by this museum. Many pieces were heavily restored or made up of partly old pieces, like this example.",
