From similar bands which are more complete, we can assume that the top figure (only his legs and lower bottom of a tunic is still present in this fragment) is a huntsman or warrior carrying a shield and sword. Below him is maybe his prey, a lion and a hare. The now detached pendant roundel consists of a crowned bust.\n\nA fair amount of silk decorations for tunics were found at the burial sites of Akhmim and Antinoe. Their arrangements on the garment was like that of the woollen tapestry panels: one shoulder band on each side of the neck ending in pendant medallions at the waist both back and front, large roundels below and oblong panels on the sleeves. The tunic was generally of linen.",
