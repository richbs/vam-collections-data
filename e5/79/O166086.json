            "public_access_description": "Designed by Jamie Reid in his then trademark style, the newsprint adorning this t-shirt reflects two sides of the Sex Pistols story. On one hand, in continuing with the 'ransom note'-style designs which had now become part of the defining imagery of the Sex Pistols and the Punk era, the t-shirt seems to warrant the message that despite everything that had happened to them by 1978, the Sex Pistols as a brand would carry on regardless. \n\nThe newsprint itself, however, tells the real story, revealing the extent to which the Sex Pistols torrid existence had degenerated. The headlines display the accusations against Sid Vicious, the bass player of the band, of murdering his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. The photographs of Ronnie Biggs, who had famously escaped from Wandsworth prison after being convicted for involvement with the \u00a32.6 million 'Great Train Robbery' of 1963, chronicles the band's meeting with him in Brazil. He performed on two tracks with the band recorded following their last live performance; these were included on the soundtrack of the film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. By this point, Johnny Rotten, lead singer of the Sex Pistols, had left the band, due to disagreements with their manager, Malcolm McLaren, and disgust with Vicious. The rest of the band would carry-on, briefly, recording several songs with different singers. \n\nThis is where the story that the t-shirt tells ends; Vicious's death from a heroin overdose in February 1979 resulted in the termination of the group in its 1970s incarnation.",
