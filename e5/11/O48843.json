It continued with only minor changes to the body profile and a gradual deterioration in quality until the end of the 17th century. This piece, closely datable to 1660-65, is a good example of its type.\n\nTrading\nUntil John Dwight, founder of the Fulham Pottery, patented his stoneware in 1672,  Britain was entirely dependent on Germany for its stoneware bottles and beer mugs. These were shipped along the Rhine by Dutch merchants to convenient ports such as Rotterdam and Nijmegen. After reaching London, they were distributed to the rest of the country. So complete was the Dutch control over the stoneware bottle trade that from about 1600 some of the leading merchants commissioned bottles with their name, arms or merchant's mark from Frechen potteries, no doubt to serve as an advertisement. Jan op de Kamp was an associate of Pieter van den Ancker, many of whose bottles have survived. Both were closely involved in the Frechen-London bottle trade.\n\nTime\nThe last mass importation of German stoneware bottles took place in the 1660s for three reasons. The popularity of the new English black glass bottle was increasing rapidly, the stoneware bottle trade ceased during the three Dutch Wars of the late 17th century, and by 1675 Dwight's Fulham Pottery was in full production.",
