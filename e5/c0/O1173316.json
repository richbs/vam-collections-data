Winter Games is a sports video game based on sports featured in the Winter Olympic Games. It was developed by Epyx and released in Europe by U.S. Gold. The game was presented as a virtual multi-sport carnival called the \"Epyx Winter Games\" with up to 8 players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal. The game allowed players to either compete in all of the events sequentially, choose a few events, choose just one event, or practice an event. The game was published by Epyx, a video games developer and publisher in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. The company was founded as Automated Simulations by Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of \"hits\" through the 1980s, but nevertheless went bankrupt in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993.",
