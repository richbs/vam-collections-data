In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nIn 1907 Ernest Nister published an edition of The Arabian Nights, edited with an introduction by W.H.D. Rouse and illustrated by Walter Paget. This drawing probably illustrates the story of 'Ali Baba and the Forty Theives'. When Morgiana, the wife of Ali Baba, kills the thirty-seven thieves hiding in the oil jars, the lead thief attempts to exact revenge by establishing himself as a merchant and befriending Ali Baba's son. He is invited to dinner at Ali Baba's house. Morgiana recognises him and kills him with a dagger.",
