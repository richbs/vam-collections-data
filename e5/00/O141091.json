She was held in position by the use of two spikes which protrude from her back.  She may have decorated a large crucifix, or possibly a reliquary casket or altarpiece.",

Both are rare survivals of applied 'bronzes' from larger ensembles, either from the left arm of a large crucifix, or from a group decorating a reliquary casket or altarpiece.
