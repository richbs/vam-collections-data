Turner (1775-1851). Reinagle (1749-1833) was a near contemporary of both these artists and this \u2018Claudian\u2019 landscape, dated 1819, would have been seen as somewhat old-fashioned. The artist\u2019s decision to paint in this style could reflect commercial considerations. Reinagle had a large family to support and may have sort to take advantage of the avid collecting of Claude Lorrain\u2019s landscapes by English connoisseurs.",
