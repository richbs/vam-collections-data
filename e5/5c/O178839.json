            "public_access_description": "Rupert Potter (1832-1914), father of the children's writer and illustrator, Beatrix Potter (1866-1943), was a keen amateur photogapher and a close friend of the painter and illustrator, Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896).  Rupert would often assist Millais by photographing backgrounds for paintings and sitters for portraits. Beatrix Potter recounted one particularly memorable sitting in July 1884 when her father photographed the former prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898), for Millais' second portrait of him, completed in 1885: ' Papa has been photographing old Gladstone this morning at Mr. Millais'\u2026  They kept off politics of course, and talked about photography.  Mr. Gladstone talked of it on a large scale, but not technically.  What would it come to, how far would the art be carried, did papa think people would ever be able to photograph in colours?' (Journal, Monday 28th July 1884).\n\nThe Millais family lived mostly in London but retreated to Annet Lodge near Bowerswell, Perthshire for the summer months.  Here, Millais executed many of his best-known paintings and enjoyed the company of likeminded friends, including the Potters who also spent the long summers from 1871 to 1881 renting Dalguise House near Dunkeld. This doorway to the house, with its distinguishing pillars and doorbell, was Rupert's preferred backdrop to many portraits of his friends and family.  Here, he appears to be photographing a sitting for a painting (probably for Millais) - a large blank canvas stands ready for painting in the background.",
