This  example may have decorated a bed, cupboard, chimney-piece or overmantel.  The long rectangular shaft of a pilaster was suited to narrow, vertical decoration, as here. Other forms of decoration included strapwork (which resembles flattened bands of leather) and grotesques composed of small, loosely connected motifs derived from ancient Roman wall painting.\n\nDesign\nThe design shows the influence of northern European engravings. The Nine Muses, the ancient Greek goddesses of the arts, were a popular subject for a series of individual engravings. Pilasters that combine both grotesque masks and female figures appear in the prints of Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau (around 1515-1585) and Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527-?1606).\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe pilaster is decorated with a figure known as a 'term' - the upper half is human and the legs take the form of a tapering pilaster decorated with a mask. She probably represents Thalia, the muse of comedy and pastoral poetry, and holds a lira da braccio (an early form of violin), an instrument with which Thalia is often represented.",
