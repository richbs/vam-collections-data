Upper: two passes of dark red/purple wool with a cabled fringe max. 28 cms. long; these are thicker along the last 3 cms. and are secured by being bound.  Some of the individual threads end with a knot.\n\nDESIGN: Field: green ground with along and narrow very dark red niche with ends with a blunt arch which is horned.  Above and below this niche is a band of 5 spanner-shapes.  A light purple toothed stem comes from a purple X at the bottom of the niche and has 6 pairs of geometric blossoms, very small rosettes and geometric devices along its length.  On either side of the niche are a variety of stepped and horned crosses in many colours.\n\nInner border: red ground with similar crosses along sides and at top and bottom a floral meander on white cotton stem.\n\nOuter border: dark blue ground with a dark red zigzag stem along centre of sides with a  half spanner from each point and with a crossed cross in each recess.  Along the bottom these lie inside an angular meander.  Along the top this becomes a narrow band with the geometric meander in light red containing incomplete flowerheads.\n\nLower band: very dark red and white interlocking geometric shapes, below are bands of dark red/blue/red.\n\nUpper band: similar but black and white.\n\nThe niche has a vertical reciprocal toothed edge with the field and the borders joined by white vertical cotton toothed lines.",
