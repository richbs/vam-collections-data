The two bows appear to hold the soft gathers of the material together as it flows from the deep, falling collar into the closely fitting bodice.\n\nDior wrote that \u2018many a dress of mine is born of the fabric alone\u2019, and in this dress he manipulates the luxurious, crisp satin organza to great effect.  The bodice is complemented by a simple skirt.  Full and short, its bouffant shape is pleated into a tight waist and supported by four layers of net petticoat beneath, the innermost reinforced by horsehair stiffening.",
