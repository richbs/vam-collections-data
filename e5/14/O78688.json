The seal was the size of a saucer and embossed on both sides. It was a highly symbolic appendage and far removed from any ordinary security seal. This impression is taken from the Queen's second Great Seal, designed by Nicholas Hilliard.  The document relates to land and property in Lincolnshire.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe impression shows the monarch enthroned, and on the reverse, riding on horseback.  This was the standard format for Tudor Great Seals.  However, this one differs from earlier examples in the many allegorical motifs incorporated in the design: the orb and sceptre, the Tudor roses and the hands reaching down from the heavens are all supposed to stress Elizabeth's divine rule over England.\n\n Time\nThis seal was commissioned in 1584.  It replaced another version in use since the Queen's accession to the throne 25 years earlier.   The 1580s were difficult years for Elizabeth and the timing of this commission is historically significant: as she entered a childless middle-age amidst conflicts with Spain, it was hoped that powerful new imagery such as this might bolster her flagging popularity.",
