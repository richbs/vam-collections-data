Silk and cotton tie-dyed bandannas (from Hindi bandhna, to tie), printed silk and cotton types and woven cotton and silk examples were all popular. Pulicat on the Coromandel Coast was known for its woven handkerchiefs, and it is quite likely that chintz examples like this one were also made there. This type of sprigged floral patttern was particularly popular in France, where imitations called paillaca were made in the mid-18th century.",
