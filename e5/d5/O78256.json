Printed borders were used to conceal the heads of the tacks and to give a neat and finished appearance to the papered wall. The fashion for using borders continued even when methods of hanging wallpapers changed and borders were no longer strictly necessary.  By the early 19th century borders were available in elaborate designs to use as a frieze decoration around the upper part of the room.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAt this time many different designs for wallpaper borders were available. Many patterns were based on architectural motifs and styles. This example includes a palmette and acanthus leaves, both characteristic of the Greek Revival style.\n\nPeople\nThis wallpaper comes from the stock of Messrs Cowtan & Sons Ltd, an important interior decorating company based in Oxford Street, London, from the 1830s to the 1930s. They succeeded two other well-known wallpaper suppliers, J. Duppa and J.G. Crace. Cowtan supplied wallpapers to customers all over the country.",
