Believed to be an amulet which could protect against the evil eye, it was often worn by children or used in rosaries. In the early 19th century, it began to be exploited in conventional jewellery and became highly fashionable. According to the 19th century French jeweller Henri Vever 'Every day, the coral merchant of H.R.H. Madame, Duchesse d'Angouleme, offers the most elaborate and elegant parures to customers and passers-by: the jewels which are sold there are created with exquisite taste'. \n\nMany 19th century designers used historical styles. This piece looks back to the elaborate pendants of the Renaissance with their intricately sculpted gold. It has a matching brooch and pendant. This was probably one of the last sets of jewellery to be sold by the Paris jeweller Fran\u00e7ois-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Froment-Meurice before his death in 1855. \n\nIt is carved with a figure of the Greek goddess Venus, the patron goddess of love.",

Coral cameos of Bacchus, Apollo and Venus set in gold and hung with pearls; the drop on the pendant also set with diamond sparks. All three items originally convertible, the pendant into a brooch and the brooches into pendants. The fittings now incomplete. Made in Paris about 1854, the pendant has an illegible maker's mark; the two brooches stamped: F. MEURICE, with Paris warranty marks for 1838 onwards. The set came to the Museum in its original case with the label of F.-D. Froment-Meurice. Probably one of the last sets of jewellery to be sold by Francois-Desire Froment-Meurice (1802 - 1855) before his death, and similar to an item shown by his widow at the Pais Univeral Exhibition, 1855.
