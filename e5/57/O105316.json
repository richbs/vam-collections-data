Barrie's Peter Pan at the London Coliseum, 27 December 1971, which she played again the following Christmas when the production was revived.  It was directed by Robert Helpmann, with flying effects by Kirby's Flying Ballet. Dorothy Tutin (1930-2001) was a popular and versatile British actress whose elfin looks thoroughly suited the role of Peter.\n\nAnthony Holland (1912-2001) began his career in 1933, designing shows for repertory theatres throughout Britain. Following World War II his work was regularly seen in London; he worked with all the major west end stars of the day and created the sets and costumes for a wide variety of entertainments, from opera and classic drama to pantomime and ice shows. Like all costumes designed for Peter Pan since Nina Boucicault first played the part in 1904, the costume had to accommodate a flying harness and allow the freedom of movement for Peter to make his first entrance flying through Wendy's bedroom window.",

            "history_note": "This pencil and watercolour costume design by Anthony Holland is particularly interesting since it is for Dorothy Tutin in her role of Peter Pan which she played in J.M. Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan at the London Coliseum, 27 December 1971, and again in the revival of the production at the Coliseum at Christmas 1972.  The production was revived at the Coliseum at Christmas 1973 and 1974, but with Maggie Smith as Peter.  It was directed by Robert Helpmann, presented by Tom Arnold Presentation Ltd. with music composed by Grant Foster and flying effects by Kirby's Flying Ballet.  Since Dorothy Tutin was a well-liked Peter, this design would make a good exhibit in the Peter Pan  display opening at the Theatre Museum in December, the centenary of the original production. \n\nThe design complements our collection of Anthony Holland designs which he presented to the museum in 1996.  The collection includes other designs by him for the same production, including set designs for the nursery scene (S.648-2000 ) and the pirate ship (S.649-2000), costume designs for Wendy (S.654- 2000 & S.655-2000), a pirate (S.653-2000), the mermaids (S.652-2000), the lost boys (S. 650-200), and another design for Dorothy Tutin as Peter (S.651-2000).  \n\nThe design in this bequest should certainly be acquired since it appears to be the design for the costume worn by Dorothy Tutin in the photographs that The Theatre Museum holds of this production.  The design that we already hold (S.651-2000) differs in the details and may have been a design that Anthony Holland was considering but was never used.\n\nThis design was bequeathed to the museum by Jean Hunnisett, a costume maker for opera, film, and BBC productions and the author of Period Costume for Stage & Screen - Patterns for Women's Dress 1800-1909.  She may have been a friend of Anthony Holland or may have worked on the production.",
