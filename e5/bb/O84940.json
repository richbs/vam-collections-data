On the huqqa base, the six-petalled flowers have naturalistic stems and sepals; by the time the wash-basin was made, perhaps for the 1867 exhibition at Paris, these flowers are more stylized, and the sepals have become three vertical lenticular shapes. This trend towards increased stylization and simplification is more marked by the later 19th century.",
