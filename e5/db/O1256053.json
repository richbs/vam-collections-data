            "public_access_description": "Rupert Potter (1832-1914), father of the children's writer and illustrator Beatrix Potter (1866-1943), took up    photography in the 1860s when it was still a relatively new art form.  An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he    was elected to the Photographic Society of London in 1869 and later contributed to photographic exhibitions.     Rupert assisted the artist Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896), a close friend, by photographing backgrounds    for paintings and sitters for portraits. His favourite subject, however, was Beatrix herself and his prolific legacy    of several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial account of her life from infancy to marriage.\n\nRupert was also a skilled landscape photographer.  During the Potter family's extended summer holidays to    the countryside it was Beatrix's delight to accompany her father on photographic expeditions. He    photographed in particular the countryside around Eastwood in Dunkeld, Wray Castle near Ambleside,   Lingholm on the edge of Derwentwater and Tenby in Pembrokeshire. This photograph depicts a rural view from Eeswyke, a house in Near Sawrey rented often by the Potter family for summer vacations in the Lake District.   The house was formerly known as Lakefield during the Potters' time and was built as a Lake District retreat for  a Lancashire mill owner in 1742; it is now a hotel.\n\nExcited by the possibilities of the new art form, Beatrix too became an avid photographer, inheriting one of her    father\u2019s old cameras, 'a most inconveniently heavy article which he refuses to use, and which has been    breaking my back since I took to that profession.' (Journal, Friday 19th April 1895).  Beatrix went on to employ    photography in the service of her own art and, like Millais, she photographed details, particularly in the Lake    District landscapes, that she later incorporated in her imaginative book illustrations.\n Author:  Emma Laws",
