There were therefore many with images of the Queen and, after her marriage in 1840, of Prince Albert, either as portraits or at particular events.\n\nPeople\nJohn Brandard was one of the leading artists illustrating music sheet covers during this early period of colour lithography. Brandard was renowned for his great technical skill and ability to convey delicate colours, in particular in his portraiture.  He was also remarkably prolific.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe popularity of sheet music was partly due to the increase in domestic ownership of pianos, particularly after the introduction of upright pianos in about 1827.  'Pianomania' apparently began to spread among the middle-income levels of society during the 1840s, providing a market for the relatively expensive sheet music. The example here cost 4/-.",
