The exhibition of his work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1954, followed by the publication of the first major monograph on the artist in 1959, established Duchamp as a cult figure among avant-garde artists in both the USA and Europe. A generation of painters and sculptors in the 1950s and 1960s professed their admiration for him, including Richard Hamilton. Hamilton, who made a replica of Duchamp's Bride stripped bare... installation in 1960 was behind the exhibition of Duchamp's work at London's Tate gallery in 1968.",
