The bodice is lined with cotton twill, boned and fastens at the centre front with hooks and eyes, front of the bodice coming across to hook at the side of the collar. There is a twill watch pocket under the draped front.\n[Skirt] Skirt made with 10 gored panels. The back panels gathered at the centre back waist and having a small additional gore at the hem for extra fullness. It is lined with glazed cotton and is faced from mid calf to ankle with buckram, re-enforced above the ankle with calico and the hem is bound with beige velvet. It fastens with hooks and eyes at the centre back waist.",
