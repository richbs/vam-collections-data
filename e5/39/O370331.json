The panel was bought in Cairo and was probably used to furnish a domestic space or home in Cairo. Elite domestic interiors in Syria were ornately decorated- so called \u2018Damascus rooms\u2019 were painted and carved with pastoral scenes. Brightly coloured panelling decorated with floral motifs were an innate part of Syrian interior decoration. The painted floral detail on this panel is representative of painted panelling found in seen in 18th century Syrian interiors. Domestic interior design in Egypt from the same period was more conservative in taste: homes in Cairo were decorated with ornately carved ceilings painted with geometric patterns. Projecting mashrabiya windows &amp; interior fountains provided visual interest in central living spaces. It is highly likely that this item may have been used to furnish a domestic space in Cairo, possibly in a home with familial links to Syria and/or Damascus. \n\nDuring the 19th century, the Victoria and Albert Museum collected two so-called \u2018Damascus Rooms.\u2019  Interiors from Syria were highly collectible items and this panel is representative of 19th century European taste in painted interior panelling from Syria.",
