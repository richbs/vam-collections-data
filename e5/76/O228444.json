They introduced it to China when they took power there in the seventeenth century.  The Chinese term for this shape of cuff is translated as 'horse-hoof', an appropriate name because both Manchu men and women were skilled horse riders.  There is no suggestion that this particular garment was worn for riding: the shape of the cuff is a feature intended to be reminiscent of the nomadic cultural roots of the Manchu people.  The cuff is in contrasting material to the rest of the garment, a common dressmaking feature of ladies' robes from this part of the world for some centuries.  There are two bands of coloured silk embroidery on black satin and, although both bands have the same design of flowers and butterflies, each is on a slightly different scale.  They are edged in a braid of gold-wrapped thread and a strip of woven gold silk.  The rest of the gown, which may date from the eighteenth century, is quite different, being made from a soft yellow satin embroidered in a limited palette of pale blues and white.  It has a floral theme, like the cuffs, and a vertically striped hem of the kind seen throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on both men's and women's clothes.",
