Further thoughts on the Grubbe Plates. <u>Transactions of the English Ceramic Circle</u>, 2012, vol. 23, pp. 213-229.\nThis plate and three further plates illustrated figs. 2, 3 and 4 are discussed in detail by the author, particularly in relation to the circumstances of their donation by Mrs Dora Edgell Grubbe to the museum in 1935 and their historical attribution to decorating workshop of James Giles.  His caption to all four 'Grubbe plates' reads 'here attributed to Fidelle Duvivier, c. 1764-69'.  On 219p, he states:\n'Firstly though in no sense a set, they are all of virtually the same size and shape.  Secondly, all are without incised or underglaze-blue marks, whether crossed swords in imitation of Meissen, square marks of crescents.  Thirdly, though each is of a different genre, all are painted with an assurance that places them among the very best work atttributable to the Giles workshop or any other establishment in the England of their day.'  His suggestion that the Tournai painter Duvivier is the artist responsible for all four hinges partly on the plate with dead game, C.878-1935.  Its French subject matter and feathered blue-edged border reveal a non-English sensibility,  while a number of other idiosyncrasies found on this plate and others in the group link it to the Worcester teapot in the Ashmolean, signed by Fidelle Duvivier, dated 1772.  While there is no documentary evidence as to where he may have been between 1764-69 it is possible he was in London and working for Giles at that time.  Chelsea and the other London factories (Bow and Vauxhall) lacked innovative artistic direction at thie time: 'In 1764 there were real opportujnities at the higher end of the London porcelain market, and James Giles, the leading independent decorator, was well placed to take advantage of them.'\nMitchell, Sir Stephen.
