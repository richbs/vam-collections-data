He began his artistic career in 1914 as a painter and it was only around 1919 that he turned his attention to sculpture.  Torso, with its simplified form and flowing lines, was no doubt the result of his study of ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, Peruvian and African art in the British Museum, and his interest in the principles of Cubism. These were the key influences that first inspired him to make sculpture.",
