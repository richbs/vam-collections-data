Double-sided embroidery on hand-made dark brown silk net. There is no border down the right hand side and the lower panel has been mounted upside down. There is a 3-part border with a line of blue and light blue chevrons either side of three lines of pattern in which a green and yellow leaf-like motif alternately pointing inwards and outwards with a line of 3 small white flowers on either side alternates with a 4-petalled flower in pink, red and dark brown. The central area has a directional design. One motif has no stem but it does have a pair of green leaves with small red and yellow flowers.  This alternates with an angled green stem with a pink and red flower made of 4 angled lines, a short stem with 3 pink and red flowers and 2 small pink and red flowers at the bottom. There are small white blossoms and some larger blue ones filling the ground and there are 4 and a bit blue and yellow geometric motifs along the top edge of the central area.",
