His small paintings of religious and mythological subjects were in the Flemish tradition and were collected for display in small cabinet rooms by Italian and foreign collectors. Lauri lived in the area of the Piazza di Spagna, the principal quarter for foreign artists in Rome. His work was influenced by that of his friends, the celebrated French artists Nicholas Poussin (1600-1682), Claude Lorraine (1594-1665) and Gaspard Dughet (1615-75).",
