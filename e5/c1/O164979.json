            "public_access_description": "The use of predominantly plain dress silks for this patchwork coverlet has provided a design of vibrant contrasting colours, with surprising combinations such as bright blue and brown. The colours used provide a perfect display of fashionable British taste in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, when developments in the textile industry led to a new range of brightly coloured dress and furnishing fabrics. Chemical aniline dyes, first discovered in 1856, proved particularly successful when used on silks of the period. This lead to a move away from the cottons which had dominated the market in previous decades. By the 1860s, women across the country were acquiring fashionable silks for use in their domestic patchwork projects, including quilts, cushions, piano covers, table covers and sofa pillows, and for small articles such as theatre and work bags. \n\nWhen the coverlet was donated to the museum in 1937, it was said to have been worked by the donor's ancestor, Sarah Tomes (1792-1870), at around the time of her marriage in 1813. The brightly coloured silks are typical of those from the third quarter of the nineteenth century, and it may be that Sarah Tomes made the coverlet towards the end of her life. Sarah Tomes was the daughter of William Baylies of Welford in Gloucestershire. She married John Tomes (1791-1864), a farmer, in around 1813.",
