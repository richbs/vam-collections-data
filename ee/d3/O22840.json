The birds, painted in black and white enamels and accentuated with iron red, stand out vividly against a bright yellow ground.  The rim is gilt and the inside is white.  The mark Shende Tang zhi (made for the Hall of Prudent Virtue) is written in overglaze red enamel on the base.\n\nIt has long been known that Shende Tang was the residence of the Daoguang Emperor in the Yuanming Yuan complex, and that porcelains with this mark are imperial ware for his personal use.  Recent research however has pinpointed its location to the western end of the Jiuzhou Qingyan Palace (Palace of Peace in the Nine Regions).  The Shende Tang was completed in 1831, thus the group of  Shende Tang porcelains can be more precisely dated to the twenty years between 1831 and 1850, the year when the Daoguang Emperor died.\n\nThere are no less than 30 types of imperial Shende Tang porcelains extant in public and private collections, mostly in the shape of bowls, dishes and vases.  The majority are overglaze enamel-decorated, and the mark is usually written in iron red, although the Taoya says there are occasional ones in gold.  Incidentally the Taoya mentions a bowl 'with flights of cranes on a yellow ground and marked Shende Tang', a description that perfectly fits the present bowl, though Jiyuan Sou considered it as 'inferior to Qianlong pieces with magpies'.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that not all Shende Tang vessels are imperial ware.  This mark appears on folk wares of the Kangxi and Republican (1911-1937) periods.",
