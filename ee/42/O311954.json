Carabin (1862-1921) was a sculptor, medallist and gem-engraver. He began his artistic career as a gem-engraver under Jules Lequien, then worked as a wood carver, and from 1889 he devoted himself almost exclusively to sculpture, but occasionally modelled plaquettes and medals.\n\nThe continuing interest in the Graces throughout the nineteenth century is demonstrated by Carabin's use of the motif on this medal commemorating Le Journal. The theme was here adapted so as to relate to newspaper production and technology. To late twentieth-century eyes, it seems to have given the Three Graces a rare opportunity to read the newspaper, rather than to appear in the press themselves.\n\nThere was a display of the medal in 1994 to mark the acquisition of Canova's 'Three Graces' (A.4-1994) in 1994.",
