Turbans indicated the rank of the wearer. They were removed like hats and not unwound.  The red woollen fez replaced turbans for all except the ulema (clergy) about 1827. From about the 1720s onwards Ottoman embroidery stopped copying woven designs and became a truly creative art form. Designers introduced new, lifelike floral decorations, many of which were very detailed. They allowed some floral decorations to sway and sweep across the fabric. Some were stylised.  All decorations were worked in soft colours often enriched with metal thread.  The colours of many 18th century embroideries were originally very bright but they have faded to pleasing pastel shades.",
