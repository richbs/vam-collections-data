They were filled with pot-pourri (perfumed or sweet-smelling leaves) similar to those used to sweeten the air in domestic interiors today. Perfume vases of this design were made in pairs, but also sold singly.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe market for vases in the 'antique' style grew rapidly in the late 1760s, as the Neo-classical style gained ground. The demand was so great that, in addition to copying genuine Greek and Roman antiquities, manufacturers took designs from prints of the 17th and 18th centuries. Some of these prints were highly fanciful inventions, which may not have been seriously intended for production. The design here is taken from a print in Joseph-Marie Vien's Suite de Vases of 1760. The shape was made at Chelsea prior to its takeover by the Derby porcelain factory in 1770. Vien's engraved design was also copied in Black Basalt by the Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795).\n\nTrading\nChelsea porcelain vases of this shape were sold at a London auction held in 1770. They were described as 'antique urns upon pedestals ... ornamented with womens heads, and garlands of flowers'. They realized \u00a36 5s for a pair and \u00a33 12s for a single one. At that time, Chelsea and Derby modellers earned around \u00a32 11s. per week.",
