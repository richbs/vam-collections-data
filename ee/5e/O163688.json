Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder, were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe and boot shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. This carved shoe-shaped wooden snuff box is one of a pair, which were perhaps designed to be keepsakes given between friends or sweethearts.. The box is made from a single piece of wood and stained in imitation of inlaid wood. The stained wood floral decoration is outlined with fine brass stringing; and brass studs form the 'buttons' and 'stitching' of the shoe. The top is hollowed out to provide a container for the snuff and is secured with a hinged lid. It is lined with tin to keep the contents fresh and unaffected by the smell of the wood.",
