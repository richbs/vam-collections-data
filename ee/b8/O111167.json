The Liverpool band started at the end of the 1950s with John Lennon, who was in a band called The Quarrymen.  He was joined by Paul McCartney who brought his school friend George Harrison into the band. They perfected their sound during lunchtime concerts at Liverpool's Cavern Club, and clubs in Hamburg, and were brought to prominence by the record shop manager Brian Epstein. Epstein recognised their appeal and secured a record deal for them with EMI Parlophone records, after Decca turned them down. EMI's George Martin, a classical musician and composer, helped them develop their talents further and they went on to become the most successful recording artists in musical history.\n\nThe earliest examples of Beatles' merchandising were produced in the United States, after Brian Epstein sold a company called Seltaeb the rights to license it.  After a flood of successful Beatles items from stockings to talcum powder, Epstein realised the lucrative potential of the market and kept firm control of the licensing. This tile is one of a set of five produced in England, one representing each individual band member and one showing the group.",
