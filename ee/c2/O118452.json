The back is composed of two similar parts, each consisting of a shaped top and lower rail in between which is a row of turned balusters.  The rails and the apron are each carved at centre with a rosette from which spring stems bearing leaves and bold flowers.  The three uprights (two at either end of the settee and one in the centre) are surmounted by a bulbous finial, and are carved with rich leaf and flower borders, as are the two arms.  The seat, of stained teak, is supported on six barley-sugar twist legs married into rectangular blocks carved in the manner of the rest of the settee.  The legs are connected by twisted stretchers, and terminate in cup feet.  The two arms are supported in front on prolongations of the front legs.",

This idea was supported by the rigid, rectilinear forms of the furniture, which looked antiquated to 18th century eyes; the use of twist-turning, which was believed to be typical of Elizabethan furniture; the bizarre, intricate carving, which often included mythic beasts and figures; and the colour, black, which was commonly associated with furniture of great antiquity. \n\nFor Horace Walpole, who appears to have been responsible for this attribution, notions about the age of such furniture based on its physical attributes were confirmed by the existence of examples in houses with Tudor associations.  By the early 19th century Walpole's views that carved ebony furniture of this type was both English and of early date had become firmly established.  In actual fact such pieces were not English, but made in India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.",
