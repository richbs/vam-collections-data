The desk has been attributed to Thomas Roberts, who is mentioned in the Royal Accounts 1694-4 as supplying folding furniture to Queen Mary.\n\nNotes from R.P. 49/1981\n\nInventory Description\nFolding table: walnut veneer.  English about 1694.  Probably by Thomas Roberts.  \n\n22/7/49 letter, Phillips to Ralph Edwards \nPhillips asks that the V & A examine a table that folds down to 2'6\" x 1'1' in order to identify a royal seal that appears on \"the underside of the rail which ties the upper portion of the two turned legs on the right of the table as you face its sloping front\".  The stamp clearly shows a royal crown, but he cannot decipher what is beneath it.  He describes it as \"a walnut portable table or lectern or bureau, the legs of which fold or hinge upwards after the removal of an iron bar\".\n\nA Miss Alcock, former private secretary to H M King George V, has told Phillips that there was a similar example in Lord Stamfordham's room at Buckingham Palace some years ago.  (She remembers that one as larger or taller).
