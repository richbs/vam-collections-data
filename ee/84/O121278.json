Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s countless other royal figures were issued by Staffordshire pottery firms.  Although some Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were made in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThis represents Will Watch, a legendary smuggler who was believed to have come from the Sussex area of England and who featured as a hero in a number of melodramas, the best- known being Will Watch and his Black-Eyed Susan.  Several different versions of Will Watch were produced by Staffordshire firms, his popularity due to his romantic swashbuckling appearance.",
