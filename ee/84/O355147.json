The fabric strap that would have been attached to the front of the sole and which wrapped over the wearer's foot is missing. They were purchased by the V&amp;A from the 1867 Paris Universal Exposition and were probably never worn.\n\nEarly depictions of women wearing these high shoes feature in the artworks of 16th century European travellers who were fascinated by the exoticism of the Ottoman bathhouse. The subject continued to hold fascination with western artists up to the end of the nineteenth century and as such, the bathhouse came to exemplify a Victorian vision of 'oriental otherness'. In reality, qabqabs had become less common by the late 1800s due to new shoe fashions and also the popularity of private bathrooms.",
