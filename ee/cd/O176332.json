The schematized and isolated nature of these motifs suggests that they are ideas for motifs rather than records of an antique source. The scabbard occurs on the hall doorcases at Manresa House, the vessel on the Library doorcase of the same house. Both lyre and vessel occur in the drawings of terms possibly for Gower House and their derived plate in the Treatise of 1791. The drawing probably dates from soon after 1755.",
