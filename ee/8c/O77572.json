Combs were often made of luxurious and eye-catching materials, in this case lacquered wood. The design of the moon behind a tree cleverly continues around the back, encouraging the viewer to turn it over.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis type of comb was meant to be used as a decorative hair ornament rather than as something useful for actually combing the hair. Combs became popular with the emergence of elaborate hair-dos during the 17th century. They complemented the elegant kimono of the wearer and were usually used in combination with ornate hairpins and bodkins.\n\nTime\nIn the mid-1850s Japan was opened up after more than two centuries of seclusion from the rest of the world. The passion for all things Japanese that this triggered in the West was termed 'Japonisme'. Japanese art objects were avidly bought by Western collectors, artists and designers from specialist dealers or from shops such as Liberty's. Kimono and dress accessories were regarded as the embodiment of Japanese femininity.",
