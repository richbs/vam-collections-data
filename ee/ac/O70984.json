Piero Fornasetti's unique style of decoration has transformed Gio Ponti's modern version into a striking piece of furniture. The technique used to make it was unusual. Lithographs were created for each section, printed on to transfer sheets, and then applied to fibreboard panels. These were fitted to the cabinet and varnished. Fornasetti's trompe-l'oeil schemes were inspired by 16th century Italian Mannerist art as well as by 20th century Surrealism. (Trompe-l'oeil is a French term meaning 'trick of the eye'.) They were based on his knowledge of printed books and engravings, rather than the observation of real buildings.",
