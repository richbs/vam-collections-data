His face is covered with a grotesque mask, with 'spectacle' eyes, a hooked nose, pointed protruding chin and long drooping moustache. The figure wears a soft broad-crowned hat with brim turned up proper left with feathers held in a jewel mount. Around the neck is a ruff and the grotesquely shaped body is covered with a jacket belted below the belly, fastened with large round ball buttons; from the shoulders hangs a waist-length collared cape. To top thigh are loose 'trunk-hose', with straight trousers reaching to mid-calf. Front opening, cape, hose and trousers are decorated with braid forming rows of triangles, each topped with a small 'button'. The ankle-shoes fasten with small bows.",

Mariette.\n\nAs might be guessed from the nose, chin and pot belly, the character depicted is the ancestor of Britain's Mr Punch. Punch began as Polchinel, a character in an Italian entertainment called the Commedia dell'Arte which became very popular in France in the 18th century; they came to England when Charles II was restored to the English throne in 1660. The performers improvised around a number of stock characters, of which Polichinel: thug, wifebeater, thief and murderer, became the most popular in many countries. In France, he became Polichinelle or Pulcinella, in Germany Hanswurst, in Austria Kasperle, in Russia Petrushka, in Turkey Karagoz and in England, Mr. Punch. Pulcino in Italian means a day-old chick, and the figure's pose hints at the hen-like way in which the character moved.",

In France, he became Polichinelle or Pulcinella, in Germany Hanswurst, in Austria Kasperle, in Russia Petrushka, in Turkey Karagoz and in England, Mr. Punch. Pulcino in Italian means a day-old chick, and the figure's pose hints at the hen-like way in which the character moved.",
