The plate was then acquired by print publisher John Boydell who had some of the lettering re-engraved and included it in reprints of Italian Landscapes and also in his printed survey of pictures as Houghton, sold to Catherine the Great, The Houghton Gallery (1774-88). \n\nArthur Pond's Italian Landscapes project was the springboard for Francis Vivares' career as a reproductive printmaker. Vivares was closely identified with the work of painters Claude Lorrain and Gaspar Poussin, two of the landscape painters most admired by British art-collectors in the eighteenth century.",
