His subjects were his friends and associates but also leading figures in politics, religion, science and the arts as well as key figures involved in the Reformation. Some of these portraits were for private use while some were designed from the outset for public display. By the time he produced this print D\u00fcrer was an accomplished master of engraving.\n\nThis portrait of Desiderius Erasmus (1466-1536), the Dutch theologian and humanist who was famous for his published correspondence, was made in 1526. D\u00fcrer's unusually detailed engraving shows Erasmus writing a letter with a reed pen. The book in the foreground is probably the 'Adagia', his compilation of proverbs reconciling classical and Christian wisdom.  D\u00fcrer met Erasmus three times during a stay in the Netherlands in 1520-21 but did not produce this portrait until some years later, after Erasmus had expressed an interest in obtaining a portrait of himself by the artist. When Erasmus saw the print he complained that it was not a good likeness. However he allowed copies to circulate and probably distributed some as gifts.",

After receiving D\u00fcrer's engravings of Pirckheimer, he repeatedly asked D\u00fcrer to do the same for him. In the end, he wrote to Pirckheimer: 'I wonder how I shall show D\u00fcrer my gratitude, which he deserves eternally. It is not surprising that this picture does not correspond exactly to my appearance. I no longer look the same as five years ago.' The inscription reads: The Likeness of Erasmus of Rotterdam, Done by Albrecht D\u00fcrer from Life [Latin] - His Writings Present a Better Picture of the Man than this Portrait [Greek] /MDXXVI/AD.' The likeness is in all probability based on Erasmus's portrait medal designed by Quentin Massys.\n(From 'The Illustrated Bartsch - Albrecht D\u00fcrer; Volume 10 (Commentary) page 238).\n\nTogether with his portrait of Melanchthon, cat. no.166, which was engraved in the same year, this is the last of D\u00fcrer's printed portraits as well as being the most elaborate. D\u00fcrer met the great humanist Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536) three times during his stay in the Netherlands in 1520-21 (see Conway, pp.98, 102, 114). On these occasions Erasmus had given D\u00fcrer a Spanish 'mantilla' and three portraits while D\u00fcrer had presented Erasmus with a set of the 'Engraved Passions' (cat. nos 116, 215) and had drawn his portrait 'once again' (probably the charcoal portait dated 1520, in the Louvre, Strauss 1520/16, which does not relate to this print). Erasmus expressed his interest in obtaining a portrait from D\u00fcrer in correspondence with Pirckheimer in 1523 and 1525, but several months elapsed before D\u00fcrer produced it. Its formal appearance is emphasized by the two inscriptions on it, one in Latin, 'Portrait of Erasmus of Rotterdam, drawn from life by Albrecht D\u00fcrer', and the other underneath in Greek, which states that the writings of Erasmus will show a better portrait than the print.\n(From 'Albrecht D\u00fcrer and His Legacy - The Graphic Work of a Renaissance Artist' by Giulia Bartram, The British Museum Press, 2002)",
