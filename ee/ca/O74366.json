By the end of his career he had become an important designer of large parks and gardens; around 1900 he set up his own garden design business in Berkswell, Coventry. He often adopted the \u2018S\u2019 shape, a line of beauty thought to be inherent in all successful works of art. This idea had been popularised by the artist William Hogarth (1697-1764), who published a treatise called The Analysis of Beauty in 1753. Miller approached his tasks like a decorative pattern maker, rather than someone working in three dimensions. The garden incorporated parterres, statues, fountains raised on mounds, flower beds and paths, as well as administrative buildings and lavatories.",
