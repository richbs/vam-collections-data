It was often combined with precious metals and usually took the form of relief panels, for book covers, portable altars and caskets. An almost unbroken tradition of ivory carving extends from the Roman and Byzantine empires until the end of the 14th century. From about 1250, Paris became the centre of production for figures and reliefs intended for private devotion. This was originally probably from a book cover.\nThe form of the Christ in Majesty surrounded by the four evangelist symbols derives from prototypes such as the mid-ninth-century Tours Majestas pages, found in the Vivian Bible and other related manuscripts.",
