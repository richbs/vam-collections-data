He was a close friend of the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who was, as Apollinaire's biographer Oliver Bernard points out, 'the first writer to understand what the Cubists were up to'. His illustrations of Apollinaire's collected works, Alcools, were made after Apollinaire's death, a tribute to the memory of his friend. This image illustrates a silent farewell to a beautiful woman, whom the poet never met, but followed through the streets for two hours until she disappeared into a house.",

Forlaget Cordelia, Copenhagen, 1991.\nTimmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Louis Marcoussis (1878-1941)</b> \n\n<i>Romemonde</i>, 1934 \n\nMarcoussis was an inventive exponent of Cubism and his illustrations to <i>Alcools</i> are delivered in a variety of styles with affinities to Surrealism and Symbolism as well.  Such freedom of appropriation was particularly suited to the nature of this work.  <i>Alcools</i> was a collection of verse by Guillaume Apollinaire, who was, as his translator Oliver Bernard points out, 'the first writer to understand what the Cubists were up to'.  Apollinaire's own writing relates to the principles of Cubism in its unconventional construction, and like the Cubists he 'collaged' together fragments of daily life - in his case scraps of conversation or visual and aural experience.  He invented the tern Surrealism and his style anticipates that of some of the Dadaist artists whose concerns lay with undermining cat and bourgeois values.  He was to become one of the most creative writers in Europe before his tragically early death in the influenza epidemic of 1918. \nLouis Marcoussis had come to Paris from Poland in 1903.  Apollinaire, who also had a Polish mother, had persuaded Ludwig Markus, as he then was, to change his name and adopt a more Latin identity, as he himself had done.  They became life-long friends, and Marcoussis's illustrations to <i>Alcools</i> were a kind of posthumous tribute.  Solange Milet, introducing the <i>catalogue raisonn\u00e9</i> of Marcoussis's prints, notes how the friendship emerged through Marcoussis's response to the poems: 'In accordance with the modernity of the vocabulary and the suppression of punctuation in the poems, the plastic artist continued his research and conceived of forms which intensified the sense of the text.  He adopted new ways of organizing the work on the page, resorting to superimposition and harmonic invention.'  <i>Rosemonde</i> records Apollinaire's silent farewell to a beautiful woman whom he had followed for two hours, unseen by her, until she disappeared into a house.  Smaller than life size, the raised palm of the illustration is monument and floating spectre; with the pattern of lips drawn out in the hand's fragile lines of fortune, the vulnerability yet strength of desire is simply but powerfully expressed.\"",
