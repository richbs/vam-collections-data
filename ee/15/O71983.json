He commissioned some of the most brilliant artists of the period. The Histoire Naturelle (Natural History) written by the 18th-century French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, was scientifically obsolete by the 20th century, but had become a classic of French literature with its attempt to codify the natural world, often by means of allegory. Picasso's illustrations follow the spirit of the text: many of them are quirky and humorous and show anthropomorphic tendencies, as in this somewhat vacant-looking ostrich.",
