The fragment of a crucifixion scene is an expression of sympathy for those who died in the revolution in Romania in 1989. The multi-ethnic Transylvanian town Timisoara (in Romanian) or Temesv\u00e1r (in Hungarian), was the flash point for events that resulted in the overthrow of Ceausescu\u2019s communist dictatorship in Romania. The fact that the revolution was a common cause for Romanians and Hungarians is emphasized by the image of a double arm and the two squares in the countries\u2019 national colours. \n\nThe element of Christian iconography is in harmony with the style of the image which imitates the appearance of a woodcut print, a general feature of Orosz\u2019s work. The historicising effect endows the poster with pathos and a strong emotional tone while still observing the principal rule of poster art:  the need to create a simple, immediately recognisable sign. Orosz\u2019s posters were among the most popular graphic designs during the period of political transition in Hungary. At the same time, they were considered works of high artistic quality and collectors\u2019 pieces.",
