Approx 8000 sold by September 1997.  Available with three or five hangers.\n\nAccording to the designer Jonas Lindvall, the coathanger is named after the bellringer, Quasimodo, from Victor Hugo's novel, The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nSix Quasimodo Coathangers were lent by David Design for the display \"... not so simple\" in the Design Now Room of the Twentieth Century Gallery, April to October 1997.  Three were were converted into a permanent gift to the museum.  They were chosen as examples of products by a leading Swedish manufacturer as part of the Furniture & Woodwork's commitment to collecting the best examples of international design for production.\n\nHistorical significance: During the 1990s Swedish design has become increasingly influential.  It draws on the history of  'soft modernism' in Scandinavian design, when designers used wood rather than metal as a principal material (eg Alvar Aalto, Bruno Mathsson, Arne Jacobsen).  A respect for traditional materials and techniques has also endured alongside experimentation with form.  Concern for the environment also explains Swedish designers' economy of expression and respect for materials.\n\nThe design ethos of David Design is typical of many Swedish companies - to produce or sell functional design for everyday use.  The key elements of this are simple, subtle, direct design, quality materials and craftsmanship, function, comfort, and beauty.  Between 1994 and 1998 David Design was part of Swecode, an agency set up to promote the best in contemporary Swedish design to an international market.  Other companies involved in the agency included Asplund and CBI.",
