He first trained with Christian Gottlieb Steinlen (1779-1847) in Vevey and subsequently with Fran\u00e7ois Bonnet (1811-1894) in Lausanne. In Paris in 1845, Bocion entered the atelier of Louis-Aim\u00e9 Grosclaude (1784-1869) and later that of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874) and befriended Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) and other important exponents of the Realist movement. Back in Lausanne in 1849 he became a teacher at the Ecole moyenne et industrielle of Lausane, a position he held until his death. At the same time, he had an extensive output with several travels abroad. He exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Anvers, London and was a founder member of the Swiss society of watercolorists (1884). \n\nThis painting was probably executed shortly after Bocion's return to Lausanne and inaugurates one of the main thematic of the artist: lake views. Bocion focused here on the rendering of twilight, especially in the reflects onto the water surface, in a broad albeit restrained brushwork. The attention on atmospheric effect and the direct observation of nature were characteristic of the Realist movement emerged in France in the 1840s. This painting is a fine example of his oeuvre characterised by peaceful scenes dominated by imposing mountains in the distance.",

Grosclaude in Paris. From 1849 he lived in Lausanne. He painted historical subjects in his early years, but subsequently concentrated almost exclusively on landscapes, in particular views of Lake Geneva. \nThere are sixteen paintings by Bocion in the bequest of the Rev. C. H. Townshend, who was in the habit of spending the winter in Lausanne. \n\n24 \nSTEAMER ON LAKE GENEVA; EVENING EFFECT \nSigned lower right <i>F.

Among the portfolios of watercolours, etchings and engravings were thirteen [Gustave] Le Gray seascapes, along with three landscape views. The bequest included a seascape painted by Fran\u00e7ois Bocion, a Swiss artist whom Townshend had known for some years. Bocion's <i>Steamer on Lake Geneva: Evening Effect</i> (fig.119) is a fine observation of twilight in keeping with the work by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, whose influence Bocion acknowledged. The title, too, was indebted to Corot, on whose paintings the term 'effect' designated a time of day. \n\nThe work bears a significant resemblance to Le Gray's seascape of a steamer.... a print of which is included in the Townshend bequest [67:995]. The proportions of the composition are uncannily similar. ",

Steamer on Lake Geneva: Evening Effect. By F. Bocion. Signed. Swiss. 1863'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is one of a group of 16 paintings bequeathed to the museum by the Rev. Townshend who had a villa in Lausanne where he spent the winter. \nIt is a fine example of the central thematic of lake views in Bocion\u2019s oeuvre. Executed a decade after his return to Lausanne from Paris, this painting witnesses the development of Bocion\u2019s personal stile following the primary influence of the Realist painters such as Courbet and Leon Berthoud.\n This lake view has been identified as the Lake Leman near Geneva in Switzerland. Particularly interesting here is the horizontal format and the boats depicted in the distance, which marks a difference with previous composition focusing on group of figures on boats in the foreground.\nHere particularly interesting is the palette composed of hues of blue and purple enlivened by a stripe of golden orange in the sky reflecting on the water surface. \nComparable compositions include: Comparable compositions include: <i>Storm on the Leman, Waves Effects</i> and <i>Lake Leman at Twilight, Pointe d\u2019Yvoire </i>, both in Private collection, Lausanne.\nThis painting was probably bought by the Rev. Townshend directly from the artist and displayed in his villa in Lausanne where it completed there a large collection of 19th-century landscapes paintings. The Victoria and Albert Museum owns the most comprehensive group of Bocion\u2019s paintings in the U.K.",
