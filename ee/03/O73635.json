The colouring is predominantly black with orangey brown underneath the body, on the lower face, on the bottom ends of the two front legs and on the front of the back legs. There are darker brown markings on these parts around the eyes and on the chest as well as spots on the face. The nose is vertically stitched with black thread and the eyes are black boot buttons. The mouth is a long stitched black inverted V-shape and the ears are lined with black cotton. There is a long black stiff tail, slightly bent. The extremities of the legs are bent to form feet. All are bent forward except the right front one which is bent outwards. The back legs are also bent in a fashion to suggest that a sitting down position is dictated. There is a brown leather collar with a metal buckle around the dog's neck. The trademark button in the ear is missing but its former position in the left ear is clearly marked by two holes in the lining. The stuffing is woodwool.",
