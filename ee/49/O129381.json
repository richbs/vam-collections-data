Vessels of this type were made in the eastern Mediterranean between the 6th and 9th centuries. They were widely exported and a similar flagon has been excavated from a princely burial in an Anglo-Saxon cemetery in Prittlewell, south-east Essex. \n\nThe Anglo-Saxons believed the dead would need their belongings in their next life. Feasting and drinking was central to Anglo Saxon culture, especially drinking. Cauldrons, buckets, bowls, glass jars, drinking horns, cups and beakers, frequently occur in the graves of high status individuals; all suggesting the hospitality and feasting in the great hall described in Beowulf, one of the earliest poems in the English language,.",

The work was part of a proposed road improvement on the site of a known Anglo-Saxon cemetery. The archaeologists discovered a burial that was a rare example of a princely burial of the 7th century AD. Four copper alloy  vessels were found hanging on iron hooks on the chamber wall. They included a Byzantine flagon very similar to the present example.\n\nSuch flagons were cast in a mould, shouldered with a slightly convex base and a lid that is secured to the ornate handle by means of a chain. The handle was made separately and is atttached to the neck by a plain band and to the body by a second band, the central part of which has three embossed medallions of figures, possibly saints, on horses facing to the left. Vessels of this type were made in the eastern Mediterranean between the 6th and 9th centuries. They were widely exported but the Prittlewell flagon was the first example to be found in an archaeological context in England.\n\nThe notes and findings of a study morning held at the British Museum on 13/12/2012, at which four ewers were compared, are filed in the ewer object file in Metalwork Conservation. Electronic copies of notes and images for the morning filed on the Metalwork Section S:/ drive in a folder 'Prittelwell ewer M.434-1910. (KK, 21/02/2013).",
