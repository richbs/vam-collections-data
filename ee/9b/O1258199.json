It was taken by Keith Macmillan at Bowie\u2019s flat in Beckenham, \u2018Haddon Hall\u2019.  The styling of the scene was arguably influenced by the set dressing in Performance (1968), which starred Mick Jagger.  This cover was only used on the UK release -  the American record label refused to issue such a controversial image and instead used a cartoon cover, showing a John Wayne style cowboy with a gun.  Bowie wore such a man-dress on his first tour to the USA in 1971, provoking a range of strong reactions.",
