            "public_access_description": "Straw marquetry was known as early as the 17th century, but it was most popular in the period 1780\u20131830 in France and Britain. The straw was split and flattened, then glued into place on thin paper on which the design had been drawn. This was then glued to a wooden carcase, which was usually covered first with a thicker paper. The maker could divide the straw into two, four or more strips, depending on the fineness needed for the design. Colour could be added to the surface with various varnishes, which also enhanced the glossy appearance of the marquetry. Straw marquetry was most suitable for small objects such as tea chests or work boxes but occasionally larger pieces of furniture were decorated in this way. Because straw work is very fragile, it is rare for pieces to survive in good condition. \n\nThis box is an ambitious piece, with a large-scale view of Paris on the lid and illustrations of the Fables of the French 17th-century poet Jean de la Fontaine on the lids of the small inner compartments.",
