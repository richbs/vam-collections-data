The name has stuck and <i>cartes</i>are the most plentiful surviving form of 19th century photograph.  The most stylish master of this mass-produced imagery was Silvy (see also Mus. no 68, 012) and this example is from his famous series <i>The Beauties of England</i> (a photographic continuation of a genre earlier established in engravings).  The craze for <i>carte</i> collecting began about 1860.  Despite the name these pictures were not used as visiting cards but they were exchanged among friends and assembled into albums. ",
