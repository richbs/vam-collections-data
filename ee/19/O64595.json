It is not known which house they were originally intended for, but they relate closely to a set of similar panels painted in 1696 for a house in Botolph Lane, London.\n\nPeople\nVery little is known about the painter and printmaker Robert Robinson and not much of his work survives, apart from the two sets of panels. The panels' dramatic quality may be attributable to Robinson's work as a scene painter for the theatre.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThroughout the 17th century goods from East Asia were highly fashionable. However, these painted panels are one of the earliest manifestations of Chinoiserie. The term denotes purely decorative fantasies produced by European artists and based roughly on East Asian themes, as opposed to imitation of true Chinese forms in such techniques as lacquer work. In these panels all manner of whimsical grotesques are mingled with reminiscences of Chinese, Tartar, and Indian themes.",

Various sizes</i>                       P.6-16-1954 \n\n<i>Note:</i> These panels were Lot 131 at Christie's, 30 April 1954 (anonymous sale).  See 'An English Painter of Chinoiseries' by Edward Croft-Murray, in <i>Country Life Annual</i>, 1955 (pp.174-9), where seven of them are reproduced.  The original provenance is not known, but some indication of the identity of the person for whom they were executed may be had from the fact that shields of arms and banners of the families of Nourse of Woodeaton, Oxfordshire, and of Skelton of Cumberland, occur in two of the panels.  See also Croft-Murray, <i>Decorative Painting in England</i>, vol.1, 1962, pp.224-5, No.6.\"",

            "history_note": "According to Croft-Murray [q.v.] this panel contains the arms of Nourse of Woodeaton, Oxon. This indicates that the set of panels may have been commissioned by that family, perhaps on the occasion of a marriage with a member of the family of Skelton of Cumberland,  whose arms are on a similar panel in the set. [P.15-1954]. The arms of Nourse are: Gules, a fess between two chevrons or, (in fact, these should be argent). Crest: An arm embowed vested azure, cuffed argent holding in the right hand ppr. a snake of the last environed round the arm. Research has not so far identified a marriage date or the location of the house in which these panels were installed for certain, but a letter from Nevill Aldrich-Blake records that the Nourse family of Woodeaton occupied a house, Weston Hall, Ross on Wye,  from c1550-c1780.",

            "historical_context_note": "It is not known which house this set of panels was originally intended for, but they relate closely to a set of similar panels, which were painted in 1696 for a house at 5 Botolph Lane, in the City of London and removed to Sir John Cass's Foundation Primary School, Aldgate, London, in 1906. Very little is known about the painter Robert Robinson and not much of his work survives, apart from these two sets of panels. Robinson's work anticipates the mania for Chinoiserie in England by 30 years or more. The Botolph Lane panels are a mixture of Chinese and Peruvian scenes, whereas the set now in the Museum is mainly Chinese in inspiration. Throughout the 17th century goods from the Far East were highly fashionable. However, these painted panels are one of the earliest manifestations of chinoiserie, i.e. purely decorative fantasies by European artists, based roughly upon Far Eastern themes, as opposed to imitation of true Chinese forms such as lacquer work. In the V&A panels all kinds of whimsical grotesques are mingled with reminiscences of Chinese, Tartar, and Indian themes.",
