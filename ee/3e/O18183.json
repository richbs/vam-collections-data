The royal family are shown seated within the larger pavilion to the left in conversation with two British officers. This central group is surrounded by Burmese ministers and groups of Indian and Sikh soldiers.\nThe second scene shows the royal family departing from the palace in covered bullock carts distinguished with the white umbrellas of Burmese royalty - perhaps Supayalat's mother and the royal children in the first followed by Supayalat and Thibaw in the second. They are accompanied by troops of English and Indian militia - some on horseback. \nIn the background at the top of the picture one sees the Irrawaddy and two paddle steamships - waiting to take the royal family on the first part of their voyage to exile in India. In the far distance, beyond the river scene, (at the top of the picture) one sees the white pagodas of Sagaing.",

They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars. Schools of Company painting never really developed in the other areas of South and South-East Asia that came under British influence, but occasionally a British officer might commission a local artist to make drawings especially for him. \n\nThis is an example of a Company-style painting from Burma (Myanmar), painted, unusually, on cloth rather than paper. It depicts the departure of King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat from Mandalay at the end of the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885. In the background, the king is shown seated with ladies in a pavilion - possibly the Lily Throne Room of the Mandalay Palace - within a fenced compound; British soldiers are ranged on either side. In the distance is a river with paddle steamers, the far bank of which is wooded, with many temples. In the foreground are two bullock carriages with the king and members of the royal family setting out on their way into exile in India.",
