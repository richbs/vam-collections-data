In the second part of the book, Mr. Great-heart tells the pilgrims that the water from the spring may be put into a vessel 'that is sweet and good, for then the Dirt will sink to the bottom, and the Water come out by itself more clear. Thus therefore Christiana and her companions were compelled to do. They took it up, and put it into an Earthen-pot, and so let it stand till the Dirt was gone to the bottom, and then they drank thereof'.",
