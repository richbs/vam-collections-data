Crinolettes, or half-crinolines, marked the mid-point between the cage crinoline and the bustle. They were often made with extra loops of steel, which acted as a bustle. \n\nSome crinolettes were laced like a corset. This lacing, combined with the tying of internal tapes, enabled the shape of the bustle and the width of petticoat to be adjusted. Gaps in the tape made it possible to remove some of the steels when washing the petticoat.",
