Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nThese anklets are typical of those worn in the cities of Kairouan and Sfax.  They are similar in size and design to the heavy solid silver anklets worn in the countryside, but these are hollow, and there is a closed rectangular box where the terminals of traditional penannular anklets would have been, showing that they were made for urban use.  The name menfukh means full of air.  The custom of wearing anklets, which was common throughout the Maghreb region, is probably African in origin.",
