Both tree and base have a green ground with gold metal thread patterns.  The base has a few scrolling leaves and the tree contains a scrolling floral composition based on a vertical stem. The tree is edged with serrated leaves and terminates in a lotus like flower.  The ground of the arch/niche is a small ogival lattice in gold metal on a red ground each compartment containing a rosette.  The lobed outline of the arch is formed by a wide band of gold metal thread; it also terminates in a large lotus like flower.  There is a pair of confronting male tigers at the base of the cypress tree. The spandrels have a green ground with a small ogival lattice pattern in gold metal thread, each compartment contains a 4-petalled flower head.  There is a large red roundel in each corner containing a large rosette. There are 6 borders.  From the inside:\n[1] down both sides and along the top: half an architectural column supporting the lobed arch in gold metal thread with red details.  Above the capital and across the top is an abstract pattern resembling quotation marks in gold metal thread on a red ground.\n[2] undecorated gold metal thread\n[3] a chevron pattern: orange ground with silver metal alternating spots with a floral pattern.  In the centre of the upper part of this border is a rectangular panel with a woven inscription.
