He is heavily bejewelled and holds a large, facetted emerald surrounded by pearls in his left hand and the hilt of his sword in his right hand. The portrait is mounted onto an album page of probably contemporary date, decorated with gold flowering plants on an indigo ground. The signature of the artist is in gold beneath Shah Jahan's feet; the signature  of the illuminator is repeated twice, hidden amongst the gold designs. The album page has been cut down from its original size, as shown by the truncated plants at the edges.",

The portrait depicts Shah Jahan, a renowned connoisseur of precious stones, wearing necklaces, bracelets, armlets and turban jewels made of very large pearls, spinels and emeralds. He holds a huge, facetted emerald in his left hand. The artist has signed his name and family connections in minute gold script beneath Shah Jahan's feet, with the addition that the painting was completed in the first (regnal) year, corresponding to 1628-1629.\nThe border of gold flowers on an indigo ground is signed in three places by the gilder, Harif, about whom nothing is known.",
