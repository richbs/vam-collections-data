This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread. According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass. The bowls of silver chalices are usually gilded inside, to emphasize the precious nature of their contents and to protect the metal.\n\nThe lively, secular ornament on this piece was typical for the period when Spanish goldsmiths were hugely influenced by Mannerist ornament prints, especially those printed in Antwerp in the southern Netherlands. Here, masks, mythical beasts and vases decorate the base while flowers and monsters ornament the stem. Mannerist silver is characterised by complexity of design, virtuosity of execution and the profuse use of surface decoration. \n\nOn either side of the foot are two embossed heraldic shields. One shows a variant of the emblem of the religious Dominican Order, while the other depicts the arms of the Castaneda family below a kneeling figure in a nun's habit flanked by trees. The Castenada family may have donated the chalice to a church belonging to the Order.",
