This hanging silk tassel has three parts with a skirt and hanging cord of twisted wool. The main part of the tassel is in coloured silk with decorative stripes of silk gimp (fine braid). \n\nAlthough it was always used in the home of the wealthy, passementerie (the name given to all types of curtain and furnishing decoration, for example fringes, braids and tassels) became very popular in 19th century Britain. British consumers  followed the trend for French interior design, particularly the fashion for heavily stuffed upholstered chairs with lots of decorative trimming. Tassels such as this example would have been expensive to buy and were used only in upper-middle-class homes.",
