Such linen, which was sometimes described as 'holland', or 'cambric', after the town of Cambrai, France, one of the original centres of production, was imported from The Netherlands, Flanders (now Belgium) and northern France. Most people would have had bed linen made from locally-grown, spun and bleached flax or hemp, however. Different parts of the plants produced fibres of differing quality, giving a range of sheeting from fine to very coarse and rough.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis pillowcase is made up from a rectangle of linen folded in half, with the selvedge (side edge of the fabric) at the open end making neat finished edges. The seams are decorated with narrow insertions of bobbin lace and whitework embroidery.",
