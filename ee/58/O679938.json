Bogue, 86 Fleet Street</i>\nSigned in pencil, gone over in ink <i>First proof. colored as a pattern by George Cruikshank</i>\nEtching coloured by hand.\n17 X 43cm\n9712.2\nCruikshank Collection\nGiven by Mrs Elizabeth Cruikshank.\n\nThe Cruikshank Collection, consisting of more than four thousand items, came to the V&amp;A by gift and bequest from the artist's widow.  At an early stage in the negotiations, a museum official, R. Soden Smith, wrote in a memo to the then Director concerning the collection: 'a large number of the pieces composing it differ in one important point from other impressions of the plates in having been signed by the artist at Mrs George Cruikshank's request'.<sup>1</sup>\nHere for once is concrete evidence of the printmaker laying down the type of colouring he wanted on his print.  It marks a reversal in the balance of power between publisher and printmaker from the 1814 Cruikshank caricature, when the publisher had his standard colouring applied to the image without reference to the artist. \nThe colouring here is pale and is present only on a small proportion of the image.  Patterns for the colourist to work from, done by the artist, would be adjusted in line with his or her particular subject matter.  The delicate, pretty quality of the colouring acts as further sardonic comment on the discrepancy Cruikshank perceives between apparent female docility and woman's actual ruthlessness.\n\n1.
