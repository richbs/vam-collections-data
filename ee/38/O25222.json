As attacks by the U-boats increased, grain provisions dwindled alarmingly.\n\nThrough the slogan, and a telling juxtaposition of imagery, the secure domesticity of the family at breakfast - with mother slicing the precious loaf of bread - is shown to be dependent on the heroic efforts of the Merchant Navy and the country's ship-building programme. Although strongly idealised, especially the Gibson-girl-like mother, the breakfast scene is intended to represent a working class household.\n\n[Margaret Timmers, 'British Design at Home', p.104]",
