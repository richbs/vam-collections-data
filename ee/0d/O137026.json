            "public_access_description": "Phyllis Ginger studied at the Richmond School of Art between 1932 and 1935. Although her main ambition was to work in illustration, she was encouraged during her studies to also follow her interests in etching and portraiture. She exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1938 and was elected to the Royal Watercolour society in 1952. In 1939 Phyllis Ginger's skill as a topographical artist led to her involvement in the Pilgrim's Trust scheme Recording Britain, which invited artists to visit particular places and make their own choice of scenes to depict that may be destroyed by enemy action.\n\nThis watercolour demonstrates Ginger's ability as a topographical artist. The location has not been identified however it seems likely from the style of the architecture that it is of a house in the Bath area. The artist lived in Saltford, near Bath from 1944 until 1946 and drew inspiration from these surroundings for a number of her works. The house has been centrally placed between trees on a ridge of a landscaped garden. Brief pen marks have made an outline which the artist has then developed with washes of watercolour to effectively convey the different textures of the trees or the dark clouds over the house.\n\nPhyllis Ginger was working in watercolour during this period for works in the Recording Britain series. This watercolour does not relate to any in the Recording Britain series. However it demonstrates Ginger's perception of her capturing surrounding scenes in the 1940s.",
