A curious feature of the design is that the heads of the figures from the story of the Prodigal Son were all moulded separately from the rest of the figures and were applied after casting: they are slightly too large for their bodies.\n\nThe inner bands of decoration consist of half-figures of women with stags and fruit, symbols of plenty, and masks framed in tightly curled strapwork. The central boss is circular Limoges enamel plaque from around 1540 depicting a warrior cherub.\n\nThere is a repair to the pewter in the upper right hand section of the middle band, clearly visible from the reverse, and of considerably poorer quality than the original on the front.",

            "public_access_description": "This dish is one of the highlights of the V&A's pewter collection. It is a fine example of Edelzinn, literally \u2018precious pewter\u2019, which was produced in France and Germany during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries primarily for display. This dish dates from around 1580 and was possibly cast using a mould made by Francois Briot, a celebrated medallist and die-cutter.\n\nThe dish was probably designed to decorate the buffet of a prince or of a civic body such as a town guild. Contemporary illustrations show that buffets could be enormous, multi-tiered structures supporting rich displays of gold, silver, mounted exotic shells and colourful stones, and other items from their treasuries. \n\nBy the late 16th century, most fashionable patrons favoured fantastical Mannerist pieces for their displays. Mannerism was a courtly style based around the idea of difficult\u00e0: complex design, virtuoso craftsmanship and decoration infused with intellectual references. The outer rim of this dish depicts the story of the Prodigal son, one of the most frequently represented parables in the history of art, and one used to preach the virtues of repentance and forgiveness. In the parable, a man divides his wealth between his two sons, one of whom departs and wastes his fortune on riotous living and is reduced to tending a farmer's pigs. On returning home full of remorse his father forgives him, dresses him in fine clothes and kills a calf to make a feast, pacifying the other brother with the words: \"Your brother here was dead and has come back to life, was lost and is found.\"\n\nThe central plaque is of Limoges enamel and has been attributed on stylistic grounds to Couly II Nouailher (also known as Colin, also known as Noylier) whose first signed and dated work is from 1539. Limoges in central France is a town with a long tradition of enamelling. During the sixteenth century, there were a number of families well-known as highly-accomplished practitioners of this art. Limoges painted enamels were luxury items for the wealthy middle and upper classes.",

            "history_note": "This dish dates from around 1580-90 and was possibly cast using a mould made by Francois Briot, the celebrated medallist and die-cutter. Its provenance until the 19th century is not known. The dish was one of the Museum's early purchases. It was bought at the Bernal Sale in 1855, an enormous collection of metalwork, glass, ceramics and miniatures belonging to Ralph Bernal, a lawyer and MP. The sale by Christie, Manson and Woods took 32 days during which 4294 lots fetched nearly \u00a371,000. The Museum bought 730 lots including this dish for which it paid \u00a319.19s.\n\nThis dish be seen as one of those objects which heralded a change in direction in the Museum's collecting activities after the appointment of John Charles Robinson as Curator in 1853. Robinson was a prolific collector and persuaded the Museum's first director, Henry Cole, that historic works of art were as instructive to students as 'modern manufactures'. Under Robinson's guidance, some of the earliest purchases by the Museum included outstanding examples of European pewter.\n\nHistorical significance: This dish is one of the highlights of the V&A's pewter collection. It is a fine example of <i>Edelzinn</i>, literally \u2018precious pewter\u2019, which was produced in France and Germany during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Made for display, Edelzinn incorporates intricate relief panels partly designed to emulate embossed silver. An important difference between silver and pewter, however, is that pewter is cast and therefore depends on the production of expensive moulds, which in turn means that it was generally produced in multiples rather than as unique pieces. As edelzinn was designed for display it tends to survive in excellent condition.\n\nAlthough the dish is not signed it relates to the work of Francois Briot, the most celebrated member of a French family of medallists and die-cutters. Briot was court engraver to John Frederick of W\u00fcrtemberg from 1586. He has subsequently been described as \"the Raphael or Cellini of pewterers\".  He was in fact a model carver, medallist and pattern-maker rather than a pewterer, creating copper moulds in which pewter was cast. It is for these dishes (see also Mus. No. 2063-1855) and for similar ewers (see Mus. No. 4289-1857), that Briot is best known.", 
            "place": "France", 
            "production_note": "The modelling of this dish can be attributed tentatively to Fran\u00e7ois Briot (ca.1550- ca.1616) or someone closely influenced by his work. Born in Damblain in Lorraine, he was famous in his lifetime as a maker of <i>Edelzinn</i>, or high relief display pewter, although only one of his works, the Temperantia dish (see 2063-1855), is known to be signed.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The dish was probably designed to decorate the buffet of a prince or of a civic body such as a town guild. Contemporary illustrations show that buffets could be enormous, multi-tiered structures supporting rich displays of gold, silver, mounted exotic shells and colourful stones, and other items from princely treasuries. \n\nBy the late 16th century, most fashionable patrons favoured fantastical Mannerist pieces for their displays. Mannerism was a courtly style based around the idea of <i>difficult\u00e0</i>: complex design, virtuoso craftsmanship and decoration infused with intellectual references.\n\nThe surface of this dish is decorated with cast designs in relief. The outer rim depicts the story of the Prodigal son, one of the most frequently represented parables in the history of art, and one used to preach the virtues of repentance and forgiveness. In the parable, a man divides his wealth between his two sons, one of whom departs and wastes his fortune on riotous living and is reduced to tending a farmer's pigs. On returning home full of remorse his father forgives him, dresses him in fine clothes and kills a calf to make a feast, pacifying the other brother with the words: \"Your brother here was dead and has come back to life, was lost and is found.\"\n\nThe scenes on the dish, each separated by human and lion masks, show:\n<i>Upper right:</i> The son departing, well-dressed and on a fine horse, with his brother accompanying him on foot;\n<i>Centre right:</i> The son feasting with women at a table, being attended to by servants and with musicians playing in the background;\n<i>Lower right:</i> The son feasting less lavishly and then being chased away by the women when his money has run out;\n<i>Lower left:</i> The son milking a cow with a barn in the background and pigs feeding on the foreground, and then kneeling in prayer and asking for forgiveness;\n<i>Middle and upper left:</i> The son returns to his father, kneels before him and is embraced and then is fed at a table in a plain Romanesque loggia.\n\nThe central plaque is of <i>Limoges enamel</i> and has been attributed on stylistic grounds to Couly II Nouailher (also known as Colin, also known as Noylier) whose first signed and dated work is from 1539. Nouailher made a number of plaques for caskets, many featuring children painted in grisaille on a deep blue background. His last signed work is from 1545 but he is still described in archives as an enameller as late as 1574. He was part of a dynasty of enamellers in Limoges first mentioned in 1503 and still going in the 19th century.\n\nLimoges in central France is a town with a long tradition of enamelling. During the sixteenth century, there were a number of families well-known as highly-accomplished practitioners of this art.  Limoges painted enamels were luxury items for the wealthy middle and upper classes.\n\nElaborate French and German buffet dishes of the 1580s, including this example, show pewter mould-making and casting at its most skilled. Pewter is an alloy or mixture of metals consisting primarily of tin. Adding metals such as copper and antimony makes pewter harder and more durable. The best alloys contain over 90% tin. Before 1800 lead was allowed in \u2018lay metal\u2019, a lower-quality alloy used for measures and boxes. Soft lead made casting easier, but was poisonous, so it was forbidden in \u2018flatware\u2019 such as plates, dishes and porringers. Tests do reveal small amounts of up to 2%. Modern pewter contains no lead. Pewter\u2019s low melting point makes it suitable for casting, though early casting moulds were expensive.",
