Educated at Eton and Cambridge. Took holy orders, but ill health prevented him following a clerical career. Encouraged by Robert Southey, published poems 1821, and other volumes of verse; also travel books and tracts on mesmerism. Amateur painter and draughtsman, travelled abroad and lived in Lausanne in later years. Best known as a collector, he left his precious stones, coins, cameos, paintings and drawings to the museum. He was characterised as Mr Fairlie, the fastidious connoisseur, in Wilkie Collins's novel The Woman in White (1860).
