The compartments depict a woman committing adultery in view of her husband inscribed: 'How can a young woman bully an old man Another makes the baby and I like a mother rock the cradle?'; a loveless marriage inscribed: 'I have an old husband who gives me no pleasure, but Venus manages the business so that I have no reason to complain'; and a false bottom which shows a happy family with the inscription: 'One finds nothing so sweet in fidelity as love between a man and a wife'.",
