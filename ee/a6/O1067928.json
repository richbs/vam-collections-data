No. 57 but smaller; also made for the miniature in 1934 by F Jennings of Ward our Street.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Sotheby's 20 December 1933, lot 154, bt for the Museum with Cat. No. 57 [P.35-1933] as a pair.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Accessions</i> 1933, p. 62; V&A, <i>Review of the Principal Acquisitions</i>, 1933, p. 22, pl, 14b; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9.  \n \nAlthough the condition of this miniature makes assessment of stylistic detail difficult, Long's attribution following that of Cat. No. 57 [P.35-1933] seems acceptable. The identification of the sitter as Christine von Erbach (1596-1646), the wife of William, Count of Nassau, was presumably dreamt up when the miniatures went through the trade and were framed in the 1930s. It rests on nothing other than the supposed status of the miniatures as a pair, which they clearly are not. The obvious differences between them - size, shape and scale of representation of the figures - argue strongly against it. The woman may have belonged to the same social milieu as the Count, and she was probably also painted by Alexander Cooper (probably, on costume, somewhat later), but there the relationship seems to end.\"",
