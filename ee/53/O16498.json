First exhibited at Royal Institution, Manchester, 1851; his address in the SBA catalogue 1854 was the School of Art, Warrington. Exhibited 31 works at the RA between 1858 and 1890, 10 at the BI 1861-67, 14 (including three watercolours) at the SBA 1854-81/2, and 17 elsewhere. Subjects principally genre and landscape. His 1862 'Ordered on Foreign Service' (RA 1864) was engraved by CA Tomkins 1865; that, and his etching of his 1868 project for the Royal Horticultural Society's buildings, are in the V&A collections. Taught at the Government School of Design, South Kensington, from before 1866 to 1875; elected Member of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts 1881. Ruskin found his 'Sunday Afternoon' (RA 1875) 'extremely delightful'. He does not seem to have been related to the Pre-Raphaelite painter James Collinson. \n\nLIT: \tH Ottley <i>A Biographical and Critical Dictionary</i> 1866; J Ruskin <i>Academy Notes</i> 1875 Cook and Wedderburn 14, 1904 \n\n<b>Stray Rabbits</b> \n9100-1863 Negs X2131, HG1883 \nMillboard, 38.1 x 48.2 cm (15 x 19 ins) \nSigned and dated 'Rob'.

It was not noticed by the <i>Art Journal</i> and <i>Athenaeum</i> critics.
