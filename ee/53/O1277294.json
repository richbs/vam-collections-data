He started his career at Lachasse and opened his salon \u2018Michael\u2019 in Carlos Place in 1953.  Michael\u2019s sculptural traditional tailoring with a twist, much admired by French couturiers, earned him the reputation for being \u2018the Balenciaga of London\u2019. In the 1960s his influence extended to the high street when he became an adviser to Marks &amp; Spencer and worked to improve the cut and cloth used for mass manufactured clothes.\n\nThis bespoke skirt and jacket ensemble is a  good example of Michael Donellan\u2019s sculptural tailoring and shows the influence of Dior\u2019s 'New Look' in the flared hips and nipped-in waist of the jacket. The shoulders of the jacket are more square than sloping suggesting that this dates to the early 1950s when the shoulder pads popular in the 1940s were still influencial.  The double breasted button detail at the waist is a signature of Michael\u2019s designs and can be seen in a later jacket and skirt in the collection T.52:1&amp;2-1997",
