The elements of the chair are cut from MDF (medium density fibreboard), a ubiquitous modern construction material, using a laser cutter.  The cutter is controlled by computer, ensuring a perfect reproduction of the design with each chair. However, the decoration derives from a simple paper cut, made by folding and snipping a piece of paper, and the laser faithfully reproduces the flaws and inaccuracies of the design, diminishing the technological character of the chair and suggesting hand craftsmanship.  Furthermore, the decoration consciously evokes vernacular or folk design in a bid to reconnect with tradition and history, even though the chair is made using modern means and materials. The laser beam scorches the MDF as it cuts it, but Ineke Hans has chosed self-coloured black MDF for the chair to disguise this. The chair is produced in batches by the designer.",
