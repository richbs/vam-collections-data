The object was formerly in the Soulages Collection, together with a companion piece of the Nativity, and appears to be part of a disassembled predella from an altarpiece. The composition was followed by Andrea della Robbia in the predellas of two altarpieces, in the Museo Civio at Montepulciano (1484) and in San Bernardino at L'Aquila, and was modified in another in Santa Maria degli Angeli at Assisi.\n\nThe Della Robbia family was an Italian family of sculptors and potters. They were active in Florence from the early 15th century and elsewhere in Italy and France well into the 16th. Family members were traditionally employed in the textile industry, and their name derives from rubia tinctorum, a red dye. Luca della Robbia founded the family sculpture workshop in Florence and was regarded by contemporaries as a leading artistic innovator, comparable to Donatello and Masaccio. The influence of antique art and his characteristic liveliness and charm are evident in such works as the marble singing-gallery for Florence Cathedral. He is credited with the invention of the tin-glazed terracotta sculpture for which the family became well known.",
