Dove and Co. of  Leeds in the mid-19th century and has a pattern of stars and crosses inspired by jewellery motifs.\n\nThe carpet industry flourished between 1830 and 1850 due to technical innovations which provided looms to weave numerous variations of floor coverings with Kidderminster, Wilton, Axminster and Kilmarnock all centres of production.",
