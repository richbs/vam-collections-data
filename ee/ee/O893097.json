They have no real equivalent in the West but they were contemptuous of Muslim or any other orthodoxy, they ate and drank in Ramazan, and were loosely described as free-thinkers. They appear to have considered that they had reached such a pitch of spiritual development that the constraints of harsh dogma no longer applied to them. Books of humorous stories, about Bektashis happily confounding the bigots, are still published in Turkey today. Naturally, the orthodox regarded them as drunken rogues and Preziosi perhaps reflects this opinion in his mischievous portrait of the old man.",
