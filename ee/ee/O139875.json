Now little known, Skidmore was once famous as the maker of the Albert Memorial (1863-1876) and the Hereford Screen (which was exhibited in London at the International Exhibition of 1862). Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) designed both the memorial and the screen and employed Skidmore to execute them. This design is a highly finished presentation drawing to be shown to the client.  \n\nSkidmore was interested in the new gas lighting and there are numerous designs for gas lighting brackets and gaseliers in the collection at the V&A. The Corporation of Coventry approved a scheme for gas lighting in St. Mary's Guildhall and Skidmore produced gas brackets along the walls and gaseliers hanging from the ceiling. The gas brackets are later reproductions and the gaseliers have been removed. Skidmore provided gas lighting for St. Michael's Church, Coventry, (destroyed by German bombs in the second world war). In addition, he provided gas standards and brackets for Holy Trinity Church in 1856 which are still extant. Neither St. Mary's Guildhall nor Holy Trinity had or have a gaselier like this one.",
