            "history_note": "Frederick Leyland, a steamship owner and collector, being keen to display his collection of blue and white porcelain, engaged the architect and designer Thomas Jeckyll in 1876 to line his dining room with shelves in the Anglo-Japanese taste, backed by seventeenth century embossed and gilded leather. Over the fireplace, with its Jeckyll sunflower fire dogs, hung J. M. Whistler's 'La Princesse du Pays de Porcelaine'(1863-4). Whistler considered the colour scheme to be unsympathetic to his painting and in 1876 and 1877 he was allowed to 'touch-up' the leather. In Leyland's absence Whistler completely repainted the room with peacock motifs in the Japanese taste, naming it, like a painting, 'Harmony in blue and gold: The Peacock Room'. The room, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington DC, became famous both as the ultimate expression of the Aesthetic Movement and for the quarrel it caused between patron and artist.\n[Stephen Astley, British Design at Home, p.68]",
