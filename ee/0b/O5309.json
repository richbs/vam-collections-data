Contemporary wine bottles were almost black and were no asset to the dining table, unless sealed with the owner's crest or name,  whereas a crystal glass decanter or jug showed off the colour of the wine to advantage. These early decanters were without ground stoppers, as they were intended only for serving wine, not for storing it.\n\nDesign & Designing\nLacking prototypes that would suit the heavy viscous glass perfected by George Ravenscroft in the 1670s, London glassmakers turned to jugs of Continental faience (tin-glazed earthenware) for their inspiration. This example follows that form, but with the deep mould-blown ribbing so characteristic of glass of the period, and the addition of a reinforcing ring around the foot and a decorative frilled collar around the neck. The flaring hollowed top of the neck has been copied from faience wine jugs, which normally had hinged pewter lids: this glass decanter would have had a loose-fitting hollow stopper, designed to rest in the top of neck.",
