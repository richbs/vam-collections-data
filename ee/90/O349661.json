This monument comes from the demolished church of St Denis, Faxton, Northamptonshire. Although this monument is signed by John Bacon the Younger it is more likely to be the work of Charles Manning, with whom Bacon was in partnership from 1808.\n\nJohn Bacon the Younger (1777-1859) was a sculptor, and specialised in tombs using coloured marbles.\nSon of John Bacon, he was his father\u2019s true heir: he had won both silver and gold medals at the Academy by the age of twenty. However, he was never elected ARA, probably because of his unusual business practices. In 1808 he went into partnership with Charles Manning (1776\u20131812) to whom he entrusted the design and execution of the majority of commissions while retaining the family name on the work. Manning\u2019s brother Samuel (1788\u20131842) succeeded him, the business continuing its extensive production of monuments with Bacon as \u2018sleeping partner\u2019 until 1843.",

Given by the Rector and Churchwardens of Lamport with Faxton, Northants, in 1965 together with cat. nos. 17, 62 and 126.\n\nHistorical significance: The hamlet of Faxton, is an abandoned village and chapelry in the county of Northamptonshire in England in a remote position two miles to the north-east of Lamport. In the Domesday Book it was a village of thirty-two families. By 1801 the total population was 54. By 1841 it had risen to 108 but by 1921 it was 37. No one lives in the village now. in 1939 services in the church came to an end. Eventually lead was stripped from the roof and in 1958 it was demolished as a 'dangerous structure'. The wall monuments were removed in pieces to the stables of Lamport rectory. In 1965, the Museum agreed to accept the monuments in the rectory stables as a gift. By then they were in poor condition and the reassembly of the monument was laborious and complex. \nThree memorials in Faxton church have not come to the Museum. A plain slabe to Elizabeth Framwell, who died in 1781, has been included in the paving round the base of the column that marks the site of Faxton church. Another simple slab to Susanna Danvers, who died in 1730, daughter of Sir Edward Nicolls, second baronet, has disappeared, although it was photographed by the National Buildings Record in 1945. The monument to Hester Raynsfor, born Isham, who died in 1763, was installed in the Ishal chapel in Lamport church. It was executed by William Cox of Northampton (b. 1717, d. 1793).",
