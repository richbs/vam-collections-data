He was most admired for his poetic effects of sunrise, sunset and moonlight (Orrock wrote in 1898, 'As a painter of light he has had no rival, save and except Cuyp'), and also for his classical landscapes inspired by the works of Claude. Exhibited four oils at the RA between 1800 and 1802, and another in 1821, and 19 at the BI 1820-43. But he was almost exclusively a painter in watercolours. A founder member of the OWS 1804/5, he exhibited there each year for the rest of his life - a total of 581 works. Thirty watercolours are in the V&A collections. Published <i>The Theory and and Practice of Watercolour Paintings,</i>elucidated in a series of letters (1840). Bury states that he visited Italy. Died London 19 March 1842. His self-portrait is in the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nLIT: J Orrock 'George Barret', <i>Art Journal</i>1898, pp129-32; B Webber <i>James Orrock, Painter, Connoisseur, Collector, </i>2 vols, 1903, I, pp135-46; A Bury 'George Barret Junior: A Classic Water-colour Painter', <i>Connoisseur</i>CV, 1940, pp237-41; 'Some Letters of George Barret, Junr ... ', <i>OWS</i>XXVI, 1948, pp1-5\n\n<b>Italianate Landscape with Shepherds</b>  \n4-1887 Neg 31840 \nCanvas, 149.9 X 228.6 cm (59 X 90 ins) Given by James Orrock RI, 1887 \nEvidently inspired by the paintings of Claude, with whom Barret was compared by his contemporaries including Ruskin, but does not seem to be based on a specific Claude work. \nWebber quotes James Orrock relating the donation of the picture: \n\nMy friend Dr Marshall was paying me one of his welcome visits in \t \nLondon when I showed him an unusually large oil picture by George \nBarret the younger, the celebrated water-colourist. I observed that such a magnificent work as that ought rightly to belong to the nation, and I \nthought that, one day, I would present it to South Kensington Museum. \nHe exclaimed in his racy Scottish way, 'Man, why not do it now?'. On \nbrief consideration, I followed his advice. Having always felt a deep \ninterest in the history of the two celebrated De Wints in oil, which, in \nconsequence of their having been executed by a watercolour painter, for \na long time found no worthy resting-place - although they were offered \nto the National Gallery - until they were finally located at South \nKensington, I felt that this grand Barret in oil, also painted by a master \nin my beloved art, ought by right to keep them company. I therefore made it a condition of my gift, one that every artist will thoroughly appreciate, that the Barret should be hung alongside the two De Wints. The gift was accepted on these terms, and the three pictures are grouped together to this day in what may be called a truly English section of our National Gallery. To see them, and them only, will repay a pilgrimage to South Kensington on the part of anyone who would dwell delightedly on what two masters in water-colour can accomplish in oil. \n\nChancellor admired the painting in 1910:  \n\nThis remarkable canvas is very Claudeian in conception and treatment; it is suffused with that golden tone which the great Frenchman loved to put into his work, and in this respect it exemplifies what Ruskin wrote of Barret's 'glorious and exalted passages of light' and you will remember that the critic once exclaimed that 'one careless blot of Barret was worth all the Caraccis in Europe'. The foreground of this work is rather conventional and 'tight', rather factitious, in a word, but this was due to the particular treatment of the subject (one wonders if Barret produced the work in a frank competition with Claude), but could the distance be better, could even Claude or Turner (even he) have produced anything more ethereal or more poetic? \n\nA watercolour replica, with some alterations, was sold from the Stephen G Holland collection at Christie's 25-29 June 1908 (131, as 'A Landscape: sunrise, peasants and horses in the foreground; a distant view of a town on the left', 51 X 82.5 cm/20 X 32 1/2 ins), bought Agnew \u00a3283 10s. \n\nPROV: \tSold ('property of a gentleman') Christie's 30 June 1883 (208, as 'A Classical Lake Scene, with figures, sheep, and goats', 152.4 X 23 cm/60 X 89 ins), bought Cannin \u00a3420; presented to the museum by James Orrock 1887 \n\nENGR: Walker and Cockerell, for Webber I, facing p142\n \nLIT: \tC Monkhouse <i>Earlier English Watercolour Painters 1890, </i>p101; Webber II, pp183-4; E B Chancellor, <i>Walks Among London's Pictures 1910, </i>p250\"",
