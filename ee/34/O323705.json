The pendant is hinged to the wire, and consists of two hollow square segments, each set with a turquoise on the front.  There is a silver pendant point attached to each side of the top segment, and three similar points, alternating with two short strips of coral beads, hanging from the base of the lower segment.  The two earrings are linked together by a length of figure-of-eight chain which is attached to a loop at the end of the decorative strip on each earring.  There are four discs looking like medieval Christian coins hanging from the chain, and three lozenges of sheet silver, one of which is stamped with the head of a lion.",
