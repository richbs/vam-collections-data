First studied medicine, then travelled extensively, (supposedly on foot) on the continent 1843-45, settling in Rome where he took up painting, influenced by the work of Giovanni Costa. Returned to England 1858, marrying and settling at the family seat of Wetley Abbey. Visited Paris with Costa 1863. Exhibited 25 works at the RA between 1857 and 1872, and 12 elsewhere, Italian and English landscapes with an idyllic atmosphere and effects of mist and twilight which were both admired and influential. Moved to Hammersmith, London 1864, where he died 22 October 1872. An exhibition of his work was at Christie's 15 February 1873. His portrait by Val Prinsep is in the NPG. \nLIT: \tSir J F White 'The Pictures of the late George Mason, ARA', Contemporary Review April 1873, pp724-36; 'Holland and Mason' The Architect 27 December 1879, pp378-80; Alice Meynell 'George Mason' Art Journal 1883, pp43-5, 108-11, 185-8; H Quilter Pinwell and Mason Royal Society of British Artists exhibition catalogue 1895; A Chester 'The Art of George Heming Mason, ARA' Windsor Magazine (32), 1910, pp491-504; R Haggar The Masons of Lane Delph 1952; R Billingham Life and Work of George Mason unpublished thesis, University of Leicester 1975; S Reynolds 'George Heming Mason and the Idealised Landscape' Apollo February 1981, pp 106-9; R Billingham George Heming Mason exhibition catalogue Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on- Trent, 1982 \n\nAt Wetley Rocks, Staffordshire\n309-1887 Neg HF978\nPaper, 17.8 \u00d7 33 cm (7 \u00d7 13ins)\nPurchased 1887\n\nA study made in connection with 'The Gander', a painting exhibited at the RA in 1865 (31), and now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool (repr A Staley Pre-Raphaelite Landscape 1974, pl 99A).\n\tWetley Rocks, some ten miles east of Stoke-on-Trent, is near where the artist's father had acquired the house and estate of Wetley Abbey (built 1824) inherited by Mason in 1859. He lived there between 1858 and 1864, and frequently visited thereafter. His friend the artist Giovanni Costa wrote that Wetley Abbey was 'situated in a smoky rainy country but idyllic in character and inhabited by a refined race of peasants who (especially the children) made one think of the Greeks and Etruscans all the more because that part of the country was called Etruria (G Costa 'Notes on Lord Leighton' Cornhill Magazine March 1897, p377).  \n\t The number of finished paintings by Mason is few, but there were several oil sketches in both the studio sale and the Burlington Fine Art Club exhibition of 1873, which seem to have been highly priced. At the studio sale, lot 138 was 'On Wetley Rocks', bought for \u00a3152 5s by Leighton, presumably his friend the artist Lord Leighton. Leighton also bought lot 145, 'A Country Wedding', (see 310-1887 below). It is possible that he bought them for, or on behalf of, Mason's widow; according to Billingham (1982), Leighton arranged the studio sale, and continued to help Mason's family. \nPROV: Purchased by the museum from Mrs Mary Mason, the artist's widow, 1887 \n\nEXH: \tLoan exhibition of works of art, Wedgwood Memorial Institute, Burslem, 1869 (44 or 45, 'Wetley Rocks', lent by Mrs Mason); Art Exhibition Wedgwood Institute, Burslem, 1879 (98 or 124, 'Wetley Rocks', lent by Mrs Mason); George Heming Mason City Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent, 1982 (34, as 'Sketch at Wetley Rocks', on canvas, dated to about 1865) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
