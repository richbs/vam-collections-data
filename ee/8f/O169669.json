The whole has then been 'broken down' with paint and fake blood creating the impression of wear and decay.  Much of the decoration (such as the newspaper, rubber gloves and bin bags) is ephemeral, but the production was not intended to have a long run and the occasional tear in a glove or trailing bin bag only added to the authentic impression.  However, in a museum environment, these materials create major conservation problems.",
