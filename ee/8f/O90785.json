As fashions and styles of fighting changed, good early blades might be shortened and remounted in more contemporary styles and this blade has been shortened (\u2018suriage\u2019), which has resulted in the loss of the final character of the smith\u2019s signature. It is, however, clearly a 16th-century blade and may have been made either by Kanekado or Kanetsuna, both of whom worked around 1532. From the folding and forging technique used in its manufacture the blade clearly shows strong \u2018masame\u2019 (parallel longitudinal graining) and \u2018mokume\u2019 (concentric wooden graining). It also shows lines of \u2018nioi\u2019 (literally \u2018visual fragrance\u2019 - a term used to describe the cloudy pattern of crystals in the steel, which are said to resemble the Milky Way) along the gently undulating tempered edge (\u2018hamon\u2019). The blade may even have been converted from a polearm blade (\u2018naginata\u2019) into a wakizashi.\n\nThe wakizashi was the shorter of the two swords (know together as \u2018daisho\u2019) worn by the samurai at all times. It was suited to fighting at close quarters, especially in towns.",
