The first type naturally evolved from the simple European pricket candlestick, where the shaft is supported on three legs. The second type originated in the Near East and had a high cylindrical or slightly conical base surmounted by a flat circular wax pan and a short circular stem. These candlesticks were introduced into Europe by the Muslim community in Venice from the 14th century. \n\nBroadly speaking the development of the base of European candlesticks can be attributed to Near Eastern influence, while the stem, which gradually became longer, with an increasingly complicated range of knops and balusters, is largely European in origin. \n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries an interesting variation was the replacement of the conventional shaft with a model of a human figure in contemporary dress, as in this example. The outstretched arms supported either a socket or a pricket with a wax pan immediately underneath.",
