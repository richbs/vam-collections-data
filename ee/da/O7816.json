This means that there are three golden ducal crowns on a red shield.\n\nWe know that the panel came from Barnham Hall in Suffolk, near Ipswich, but it is unlikely that this was its original location. The arms are ecclesiastical, and it is more probable that they would have been inserted in a window of a church, a chapel or even a cathedral.\n\nAt the time of the Reformation, many religious institutions were stripped of their furnishings. It is possible that this panel was removed at that time and sold into private hands.",

It is not likely that this would have been its original location. The arms are ecclesiastical and so probably would have been inserted in a window of a church, a chapel or even a cathedral.\n\nAt the time of the Reformation, many religious institutions were stripped of their furnishings. It is possible that this panel was removed then and sold into private hands.",
