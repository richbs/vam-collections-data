However the dwarf-like figures here exhibit disproportionate muscular bodies and facial types which are uncharacteristic of the first half of the 16th century. The presence of the figure of Death with an hour-glass, a subject which cannot be found in any 16th century medals or plaquettes, is a typical 19th century addition. It is very likely that the relief was made for the collector Frederic Spitzer - in whose collection this relief was - in the 19th century. Spitzer owned several such pieces in boxwood which were fabricated at the time to enhance his collection of models.",

However the dwarf-like figures here exhibit disproportionate muscular bodies and facial types which are uncharacteristic of the first half of the 16th century. The presence of the figure of Death with an hour-glass, a subject which cannot be found in any 16th century medals or plaquettes, is a typical 19th century addition. It is very likely that the relief was made for Frederic Spitzer in the 19th century. Spitzer owned several such pieces in boxwood which were fabricated at the time to enhance his collection of models.",
