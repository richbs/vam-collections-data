The good wishes in Arabic on the shoulder are in a bizarre style of script in which each upright ends in a human face. The figures between are four musicians. Those on the sides represent the moon.\n\nIn Islamic art, objects made from base materials were often transformed by sophisticated forms of decoration. Brassware, such as this ewer, was decorated with inlaid surface ornament.\n\nFor larger motifs, metalworkers chiselled out small areas of brass and filled them with thin sheets of silver, gold and copper. They added details by chasing the surface of the softer metals and contrast by using a black filler. \n\nThe inlay technique first became popular in eastern Iran in the mid 12th century. It then spread westwards and by 1250 was in use across the Middle East. Its popularity declined after 1500.",
