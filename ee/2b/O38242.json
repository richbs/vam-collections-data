The walls of the room are decorated with various items including two in  frames, a sheet of paper inscribed \"Little Johnny Stout\" (from the nursery rhyme \"Ding Dong Bell\") and a photograph of farm horses.  The children's appearance shows the transition from Victorian and Edwardian fashions to those of the 1920s: the girls' clothes include both white pinafores and short tunic dresses, and the boys' clothes a Russian-style tunic and a Fauntleroy top as well as a number of knitted jumpers.",
