            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nMiniature painting is defined as watercolour  on a vellum (fine animal skin) support . Most miniaturists learnt the techniques from another miniaturist. Gibson's technique however reveals a different training. Gibson was a page to the Lord Chamberlain, Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, and through him became a page in the Royal Household. Here Gibson met the oil painter Peter Lely (1618-1680) and was probably influenced by his technique. Unlike the other miniaturists, whose brushwork was very smooth, Gibson used a distinctive dragged impasto (thickly laid paint).\n\nPeople\nGibson's work is sometimes lacking in individuality, but this image is very like other known portraits of Elizabeth Capell. It dates from 1653-1657, the period following Elizabeth's marriage to Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon. He was grandson of Lord Pembroke, Gibson's longstanding patron.\n\nArtist\nFor years it was thought there were two artists, one signing 'DG' and one signing 'RG'. It is now clear that the 'D' stands for 'Dick', or possibly 'Dwarf' (Gibson was only just over a metre tall).  Gibson's position at the court of Charles I was as page not miniature painter and during the Commonwealth period he remained under the care of  the Earl of Pembroke's nephew.  But at the Restoration Gibson set up independently as a miniaturist in London. He then signed more confidently 'RG'.",

In his Gazette des Beaux Arts article (2) Long published the miniature tentatively as a key part of a possible du Guernier opus: recognising the Englishness of the style in this, as in four supposedly similar miniatures in English collections, he suggested that du Guernier may have worked in England. \n\nLong died before he could sort out the DG problem, and his classification of this miniature came to be questioned only when the early works of Richard Gibson, both Signed and unsigned, were studied in connection with work on this catalogue. Presumably the works that Long recognised as similar to this miniature were also early works by Gibson; certainly, on the basis of the reproduction, one miniature illustrated as du Guernier by Schidloff (3) is a Gibson closely comparable with this miniature. Much of the previously accepted oeuvre of du Guernier has thus been stripped away, and he can be identified now as an exclusively French illuminator and enamellist. (4) \n\nSimilar DG signatures are on the <i>Unknown Man</i> (5); datable 1648-50, this, together with a miniature in the collection ofRobert Bayne- Powell, is one of the earliest extant works of Richard Gibson. Other examples of the monogram are on the <i>Earl</i> and <i> Countess of Carnarvon</i>, datable 1653-7, in the collection of the Duke of Beaufort (6). Possibly this form of monogram in interlinked romans precedes the cursive form which appears on the back of <i>Sir Richard Anderson</i> of 1658 (7), which in turn precedes the very similar cursive <i>RG</i> of the later works \u2013 for example <i> Lady Isabella Dormer</i> (Cat. No. 109).  \n\nThe sitter for this miniature seems to bear a strong likeness to Elizabeth Capell, Countess of Carnarvon, as for example in Gibson's perhaps slightly later treatment of her in the Duke of Beaufort's miniature. The arrangement of hair on her forehead is different, but the resemblance otherwise in the set of the chin and mouth, the form of the nostrils, and the wide spacing of the eyes, goes well beyond the effect of the artist's standardising vision. The date would be 1653-7, the period immediately following Elizabeth's marriage to Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon, who had recently taken on the main patronage of Dwarf Gibson from his grandfather, the 4th Earl of Pembroke (d. January 1649/50). Gibson's portraits of the members of this group all share the same sober hues of the sad-coloured Commonwealth style. In most of them, fading has increased the effect of this, but in the present miniature the sitter's bright red cheeks have survived exceptionally well. Gibson's intentions in this respect - to show his sitter in the bloom of righteous health and colour - are even more evident in a miniature of an unknown woman, also of the 1650s, (8) which is in pristine, unrestored condition. \n\nThe frame of the miniature was, according to a note in the Museum file, substituted for a nineteenth-century gilt rim when it was acquired by the Museum. The present wooden frame was probably in the Museum already (in connection with the Wallop Loan perhaps; Cat. No. 97 is a portrait of Sir William Portman). The inscription therefore, with its seductively interesting reference to Henry Portman, cannot be made to bear the inferences previously suggested by the present author.
