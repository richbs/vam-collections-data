In the first, captioned 'Put Strength In The Final Blow. Buy War Bonds' (an impression of this poster is in the Museum: inv. no. E.2319-1918), the falling soldier is more dramatically portrayed, suspended in mid-air, with the battlefield below and the dead figure prominently crumpled on the ground beneath. A proof for the design of 'Back Him Up . . .' (also in the Museum: E.3513-1931) bears the caption 'He Needs Your Help Now Buy War Bonds', but this has been changed to focus on the British soldier's strength and to avoid any implication of weakness. For unknown reasons, the artist's suggested colouring was also changed.",
