The cover has a low, everted base and a flat shoulder, followed abruptly by a low, broad rib running around the base of the dome.  The dome is moulded into 8 lotus-bud-shaped ribs which form a rossette around a central knop.   \n\nThe knop was engraved with a rossette pattern, now partly erased by wear.  The rib around the dome is engraved with a crenellated pattern, divided into three sections, each separated by a roundel enclosing three cursped, whirling lobes.\n\nOn the shoulder, the rim, and the everted base of the cover, the same crenellated pattern is divided into six sections with separating six-petalled flowers.  \nThe ribs of the dome have a stalked flower decoration(?).\n\nFinally, the body is divided into four horizontal borders of equal height.  Each band is engraved with the creneallated motif divided into nine sections and spaced with six-petalled  flowers.  Three reserved escutcheons, tear-drop shaped, correspond to the missing attachement plates.\n\nThree lotus-bud legs were cast as one with the body.  The underside of the base has engraved decoration featuring a central 12 petalled rossette.  Framing this are three lotus buds each centrally adjoined to a bi-focating leaf stem.  Three sections of guilloche form the outer border.\n\n A pair of hinges and a plain hasp attach the cover to the body.\n\nPatina: olive brown blackened by dirt.",
