They are often called 'caddies' today, a name that derives from the Malay word for a measure of weight (kati) equivalent to about half a kilogram. In mid 18th-century Britain tea was made not in the kitchen but in front of the family and guests by the lady of the house. Canisters and other tea utensils are therefore often highly decorative.\n\nThe price of tea gradually fell during the 18th century as imports increased to meet demand (and because of widespread smuggling). Tea ceased to be an expensive luxury and was drunk more widely. In 1784 import duties were drastically reduced. These changes were reflected in the increasing size of tea containers over the course of the century.\n\nDesign & Manufacture\nCeramics with naturalistic moulded decoration were very popular in Britain between 1755 and 1765. This pineapple canister was made by pressing wet clay into a hollow two-piece plaster mould bearing the shape in reverse. The seam from the mould is clearly visible down the side of the canister. The hollow moulds for making this piece were formed using a convex master model of the shape. The master model would have been made in stoneware, probably by a specialist blockmaker.",
