The creative monad with its two nuclei of ancient Chinese philosophy, the eight trigrams being displayed within medallions strewn with fruit, flowers and symbols of Daoist character, on other parts of the garment. The intervals are filled in with scrolled clouds and flying storks carrying flowers in their beaks. The red borders are embroidered with flower baskets, bats, <i>ruyi</i> sceptres and other symbols. Such a coat would be appropriately worn when attending worship at a Daoist temple in olden time, and it may have figured as the costume of some Boxer chieftain, as they are described in narratives of the siege of the Legations at Beijing as clothed in cloaks of this nature. It was perhaps originally an imperial cloak. The satin being woven with the brand of the Treasury manufactory.",
