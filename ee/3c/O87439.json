Voysey for Alexander Morton & Co. between 1895 and 1900.  \n\nVoysey was one of the most original and influential architects and designers of all forms of decorative art working at the turn of the 19th century. In 1882 he set up his own architecture practice and from the late 1880s started to design repeating patterns for wallpaper and woven and printed textiles and carpets. Voysey's most interesting designs date from this time and are dominated by flowing patterns incorporating pastel coloured birds, animals, hearts, flowers and trees in silhouette.  He sold his work to manufacturers such as G. P. & J. Baker, Thomas Wardle and Alexander Morton. Voysey's designs were well known on the Continent, and though popular with French Art Nouveau designers, his influence was felt more dramatically by the founders of the Modern Movement.\n\nAlexander Morton founded his textile company in Scotland in 1867 and in 1900 moved to a factory in Carlisle. Morton's son James was responsible for buying patterns from most of the leading freelance designers of the day, including Voysey, Butterfield and the Silver Studio.",
