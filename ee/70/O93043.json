Around the top of the feet are four turned bands.  The stems swell to form an oval urn-shaped section narrowing at the top to form an oval fan.  The sockets for the candles are round; a concave plate at the base of the socket on each is attached to a thin rod passing through to the base where it terminates in a flat brass button.  This device enables the old candle to be easily removed.  The candlesticks are cast in two sections, joined by solder at the top of the base.",
