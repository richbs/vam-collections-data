            "historical_context_note": "In the late 16th century, collecting became popular amongst the nobility of Europe and many important collections were established at major courts. One of the largest of these  Kunstkammern was established by Emperor Rudolf II at the Hradschin Palace in Prague; and other notable collections were in Vienna and Munich. These collections attempted to encompass the wonders of the natural world (naturalia) often carved or embellished with other materials. They also collected objects created by the artistic and scientific genius of man (arteficialia and scientifica). These collections included hundreds of pieces of gold, silver, bronze, rock-crystal and colored precious stones, ivory and mother-of-pearl. \nDuring this period, European voyages of exploration provided increased access to exotic materials such as mother-of-pearl, from warm seas where it was present as the iridescent lining of shells of certain marine moluscs. The raw material was transported to carving centres in Europe where they were shaped and then diseminated to collectors.",
