The design dates from 1931 and the name Entas refers to the French 'entasser' meaning  'to stack'. Like other architect-designers of the period, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier, Goldfinger used tubular steel for the frame of his chair, although he was less experimental with the structure than many of his contemporaries. Goldfinger intended the chair to be mass-produced but it was only ever made in batches for use in his own home and offices, and for his architectural commissions. This example was probably used in his London offices in Bedford Square and later in Piccadilly. Several more examples survive in the house he built for himself in Willow Road, Hampstead, in 1938.",
