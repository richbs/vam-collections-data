Today he is acknowledged as one of the greatest bronze sculptors of the Renaissance.\n\nHis statuettes, functional objects, like oil lamps, and reliefs reflect Riccio's inimitable ability to express the most refined humanist ideas prevalent in the Veneto in bronze.\nHe was also a specialist in rendering themes of Classical mythology.\nHis oeuvre is often neglected because of its small scale, but it constitutes one of the most fascinating manifestations of the poetic paganism of the High Renaissance.",
