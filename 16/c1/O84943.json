At the news of a death in a Santal house the 'jadupatua' would soon arrive and bring out a ready-made portrait approximating to the age and condition of the deceased. It would be complete except for the pupils of the eyes. The 'jadupatua' told the relatives that the dead man would wander blindly in the other world until the pupils were painted in, an act known as 'chakshudana' or bestowal of eyesight. For this service the artist would demand domestic goods or money in accordance with the family's means.\nSee Ray [1953] p.301; M.Archer [1977] pp.16-17",
