Messel's surviving notes and delicate, magical designs are a tantalising glimpse of what might have been an enchanting film.  \n\nFrom the surviving preliminary synopsis it appears that each fairy was to be seen in her own setting before magically leaving for Princess Aurora's christening.  The principal fairy  godmother, The Lilac Fairy, was set in an \u2018arbour [of] sparkling cobwebs, bringing with her a gift of a magic talisman.\u2019  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
