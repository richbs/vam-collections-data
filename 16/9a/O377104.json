Outside the cartouches there are chased scrolls, engraved ornament, of which some is geometrical, and engraved flowers on a ground which is frequently hatched with horizontal engraved lines. A small number of the foliage elements have deep-blue basse-taille enamel.  On the sides four of the panels have chased shellwork with enamelled dark-blue foliage within symmetrical panels engraved with horizontal hatching.  The greater use of engraving rather than chasing is distinctive.   \n\nScenes. 1.  Lid: seated man and woman with three children, a maid, a spinning wheel, and a dog. 2. Side panel, front: man drinking, woman eating grapes, boy offering fruit, dog. 3. Side panel, right: seated drinking man holding out scrap for begging dog.  4.  Side panel, back: woman fallen onto floor, her basket of eggs beside her, of which is broken on the floor.  She looks back at a small dog, possibly the cause of the accident.  5.  Side panel, left: kneeling boy restrains dog which is barking at cat on a cupboard.  6. Base: Seated man and woman with five children, one man servant, a dog and a cat.  A glass of wine is being poured for the woman.  The man is holding a bowl from which a girl is helping herself with a spoon.",

The scenes are in the manner of David Teniers the Younger (1610-90), a Dutch artist who specialised in interior domestic scenes.  Scenes derived from engravings of the paintings became popular on Paris snuff boxes in the 1750s and early 1760s, and this taste has clearly influenced Schindler in Vienna.\n\nSchindler was the son of a porcelain painter at the Meissen factory in Saxony. He worked at Meissen between about 1740 and 1750, when the director of painting at the factory, Johann Gregor Herold, complained that he had worked on his own account.  He moved to Vienna in 1750 and in 1777 became director of painting at the imperial porcelain factory.  Further enamels in the style of Teniers signed by Schindler include rococo boxes in the collections of the Louvre, the Wallace Collection, London, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection, and a rococo \u00e9tui in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.  \n\nSchindler may well have been responsible for the engraving and chasing on this box, as well as the enamelling, but the box itself would have been made by specialist goldsmiths.",
