            "public_access_description": "Very little is known about the artist known as Alberto Sotio (active 1187). The church of SS Giovanni e Paolo in Spoleto contains frescoes by him and his circle and a crucifix, originally in the same church and now displayed in the Cathedral, is signed \u2018Alberto So\u2026\u2019 and dated 1187.  The V&A\u2019s is very close in style and execution to the Spoleto work and is one the most important Italian paintings of this period in a British collection. Painted crucifixes such as these were intended as devotional pieces to be hung above the screen or an altar, or to be carried in procession, and act as aids to religious contemplation to anyone praying in the church or attending mass. Here, Christ hangs on the cross, confronting the beholder with open eyes. On His left is St. John the Evangelist and on His right the Virgin directs our gaze towards Him. At His hands and feet are three narrative scenes; on the left, the Harrowing of Hell, on the right Holy Women at the Sepulchre, and at the bottom the Denial of St. Peter. While Christ on the crucifix alludes to His human nature, the Triumphant Christ flanked by two angels at the top of the cross alludes to his divine nature and triumph over death. \n This early crucifixion eschews a dramatic representation of the event, favouring a simple and direct approach as an aid to devotion. Later depictions of this scene (post 1250) tended to represent the dead Christ, with eyes closed and with the weight and suffering of his body suggested by the sagging of his corpse on the cross, and by the conspicuous grief of the Virgin and St. John at either side. Here the somewhat disconnected scenes and figures of the narratives serve as \"clues\" to the beholder who is supposed to meditate on the images before him as a means to understanding the immensity of Christ's sacrifice.\nThe panel is fairly well-preserved, although there are losses of paint on the Virgin's robe and the little scenes at the terminals of the cross. Few individual painters of this period are known by name, but this work, in addition to resembling that of Alberto Sotio in Spoleto, combines a number of central Italian motifs that suggest that it was painted in Umbria in the last quarter of the twelfth century.",

JOHN\nTempera on canvas on panel, 218.5 x 171.5 cm \n850-1900. <i>Gift of Lord Carmichael</i> \n\nItalian paintings produced before 1300 are exceptionally rare; it has been estimated that over ninety per cent of very early Italian paintings have not survived into the present century. This crucifix is the most important Italian painting of its period in a British collection, and gives us a glimpse of what painting in Italy was like before Cimabue, Giotto and Duccio made the innovations and refinements in Tuscan painting in the early 14th century that are generally considered to mark the beginning of modern Western painting.\n\nThe Church was the dominant cultural influence of this time, and virtually all the surviving Italian pictures of this date are religious in character. Painted crucifixes such as these were intended as devotional pieces to be hung above the screen or an altar, or to be carried in procession, and act as aids to religious contemplation to anyone praying in the church or attending mass. This crucifix impresses us by the stark simplicity with which its main features are drawn. Christ hangs before us; He confronts us with open eyes and He exposes the wounds on His hands and feet to our view. On His left is St. John the Evangelist and on His right the Virgin who indicates him to the spectator with her hands. At His hands and feet are three scenes; on the left, the Harrowing of Hell, on the right Holy Women at the Sepulchre, and at the bottom the Denial of St. Peter. These scenes are intended to remind the spectator of the human frailty of doubting Christ's sacrifice  and His ultimate power to rise above death and ultimately to help the spectator gain eternal life by having faith in Christ's sacrifice and resurrection. The point is underlined by the top terminal of the crucifix, where Christ is shown victorious with two angels.\n \nAll the features of the crucifix are painted with the utmost simplicity, as is usual in paintings of this date; the draperies fall in simple folds and the heads are drawn like simple masks with no attempt to give them any expression. Later depictions of this scene (post 1250) were to show a specific moment of the crucifixion, with Christ dead, His eyes closed and His body slumped down the cross, and the Virgin and St. John conspicuously grieving at the sides of the cross. This early cross eschews any such dramatic representation of the event and portrays a collection of artistically somewhat disconnected scenes and figures which serve as \"clues\" to the spectator to reconstruct his own personal conception of the agony of the crucifixion and the immensity of Christ's sacrifice.\n \nThis panel is fairly well-preserved, considering its age, though there are losses of paint on the Virgin's robe and the little scenes at the terminals of the cross. Few individual painters of this period are known by name, but it displays a mixture of central Italian motifs that suggest that it was painted in Umbria in the last quarter of the twelfth century. \n\nHoward Coutts\"\nUmberto Gnoli,<u>Pittori e miniatori nell'Umbria</u>, Spoleto: 1923, pp. 15-16.\nGabelentz, Hans von der. \"Italienische Kruzifixe des Mittelalters.\" in <u>Festschrift zum sechzigsten Geburtstag von Paul Clemen</u>, ed.

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 280-81, no. 345.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nUmbrian School, late 12th century \n\n345 \nPAINTED CRUCIFIX, WITH MARY AND ST JOHN \nIn the terminals: top: CHRIST WITH TWO ANGELS \nleft: THE HARROWING OF HELL right: THE HOLY WOMEN AT THE SEPULCHRE \nbottom: THE DENIAL OF ST PETER \nTempera on canvas on panel \n86 X 67 \u00bd (218.5 X 171.5) \n850-1900 \n\nThe original description of 'early 14th century' was subsequently changed, and a date in the late 12th or early 13th century has been widely accepted since 1910. This dating is supported by the open eyes of Christ on the cross and the almost straight position of His body, which contrasts with the closed eyes and strongly curving body of Italian crucifixes after c. 1250. Attributions have fluctuated between Tuscany and Umbria, but it has long been recognized that the closest stylistic comparison is provided by the crucifix in Spoleto Cathedral signed by Alberto Sotio and dated 1187. This connection, which was first pointed out by Count Gnoli in 1910 (orally), was published by van Marle in 1923. Meanwhile the opinion that it was Tuscan was expressed by Osvald Sir\u00e9n (orally, 1920; Pisan, mid 13th century) and Tancred Borenius (1929: Tuscan). The similarity with the Sotio crucifix was stressed by Evelyn Sandberg-Vaval\u00e0 in her monumental study of painted crucifixes, but she also found stylistic features connecting it with Siena, and pointed to the fact that the practice of placing the Passion scenes in the three lower terminals of the cross was unknown in both Umbria and Siena but occurred, for example, in Arezzo. Of the individual scenes, also, neither the <i>Harrowing of Hell</i> nor the <i>Denial of St Peter</i> occurs on Umbrian crucifixes. Sandberg-Vaval\u00e0 concluded that Siena was the most likely place of origin, in spite of the connection with the Alberto Sotio crucifix in Spoleto, whereas Garrison (1949) catalogued it as Spoletan. \nExtensive overpainting was removed in 1948 with the result that the reproductions in van Marle, Sandberg- Vaval\u00e0 and Garrison give a misleading impression of the present state of the crucifix. In particular, the loin cloth has regained a shape more nearly approaching its original character. This is closer to Tuscan examples than Umbrian (cf. Sandberg-Vaval\u00e0, pl. i and fig. 75d) but the stylistic affinity with the Alberto Sotio crucifix justifies the attribution to Umbria in spite of the objections raised. \nThe Tuscan nature of the scenes in the terminals is not an effective obstacle to the Umbrian localization. Arezzo, the principal centre concerned, is in southern Tuscany and on the main route to Perugia and Spoleto. The Passion scenes in the two side terminals have been too badly damaged to allow for a study of the iconography. The <i>Harrowing of Hell</i>, in particular, is peculiar in its present state. The half-naked figure on the left is a most unusual representation of Eve, especially considering the fact that Adam is fully dressed, but no alternative identification presents itself. On the other hand, the <i>Denial of St Peter</i>, which occurs invariably in the lower terminal, follows the standard iconographical formula. \n\nCondition. Considerably damaged. Cleaned and restored by S. Isepp in 1948. \nProv. Probably bought by Lord Carmichael on one of his visits to Italy - in particular Florence - in the 1890s (1892, '93, '95, '99), during which period he acquired the bulk of his collection.

            "history_note": "Given by Lord Carmichael of Skirling, 1900.\nExtensive overpainting was removed in 1948, restoring the crucifix (in particular, the shape of Christ's loincloth) to a state closer to its original character.\n\nHistorical significance: Very little is known about the artist known as Alberto Sotio (active 1187). The church of SS Giovanni e Paolo in Spoleto contains frescoes by him and his circle and a crucifix, originally in the same church and now displayed in the Cathedral, is signed \u2018Alberto So\u2026\u2019 and dated 1187.  The V&A\u2019s is very close in style and execution to the Spoleto work and is one the most important Italian paintings of this period in a British collection.\nFew Italian paintings survive from 12th century.  It has been estimated that over 90 percent of art from the era has been lost. Painted crosses are also rare, though it is assumed many Italian churches housed such crucifixes. There are 31 surviving crosses with the Cristus Triumphans datable to ca.1100-1230.\n\nCrucifixes such as these often include a variety of scenes from the Passion of Christ.  Most include the scene of the Women at the Grave and the V&A crucifix appears to be the only surviving work to include this combination of scenes. \nWhile the painter of the V&A crucifix remains unknown, Lord Carmichael\u2019s wife noted in his biography that the cross was believed to have been Tuscan, \u201cassociable with Berlinghiero Berlinghieri,\u201d and dated to the early 13th century.  (Carmichael, p.274). \nThe crucifix has often been compared it to Alberto di Sotio\u2019s 1187 painted cross from Spoleto while Van Marle believed the V&A crucifix to be the oldest painted cross in existence. Gnoli saw its linear style as evidence of Spoletan and Byzantine influence (Van Marle, p.201; Gnoli, pp. 15-16; Kaftal, p.880).\n\nVaval\u00e0 saw so many similarities with Umbrian, Sienese and Aretine crosses that she avoided giving a firm attribution, though was most in favour of a Sienese origin.  She felt that it showed \u201cstrange combination\u201d of the three regions. She identified the projecting moulding as Sienese, the face of Christ similar to the work of Alberto di Sotio\u2019s assistant\u2019s work in Assisi, and the body and the small figures in the terminals as Roman.  She dated it to the later part of the 1100s.  (Saval\u00e0, p.636-637).\n\nGarrison believed the V&A crucifix showed similarities to crosses from Lazio. However, he believed strongly that it was produced in Spoleto and \u201cshould be classified as Spoletan under strong Latian influence.\u201d  He felt that along with a tabernacle in Viterbo, the V&A crucifix provided a connection between the regional styles of Lazio and Umbria.   In 1949 he refined his theory to place it as similar to Alberto di Sotio\u2019s (or Sozio) painted cross yet with a Roman influence.  He dated it to the late 12th or early 13th century (Garrison, 1949, p.187).\nCampini felt the V&A Crucifix was Spoletan from late 12th - early 13th century. He followed Garrison\u2019s view that it was in the circle of Alberto di Sotio with Roman influence.  (Campini, p.51).\n\nKauffmann classified it as \u201cUmbrian School, late 12th century\u201d in his catalogue of paintings at the V&A.  He noted that despite the presence of elements more commonly found in Tuscany (the \u201cHarrowing of Hell\u201d and the \u201cDenial of St. Peter\u201d), an origin in Arezzo \u2013 in Southern Tuscany and on the route to Perugia and Spoleto (both in Umbria) could explain the combination.\n\nBoskovits put the V&A crucifix in the same category as the Rosano crucifix, a crucifix from San Frediano in Pisa, the Montalcino cross, and a cross found in the Sienese Pinacoteca formerly in San Giovanni d\u2019Asso because of the loose lines and flowing qualities. He believed the V&A cross to be by a Roman painter working in Rome in the early 1100s. (Boskovits, p. 19-20, 25).  Andrea de'Marchi (in conversation) also suggested a Roman provenance due to the placement of the Virgin Mary's hands, which recalls (though in reverse) the position of the hands of the Madonna di S. Sisto, a 6th century icon venerated in Rome.", 
            "place": "Italy", 
            "production_note": "This work has been attributed alternately to the Tuscan and Umbrian Schools but is now generally accepted as Umbrian and appears very close to a work by Alberto Sotio of 1187 now in the Duomo of Spoleto, Umbria.", 
            "historical_context_note": "A painted Crucifix is a painted wooden panel in the form of a cross, with a central figure of the crucified Christ. Other figures or scenes are sometimes also included on the apron (on either side of Christ\u2019s lower body) and on the terminals (rectangular extensions of the cross arms); there may also be a roundel with a representation of God the Father or Christ Logos above the upper terminal. Painted Crucifixes were commonly either placed behind the altar or suspended from the chancel arch, as in Santa Croce, Florence. The double-sided construction of some painted Crucifixes suggests that they may also have been carried in liturgical processions. The iconography of the Crucifix was dominated by theological expressions of the incarnation and resurrection. In the 13th century the development of Franciscan theology, stressing Christ\u2019s humanity, and the renewal of Byzantine artistic influences prompted not only the transition from a triumphant to a suffering Christ but also the changes in number and arrangement of secondary figures and scenes.\n\nPainted crosses became popular in Italy certainly by the 12th century, though the absence of surviving works makes more precise dating difficult.  The earliest surviving Tuscan painted crucifix' represent Christ as<i>Christus Triumphans,</i> or the \u201cTriumphant Christ\u201d with his head up and eyes open.  This form was supplanted in the 13th century with the <i>Christus Patiens,</i> or \u201cSuffering Christ\u201d type who is shown often with his head fallen on his shoulder and his eyes closed.  The iconography of the suffering Christ appears to have developed out of a new interest in Christ\u2019s human nature, the development of the feast of Corpus Christi and with increased importance given to the Eucharist.",
