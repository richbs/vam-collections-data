The blue ground is covered with symmetrically-arranged branching stems in two shades of green, bearing carnations, Tudor roses, acorns, grapes, etc. In the centre is a roundel, containing (within a broad border of floral stems on a black ground) an impaled coat of arms and the initials O.S. and E.S. The carpet is surrounded with a broad border of floral stems of different types on a black ground, containing 20 heraldic shields of the alliances of the St John family. \n\nThe ground also has various initials (some undeciphered) and devices, including a crest.\n\nThe border is in four pieces (one with a narrow red chevron edging) but probably belongs to the centre, which has been cut down: the whole was mounted at a later date on a piece of coarser canvas, through which some of the outlines were reworked.",
