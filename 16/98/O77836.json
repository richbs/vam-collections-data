The principal market for the tiles was for churches, both new and restored.\n\nManufacturers\nThe partnership between Colin Minton Campbell and Michael Daintry Hollins ended in 1868. It produced a split in the famous Minton company, with Campbell in charge of china production at Minton's China Works, and Hollins producing tiles of various types at Minton, Hollins & Co. Campbell also started to produce tiles, but it was not until he took over an existing tileworks in 1875 that production of encaustic and mosaic floor tiles began. This business was originally styled the Minton Brick & Tile Co., though a lawsuit brought by Hollins forced Campbell to drop 'Minton' from the name. Henceforth the firm traded as the Campbell Brick & Tile Co. until switching to simply the Campbell Tile Co. in 1882.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nEncaustic tiles were a good medium for depicting religious symbols and played an important part in ecclesiastical decorative schemes.  The symbols on this tile represent incidents from the Passion Cycle (the suffering and crucifixion of Christ). This tile shows the cross and ladder, and the inscription 'INRI', which stands for the Latin Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum ('Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews'). According to the Gospels, this phrase was written by Pontius Pilate and attached to the cross.",
