Their popularity  is partly explained by the dual function they served, of demonstrating both the pupil's needlework skills and her geographical knowledge.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe earlier map samplers have hand-drawn or traced outlines. They were  prepared by the teacher or governess in many cases, and that may have happened here. We do not know how old Elizabeth Hawkins was when she embroidered the map, but the slightly haphazard spacing of its place names suggests an inexperienced hand, and she probably located these herself.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe map of Europe embroidered here was one of the most popular choices, but the range of possibilities was wide.  A pupil might choose to depict as local an area as the field layout of a nearby estate, or her country, its continent, the two hemispheres of the globe or even the solar system. Such complex maps as the two hemispheres were almost always undertaken on printed grounds, which were effectively sampler kits, although generally left with bare borders to allow for some personalisation.",
