When in London, he met the scientist Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Hermann Borhaave, with whom he corresponded. On his return to Italy he became Professor of Medicine at Pisa University and Professor of Philosophy and Anatomy at the University in Florence. Emperor Francis I of Austria appointed him court antiquarian. Cocchi's study of tuberculosis enabled the Tuscan authorities to contain the disease by taking public health precautions.  He also shared the opinion that scurvy is caused by a lack of vegetables. Proficient in many modern and ancient languages, Cocchi also wrote medical, anatomical and scientific works that made him famous.\n\nThis medal depicts Cocchi in profile to the right. On the reverse face there are two unidentified figures wearing classical style draperies along with a serpent wrapped around a staff, the symbol of the ancient Greek God Asklepios.",
