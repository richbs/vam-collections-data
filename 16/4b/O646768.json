            "public_access_description": "Subject\nJeffrey Amherst (1717\u20131797) was a military officer, particularly noted for his role as commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America during the Seven Years\u2019 War.  Amherst had previously served under William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, and Sir John Ligonier, when he was recommended to William Pitt to undertake an expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg in 1758.  \n\nFollowing the successful capture of the fortress and General James Abercromby\u2019s recall to Britain, Amherst was appointed commander-in-chief.  The appointment of Amherst could not have come at a better time, for the British had suffered a series of defeats in North America at the hands of the French and their Indian allies: Amherst\u2019s predecessor, Abercromby, was forced to retreat after an ill conceived assault against the French stronghold of Fort Ticonderoga a few months before; and General Braddock, despatched at the outbreak of the war, had been killed when his army had been ambushed en route to attack Fort Duqesne.  In July 1759 Amherst succeeded where his predecessor had failed and captured Fort Ticonderoga.  This was followed, under instructions from William Pitt, by an attack on Canada.  Amherst\u2019s subordinate, James Wolfe, captured Quebec in September 1759.  It was some time before Amherst launched the final attack on Canada, choosing to carefully prepare a three-pronged attack which culminated in the capitulation of Montreal in September 1760.  After the defeat of the French in North America Amherst dealt with a number of administrative challenges and the outbreak of Pontiac\u2019s rebellion in 1763 \u2013 the year in which he was recalled to England.\n\nIn 1774 he was offered the command of the British forces in North America but declined.  This came at a time when relations with the North American colonies were deteriorating and would eventually lead to the outbreak of war.  He declined the command a second time in 1777.  In 1778 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the home forces and charged with defence of Britain against a possible French invasion.  He was again appointed commander-in-chief at the outbreak of war with France in 1793, although his abilities were questioned.  \nHe died in 1796 at his home in Kent.\n\nDepiction\nJoshua Reynolds (1723\u20131792) was the leading portraitist of the late-eighteenth century.  In 1768 he became the first president of the Royal Academy and had a profound influence on British art and theory of the period. \n\nIn the portrait Reynolds has depicted Amherst wearing armour and leaning on a commander\u2019s baton.  Armour was not worn on the battlefield at this time.  It is instead used as an overt reference to Amherst\u2019s position as a military leader.  In the left background is a view of the St. Lawrence River and British troops disembarking for the assault on Montreal.  The plans for this attack are placed on the table on the left.  The stormy sky, often employed in portraits of military leaders, adds to the martial atmosphere. \n\nTechnique\nMezzotint is an intaglio printmaking process.  This technique allows for a greater effect in the gradation of tone.  The engraver employs the use of a rocker \u2013 a tool used to roughen the surface of the metal plate from which the print is made; the printing surface is then smoothed with a burnisher so that certain areas of the plate retain more or less ink than others: the more an area is burnished the less ink it will hold, and so the lighter it will appear when printed.  \n\nJames Watson (1739/40?\u20131790) was an Irish engraver active in London in the late-eighteenth century.  He was born in Dublin and probably arrived in London around 1760.  In 1765 he became the principal engraver to Joshua Reynolds.  Watson specialised in making mezzotints after portraits.",
