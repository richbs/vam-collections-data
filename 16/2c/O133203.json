No.5, boccador 120 dated 1560-70 and attrib burgundy (depth 40cm, height 160\n\nThe box armchair (chaire \u00e0 coffre) combining an armchair with storage under the seat had been long established form in medieval Europe, evolving from Italo-Byzantine thrones (see Schmitz).  Surviving 16th century box chairs published in the recent literature (Thirion, Boccador) tend to be high-backed, throne-like chairs, with panelled bases and hinged seats, sometimes fitted with locks accessed from the front panel. Clearly this is the sort of form that Corrozet refers to when he writes of \"Chair well shut up & well enclosed, wheret he scented musk is stored with the fine linen, so fragrant, sweet-smelling, so well folded...\" All of these chairs would have denoted relative high status, and been reserved for the most important person present, with others standing or using benches, stools or floor cushions. Such chairs would have been used with a cushion, of luxury fabric. During the 16th century French box armchairs were incorporating panels of fashionable carved ornament of the type found on wardrobes or dressers, but a group of armchairs survives with plain fielded panels like 803-1895, usually dated 1560-1600 (Boccador figs. 120, 121). The extreme height of the backs seen on late 15th century chairs is gradually being reduced (as on 803-1895) and elaborately carved arms are being replaced by flat arms with moulded edges or (as on 803-1895) an elegant curving strap-like arm with a scrolled handle, perhaps influenced by open-framed Italian armchairs with leather seat and back panel found c.1550.\n\nBonnaff\u00e9e says (p.217) that armchairs (being relatively awkward to move) were usually placed between the bed and the fireplace, with their plain backs to the wall, where they sometimes concealed a cupboard built into the thickness of the wall. As well as storing linen (see Corrozet) they would have held objects useful at night. [By which he may mean a chamber pot, allowing the chair to be used as a close-stool.] Bonnaff\u00e9e cites various inventory references to 16th century chairs painted and gilded, such as \"une vieille chaire de boys paincte aux armes de feu Madame (inv. de Chamb\u00e9ry)\", and makes the point that the best available artists could be involved in the decoration of luxury furniture. Bourgeois chairs would have been similar, though less luxuriously finished, such as that of Jehan Leclerc, illuminator and bookbinder of Paris, rue de la Verriere (1544) who possessed \"une chaize de bois de chesne \u00e0 hault dossier, fermant \u00e0 clef, garnye de sa marche haulte, \u00e0 un escu de France et ros\u00e8tes\".\n\nReferences\nTHIRION, Jacques: Le Mobilier du Moyen Age et de la Renaissance en France.
