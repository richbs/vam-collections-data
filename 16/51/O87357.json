An eccentric object, this oil lamp in the form of a grotesque monster, has a lion's body with a knobbly spine, a lion's legs and tale, a scaly dragon neck and a canine head. The spout forms within the jaws, with a channel for the wick inside; from this a square shaped channel runs through the body. The tail curls round to also form a handle or hanging ring, through which cord could have been run through; causing the lamp to hang at an absolute level, although how effectively this would have worked in practice is questionable. It could have been an antiquarian fantasy. In the Italian Renaissance lamps and heating devices were common in the home and the oil lamp symbolised life, which is probably why an almost identical version of this lamp is inscribed with the words: VITA QVID ALIVD ('Life, what else?').",

There is uncertainty over the attribution of this lamp; Fortnum catalogued it as Florentine sixteenth century in 1876. Bode later identified it as Venetian, about 1575.  and in Draper's revised edition of Bode he classified it as 'probably Italian 17th or 18th century'. Sotheby's sold an almost identical version in 1980 as Paduan, early sixteenth century. In The Robert H. Smith Collection, Bronzes, 1500-1650 Anthony Radcliffe stated that none of these claims carry conviction, and finds it more plausible that the lamp is dated from the second half of the sixteenth century.\n\nHistorical significance: In the Italian Renaissance the oil lamp symbolised life, which is probably why an almost identical version of this lamp is inscribed with the words: VITA QVID ALIVD (\u2018Life, what else?\u2019).",

The tail curls and loops round to form the handle or ring for the lamp to be suspended from. A hook or cord could be passed though this ring, making it perfectly level, although there would have been difficulties in filling it with oil, apart from through the very limited conduit for the wick, and little space to allow for an adequate reservoir of oil. Therefore whether the lamp was actually used or is an antiquarian fantasy remains questionable.",
