This print cabinet, made for his own use, is fitted inside with seven sliding trays and six pigeon holes.  The plainness of the shape and the dominance of its two-dimensional decoration, make it easy to see that the cabinet was designed with a painter's sensibility for framed compositions on flat surfaces. \n\nIts simplicity also recalls furniture design from east Asia, and perhaps Brangwyn intended to suggest the picture was made from oriental incised lacquer (Coromandel lacquer), although the draped figures in the picture look more Caucasian than Asian and the landscape features Italianate temples rather than pagodas. Nevertheless, the inclusion of flamingos and parrots, and the exotic clothes, place the scene in the realms of myth rather than history or geography.",
