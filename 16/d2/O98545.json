Smooth glossy silk satin was especially exacting to make and accuracy was crucial as the tiniest mistakes could not be concealed. This attention to detail can be seen in the careful construction of this dress with its hip panels, seaming and collar with its rows of parallel top-stitching. Lanvin favoured decorative techniques such as top-stitching and ruching to create stunning visual effects and low-key Art Deco relief. \n\nMiss Sylvia Golding owned the dress and gave it her niece Sarah Golding in 1959 to dress up in. Sarah does not know how the dress came into her aunt's possession and she never saw her wearing it. Sylvia worked in the wages office for Marconi of Chelmsford and loved the theatre all her life as well as the colour purple so there may be a connection there. Her fianc\u00e9 was killed in the Second World War and she never married.",
