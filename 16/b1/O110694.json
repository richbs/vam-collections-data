They are often sand cast, but are also made using a variation on the lost-wax method. A basic shape is created in clay and the form of the bell then applied in wax, along with its relief decoration. An outer mould of clay is built up on top. The mould is heated, the wax melts out and the clay bakes dry before the molten metal is poured in.\n\nBells played an important role in everyday life during the 16th century, regulating the working day, calling worshippers to church and announcing special occasions such as weddings and funerals. \nHandbells were both religious and secular in function. They were used in religious rituals and were commonly decorated with figures of saints. Small bells were also used as doorbells, and to call servants and institutions into action. The sounding of a bell had a number of meanings from warning to protection from danger, calling order, regulating routine and announcing civic and religious occasions.\n\nGiuseppe de Levis (1522-1611/14) was the most distinguished member of a famous dynasty of bell-founders active in Verona and became perhaps the most accomplished and versatile founder of bronze sculpture and artefacts in Northern Italy of his day.",
