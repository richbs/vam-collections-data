Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nJones' photograph of this Georgian bridge was taken from an established viewpoint, though it lacks the usual boats evident in pruints and drawings. The crossing point had long been a main thoroughfare into the city. By the time that Jones photographed the bridge, access was free and the two domed toll houses were no longer in use.
