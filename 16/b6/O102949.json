His dancers were not required to be emotional beings but to subsume their individuality into the total theatrical creation. In the 'Finials' section of his work Allegory, first produced in 1959, he achieved the ultimate dehumanisation of the performer. The costume bears no obvious relation to the shape of the body but instead gives shape to it, and the dancer becomes an abstraction in the overall scheme.  \n\nIn this costume the placement of hoops around waist, knees and head is determined by the need to maintain a clear outline that has nothing to do with the human form. Jersey fabric is used as a covering as it will stretch tightly over the hoops, then curve softly inwards. The performer's face is entirely obscured. A description of  Nikolais's works makes them sound mechanical and inhuman, but on stage the mix of music, colour, light and shapes wove a potent theatrical magic, and the dancers were like beings in some alien universe, moving in perfect harmony.",
