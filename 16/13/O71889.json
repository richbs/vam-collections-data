Bedford, Keeper of the Department of Architecture and Sculpture at the Museum, wrote of this piece that it was 'evidently one of the 74 marble busts of Pitt which were made by Nollekens masons after the death mask. There was a constant demand for busts of Pitt & Fox, they were known as \"Nollekens' stock pieces\". As is to be expected, the work is dull but it is quite genuine.' \n\nR. Gunnis, in the Dictionary of British Sculpture 1660-1851 (revised edition, 1968), records that the busts of Pitt, taken from a mask produced immediately after his death, were sold by Nollekens for \u00a3120 each, and that Nollekens 'also made replicas of the mask itself, but in this case the original is in the possession of Earl Stanhope'.  Nollekens also executed a full-size marble statue of Pitt, erected at Senate House, Cambridge, in 1812. Busts by Nollekens of Pitt and Fox were often displayed as pairs.",
