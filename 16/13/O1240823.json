The poster claims that the Empire is 'the Premiere Variety Theatre and Cosmopolitan Club of the World', the Managing Director is Alfred Butt and Manager Oscar Barrett. The Programme notes that evening performances are at 8.30pm with the Saturday matinee at 2.30pm. The programme for each performance is announced and the repertory for the week consists of La Boutique fantasque, Le Carnaval, Children's Tales [Contes Russes], Cleopatre, The Good-Humoured Ladies, Petrouchka, The Polovtsian dancesfrom Prince Igor, Scheherazade, Les Sylphides. Details of ticket prices from 21s to 2/6 are given. The poster is an example of the first publicity by the Ballets Russes to include the costume design by Pablo Picasso for the Chinese Conjuror in the ballet Parade which received its London premiere during this season. Subsequently the image served informally as a company logo whenever the ballet was presented.  This image with changing repertoire details was also used for advertising cards during the season. The season at the Empire was the final one in the company's 15-month stay in Britain which restored its fortunes after the War.",
