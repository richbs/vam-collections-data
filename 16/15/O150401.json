Although referencing classical design, the vase is very much in the spirit of Victorian art pottery which encouraged artistic expression in the ceramic medium and was regarded as the antithesis of uniform mass-produced wares.  \n\nOn the base of one of the columns depicted on the vase is painted the initial 'F', the unidentified mark of the painter/designer. In style, the design is very similar to those produced for Maw & Co. vases by the designer Walter Crane in about 1888-9, although his work was usually marked with his own monogram. It was common practice for firms to continue producing works in the style of a particular designer beyond the duration of their employment.",
