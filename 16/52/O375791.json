The top in the form of a cupola supported on two stages of open arcades, each surrounded by a balustrade with baluster finials; the lower balustrade square in plan, the upper octagonal. On each side of the case there is a large dial and, below, one or two smaller dials, as follows:-\n(1) clock dial with three rings, the innermost with hours 1 to 24, the second with hours I to XII twice repeated, the third with minutes 1 to 60, also twice repeated. The hour hand thus makes one complete revolution in twenty-four hours, the minute hand in 120 minutes. Within these dials is a further dial divided into two halves for night and day, marking the position of the sun. Beneath, a smaller dial, the central panel missing, enamelled with the signs of the zodiac and numbered with lunar months.\n(2) Large dial. Perpetual calendar with list of saints' days. Below, two small dials of enamelled silver. The left one is an indicator dial for the alarm, the right one is missing.\n(3) Astronomical dial within an hour ring numbered from I to XII twice. Below, a dial numbered in units of five from 1 to 60. The periphery of the dial is carved with figures of the gods emblematic of the days of the week.\n(4) Perpetual calendar with a list of saints' days. Below, two small dials of enamelled silver, the left one marked with quarters, the right one numbered 1 to 10.",
