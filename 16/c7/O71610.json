The cross is battlemented at the foot. Christ's head is inclined to his right and a long lock of hair hangs down in front of his left shoulder. His right foot rests on his left. Angels receive the blood in chalices held under the wounds in his hands and feet. Longinus, touching his eye with his right hand and holding the lance in his left hand, stands on Christ's right. On a smaller scale, to Christ's right and left, are represented the beardless figure of the good thief and the bearded figure of the unrepentant thief who hang from crosses by their arms. The Virgin Mary, veiled and wearing a cloak fastened with a brooch, kneels facing left, head bowed, on the left of the panel. Her hands are crossed in front of her and she is supported from behind by the beardless figure of St. John the Evangelist who looks up at Christ. One of the Marys stands on the left of the panel behind the Virgin. The bearded centurion, wearing a deep-crowned hat, a belted gown and a cloak over his shoulders, is standing on the right of the panel. He turns towards the figure of a soldier wearing a pointed helmet who stands behind him. The centurion points with his left hand to the cross, a scroll rising from his finger. The scroll was no doubt previously inscribed 'Vere Filius Dei erat iste.' His left hand rests on the top of his staff, most of which is concealed by an angel's wing. \n\nThe right hand of Christ, the angel beneath it and the head and chalice of the angel at the foot of the cross are damaged. The angel under the left hand of Christ, and the angel by the wound in his right side, are almost entirely missing. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the lower ground, as well as traces on the cross. However, some of the paint, especially the red and gilding, appears to be relatively modern. The back of the panel is incised with a number of strokes which may be random and also with the word 'LOMBARD.' There are four lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

The Virgin Mary, veiled and wearing a cloak fastened with a brooche kneels facing to the left with her hands are crossed. She is supported by the beardless figure of St. John the Evangelist. Angels are shown at the base of the cross receiving Christ's blood in chalices. \n\nThis panel probably formed the central panel of an altarpiece and would have been taller than those flanking it. Several examples of this type of crowded composition survive from the late fifteenth century.",
