Along the bottom the triangles are in green and dark blue.\n\nMain border: (lower and upper only): white ground with a linked floral motif in reds and dark blue with a pair of tendrils to tbe right of each.\nInner and Outer borders (on each side of the main border): a band of interlocking Y-motifs which extends along both sides of the piece.   Above the top border and outside the side borders is a band of undecorated dark red.   This becomes the ground for the bottom panel, now cut into triangles.\nThere are 4 small dark red triangles below the bottom border, each with 3 V-shaped bands, with small crosses, in dark blue, red and green, mirroring the zigzags in the field.\nThe warp runs the width of the bag when in use; this piece was woven with the points on theright hand side.\n\nDate catalogued: 11.12.96",
