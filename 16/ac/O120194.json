Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThis probably represents the actress Fanny Kemble and is based on an engraving by Richard J. Lane ARA after a drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence, completed in 1829.  Frances Anne Kemble (1809-1893) was the daughter of the actors Maria and Charles Kemble.  Her father was part of the Kemble family that dominated the British stage in the late 18th and early 19th century; the great actress Sarah Siddons was his sister and  John Philip and Stephen Kemble his brothers. Fanny grew up in this theatrical family and made her stage debut aged nineteen as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet at Covent Garden Theatre, to help save her father from bankruptcy when he was manager of Covent Garden.  Despite her misgivings about the theatre as a profession, she went on to become a popular actress both in England and America, where she married Pierce Butler of Philadelphia in 1834, a marriage that ended in divorce in 1848.",
