To proclaim their new position in society, people would often commission a portrait by a fashionable artist.\n\nPeople\nLawrence was regarded in his own generation as the true successor to Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641) and Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792). He combined a highly skilled technique with a sensitive rendering of character  and his dashing, romantic portraits were in great demand.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nSir Codrington Edmund Carrington was a member of an aristocratic family which owned extensive plantations in Barbados. He claimed descent from Sir Michel de Carrington, standard-bearer to Richard I (1157-1599). Sir Edmund was knighted in June 1801 and appointed first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Ceylon. In August of the same year he married his first wife, Paulina. The V&A has a companion portrait of Paulina, also by Lawrence. Both portraits were probably commissioned to celebrate this marriage and promotion before Sir Edmund left England to take up his post.",
