Inscribed on the back in ink: 748/EE/-/-/\u00a330.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century circular silver-gilt locket, with convex back and the sides deeply grooved, curving in a broad rolled edge to the bezel, which holds a convex glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger of D-section, with a central channel, of tear-drop form, dividing into diminishing spirals of three turns. Packed out with part of a nineteenth-century goldsmith's trade card (no name). Engraved on the back in copperplate: Isaac Casaubon/ by / Peter Oliver.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by the Revd Alexander Dyce from an unrecorded source, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1869.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Redgrave 1874, p. 8; Williamson 1904, voL 1, pl. XV, fig. 7;  <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 27 (as by PO); Long 1929, p. 321 ('ascription rather doubtful'); Long 1930, p. 52 ('attribution doubtful', 'inscribed' with PO signature); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 76 (Anon., Unknown Man).  \n \nUntil Long looked at it, this miniature was accepted as by Peter Oliver. The early department register sheets are missing, but Long's scepticism about the signature would have been pre-1914. Technically the miniature is characteristic of English work despite the absence of a carnation ground, but the hand bears little relation to any of those represented in this catalogue and may after all be 'foreign', perhaps Netherlandish. In the circular format and in the use of a blue background, the intention seems to be archaising. \n\nThe likeness does resemble that of Isaac Casaubon, the Huguenot scholar and theologian, following the familiar basic portrait type of c.1590, (1) but as such nevertheless presents problems. Casaubon was in England from 1610 until his death in 1614, but the ruff in this miniature seems to be of the 'falling' pattern worn no earlier than 1620. Presumably there was some continuing demand for images of Casaubon after 1614, but updating the image beyond the man's death seems unlikely. \n\nBy the 1860s the name of Casaubon was in the air again in the English literary circles inhabited by Dyce. Mark Pattison (1813-1884) was collecting materials for his life of Casaubon (2) and George Eliot was working on <i>Middlemarch</i> (1871-2). This increases the likelihood that Casaubon's name was attached to the miniature by the trade in the 1860s.  \n \n1 Represented in the NPG; Strong 1969, no. 38. \n2 Published 1875.\"",
