The main border is on 3 sides and has a quilted ground with a diamond pattern in white silk.  It has a thin green leafy meander which goes through elongated pink leaves outlined in green with pink pointed flowers.  The inner border is the same design as the outer border; it is on three sides around the central rectangular panel; some light pink silk has been used in the lower half. This panel is divided into a lobed niche by green lines of embroidery.  The spandrels are filled with a pattern formed by pairs of green leaves which form an X-motif with a green disc centre, together they form an unconnected diamond lattice with a small pointed pink blossom and 2 buds in each diamond; some are worked in light pink thread. At the top of the niche is a roundel with a green ground and pink inscription; it is surrounded by outward facing pink buds resting on a stem with a pair of green leaves. The niche is patterned with offset bands of a floral stem with 3 pink carnations and is quilted in a diamond pattern with white silk. The carnations in alternate bands are outlined with green. \nBacking: beige cotton; the same fabric is used on 23-1877.",
