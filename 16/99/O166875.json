Between each of the flowering plants appears the outline of an oval shape composed of small oval-shaped patches. All except one of the applied cottons are block-printed. One or two pieces show the dark grounds and mossy trails of the late 1700s to early 1790s. 'JD yds 21' is embroidered in white cotton thread on the linen underneath one of the applique triangles, and is probably a linen-maker's mark.
