It is red, gold and white with black markings. The eyes are very large bulbous clear red plastic and the nose/mouth is orange plastic. Attached to each side is a printed paper fin. The tail fin is made of clear plastic decirated with red. It is attached to a metal pin which is connected to the mechanism.The underside is white plastic. When wound up the goldfish moves on two wheels set under the centre area and connected to the mechanism; there is a third wheel also connected to the mechanism which extends to form the pin for the tail fin. As the toy moves, the side fins open and close and the tail fin, governed by the wheel, moves from one side to the other.  This is actually an erratic movement and not just a swaying one.  The whole fish moves one way, pauses then moves with other way.\n1.  fish\n2.  tail fin, *firmly place this on the pin.\n*The breeding of goldfish in China has a long history and the breeders have always attempted to create very large eyes.  This ideal is reflected in early fish representations on other wares such as the jars",
