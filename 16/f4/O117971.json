Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. Bing experimented with solarisation from 1934 at the same time as Man Ray (1890-1976) and Lee Miller (1907-1977), although she claimed that she discovered the technique independently of them. Solarisation happens when negatives are exposed to light in the darkroom during developing and printing, producing partly reversed images. Bing\u2019s experiments developed from an interest in light, as she explained at the time, \u2018light was considered the medium that permits photography. But for me it became the main subject: the protagonist of my photography\u2019. This photograph reveals the effects of electric lights on water. Bing made solarised photographs of dancers in night-time Paris at the same time. This image shows an exterior view of the city at night.",
