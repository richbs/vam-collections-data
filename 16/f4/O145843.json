They both made their first experiments in jewellery in the sixties.  \n\nIn 1963, David Watkins and Wendy Ramshaw, collaborated in their first joint venture, \u2018Optik Art Jewellery\u2019 inspired by Op-Art. Ramshaw had been teaching screen printing, and Watkins developed this technique, to be used on acrylic, rather than spray painting. They printed multiple black and white patterns onto sheets of acrylic, which were then sliced up and finished as individual pieces of jewellery. With their \u2018Optik\u2019 collections, among others commissioned by Fenwicks of Bond Street they caught the spirit of the Swinging Sixties. These were fun pieces and jewellery accessible for the young. Their concept was to make well-designed fashion jewellery of inexpensive material. It was the right idea at the right time. \u2018Optik Art Jewellery\u2019 closed when larger competing manufacturers moved into their visual territory.",
