There is evidence of scarlet red silk as well as white silk around these seams. In its present form the central area is framed by 4 wide bands of pulled thread work forming an open net of hexagons, interspersed with touching triangles of pulled thread chevrons, edged on both sides by a line of pulled thread rosette forms.  The central area has two sides with lines of connecting offset 8-pointed stars in satin stitch and in between two large open pulled thread hexagons, with remaining space filled with pulled thread and straight stitch triangles forming squares. There are bands of needleweaving within this design.\nCotton Thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
