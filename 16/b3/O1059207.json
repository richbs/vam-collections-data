Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>Unknown Man</b>\n<b>1655-60</b> \nEvans 28 \n\n<b>Oval 53 x 40 mm</b>  \n \nFeatures in soft, blended hatches of brown and sanguine, with some grey in the shadows and blue in the eyes, on a pale creamy carnation ground; hair in brown wash, lined with darker colour and the lights in grey; collar in white, modelled in grey over the vellum; coat in opaque pale grey modelled with darker colour; the buttons in ochre and yellow-brown; the sash in gummy black wash; background in opaque brown washes; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> The support severely warped; paint losses especially in the gummed passages, and flaking in the collar; much old restoration.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Signed and dated in gold, centre right: <i>DDG/ 1657</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Probably nineteenth-century silver-gilt oval locket; the plain convex back curving to a deep rounded edge, a very shallow straight side and a bezel holding a thick, bevelled flat glass; the hanger of rectangular section channelled along its outer curve and bifurcating into tapering spirals of five turns.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an unrecorded source by the Hon. F H A Wallop before July 1927; lent to the V&A 1927-49; given to Alan Evans, June 1933, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> RA 1938, no. 795.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 124; Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 15 (as 'perhaps studio of Des Granges '): Murdoch 1981, p. 138.  \n \nAccepted as autograph Des Granges by Wallop, Long et al., and questioned only by Graham Reynolds. (1) He suggested 'Copy?', perhaps picking up the idea on which Wallop and Long had worked that the portrait was of Constantine Lyttleton (1638-1662), a derivation from images by Cooper at Hagley and at Welbeck Abbey. (2) Goulding, however, had made the additional observation that another portrait, apparently of the same sitter, engraved by Harding after Cooper in 1796, was called Charles Stuart, Duke of Richmond, and that the Welbeck version had also passed under other names, such as Abraham Cowley (With Vertue) and as Richard Cromwell in earlier Welbeck listings. The traditional evidence is therefore confused and inconclusive, but the identification with Constantine Lyttelton, one of the twelve sons of Sir Thomas Lyttelton (1596-1650), the royalist of Hagley, at least places the miniature in a quarter generally consistent with Des Granges' known patronage.   \n \nAs to his authorship of this portrait, it seems questionable, if only on the grounds that the paint quality, as it stands now, is inferior to Des Granges' best work. The signature and the background, which seem to have been repainted, create more grounds for suspicion, but basically the portrait must belong beside the pasty Bockland, (3) and in some contrast to Cat. No.51, within Des Granges' typical range of the later 1650s.  \n \n1  In a note on the photograph in the Dated Portraits Index in the department library at the V&A. \n2  Goulding 1914-15, no. 54, pl.
