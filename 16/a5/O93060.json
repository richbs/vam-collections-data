It consists of a flat varnished base with four red wheels which is pulled along by a length of pale green cord. There is a cannon, six guardsmen and two cannon balls on the base. The cannon which is painted black with red and yellow decoration on the back, is fixed to the base. The cannon balls are stained yellow. Each soldier or skittle is stylized in shape with blue trousers, red jacket with white buttons, a face with painted features and a black bearskin. The guardsmen and cannon balls can be removed and played with separately as a set of skittles. They are attached by way of small upright wooden pegs, from which they can be unscrewed. The toy is contained in a cardboard box printed with illustrations and details about the toy in French, German and English.",
