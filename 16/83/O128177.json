His armour is that of a 15th century horseman. He has scallop-shaped elbow-cops and on his feet he wears pointed sabotons and a pair of rowel spurs. His feet rest on a dog. There are fixing holes for rivets at the point of the helmet, centre of the chest, elbows, waist, thighs, shins, toes and between the feet.\n\nThere are several areas of damage: the sword is missing its pommel and outer quillon (crossbar) and is broken where the tip of the blade should meet the base. A small square section is missing from the bottom left corner and the surface of the brass has many nicks and scratches.",

            "public_access_description": "This is a memorial brass dating from the mid 15th century of a knight in armour. Memorial brasses were fitted onto the lids of tombs and memorial slabs to commemorate the lives of the medieval people and offer hope for their spirits. Today they are important sources of information about clothing, armour, status and social aspirations as they are often accompanied by inscriptions and are one of the few examples of medieval art that is consistently dated. This one has unfortunately been separated from its inscription. \n\nEnglish brasses survive in greater numbers than those in Europe, partly because they commemorated a broader cross-section of society. Bishops, knights, esquires and merchants made up the clientele. The wealthiest ranks of society opted for more elaborate monuments. In Europe, however, the brass was the preserve of the aristocracy. \n\nThe brass as a raw material was imported from Europe, especially Cologne. By far the greatest number of brasses are found in the eastern counties, particularly Kent, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, close to ports with connections to Germany and the Netherlands. English brasses in the 13th and 14th centuries can be identified by the fact that the figure commemorated is usually cut out to the outline whereas the European examples are more often engraved on a plain rectangle.\n\nBy the 15th century designs became standardised suggesting brasses were the products of a few large workshops. The effigies, as in this case, were often represented as reclining with their hands clasped tightly in prayer and their feet resting against a heraldic animal such as a lion or a dog, with sword hanging down to the side. However, the collar of interlinked 'S' characters identifies this brass as belonging to a supporter of the Lancastrian dynasty that ruled England from 1399 to 1461 and was finally defeated by Henry VII.\n\nThe symbolism of the dog has been the subject of debate. The dog may be either a symbol of loyalty or a representation of evil. Dogs had a low reputation in Christian tradition and the effigy on this brass appears to be pressing down hard on the dog with his feet.",
