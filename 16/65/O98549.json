This photograph forms part of a series of 24 photographs taken by Troeller during the festivities for the Shah's 39th birthday in 1958. The series is of historical significance as a pictorial record of a now disposed dynasty. Just 5 years prior to these photographs being taken the Shah was forced to flee Iran due to his country being increasingly dogged by political unrest in the aftermath of WWII. Having been quickly escorted back to power by a joint military operation orchestrated by British and American secret services, five years on, in these photographs, the Shah, his family and their courtiers appear to have survived the worst. \n \nLooking at these photographs now, knowing that in 1979 further political unrest would lead to the monarchy's permanent banishment (the Shah died in exile in Egypt in 1980), give these photographs an unsettling quality. The series captures the calm before the real storm.",
