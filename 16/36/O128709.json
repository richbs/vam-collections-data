This probably means that it was made for one of the convents in the city rather than further afield.\n\nHistorical significance: The design of this object is typical of Gothic style. The starred enamel at the bowl is a continuation of the skill developed by the Flemish enamellers in the 14th century (see for example 1392-1888). The size and high quality craftsmanship of this chalice suggests that it was donated to a large church or cathedral. The commissioner displays his wealth and status through the valuable materials of gold and silver and through the intricacy of the design.\n\nThe mark on the lip of the chalice, although partially obscured, may indicate Venetian craftsmanship. The mark of the winged lion suggested by H.P. Mitchell would indicate a Venetian origin. A pair of candlesticks of very similar worksmanship were donated by Doge Cristoforo Moro (d.1471) to St Mark's Cathedral, Venice. The chalice also bears similarities to a reliquary, a chalice and a monstrance at Capodistria.",

Medieval Treasuries contained two types of object; functional items used during the liturgy such as chalices and symbolic items to be revered and admired, namely reliquaries. These objects were made from rich materials such as gold, silver, enamel and gems. Such materials were considered to be the best way to honour God. The development of a treasury relied upon gifts. People donated precious objects as a sign of their wealth and status and to ensure remembrance after death. Some churchmen also sought to obtain treasures for their Church stores. Abbot Suger for example worked hard to improve the treasury at St Denis.\n\nTreasuries signified the wealth and power of their Church. Important relics attracted pilgrims, bringing wealth and status to the area. Many church treasures were kept on public display and used in public processions and festivals, which encouraged a sense of community. Other treasuries however were more closely guarded. The Basel Cathedral Treasury was kept locked in cabinets in the sacristy, only to be used on special feast days. This exclusivity only served to increase the objects' status as important and sacred objects.\n\nA chalice was used during the mass to hold the consecrated wine. Chalices were usually made from gold or silver, although less valuable chalices were made of base metal. The bowl however was always made of precious metal because it would hold the sanctified wine, which Christians believe is transformed into the blood of Christ during the Mass. Precious metals were also used for reasons of hygiene, as base metals could contaminate the wine.",
