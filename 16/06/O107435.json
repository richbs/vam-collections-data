The size and uneven wear on its two sides indicate that it came from a cloister. \n\nThe volute was a common component of classical architecture, being one of the defining features of capitals of the Ionic order. In this way is reflected the great regard felt by medieval society for the so-called 'Ancients'. \n\nThe lion was also an ancient - pre-Roman or Greek - symbol of strength, courage, and also dignity and pride. But here the lions are rendered in the 'Romanesque' manner, stylised and fairly harmless looking, with enlarged heads. Curiously, each lion's front right paw is shown stretched out to touch the tail of the lion in front. What this means, if anything, is unclear. It may simply be a novel and eye-catching way of creating a continuous and linked pattern around the capital.",

            "history_note": "On each face of this capital, the top part of a column from a religious building in southern France or northern Spain, is a standing lion. The size and uneven wear on two sides of the capital indicate that it came from a cloister. The tops of the capital terminate in volutes, meaning spiral scrolls. The volute was a common component of classical architecture, being one of the defining features of capitals of the Ionic order. In this way is reflected the great regard felt by medieval society for the so-called 'Ancients'. The lion was also an ancient - pre-Roman or Greek - symbol of strength, courage, and also dignity and pride. But here the lions are rendered in the 'Romanesque' manner, stylised and fairly harmless looking, with enlarged heads. Curiously, each lion's front right paw is shown stretched out to touch the tail of the lion in front. What this means, if anything, is unclear. It may simply be a novel and eye-catching way of creating a continuous and linked pattern around the capital. A capital in the Pitcairn Collection, also thought to be from Roussillon, shares this peculiar motif. Lions capitals of this type 'were common in Roussillon around the middle of the twelfth century', but the 'possibility of the capital originating in North-East Spain (Catalonia) cannot be excluded' (P. Williamson, 'Catalogue of Romanesque Sculpture', V&A publication, London, 1983, p. 21).\nGiven by Mr J. H. Fitzhenry.",
