The front legs turned, the twin side, front and rear stretchers plain and rectangular.

Oak Furniture from Yorkshire Churches (Temple Newsam, Leeds, 1971) no. 16 a chair at Swillington \n\nChinnery suggests p.480 that the double cross-splat backstool originated in Yorkshire, but examples are now widely spread, and that it may now be too late to locate the original workshop centres, of which there must have been several. He suggests that early specimens may date from a little before 1650, while later examples were produced up to 1700 and a little later.\n\nWells-Cole (1971) suggests that large numbers \u2018exist throughout the West and North Ridings. They probably all belong  to the second half of the 17th century although only one dated example (1686) has been traced. The decoration of the back rails indicates that channelled spiral motifs combined with deep cross hatching, stamped enrichment and foliate carving was widely popular in the county. Since this stylised pattern is not repeated on other kinds of furniture its value as a feature for identifying companion pieces of local origin is limited although it obviously expresses a vigorous tradition.\u2019 (p.10)",
