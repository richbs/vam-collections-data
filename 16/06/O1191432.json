The hollowness of the tube allows for generous storing space within and use of the bottom as yet another shelf. \nThe different materials making the three tier stand are seamlessly held together with glue and metal pins. It is sprayed with tough enamel of a plain white colour with a high gloss finish.",

The table was created by British designer Bernard Holdaway as a later addition to the first Tomotom cardboard collection that was launched to great success at the Ideal Home Exhibition of 1966. All conceived on a circular theme, the range comprised of chairs, tables and lamps coated with tough enamel spray of a plain, eye catching colour with a high gloss finish. The first collection was edited in pillar box red and royal blue but soon extended to black, white, green, yellow and purple. Conceived as cheap throwaway furniture and sold by mail order, the collection struck a chord with the young, fashion conscious families of the late sixties and established itself as an instant Pop classic.",
