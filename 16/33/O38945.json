The medal is octagonal, and made of die-cast metal finished in a silver effect, with a flat ring at the top, through which a separate ring has been threaded before mounting it on a length of doubled and stitched petersham medal ribbon in red, white and blue.  The obverse shows a central roundel with bas-relief left profiles of the crowned King and Queen; the border is divided into panels for the emblems of the United Kingdom and the inscription.  The reverse carries the Middlesex badge of a crown and three sea-axes, surrounded by sprays of laurel leaves and the inscription.",
