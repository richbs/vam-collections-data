Each sheet is die-stamped in the left-hand corner with the letters 'ESK', which stand for 'Examined South Kensington'. The first drawing is a study from life of a nasturtium plant. The three designs are adaptations of nasturtium forms for use as flat surface decoration for a ceramic plate with sgraffito decoration (scratched or scored through an opaque coating), a damask serviette and a copper panel.\n\nTime\nThese designs were entered for examination towards the end of Hayes's training, as the label at the top right-hand corner states that he was 21 years old in 1901. By this time he had been under tuition for three years. By their final year students of the School of Design were expected to be producing decorative designs for flat patterns for such applied arts as domestic plates, textiles and stencil designs for wall friezes.\n\nPeople\nAlbert Hayes does not seem to have participated in exhibitions such as those organised by the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, where many designers of the day would have shown their work. Little is therefore known about him. He designed mainly textile fabrics and wallpapers. There are some completed textile designs by him also in the V&A. Some of these are of different stylised forms of nasturtiums, probably taken from his studies at the School of Design. This suggests that the petal forms of this flower were a favourite of his, as they particularly lent themselves to the Art Nouveau shapes popular at the time.",
