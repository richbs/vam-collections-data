The front shows two children in a meadow using a log and plank as a seesaw, with a white and black puppy beside them: the girl wears a blue dress with red ribbons on her plaits, and the boy has green shorts and a yellow T-shirt printed with yachts and sea birds.  The wording reads\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY To-day !\nwith \n6 YEARS OLD TO-DAY visible inside through a cut-out space between the children; the large figure six is embossed with a design of children playing and is printed in gold.  Inside is an illustration of the two children running across the grass with the puppy, beneath the words \nHello ! AND MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF THE DAY !\nThe verse reads:\nSee-saw, Margery Daw\nAnd many games to play,\nThese little folk bring a wish to you,\nFor a really Jolly Day !",
