Beads of this type (sometimes called \u2018aggry\u2019) were widely used in trade in West Africa although it is thought that they originally came from Europe, possibly Italy. \n\nThe necklace consists of forty-six glass beads spaced with discs of hide. The pendant is formed of an iron piece in the shape of an animal\u2019s head into which has been stuffed a core of plant fibre, overlaid with strips of hide and red felt, then the whole bound with fibre string.\n\nThe necklace may have been worn by a member of the court. A large number of pieces of court regalia found their way to Britain after British forces invaded the Asante capital of Kumasi on 4 February 1874. The Asantehene (ruler of Asante state), Kofi Karikari, fled leaving behind much precious regalia which was captured.",
