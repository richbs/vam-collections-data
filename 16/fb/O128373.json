The two figures in short wigs seated on upholstered armchairs have the air of gentlemen; one holds a three-cornered hat and the other a cane. The third, standing figure in a longer wig is probably a notary; he is rather older, bespectacled, and holds a quill in his mouth, while he ponders a parchment with a seal. Behind him, a desk and a waste basket are prominently littered with papers, and an envelope lies on the floor. At the extreme left is a small table with a candle and a vase containing peacock feathers.",

For a similar subject see: 1041-1886. As the painter is not known to have visited England, the painting's support of a Windsor & Newton Ltd. prepared panel was presumably exported.",

He lived in Berlin, where he taught at the Academy in 1894-95, and in Munich, where he was a honorary member of the Academy from 1890 and a member from 1895. His works are in a number of German collections, and the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff and the National Gallery in Melbourne, as well as the V&A.\n\nDuring the second half of the nineteenth century the enduring popularity especially of Dutch, Flemish, Spanish and French genre paintings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fostered a taste throughout Europe both for realist paintings of everyday life and for more idealised historicising 'costume pieces' representing domestic subjects set in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries.",
