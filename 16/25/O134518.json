Studied at Manchester School of Design 1844-46 and with George Wallis, and moved with her sister to London 1854, where they lived together until her death. Exhibited mostly fruit and flower pieces: 42 at the RA between 1853 and 1878, one at the BI 1859, and also at the Royal Manchester Institution. Died Kensington 30 December 1885. \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 9 January 1886, p75; P Gerrish Nunn Victorian Women Artists 1987, p125 etc \n\nGroup of Camellias 28-1884 \nCanvas, 34.2 \u00d7 24.1 cm (13 \u00bd \u00d7 9 \u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated (indistinctly) 'M D Mutrie 1859' br \nPurchased 1884 \n\nThis artist exhibited three paintings of camellias, two at the RA in 1869 (588) and 1877 (1399); this painting is presumably 'Camellias', exhibited at the BI in 1859 (the date of the present work) and priced at 25 guineas (\u00a326 5s). \nPROV: \tPossibly Christie's 1 February 1884 (129), bought by Agnew's (?for the museum) \u00a319 19s; however Annie Mutrie's painting (FA29, above) seems to have been purchased at the same time but was not in this sale \n\nEXH: \tBI 1859 (355) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
