The walls show six cartouches with round ends, which contain verses in Persian written in the <i>thulth</i> style, against a cross-hatched ground. Between the cartouches are six roundels containing a Y-pattern. The cartouches and roundels and the band that contains them are all defined by a continuous plain fillet. The spare corners around the roundels are filled with a fragment of arabesque. The rim is decorated with an oblique chain motif similar to that used in the central disc.",
