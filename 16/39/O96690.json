Similar objects in the collection (A.19, 20, 21, 22-1982) also represent souls in Paradise, Purgatory and Hell. These highly realistic and dramatic wax tableaux served as \u2018memento mori\u2019, intended to inspire thoughts on mortality. Wax modelling had acquired a certain status by the sixteenth century, as it lends itself to the type of intricate workmanship on a small scale which can be seen in this object, and enhanced by the use of colour and texture to mimic flesh.\n\nThis wax is in the style of Gaetano Giulio Zumbo or Zummo (1656-1701), who was known for his expressiveness, as seen in this evocative image. Born in Syracuse to an impoverished aristocratic Sicilian family, the early life and training of Zumbo is shrouded in mystery. He spent time in Rome, Naples and Bologna, where his presence among circles of anatomists is recorded. In Bologna, he is thought to have been the first to propose using coloured wax for anatomical teaching models. From 1691 to 1695, he served Grand Duke Cosimo III and created his most famous teatrini (\u2018little theatres\u2019), many of which were highly realistic and dramatic wax tableaux that served as \u2018memento mori\u2019 and intended to inspire thoughts on mortality (such as A.3-1966).",
