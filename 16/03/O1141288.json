He often works with inflatable structures and translucent materials, and has described his work as expressing his interests in space, light, translucency and transparency. His sculptures often take the form of circles or ellipses, and both this print and E.663-2009 use these geometric shapes. The prints have a three-dimensional aspect achieved by the use of blind embossing, and this piece is itself an elliptical shape made from hand-made paper. The use of a single luminous yellow pigment on the other print (E.663-2009) connects to Shaw's interest in light.\n\nThe artist was commissioned to make an inflatable sculpture in response to Bernini's Neptune and Triton, as part of the 'Captured in Stone' Friday Late at the V&A on 24 April 2009, and donated these two prints to the V&A afterwards. Although they do not relate to this particular project they do reflect the ongoing themes in his work.",
