The other part is E.481-1988. \n\nThe reproduction was made by the Vasari Society, a publishing house which specialised in making high quality facsimile reproductions of drawings in British collections between 1905 and 1915. The Vasari Society was closely linked with the Arundel Club, which opened in 1904, largely in the spirit of the Arundel Society (1848-1897). The Arundel Society had sought to promote a greater and wider knowledge of art, especially that of the Italian Renaissance, through the publication of reproductions, paid for by subscribing members of a club. These were first wood engravings and later chromolithographs of watercolour copies of original paintings and frescoes. By the late 19th century, however, tastes as well as technology were changing and when the Vasari Society began publishing in 1905  it used photo-based processes such as photogravure or collotype.  Additionally the Vasari Society focused on drawings in private collections which would not therefore be normally accessible to view.",
