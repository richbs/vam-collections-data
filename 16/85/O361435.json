Each octagon or square has a creature, difficult to decipher but they appear to be birds and animals of different sorts. The octagons are outlined with cord quilting secured with backstitch, and are largely intact, but the figures originally stuffed with wool wadding have mostly had this removed, apparently on purpose by slitting the channels from the back to remove it, rather than loss through wear. The reason for this is unknown, although when held up to the light the design can be seen more clearly through these now single layer pattern areas. The top and bottom layers both have a seam in one place down their length, not aligned. There is a fringe all round, added later; the edges of the cover within that are cut, not finished.",
