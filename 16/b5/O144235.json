            "physical_description": "Wood box of cypress or cedar with shaped interior compartments, possibly for a balance scale and weights. The box is decorated with intaglio carving, ink decoration and punched ornament, and shows the Annunciation on the outside of the lid.\n\nStructure \nThe box is carved from a solid block (dug out), with four inner compartments: one long narrow compartment which has lost its lift-off lid; one rectangular with a heart-shaped sub-divider enclosed by a lid hung on three brassy metal wire hinges; two small compartments with rounded ends and sliding lids. The two small compartments appear originally to have received their sliding lids from the right side of the box, but the openings have been filled by inset blocks of dovetail form (with a slightly different punched border pattern), and the lids themselves presumably shortened. The main, external lid consists of two boards joined by their 3 original  twisted wire iron hinges, which allow the lid to be partly folded back \u2013 though the reason for this is not obvious. The main lid is hinged to the box using 3 brassy metal twisted wire hinges added over the 3 original, broken, cut and pierced brassy metal hinges of flower shape fixed by metal pins. The lid is now secured at the front by a crude brass ring (on the lid) and a length of wire in the box front, which may supercede the original catch of similar form.\n\nThe cutting out of the structure from the solid would have been carried out using small chisels. The intaglio surface designs appear to have been worked using very small chisels, and square and rhombus punches and ink, presumably applied with a metal knib.\n\nDecoration \nThe outside of the main lid is carved in intaglio, with inked detail on the relief areas and punched ground and depicts the Annunciation: on the left the angel Gabriel with a staff stands(?) below a canopy supported by two columns, with a vase of flowers; in the centre is a smaller seated female figure (possibly St Anne) spinning with a distaff below a tree and with the sun above; on the right is Mary kneeling at a low lectern(?) under a canopy supported by two columns. There is an outer border consisting of a repeated square punch mark within incised parallel lines. The front and sides are fully carved in intaglio with a lattice rhombus design with a regular square punched pattern on the raised ribs and (on the front only) punching in the recessed background, within a border of 3 parallel incised lines. On the front a central area has been left blank, where the keyhole would normally be placed.\n\nInside the box the borders around and between compartments are punched with a regular repeating pattern of rhombus (doubled along the sides), between incised parallel lines, except for the two inset pieces of wood added on the right side (see above). The large compartment lid is carved in intaglio with two eight-pointed stars flanking a rhombus on a background of small rhombus punch marks, within a border of small rhombus marks and parallel lines. The two small compartment lids are punched and incised with a regular rhombus lattice pattern matching the front.\n\nLater interventions and changes\nThere is a long split on the bottom along the back edge.\nLid hinges replaced.\nCompartment lid hinges added.\nOn the right side two small sections (originally open for the inner compartment sliding lids) have been filled with cypress(?) blocks.",

Described as a 'Box for scales and weights, of cypress wood with ornament outlined in India ink and incised...Worn. Original hinge broken'. No other information on the nominal file (checked NH Dec. 2010).\n\nThe suggestion that this box was to hold a balance scale appears to rest on the arrangment of internal compartments, especially the heart-shaped cavity above a long slot, which may have been shaped to hold the fulcrum and the beam. The purpose of the hinged lid is not obvious, save that it allows the lid to be partly opened, perhaps to keep the rear compartment (for coins or precious weights, say) to remain enclosed.",
