The carved crest rail with stylised leaf flanking an anthemion over a horizontal moulding is set on the rear uprights which are tenoned into it, and which rake slightly above the seat. Carved 'ears' (with unusual punched granular ground, matching the main panel) are fixed to the uprights with a single nail. From the back the crest half laps over these ears. \nThe back panel depicts a single large lozenge, shallow-carved with symmetrical stylised (acanthus?) leaf motifs within the lozenge, and in the triangular spandrel areas. The ground has a granular effect created by punching. At the 'sight edge' of the panel a cyma moulding is integral to the crest, lower back rails and rear uprights that enclose the panel. The panel is roughly chamfered behind. A deep lower back rail sits above the seat level.\nThe carved arms are tenoned into the rear uprights and sit on the front legs/arm supports, secured by a tenon joint. At their handles, they have been built up on both sides with a glued rounded 'boss' (one of the four missing 2009). The front and side rails of riven oak have scratch mouldings on their outer faces, there is no real rail. The lower stretchers are all plain. The seat is formed from two boards (the grain running side to side) nailed onto the rails, and appears to be original; the front board sits over the front arm supports.\n\nRepairs: all four feet have been built up on modern shaped blocks. The left arms has been repaired on the underside. A narrow strip of wood has been inserted behind the rearmost seat plank.",
