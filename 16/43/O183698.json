Despite efforts to save it, in 1966, the \"Magpie and Stump\" was scheduled for demolition.  The firm of Wates Ltd was contracted to carry out the demolition work, but allowed the Victoria and Albert Museum to remove any fixtures and fittings before the house was destroyed.  The V&A's Circulation Department moved in quickly to salvage what they could.",

It was designed and fitted out by the Arts and Crafts practitioner, Charles Robert Ashbee (1863-1942) and was one of his better known projects, a home for his family and an architectural drawing office for himself.\n\nBy 1921, the Ashbee family had left the house.  Despite efforts to save it, in 1966, the \"Magpie and Stump\" was scheduled for demolition.  The firm of Wates Ltd. was contracted to carry out the demolition work, but allowed the Victoria and Albert Museum to remove any fixtures and fittings before the house was destroyed.  The V&A's Circulation Department moved in quickly to salvage what they could.",

Influenced by Ruskin and Morris, he intended the Guild to be a co-operative venture which would encourage the full creative potential of the craftsman.  At the turn of the century, the Guild was at the height of its success and had evolved a distinctive and mature style.  Softly planished surfaces decorated with chasing and embossing were characteristic of Ashbee's designs and had a significant effect on contemporary silver in Europe and America as well as Britain.  Financially however, the Guild was less successful and in 1908, Ashbee was forced to wind up its affairs.",
