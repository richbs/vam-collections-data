The lithographs were created from a larger series of computer-generated images that were produced using the Fortran programming language, in 1972. The original images would have been displayed on a computer-controlled phototypesetting machine, then converted into photographic prints and transformed into lithographs. \n\nAaron Marcus has described them as \"Poem-Drawings\". He has also explained that the computer graphic images are shown on a dark background \"to suggest the night, stars, light, etc - in short, 'constellations' of symbols\". \n\nThe Museum also holds a set of eleven \"photo prints\" by Aaron Marcus, and these include images that are similar to those used in some of the lithographs.",
