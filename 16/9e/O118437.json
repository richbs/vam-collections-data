The design shows a right-angled pattern and thus the bottom right corner of the apron.  There is another design in the group of patterns from which it comes that also shows a right-angle which is inscribed 'Apron Lady Webster'  E.247-1973.  The designs comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Mr Styart whose designs were published in The Fashionable Magazine in London in 1786 does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.",

He did not specialise in collecting textiles although he owned some examples.  He was in contact with the Museum 1920s-1970 offering to sell objects from his collection.  Johnes did not provide the Museum with information about the history of ownership of the designs. \n\n*Mr B.W.

            "production_note": "The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Mr Styart whose designs were published in <u>The Fashionable Magazine</u> in London in 1786 does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.\n\nAttribution note: The right-angle suggests that the design is for an apron.  There is a design with a right-angle inscribed 'apron' in this group E.247-1973.  The speculation is that all designs that depict a right-angle are for aprons.\nReason For Production: Retail",
