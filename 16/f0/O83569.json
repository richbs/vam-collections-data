He was a creative menswear designer, with a shop in London's Clifford Street, who used unexpected materials and unusual design elements. The vivid lurex brocade jacket features an Art Nouveau revival design. The corded silk fastening and beaded tassels are inspired by Victorian men's smoking jackets. In contrast, the hipster trousers are very modern and up to date. The shirt is equally modern and unusual, with a boned high roll collar, pleated front, and side zip fastening.\n\nMichael Fish designed under the label 'Mr. Fish'. In reference to his surname he wore an enamelled silver fish brooch with this suit.",
