London: HMSO, 1964.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>THEODORE, Frank (Charles Emanuel THEODORE) (born 1882)</b>    \n \nThe artist, Mr. Frank Theodore, was articled to the firm of Barkentin and Krall, ecclesiastical metal-workers from 1906 to 1914.  In the years between 1909 and 1913 he made copies from working drawings of church plate designed by G. F. Bodley, William Burges, J. L. Pearson, G. E. Street and others.  He received a Regent Street Polytechnic medal for building construction, and a bronze medal for metal casting from the Founders' Company in 1910.  From 1917 to 1925 he was a member of the Royal Navy, and while sailing on the Round the World Empire Cruise of the Special Service Squadron made a set of water-colour drawings, now in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.  From 1926 he worked for the London and North Easter railway, rejoined the Royal Navy during the Second World War and in 1946 returned to the Architect's Department at Kings Cross Station, London.  [\u2026]  \n \nDrawings (4) of a lectern, chalices and an altar candlestick. \n<i>Each signed</i> Frank Theodore <i>and dated between 1910 and 1913.  Each inscribed with title and note. \nPencil and water-colour.</i>  29.2 x 9.5; 11.7 x 9.5; 20 x 15.9; 77.8 x 20.3 cm. \nE.1032-1035-1963 \n \nGiven by the Artist \n \n<i>Note:</i> The altar candlestick is similar to one designed by G. F. Bodley for Ripon Cathedral.  Bodley's design is E.1042-1963.  The lectern is similar to one designed by Sir Ninian Comper, and the chalice, E.1034-1963, is similar to an example designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, and made for the church of St. Mary Abbots, Kensington, in 1877.\"",
