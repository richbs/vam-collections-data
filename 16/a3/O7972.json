York House Book vol. 38. The window had been ordered \"to be set up in Guildhall according to the Modell now presented to this court\" on 15 Dec. 1679. \n\nNote in Register (referring to B&W photo in Register): This photograph is apparently the 'print' mentioned in the registered papers as having been given by Mrs Milner, with the glass; the window shown in it differs very considerably from the glass itself.\nNote in Register: In her letter (RP 26/1693) Mrs Milner said she believed the figures of Truth (actually Mercy) and Justice were in Ireland.\nNote in Register: Mr Trevor Brighton believes these panels are not from Guildhall but are similar ones made for Leeman's House, Acomb, York.\n\nMA/1/M2243\n\nNominal File: Milner, George Mrs.\n\n(5 Feb 1926) Letter from Rackham to Mrs George Milner (c/o Lady Vivian Glyn Bodmin Cornwall):\n\nMr Lycett Green has been here today and reported to me that you might be willing to give the museum a panel of stained glass which is at Acomb Priory. Mr Green described the panel to me and I have no hesitation in saying that it appears to be the kind of thing we should very much like to acquire for our collection, since we are very weak in glass of this period. If you would kindly confirm your intention, we should be pleased be pleased to arrange for our glazier to go down to Acomb Priory the week after next, when he could remove the stained glass and make good the window from which it is taken.\n\n(8 Feb 1926) Letter from Mrs Milner to Rackham:\n\n\u2026I shall be very pleased to give the panel to the museum. I should like if possible for some note to be made that I have given it in memory of my husband Brig. General George Milner. The date on the glass I believe is about 1662 and it was made by Giles of York. It was taken from a window in the Guildhall at York by W. George Leeman then Lord Mayor, who presented a modern glass window.\n[Was Lord Mayor 1853-4; 1860-1; 1870-1]\u2026Also there is a print which you might care to have\u2026It is of the original window in the Guildhall. The bottom part of the window in the Priory is I am told glass made by Peckitt (I believe early 19th century) which if it is of any use for the museum I shall be delighted to give. I always think that it is interesting to have the different centuries. You will notice in the print that there are two figures by the side of the Royal Arms. Truth and Justice. These I believe are in Ireland. The glass may not be in a very good state of repair and will probably want cleaning. I was told the history of the Giles window at the Guildhall and Mr. Knowles of York verified it.\n\n(20 Feb 1926) Gift form:\nPanels (3) of stained glass (in several pieces) \t\tC.88 to 90-1926\nAnd framed photograph\t\t\t\t\tnot registered\n\n(1 March 1926) Minute from Rackham to Palmer:\n\u2026The glass paintings which we have had fetched from York are very interesting examples of 18th century enamel painting, with signatures of Henry Gyles and a later restorer. They were at one time in the Guildhall at York, where they were replaced by modern glass in the 19th century.\n\n(16 March 1959) Memo from Arthur Lane to ?:\nI spoke twice with Mr Craze [?] of Milner & Co., 120 Crawford St, W1, about the Gyles glass from York Guildhall now in the V&A Museum. His form of architects are engaged in refurbishing the Guildhall, which was damaged in the war. The question of uncovering the old glass and putting it back in the Guildhall has been raised, apparently by the Dean of York, who is evidently under the impression that it is still the property of York City Council and in the Museum on loan. \u2026\n\n(27 May 1959) Press cutting-I.P.Pressly to the Editor of The Yorkshire Evening Press:\nI note with interest the suggestion for a new painted window for the west end of the restored York Guildhall. Now the original west window, made by Henry Gyles containing glass dated 1682, is still presumably in existence in the storerooms or cellars of the V&A. When the west end of the Guildhall was enriched by woodwork to enhance the dignity of the Lord Mayor and aldermen and councillors, the window was removed to Acomb Priory, then the residence of George Leeman, and there it remained until about 20 years ago when the tenant of the property, Mrs. George Milner (nee Lycett Green), gave the window in memory of her husband\u2026to the V&A\u2026.",
