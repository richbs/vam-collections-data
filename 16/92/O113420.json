The structure is similar to a Chinese lantern. Here, the layers of paper have been partially opened to make a fan-shaped volume, with the vertical spine of the fan at the back of the chair. The designer sat on the form once it was partially opened, crushing the paper folds and creating the form of the seat and back: the impression of his body is still visible. The cell-like paper structure enables light and air to penetrate into the volume, and perhaps inspired the name Honey-Pop, because it looks like a honeycomb. Unlike most other seats, the user of the Honey-Pop chair is sitting on almost nothing.",
