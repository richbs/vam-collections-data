            "physical_description": "Description: Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in straight and chain stitches, backed with block-printed cotton and with two patches of roller-printed cotton, faced with cottontwill.\nWhite cotton ground seamed down the left-hand side before being embroidered. There is an inner and outer border containing an interrupted green meander with red or cream pointed flowers.  The borders do not turn around the corners but end abruptly. The shade of red varies to pink. The main border has a leafy meander with pointed red blossoms and smaller cream ones.  It does not turn the corner. There are dark registration marks from the block printed design. \nThe field is divided into a diamond lattice, each compartment containing a flowering stem with either 2 red and 1 cream flower or 2 cream and 1 red.  In the lower part the lines of the lattice are worked with green silk but dark blue has been used for a section across the centre and for the upper rows.  Dark blue replaced all green in the uppermost part of this textiles. Dark green also appears in the central right hand area.  Such variations suggest this piece was embroidered in a domestic setting where colours had to be substituted when one ran out.\nBacking: pieced; block printed stripes. A red stripe with a blue and white boteh facing alternate directions and a blue stripe with a small floral pattern in red, brown and white separated by a narrow stripe of brown with an abstract blue motif. \nThere are two loose patches with an isolated motif of an elongated pink boteh and fine floral tendrils.\nFacing: bias cut cotton twill; two different types.\nMaterials and Techniques: cotton yarn, silk thread, weaving, embroidering, printing, sewing",
