The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London. \n\nThe three fern-like stems could be three feathers emerging from a bow and resemble an aigrette which is an ornament in imitation of a plume of feathers.  This design is the same as another in the group (E.266-1973) which suggests that it might have been in demand by clients.  Perhaps the aigrette design was associated with the three plumes of feathers, symbol of the Prince of Wales.  This design might have been for Court dress.",
