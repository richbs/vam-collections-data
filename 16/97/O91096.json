These were models for bronze mounts made in the first half of the 19th century for use on furniture and in the interior decoration of the Spanish Royal Palaces around Madrid. The Spanish Royal Arms appear on one of the largest rectangular reliefs together with a design which is repeated with some variations on another example. This latter design appears on the central plaque of a table at the 'Palacio de Madrid.' A suite of rooms, fitted up by Angel Maeso between 1815 and 1830, is also decorated with small octagonal plaques in the same style. All the work was done by the Royal Workshop including a goldsmith and ironsmith called Ignacio Millan who may have been responsible for the mounts.",
