            "public_access_description": "This poster is an excellent example of Soviet, so-called \"red\", propaganda. To commemorate 15 years of Soviet rule, this poster was produced. In the upper section, it boasts how Soviet productivity is steadily on the rise, while during the same period in America, the stock market crash led to the Great Depression. The timing of the Depression provided the perfect platform for showcasing capitalism's shortcomings. Many Americans were plunged into abject poverty at the time. Note the smiling faces of the healthy Soviet proletariat versus long queues of the American unemployed. The bleak American future is predicted by accompanying graphs and tables. Part of the text reads:\n\"Industry's aim is not to better the material level of the working class but to guarantee huge capitalist profit. / Gross National Income is not divided in the interests of the working class but in the interest of exploiters as a way to maximise profit.\"\nOf course, this rhetoric does not mention that this same Soviet productivity surge was in no small part due to the brutal totalitarian regime under which a great many suffered. This poster would have been displayed in public places to capture the imaginations of impressionable youth who would seize on the contrasts between Soviet success and American hardship, though the quoted figures were completely fabricated.",
