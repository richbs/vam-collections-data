However, it was a post of the utmost honour and there was seldom any lack of volunteers. If the officer survived, he was virtually assured of promotion: the sergeants could normally expect battlefield commissions: the soldiers got nothing. One of those who volunteered at the siege of Cuidad Rodrigo and again at Badajoz was Edward Costello of the 95th Rifles.",
