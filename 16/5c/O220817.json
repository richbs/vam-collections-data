In Italy the crosses worn with traditional costume are usually very decorative, and were often worn with matching earrings.  The design of this cross comes from France, where it is called a croix Jeanette, or croix \u00e0 la Jeanette (John's cross).  Its name comes from the fact that it was often bought by servant girls with their first pay packet.  Servants were traditionally hired on St John's day.  Almost every French woman would have worn one in the 19th century.  \n\nCrosses of this design often found their way to neighbouring countries, particularly Italy.  This one was acquired in Sicily, but it has the gold mark of \u2026  In France, women usually wore these crosses on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  Italian women preferred to hang them from a gold chain, or a necklace of coral beads.\n\nThis cross was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
