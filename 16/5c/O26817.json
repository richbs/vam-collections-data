In the case of horse cards which have alternative numbers, either number may be played. \nWhen a player has disposed of all his cards, the remianing players count up the numbers on their cards and the player with the lowest score after a fixed number of games is the winner.\n\nDEALING\nThe dealer for the first game is decided by each player cutting from the pack.  The player who cuts the lowest number is the dealer for the first game.  The player on the left of the dealer will afterwards deal for the next game and so on.\n\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS\nIf there are two or three players, six cards are dealt to each player, but for four or five players only five cards are dealt to each.  If more than five players, use two packs and deal six cards.  The remainder of the pack is then placed in the centre of the table face downwards.\n\nPLAY\nThe player on left of the dealer commences by placing a card on the table and the next player then follows by covering it with a card of the same kind, (aeroplane, train, ship, motor or horse) or alternately a card beaing the same number in the top corner.  If a player cannot follow he must pick up a card from the pack and must continue to pick up each turn until he has a card to play.  After a player has picked up a card, it must be understood that this completes his turn and he must wait for his turn again before putting a card down.\n\nTHE LIGHTNING CARDS\nFour cards can be played at any time and they also give the player an opportunity  to call the cards to follow, e g. a lightning card is played and the player cales `aeroplanes', if the next player has no aeroplane card he must pick up a card from the pack and all succeeding players must pick up until a player places an aeroplane on the pile.\n\nTHE EXTRA TURN CARD\nThis card can only be played by a player immediately after placing a card on the pile.  This is the only occasion when two cards may be played at one turn.  It is sometimes advisable tohold it back as it enables the next player to play any card he has in his hand.\n\nRemember it counts 20 against you if you are left with it when someone runs out.\n\nSCORING\nWhen a player has disposed of all his cards, the remaining players total the numbers in the corner of their cards and in the case of the horse cards which have alternative numbers, both figures must be added together.\n\nYou will enjoy played other Pepys Series Games - KARGO, PETER PAN, DUMBO\n\nCastell Brothers Ltd, london, 9-12 Bow Street, Covent Gardens, WC2\n                                Glasgow, 107 North Wallace Street, C4",
