Each recipe includes thoughts and memories in which domestic life is affectionately romaticised. In pun-laden language Ziranek tells of 'edible occasions' involving simple pleasures such as car-boot sales shopping for Tupperware containers and making chick-pea dip to fill them or cooking a meal for an old friend.The book is illustrated with black and white hotographs of 1950s ornaments, books, kitchen utensils and accessories taken from Ziranek's own collection and arranged by her into still lives. For those who want to cook rather than read, the recipes are given in a glossary at the end of the book.",
