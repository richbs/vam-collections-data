            "public_access_description": "The design of this ewer marks an important turning-point in Iznik ceramics. In the 1520s potters at the town in north-west Anatolia stopped using white on a blue ground and replaced it with blue decoration on a white ground. They expanded the range of colours to include turquoise (seen here on the neck) and later introduced black, sage-green and purple.\n \nThe small town of Iznik has given its name to some of the most accomplished ceramics produced in the Islamic Middle East. In the mid 15th century, potters there specialised in modest earthenware imitations of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. But in the 1460s or 1470s, under the patronage of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, they began to manufacture bowls, dishes and other pieces of fritware. These were elegant in shape and decoration and often very large.\n\nA number of large basins survive which were probably made as sets with equally large ewers. However, none of the ewers has survived. This smaller ewer shows what they may have looked like. Its angular shape was based on a metal ewer and it has been repaired with metal mounts after it was damaged.",
