Jars like this were traditionally used for storing the pickles and condiments that form an integral part of Korean cuisine, and were robust enough to be stored in the courtyard outside the house.\n\nFormed from fairly coarse clay, the body of the jar develops a distinctive reddish colour on firing. This is then enhanced by a thick brown glaze that gives the necessary level of impermeability. Both storage jars and tablewares are made in this way. Known as 'onggi', these everyday ceramics have a long history of production and use in Korea.",
