Serving Queen Anne, he later defeated the Franco-Bavarian army at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704.\n\nContinental artists first introduced enamel painting to England in the 17th century, however it became particularly fashionable in the early 18th century. The young German Christian Friedrich Zincke was one of the most important enamel painters of the period and went on to train other significant artists such as William Prewett and Jeremiah Meyer.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde  formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
