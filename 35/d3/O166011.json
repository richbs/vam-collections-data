On the upper sides are attached red and blue braids for 23 cms. which then extend on the left for 114.5 cm. and on the right for 112 cms.\n\nEND FINISH:   the lower end has 4 cms. of plain weave with cream weft and then red, turned and stitched.\n\nThe upper has 4 cms. of plain weave, the upper half with red weft and the lower half with cream.

The weft threads are bound in blocks of various colours into bundles of 6 to form a fringe of 55 cms. max.\n\nDESIGN: field: the top and the two pendants have a white ground.  The top has two bands of eight serrated leaves, each with an angular central curl in a contrasting colour.  Upper and lower leaves are paired by a linking stem which frames similar small leaves also containing curls.\n\nOn the pendants this design becomes a foliate meander with smaller secondary motifs.  Small pronged comb motifs are scattered throughout the field.  Within the field, at the bottom of the top panel and both pendants is a band of barred motifs outlined in dark red or dark brown.\n\nBorder: the border has a dark red ground with white diamonds alternating with paired intruding triangles.\n\nAn extra upper band has a reciprocal horned motif in red and dark blue with white florets.\n\nCatalogue date: 21.2.95",
