The text of a Sanskrit commentary is inserted in small Nagari characters in the margins. Central and marginal string-holes are decorated but not pierced and on the obverse of each folio the central hole only is marked. Folio numbers are written in the lower right-hand corner of the reverse of each folio but are defective from folio 85 onwards due to insect damage. The colophon is written in red on f.92 verso (see Marks).\nThis folio recto is illustrated with Risabha giving his possessions to the poor (above) and removing his hair in the presence of Indra (below).",

            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThis folio shows Rishabhanatha. Rishabhanatha or Adinatha was the first of the twenty-four Jinas. He was a great king who is credited with the invention of agriculture, fire, various arts and social institutions including marriage. Here, Rishabhanatha is renouncing the world to become a wandering ascetic on the quest for enlightenment. In the scene above, Rishabha gives away his possessions to an elderly man with a white beard, perhaps a Brahmin priest, before his initiation as a Jain ascetic. In the scene below, he plucks out his hair, which is collected by Shakra (Indra), chief of the gods.",
