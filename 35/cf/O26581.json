It has been known, under various names since the middle of the 15th century.  The present French name and terminology were adopted in English during the reign of Charles I of England.as a compliment to his French wife, Henrietta Maria.\n\nRules \nThe game is for two.  Each player aims to score points, both with certain combinations of cards in his hand and by playing for tricks.\nA deck of 32 playhing cards is used, commonly called a piquet deck.  This is a standard 52 card deck from which all 2s,3s,4s,5s and 6s have been removed.  Usually two decks are used alternately one being shuffled in readiness for the next hand while the other is being dealt into play.\nThe cards rank normally from 7 low to ace high.\nChoice of the first dealer is by low cut and the first dealer also has choice of seats.\nThe shuffle is normal and the cut is by the non-dealer.  There need be only two cards in each section.  Otherwise the cut is normal.  The deal is in packets of two cards, face down. The dealer gives two cards to his opponent, then two to himself until each has 12 cards.  The remaining 8 cards form the stock, which is placed face down in the centre of the table./  The stock is dividied so that the upper five cards rest at an angle to the lower three.\nThe dealer has the chance to discard first.  Under American rules, he need not discard; under English rules, he must discard at least one card.  In either case, the most cards he can discard is five.  If he is discarding, he places the discards face down beside him, and draws an equal number from the stock.  Players must draw cards in the order in which they are stacked in the stock.  Even if the dealer does not draw, or does not drawll all five, he may look at the cards tht he could have drawn and then replace them without showing them to his opponent.  Then the non dealer discards at least one card and at most as many cards as remain in the stock.  He places his discards face down beside him and draws an equal number of stock cards, beginning with any left by the dealer.  The non dealer may look at any cards in the stock that remain undrawn.  But in this case the dealer may turn these cards face up for himself to see also.  Sometimes it is ruled that the dealer may do this only after leading to the first trick.  A player may inspect his own discards during play.\nPoints are scored in two ways.  Some points are scored by declaration which occurs immediately after discarding and before play.  other points are scored during play.\nEach player declares certain combinations of cards held in his hand and scores points if his declaration ranks higher than his opponen's\n\nFOR FULL RULES AND DIRECTIONS SEE THE PHOTOCOPY TAKEN FROM THE WAY TO PLAY.",
