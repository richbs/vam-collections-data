This high-quality cast shares decorative elements with objects associated with the Alberghetti workshop in Venice but production by another foundry cannot be ruled out. The Alberghetti were a family of bronzecasters from Ferrara and were active primarily at Ferrara, Florence and Venice. In Venice they were located in the Arsenal (from the late 15th until the 19th century.\n\nThe rarity of its form and lack of comparable dated pieces make the dating of this vase difficult. A design for a vase of about 1515, possibly by Giovanni Antonio da Brescia, is similar in form, and a larger maiolica vase in the collection is also related. The position of the handles, however, differs from the maiolica piece. The facture also bears some comparison with the Museum's vase from the Cavadini foundry, which is datable to the 1820s or 1830s, and it is, therefore, also possible that this vase is a nineteenth-century cast.",
