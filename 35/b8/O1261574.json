The messages in the cards are brief but it gives a  small insight into family life.  The telegram message from Uncle Ernest reads: 'Up the Reds' as they are a  family of red heads.  \nGreeting cards to celebrate birth were available but usually only sent by close family members.  The  telegrams by nature are brief; these were mostly used as emergency communication but also to celebrate  events such as a birth.  There is some advertising material relating to baby goods, which may have been  given out with the telegrams.  This child was born at the beginning of the Second World War but probably  not at a point that materials were in short supply. \nGreeting cards have existed in many cultures during the past few hundred years but it was really in the  1850s that they gain popularity, as rather than being hand crafted one off pieces they were mass produced  and cheaply available and the introduction of the postage stamp made the postal service more reliable.   They saw another increase in the manufacture of cards in the 1930s with the introduction of coloured  lithography.",
