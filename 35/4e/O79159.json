It was valued at 1000 livres.\n\nA chandelier with dolphins is first mentioned in the inventory of the marchand merciers Francois Darnault, father and son, who traded from the Le Roy d'Espagne, a shop in the Rue de la Monnoie, Paris- this was taken on 28th August 1753. It is given the stock number 247 and as the total stock amounted to 4863, this indicates that it had been in Darnaults' possession for some years.(Paris, Minutier Central, LXXXVIII, 629). Darnault had started trading in 1715 in the Rue Grenier, St Lazare, a manufacturing quarter, as a mirror maker. His trade card (illustrated in Carolyn Sargentson, Merchants and Luxury Markets, 1996, p.23) preserved in the Getty Museum, lists amongst his stock 'Lustres a six, huits, & dix branches, de bronze cizele, dore d'or moulu, d'or en feuille, argente et en coleur d'or'.\n\nAndre Charles Boulle exhibition, Frankfurt RF.2009/38\n\nHistorical significance: The chandelier was examined by Dr Reinier Baarsen in July 2010 who commented on its fine casting, noting that it was of higher quality than the example in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.",

Such designs were inspired by models made in silver by the goldsmith Claude Ballin (1615-1678); see Stockhom, Nationalmuseum, inv.NM THC 813,814, 862. The Egyptian term model has similar supports for the branches to those used in this model with dolphins. The incorporation of dolphins has led to the suggestion that the model was created for the Grand Dauphin (1661-1711) but there is no evidence to confirm this. The Grand Dauphin's effects were sold and dispersed after his death.Other examples passed through the sale rooms in 1898, Paris, 9 May (ex collection d'Armaille and Paul Eudel) and London, Christie's 26 May 1902 (ex collection Bardini) Another model of a chandelier in the Regence style made in the 19th century passed through Christie's 12 June 2003 lot 1023.\nThe dolphin model was copied in the 19th century notably for William II of Germany and was recorded in the Royal Palaces, Berlin and Potsdam.",
