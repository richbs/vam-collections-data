Judy learned the act from her mother Eileen who performed with her from the time she was 15 in the late 1940s in an act called Levanda and Van. Judy was the grand-daughter of Edwin or Ted Moxon (1857-1945) who ran away from home to join the circus when he was 17, and travelled all over the world performing a foot-juggling act in circuses and variety theatres. He performed in Russia for 7 years, spoke several languages fluently and had 13 children. When they were mature enough the oldest two children were trained in foot juggling to become part of the family act, The Moxon Trio. Eileen later formed her own foot-juggling act, first with her brother, and then her daughter Judy.\n\n\nThis was given by Judy Moxon, along with a photographs, posters showing her grandfather's act, a pair of his stage costume trunks, and a programme for London Rhapsody at the Palladium Theatre, September 1937, illustrated with an image of her mother performing the act.",
