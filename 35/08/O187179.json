He made his first appearance on the London stage at the Aquarium in 1891, and after appearing at London's Oxford Music Hall in the same year, he was engaged for most of the leading halls. Robey was known for his  \u2018trademark\u2019 hat - a semi-clerical bowler - and enormous black eyebrows which he raised quizzically to great comic effect. He could make audiences cry helplessly with laughter just by coming on stage and looking at them, asking them to 'desist from this unseemly merriment'. He was one of the music hall performers to make the change from the halls and variety to revue, appearing in The Bing Boys Are Here at the Alhambra Theatre in 1916, followed by The Bing Boys on Broadway, also at the Alhambra, in 1918.  He received a knighthood in 1954, the year of his death.",
