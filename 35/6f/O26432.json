To begin, the 12 cups must each hold 4 markers (shells) .  The first player removes all the markers from one cup on his side and sows  them, one by one, anti-clockwise into the next 4 cups. Depending on which cup he plays from, some or all may be placed on his opponent's side of the board.  For example, if a player removes the markers from the 3rd cup from his left and deposits them as described, one marker will be placed in the first of the opponent's cups.  If his opponent then takes his turn.  Gradually the pieces are no longer evenly distributed and during a game, one cup may hold more than 20 markers.  So many pieces would go round the board more than once as they are sown into the cups, however, the emptied cup is missed and left empty until the next turn.\nThe aim of the players is to capture pieces in his opponent's cups.  This is done when the last piece sown falls into a cup on the opponent's side that already holds one or two pieces.  With the deposited piece, the total is then two or three which are then captured.  A capture can be made only with the last piece that is sown into a cup.  When the last piece falls into one of the opponent's cups, making a total of 2 or 3, the capturing player takes the pieces and places then in the reservoir.  Once a player has captured, he is further allowed to take the pieces from the immediately preceeding cup and likewise from the cups consecutively before it if 1- the cups are on the opponent's side of the board and 2-each cup containes the proper number of pieces to be captured, that is 2 or 3.\nThe game ends when all the cups of one player are empty and it is his turn to play.  A player may not leave his opponent's cups empty if he can still move pieces into them.  Nor is a player allowed to make a move that would capture every one of his opponent's piece, leaving him with nothing to play.\n\nRules placement: general rules",
