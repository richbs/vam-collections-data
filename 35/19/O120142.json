The titles, in order, are: Alpha, Bang, Flight, Repose, Retreat and Omega.  The artist describes 'Repose' as signifying accomplishment, satisfaction and culmination, with the pyramidal mount a mausoleum dedicated to the effort of all that has come before. The rose- enmeshed in a kind of enigmatic diagram-  aboved the mausoleum, is  intended to suggest that the Mausoleum signifies the secrets (as in 'sub rosa'), of the Universe and the fruitless yet noble quest to understand them.\n\n'Repose' was shown in 'Art and Cartography' at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1980 where the catalogue entry notes: \"According to the artist 'the struggle is over. The world and the universe are in harmony.' ....... O'Donohue Ros, like other contemporary artists in this country and in Europe, is turning increasingly to considerations of the environment, the physical and metaphysical reality of the universe and constructing abstract concepts on recognizable, tangible often topographical symols of this world.\"",
