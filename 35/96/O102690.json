Seal impressions were attached to written documents to authenticate them, just as a signature functions today. They were made of beeswax, usually coloured red, green or brown, and produced by a seal matrix, generally of metal, which was pressed into the softened wax. The matrix was often engraved with a badge, device or  coat of arms, since heraldic devices gave status as well as individuality. Royalty and the nobility used seal matrices made of gold or silver, or sometimes of copper alloy, and very occasionally of ivory. Merchants and institutions generally used copper alloy.",

The eagle with outstretched wings was an emblem of the Este family. The Latin inscription round the outer edge of the matrix identifies Alberto as ruler of Ferrara and Master General of the Holy Church. There is a pierced handle on the reverse onto which a larger wooden handle could have been fitted, so that the matrix could be held and easily pressed down into softened beeswax to make the seal impression. This impression was then attached to a letter or a document to authenticate it, just as a signature functions today.\n\n Like many wafering irons ( which were used to make waffles and wafers) this seal matrix can be seen as an example of a mould that was used to produce very shallow reliefs.",
