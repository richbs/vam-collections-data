            "physical_description": "Olympic torch of tapered form reducing towards the base and triangular in cross section. The walls, formed of a double skin, of anodised aluminium, coloured gold and entirely perforated with circular holes, laser cut.  The inner walls have 3,600 holes, the outer walls, 4,400 making 8,000 in total, one to represent each of the 8,000 torch bearers.  The triangular top and bottom caps of die-cast aluminium fix the inner and outer skins of the torch.  The burner mechanism which sits inside the top of the torch sits inside a triangular cage on a circular base; the walls perforated and the top with a single line of perforations along all three edges.  Beneath the circular platform is a vertical pipe connecting to the gas cylinder, containing a mixture of propane and butane gas (removed from this example for safety reasons); the mechanism attached to the side wall of the torch by a horizontal component which also serves as an on/off switch.  A stamped medallion of the London 2012 logo, again of anodised aluminium coloured gold is attached near the top to one of the walls.  The aluminium is finished in PVD (physical vapour deposition, a process to produce a metal vapour that can be deposited on electrically conductive materials as a thin highly adhered pure metal or alloy coating).  PVD coatings are generally used to improve hardness, wear and oxidation resistance.  Its heat resistance properties and ability to withstand the intense flame was of particular importance to this project.",

Deyan Sudjic, Director of the Design Museum, said, \"Nothing is harder to get right than designing for the Olympics.  The lightness and simplicity of BarberOsgerby's London 2012 Olympic Torch does just that.  The torch not only captures the spirit of London as Olympic host city but also demonstrates how design can celebrate traditional ideas in a modern way.\"",

            "history_note": "The design of the torch has both symbolic and practical aspects.  Triangular in cross section, the three sides represent symbolic values as well as having a practical function.  Multiples of three are found across the vision and delivery of the Olympic Games:\n\u2022The three Olympic values of respect, excellence and friendship;\n\u2022The three words that make the Olympic motto \u2013 faster, higher, stronger;\n\u2022The fact that the UK has hosted the Olympic Games three times \u2013 in 1908, 1948 and in 2012;\n\u2022The vision for the 2012 Olympic Games to combine three strands of work \u2013 sport, education and culture.\n\nThe triangular cross section of the torch also facilitated the runner\u2019s grip.  The inner and outer skins have a total of 8,000 holes (3,600 and 4,400 respectively), each hole represents one of the 8,000 participants in the torch relay.  Laser cut into the aluminium alloy, specially developed for the aerospace and car industry, the holes made the torch lighter to carry without any sacrifice to the metal\u2019s tensile strength, helped disperse the heat, allowed the flame to escape from the sides of the torch as well as the top which made it easier to see and also helped to ensure a good grip. The gold coloured finish id achieved by the PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) process, an industrial process used to plate taps and shower heads, gave the alloy heat resistant qualities and the ability to withstand the intense flame.\n\nPrototypes for the torch were worked up by Steve Ottewill and Robert Russell of Ottewill, designers and manufacturers of silverware and jewellery, a company, BarberOsgerby has worked with before.  Other companies involved in the development of the torch were the London 2012 partner, BMW, which provided the use of their climatic testing facility and the Basildon based product engineers, Tecosim.  It was Premier Sheet Metal of Coventry which manufactured the 8000 torches.\n\nThis particular torch was carried by Beth McKillop, Deputy Director of the V&amp;A on day 66 of the torch relay, 23rd of July, 2013 between Dunheved Road South and Midhurst Avenue on the Lewisham to Wandsworth leg through Croydon.  She subsequently presented her torch to the Museum.\n\nBeth McKillop's recollections of the day are as follows:\n\nI was nominated as a torch bearer by Samsung, who were Olympic sponsors. As you know, Samsung has supported Korean programmes and displays at the V&amp;A for over 20 years, and in the 1990s I was the Samsung curator of Korean Art at the V&amp;A.\n\nInitially I was unsure about accepting, because a less athletic person than me is hard to find. However I was persuaded by the enthusiasm of those around me - family and colleagues - that I should do it.\n\nSo on 23 July, a lovely sunny day, I set off for Crystal Palace where my fellow torchbearers and I changed into our white Olympic tracksuits, paid for our torches (in cash in my case) and set off in a special bus to carry the torch as far as Croydon. There was a strange, party atmosphere, with sponsors' vehicles promoting Cocacola and Lloyds Bank. Bright young people with consultancy and sporting backgrounds were much in evidence project managing the movement of the torch and its bearers from stage to stage - they had evidently been up and down across the country and were well practised.  I was one of the latter stage runners of the morning session of 23 July, so I experienced the extraordinary crowd scenes through South London from the bus - it seemed as if every person in town was lining the route. Many in the crowd looked as though they might be housebound or unwell - people of all ages were there, some clearly being looked after by carers or younger family members.\n\nThe other people carrying torches were mainly local 'good citizens' - people who do a lot for the community, and all round good eggs. There were one or two other 'cuckoos in the nest' like me, non locals - including a haughty American gentleman from the International Olympic Committee who made no attempt at all to fraternise.\n\nMy own family - parents, husband and sister, children and grandson - were all in the crowd, as were some lovely V&amp;A colleagues including Vernon Rapley who lives in Croydon. When I got out the bus, I was overwhelmed with people, including the minders. Lots of jolly strangers thrust babies into my arms, so we could be photographed together with the torch. The digital photography of the torch relay must have generated millions of images. The operation ran minute-perfect, and I collected my torch, 'kissed' the torch of my predecessor and set off at a jog. Nervous that I would run out of puff before the end of my lap, I found that it was over before I noticed, and I was quickly 'kissing' my torch with that of my successor. The torch felt light and uplifting to hold. \n\nThen back on the bus, back to Crystal Palace, torch 'decommissioned' by having its lighter unit disabled, into the Athletics Centre to change and use the loo (despite the objections of the security guard who had been instructed to keep us out!) and home in a Samsung-provided car. Friends and family came over for a scratch picnic assembled by my family and everyone took a turn of holding the torch - including my proud mother.\n\nLater, I brought the torch into the V&amp;A and lots of members of staff came to have a look at it - that was fun. I decided to donate the torch to the museum, because it was as a result of my work at the V&amp;A that Samsung nominated me to take part in the torch relay. I wish it to be a gift from my daughter, Lucy Couillaud and my son, Joe McKillop.\n\nBMcK\n\nBeth McKillop\nDeputy Director\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nLondon SW7 2RL",
