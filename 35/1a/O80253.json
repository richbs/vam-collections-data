They were taken to demonstrate a finished article made by the wooden mould. The three identical pressings have been applied to a backing board in the shape of a section of cornice (the moulding at the junction of the walls and ceiling in a room).\n\nMaterials & Making\n'Compo' was made of a mixture of glue, rosin (made from the resin of coniferous trees), linseed oil and whiting (powdered chalk).  It  was pressed into an oiled mould and squeezed in a screw press.  The pressing could be removed from the mould while still flexible, to fit onto a shaped backing such as in this example.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAcanthus leaves were a standard feature of architectural decoration after about 1780.  They were thought suitable for  Neo-classical interiors because they had been found in surviving buildings from ancient Greece and Rome. Such features would have been used on the architectural features of a room such as the cornice, panelling or fireplace.",
