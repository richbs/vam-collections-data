John's father Frederick had specialised in river views in Devon, trying to represent accurately in his paintings and etchings the tangled banks, rocks and pools. It seems that this aspect of the landscape also fascinated his son John, as several of his scenes of fishing have intricately observed riverbanks as part of the composition. When this painting was acquired in 1920, it was assumed that its subject was a Scottish river, yet it now looks similar to other Devon drawings that the younger Lewis had done on the Tamar and other rivers in the Southwest.",
