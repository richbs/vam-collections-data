The figure wears a coronet (karanda makuta), and the siras cakra (disc behind the head for hanging garlands) is flower like. She wears a striped lower garment secured with girdle and sash, the former with long beaded ties or end-pieces extending between the legs, and the latter tied in projecting bows at the hips. Other details include a beaded harness (channavira), keyura armlets worn higher than usual, elbow bracelets with projecting ornaments, extended ear lobes without pendants, an anklet on the left foot only, and the padasaras on the feet. A marriage symbol (tali) is worn above the three necklaces. The figure is fixed on a circular lotus pedestal which is cast in one piece with a rectangular base, the latter with upright tenons for the support of an arched-surround or torana (now missing) and projecting rings for processional carrying. The upright tenons are supported by small rampant lions. The base is heavily patinated, whilst the figure is coated  with red oxide or copper, probably produced by burning.",

            "public_access_description": "Bhu Devi is both the Earth-goddess and the second wife of Visnu. As Visnu's consort, \nshe attends Visnu along with Sri Devi. When displayed in a shrine these images would be grouped, with Sri Devi to Visnu's right, and Bhu Devi at his left side. When taken out for processional use they may travel as an ensemble, or each alone in their own dedicated palanquin or temple car, thus asserting their independent identities. The slightly flexed figure of the Devi is holds in her raised left hand a blue-lotus (nilotpala) bud (kataka mudra); the right arm is extended in lola hasta. The goddess wears a conical crown (karanda makuta), strings of pearls and abundant jewellery. The marriage symbol (tali) is worn above the three necklaces. Her tightly drawn waist-cloth is secured with belt and sash which projects bows at the hips.\n\n The figure is fixed on a circular lotus pedestal which is cast in one piece with a rectangular base, the latter with upright tenons for the support of an arched-surround (prabha, now missing), and projecting rings for securing with cord during processional use. The upright tenons are supported by small rampant lions. The patination of the bronze confirms that this is an excavated image. It formed part of a cache of bronze images discovered at Coimbatore and presented to Lord Curzon of Kedleston during his term as Viceroy of India, between 1898 and 1905.",

Original text submitted in English reads:\n\n2: 24. Sri  Devi\nCopper Alloy; 54 cm high\nIndia, South, from Coimbatore, 11th century CE\nVictoria and Albert Museum IM.149-1927, bequeathed by Lord Curzon of Kedleston\n\n2: 25. Bhu Devi\nCopper alloy; 50.5 cm high\nIndia, South, from Coimbatore, 11th century\nVictoria and Albert Museum IM.137-1927, bequeathed by Lord Curzon of Kedleston\n\n\nThese standing figures of Sri Devi and Bhu Devi were both designed to accompany an image of ViSnu. When displayed in a shrine, such figures were usually arranged with Sri Devi on ViSnu\u2019s right and Bhu Devi on his left, although curiously Bhu Devi\u2019s posture in this example is in the manner commonly used for a goddess standing on his right, so it is possible she originates from a slightly different iconic grouping. The images would also have been used as utsava-murtis, festival images taken out in procession from the shrine, and the projecting hoops on each base would then have been used to secure the figures to a temple chariot or a palanquin.  The two upright prongs on the base on which each goddess stands would have been used to support an arched surround or prabha.\nBoth Sri Devi and Bhu Devi stand in a flexed pose, showing the idealised female form. The goddesses stand with their left hands raised and holding a lotus, in the kataka mudra. They are adorned with jewellery and the small ornament on a chain above their necklaces is a thali, which is given to women in South India on marriage. The goddesses also wear conical crowns, the karandamukuTa, commonly seen on consort images. \nThe two goddesses are, however, distinguishable by the difference in size. Sri Devi is depicted slightly taller than Bhu Devi, though with a more slender build. Sri Devi also wears a breast band, whilst Bhu Devi is shown bare breasted, a common feature on images of the goddess. \nWhilst the two goddesses appear very similar they have differing, although complementary, roles. Bhu Devi is often connected with the Vedic goddess Prithivi, frequently mentioned in Vedic hymns as a stable and fertile presence, and seen as the embodiment of the earth. Rarely worshipped in her own right, Bhu Devi is normally shown either, as in this example, alongside Vishnu and his other consorts, or as the earth goddess rescued by ViSnu\u2019s boar incarnation, Varaha. Most sculptures of Varaha have a small female figure, either being held or holding on to his tusk, as the god rises out of the waters (see cat no. 2: 12). \nSri Devi is strongly connected to Vishnu\u2019s other consort LakSmi. Sri Devi is, like LakSmi, believed to bring prosperity and good luck and is widely worshipped across India. Sri Devi is also considered to act as a mediator, listening to the prayers of devotees and passing them on to the distant and transcendent Vishnu.\nThe two goddesses bring together those qualities needed to aid ViSnu\u2019s role as a stabiliser and maintainer of the universe: fertility, prosperity and good luck. \nThese figures were created during the CoLa dynasty, which ruled much of South India during the 9th - 13th centuries CE. Having been buried at some point, perhaps in a time of danger, and later excavated, they were among a hoard of bronzes found at Coimbatore and presented to Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India from 1898 to 1905.\n\nCam Sharp Jones and Nick Barnard",
