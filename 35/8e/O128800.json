He has worked in various media - including kinetic sculpture, film, performance, and the making of environments - but the constant in his work has been drawing, either as a working tool, as a means of recording and observing, or as an end in itself. For Martin, drawing is a system of signs analogous to those of language, and also an intellectual process of enquiry, analysis and proposition. \n\nHis gift of drawings spans his career from the time he was a student in the 1960s, until the 1990s. This drawing, \u2018Reflections on Movement, 1989-90, ostensibly an abstract piece, continues his ongoing concerns with expressing \u2013 indeed embodying - action, energy and movement through the medium of drawing.
