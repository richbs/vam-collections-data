He wears a lace-edged shirt ad fingers the material with his right hand. He may have died young, if the design on the reverse represents a coffin. He subject is almost certainly a son of Elizabeth Eyre, whose portrait was dated in the same year, 1700 and her husand, Charels Nicholas Eyre. He is believed to have waited upon Queen Anne. \n\nThe same image was used as a model for a  Wedgewood portrait medallion. \n\nThis is the earliest dated portrait by the artist David Le Marchand in the museum's collections. David Le Marchand was one of the most important sculptors in ivory in the early 18th century. He was a native of France, and probably trained as an ivory-carved in Dieppe. He came to Britain at an early age, and all his known work was done in this country. Portraits in ivory were fashionable in the 17th and 18th centuries. Generally elephant or walrus ivory was used.",
