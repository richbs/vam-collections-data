Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Wyndham and sister of Charles, second Earl of Egremont, was in fact married in 1749 to George Grenville (b. 1712; d. 1770), the Statesman. It is possible that the William Pitt represented is not Chatham but a contemporary of the same name. Burke's Peerage of 1880 under Lord Rivers records a William Pitt who died without issue in 1774. He was the eldest son (by his second marriage) of George Pitt, M.P. of Strathfieldsaye, who died in 1734.\nThe authorship of this finely carved piece is unknown. It is in the tradition of the works of David Le Marchand, and may be by a Continental sculptor working in Britain.",

Bought from him at Sotheby's for \u00a311, on 3 November 1955, lot 13. from a collection of ivory portrait medallions belonging to S. Hand Esq., deceased. Said to have been formerly in the Pitt Rivers Collection, which was that of General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pit Rivers (1827-1900), though it does not appear to have been listed in his manuscript catalogue. It was catalogued at Sotheby's as follows: lot 13: An interesting plaque of William Pitt and his young wife Elizabeth Windham in the year of their marriage 1736, superbly carved in full relief, both heads facing each other......., inscribed on the back.",

Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Wyndham and sister of Charles, second Earl of Egremont, was in fact married in 1749 to George Grenville (b. 1712; d. 1770), the Statesman. It is possible that the William Pitt represented is not Chatham but a contemporary of the same name. Burke's Peerage of 1880 under Lord Rivers records a William Pitt who died without issue in 1774. He was the eldest son (by his second marriage) of George Pitt, M.P. of Strathfieldsaye, who died in 1734.",
