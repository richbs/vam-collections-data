The United States entered the War against Germany, Italy, Japan and their allies at the end of 1942 and by 1943 substantial numbers of US soldiers, sailors and airmen were stationed in Britain.\n\nBy that time Britain was in the fourth year of the War and her population, cities and ports had suffered almost nightly aerial bombardment. This scarf is interesting because it shows how one designer wanted to portray the spirit of London, and Britain, to its new ally. The main sights of the capital are here and the US Embassy has been included to appeal to the potential buyers. The armed forces of many nations found a temporary home in Britain shown by the French figure in this design together with a kilted Scots soldier.  There are also two soldiers of the Home Guard, a typical policeman and a bowler-hatted businessman.",
