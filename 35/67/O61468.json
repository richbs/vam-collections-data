The Cabinet Maker & Art Furnisher reviewed the exhibition and praised George Jack's cabinet which was also illustrated in the journal, 'a cabinet in Italian walnut is thoroughly commendable both as regards design, carving, and workmanship.'\n\nThe panels were carved separately and later combined by cabinet-maker, William Thatcher, to form a piece of furniture, which explains their disparate subject matter.  The inscription along the top and bottom edges of the central panel reads 'Hunting and slaying is my praying, my life is the dove's betraying G. J. 1892'. Birds of all kinds recur in Jack's carving, while the flowers and foliage of the side panels and the gnome in the centre of the lower panels are reminiscent of his textile designs.",
