An unusual group of Siva and Parvati, with Ganesa beside them, shows the god and goddess engaged in animated conversation. Comfortably seated at ease (sukhasana), each on a cushion, their figures turn toward each other. Siva's raised right hand makes emphatic whatever he may be discoursing on, while their raised chins and smiling countenances show their genial detachment. Nandin couchant, ecstatically listening, lets his small figures serve as Siva's footstool, while a calmly watchful lion renders the same service to the goddess. To Siva's right, Ganesa is installed on his own pedestal stemming from the throne of Siva and Parvati. Each of the figure has a large, oval nimbus (sirascakra); Siva's and Parvati's are ornamented with two flames rising symmetrically at the sides and a large jewel device surmounting the top. Siva's trident (trisula), a mighty standard, festively decorated, rises between god and goddess as the central object of the group.\n\nA duct connects Parvati's nimbus with the trident, the corresponding duct on Siva's side is broken.",

The quality and scale of this example suggests that it was commissioned by a person of some importance.\n\nIt shows Shiva and Parvati, accompanied by Ganesha (the elephant-headed god) and Nandin (a bull-calf), a subject otherwise known as \u2018Uma-Mahesvara\u2019. The lively image, in which Shiva and Parvati appear to be engaged in animated conversation, is dominated by the Shiva\u2019s splendid trident (\u2018trisula\u2019). Festively decorated it occupies the centre of the composition. Here it appears as an integrated form and resembles a flaming spear, a distinctive type not widely seen in India.\n\nThe divine couple are seated together on cushions, each framed by a large flaming aureole (\u2018sirascakra\u2019). Shiva is in an aroused state, his penis erect (but damaged). Both hold unidentified objects in their raised hands. In the case of Shiva it is a tapering form, which might perhaps be Ganesha\u2019s missing tusk.\n\nGanesha appears on a lotus-stem support, supplementary to the scene. Nandin, who willingly supports Shiva\u2019s pendant foot, listens attentively to Shiva\u2019s discourse. Parvati similarly rests her foot on a seated lion. Both figures are finely modelled and conform to sastric conventions of ideal beauty. Shiva is broad-shouldered and sits upright. Parvati is slender with full breasts and rounded hips.",
