This central diamond contains a small-scale and squashed Herati pattern in which the diamonds are red with a central 8-petalled rosette.  Below is a palmette in red outlined in black and above is a palmette in light red outlined in purple.  The curling leaves are light blue with stripes of purple, black, yellow, red and green.  Those below are outlined in black; those above in red.  The red field is covered with the same pattern in different colours: the diamond is green with a light blue 8-petalled rosette in the centre.  The palmette below is light blue outlined in yellow and the one above is light blue outlined in black.  The curling leaves below are white with stripes in purple, black, yellow, red, green and those above are light blue with the same stripes; neither is outlined.  The lower diagonals of the central diamond medallion have been adjusted as they were being woven.\n\nMAIN BORDER: black ground with a green and red tulip-like flower alternating with a yellow and red triangle.  Both motifs are alternately inward and outward facing.  In the side borders these motifs have toothed outlines.\n\nINNER AND OUTER BORDERS: light blue ground with red hexagons alternating with purple ones.  In the side borders these become more diamond shapes and are adjoining.  Upper outer border partially missing.  All the vertical borders are toothed at the sides.",
