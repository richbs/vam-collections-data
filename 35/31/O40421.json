The crab appears to have been cast from life. According to the obituary of the sculptor in the Art Journal, the figure depicts a Venetian fisher-boy.\n\nHenrietta Montalba (1856-1893) was the youngest of four artist-sisters. She followed many art forms but was most successful in sculpture, which she studied at South Kensington. The Montalba family moved to Italy, where she continued studying at the Scuola delle Belle Arti in Venice. When still in London she worked under Jules Dalou, when he himself was residing in London. The larger proportion of her work were portrait busts which she mainly executed in terracotta.",
