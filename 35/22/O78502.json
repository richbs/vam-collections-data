Apostle spoons were highly popular from about the 1450s, when they appear in a range of standard designs available from specialist spoonmakers.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe popularity of spoons - the least expensive means of possessing or giving silver - is indicative of the spread of silver to a broader society during Tudor times. A single spoon was an acceptable gift up to the 17th century, when the custom fell out of favour except at christenings; by that time spoons were no longer the main eating tool.  Apostle spoons were commonly given as baptismal presents. According to Edward Howes, writing in 1631,  it was a Tudor innovation for godfathers and godmothers to give plate 'as spoons, cups and such like' to the child.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe choice of Apostle seems not to be connected to the name of the baptised, but more likely to that of a local saint. St Peter, to whom Exeter Cathedral in Devon is dedicated, frequently graces West Country Apostle spoons of the period, such as this one. In other cases, however, the Apostle is unidentified, with no particular emblem or attribution.",
