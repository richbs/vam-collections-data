These carriages were often designed to be pulled rather than pushed, since they developed from horse-drawn carriages.  Some children's carriages had two shafts for a pony; others, like the one seen here, had one, which would probably have been pulled by a servant.\n\nConservation work on the wheels has revealed that they were originally red and at some point in the nineteenth century were painted black.  The black paint may have been applied out of respect for Prince Albert's death in 1861, but children's playthings and equipment were often repainted, and the change of colour may have been for convenience, or even caused by a lack of somebody with the necessary skill to replicate the original colour scheme.",
