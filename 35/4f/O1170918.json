            "history_note": "Items purchased by Barbara Cavanagh at a Sotheby's sale earlier in 1997 in a lot comprising several great bills from Richmond, which were bought from her by Richmond Library.  This is a particularly interesting bill with regard to the history of the Richmond Theatre Royal. The Biographical Dictionary records that Haymes, who played Kilmallock in 'The Mountaineers', had been lessee of the theatre from 9 June to 31 October 1797 at a fee of 105 pounds.  The manuscript lease is in the Richmond Library. The season was not a financial success, partly because of Mrs Jordan's high fees in September, and perhaps because 'of the unpopularity of the manager Haymes, who from some domestic condition or other, is perpetually bringing out women of loose character, who are enabled to pay him for their own theatrical diversion.' The BD records that Mrs Haymes had milliner's shops in London and Brighton as well as that adjoining Richmond Theatre (see bill) and it is probable that Mr & Mrs Haymes lived in the house adjoining the theatre. When Haymes was declared bankrupt the paper referred to him as the 'haberdasher' but it is probable that Mrs Haymes was a successful businesswoman and her millinery and dresses made theatre management a possibility for her husband. It sets the social scene, with the fashionable people of Richmond calling at the shop for their purchases and their theatre tickets. Associated Production: The Mountaineers, No Song No Supper. Richmond Theatre, Surrey. 22.8.1797. Performance category: drama.",
