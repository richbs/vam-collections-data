A pen  plotter is a mechanical drawing \u2018arm\u2019 that holds a pen or a brush, which is  linked to a computer.  A computer program would be written by the artist, often in collaboration with a computer programmer, and this would act as a set of instructions that would drive the pen across the drawing surface and dictate its route.  Plotter drawings are always linear, although close cross- hatching can enable plotter drawings to simulate an expanse of block colour.",
