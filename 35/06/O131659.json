He produced bodegones (genre scenes), religious paintings and portraits. He became from 1623 court painter of King Philip IV of Spain for whom he painted many state portraits. Although he had no immediate followers, his son-in-law, Juan Bautista Mart\u00ednez del Mazo (1613-1667), can be considered as his disciple.\n\nThis painting is a copy after Velazquez'  The Triumph of Bacchus, or the Drunkards, dated 1628-1629 and currently preserved in the Prado, Madrid. It depicts a scene of drunkards, one of them being crowned by Bacchus, the god of Wine, who appears here accompanied by satyrs. It combines thus a mythological subject with a genre scene, which precise meaning is still subject to debate. The copy was probably made in the late 19th century.",

It depicts the god of Wine, Bacchus, seated on a barrel, crowned with grape leaves and accompanied by satyrs, crowning a young soldier surrounded by a group of peasants drinking. It has been variously suggested that it represents a Flemish f\u00eate; a scene from the picaresque novel <i>Vida y hechos de Estebanillo Gonz\u00e1lez</i>; or a bodeg\u00f3n (the Spanish term for a genre painting), illustrating the capacity of wine to console.\n\nThe original work demonstrates an use of colour which Velazquez learned from the work of Rubens and the sixteenth-century Venetians, as well as a knowledge of Caravaggio.",
