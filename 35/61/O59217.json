The design was executed for a production of George Balanchine's ballet \"Night Shadow\", performed by Ballet Rambert at Sadler's Wells, July 18th 1961.  The music, based on themes from the operas of Vincenzo Bellini, was composed by Vittorio Rieti.  The cast included Lucette Aldous, Norman Morrice, and June Sandbrook.  The ballet was revived several times by the company, including performances at Sadler's Wells in July 1964.\n\nThe ballet (also known as \"La Sonnambula\" in some versions), was originally performed by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in New York, 1946.",
