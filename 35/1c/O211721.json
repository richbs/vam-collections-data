Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a skelton beating a wooden bell (mokugyo).\n\nThe mokugyo is used to accompany the chanting of Buddhist scriptures and services, including those for the dead. The combination of a religious utensil and skeleton should be interpreted, not as a gruesome memento mori, but as an instance of the irreverent humour which was responsible for netsuke of badgers as teamasters and demons as Buddhist monks.",
