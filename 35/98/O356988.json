The triangular front panel of the bodice is outlined with three lines of puffed and gathered silk gauze trimming mounted on muslin, which also trims each side of the centre back, and is filled in with interlaced satin bands similarly mounted.\n\nThe front seams of the skirt are faced with satin and stitched halfway down. On each seam is a triangular muslin trimming bound round the edges with satin, and trimmed on three sides with knotted silk satin fringe. The hem is faced with a padded white satin rouleau and above is a wide border of gathered gauze motifs, like those on the bodice, arranged in a scroll pattern above the hem with diagonal bands, lined by a scroll, rising from it. The scroll and motifs have leaf-shaped trimmings of wooden shapes wound round with silk, and the whole is mounted on net, of different quality from the dress.\n\nThe sleeves are long and trimmed at the wrist with interlaced bands of satin mounted on muslin like those on the bodice. They are puffed at the shoulder, held inside with silk ribbon and stiffened with wires covered with white satin. Similar silk gauze motifs to those on the skirt trim them and continue down the upper arm. Over the shoulders is an epaulette bordered with knotted silk satin fringe and trimmed in the centre with an oval motif of satin rouleau and blond. Similar edges the neck and cuffs.\n\nThe dress fastens at the centre back with bronze strip hooks and eyes at the neck and waist. Around the neck is a silk drawstring. The dress is lined with self-material. Appliqu\u00e9 trimming.",
