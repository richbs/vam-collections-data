It references the Boer War (1899-1902), as well as violent and inflammatory incidents from recent days' and weeks' press cuttings. The frequent use of exclamation marks is meant to convey outrage. The text repeatedly seeks to stress that the British enemy rewards inhumanity and disregards the value of German life. Such a poster was meant to disturb the German public and cause them to turn further against enemy nations.",
