Like other English examples of this time, this virginal is decorated with a naively painted landscape, and the soundboard is decorated with flowers like contemporary examples from Antwerp. The virginal--the name is of uncertain derivation--is a keyboard instrument that can be either rectangular or polygonal, and its strings, which are plucked by quills, run roughly parallel to the keyboard.",
