They were seeking a fresh approach to colour but preferred to work with traditional rather than new materials creating a truly unique style and technique. \n\nRos Conway met the painter Hugh O'Donnell with whom she collaborated for several years at the exhibition 'British Art Now' in New York in 1980.  In her interpretations of Hugh O'Donnell's paintings and collages she moved from working in different coloured golds to the wider palette of enamels and a more painterly technique.\n\nRos Conway studied at Central School of Art and Design and the Royal College of Art. In 1980 the Crafts Council funded her studies with Jane Short, from whom she gained the skills and fascination for enamels. Today she has taken enamelling a step further and works in p\u00e2te de verre. The V&A held an exhibition of her work in 1984.",
