The garment is full-length and unwaisted with five breaths of material gathered onto a deep semi-circular yoke. There is a rounded cross cut collar which reaches to the points of the shoulders and below it a rounded cross cut waist-length cape. The sleeves are full-length and medium full, tightly gathered at the shoulders and at the deep cuff at the wrist. At the centre back waist, there is a panel of tight gathering, through which pass four white tapes, joining at each end to a single wider white tape which can be joined to form a waistband. The garment fastens with four self covered buttons with their buttonholes on concealed tags. The cuffs, yoke, collar and cape are all piped. The hem has a deep turn-up. The bodice, yoke and sleeves are lined with white cotton.",
