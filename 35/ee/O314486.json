They acted as a focus for personal devotion and were thought to protect the family from harm. \n\nImages of the Virgin and Child were believed to have talismatic and protective properties. Some compositions, particularly those associated with miracle-working images, became very popular and were widely reproduced.\n\nAntonio Rosselino (1427-28 - 1479) was the brother of Bernardo Rossellino, from whom he possibly received his first formal training. He was of the same generation of sculptors as Desiderio da Settignano and Mino da Fiesole and his stylistic approach resembles that of those sculptors rather then that of his brother.",
