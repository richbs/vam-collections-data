These were adopted by Turkish weavers during the late 15th century.\n\nThis carpet was made in Usak, in western Turkey, a major centre of carpet production. Weavers there began to use new designs based on medallions of different types during the reign of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror (1451\u20131481). Mehmet himself probably commissioned these designs. They were then used in commercial production for several centuries afterwards.",
