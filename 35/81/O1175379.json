Mr and Mrs Kean were typical of many actors and actresses in that they married someone also in the theatre profession.  After her marriage, Ellen changed her professional name from 'Ellen Tree' to 'Mrs Charles Kean', reflecting the theatrical partnership in which both managed and acted in their own productions.",
