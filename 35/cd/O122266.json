By the turn of the century the pattern had almost become a trade mark along the sea routes to Europe and inevitably the Persian potter adopted it and adapted it to decorate bowls as well as dishes. Persian potters would frequently alter the aster pattern by adding original details. For example by adding new motifs in the centre of dishes or adding outside decoration as can be seen in this dish.",

Iranian potters were almost exclusively preoccupied with making wares in the styles of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain some close copies and some more fanciful. Echoes of earlier traditions remained, in particular in the black-under-turquoise colour scheme that dates back in Iran to the end of the 12th century. Towards the end of the 16th century there was a widening of interest that blossomed in the 17th century to a wide range of styles and techniques in which blue and white plays a dominant but not exclusive role.",
