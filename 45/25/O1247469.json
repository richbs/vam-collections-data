The dress has a stiffened nylon lining and a full skirt. Originally this dress would have been worn with a full and voluminous petticoat beneath. The dress has a simple high round neckline, fitted bodice with darted seams on the back and the front, a fitted waist and then flaring out with a full skirt. The sleeves are a form of capped sleeve with two curved overlapping sections joining at the top shoulder seam. The front of the bodice has a pink ribbon detail forming a low 'V' across the bust and is finished with a small pink bow of matching satin fabric at the point. The shape of this detailing is repeated on the skirt with 4 joined V shapes, forming a zig zag, each finished with a pink satin bow around the skirt at about hip level. This detailing accentuates the fullness and movement of the skirt. There are an additional 4 bows in the same pink satin that are stitched on to the lower portion of the skirt. The hem of the dress is finished with a cream / white braid. There is a metal zip down the proper left hand side seam of the dress and two openings along the shoulder seams, fastened on each side by a small metal press studs. \n[underskirt] Cloak made of a heavy synthetic material in a cream colour. The cloak is lined with a simialr type of fabric in a bright pink, which matches ribbon and bow details on the associated dress. The cloak has a double thickness upturned collar of gathered cream material. The gathered material collar then forms a bordered edge for the rest of the cloak. There is a parallel detailing of applied cream braid which follows the gathered edge of the cloak. the back of the collar has applied cream rope braid which forms a loop to sit around the neck loosely to keep the cloak attached. This is finished off with two tassel details, one on either side of the inside of the collar. the braid and tassles appear to be those used in upholstery, as does the weight of the fabric used for the cloak. Inside on the pink lining another strip of cream flat braid is used to decoratively add an inner border to the clock. Originally, it appears from associated photographs (in registered file) that two pink satin bows, matching those on the dress were sewn to the end of the cloak's train. These are now loose and seperately part numbered.",

This type of festival took place annually in many British rural towns and villages. This dress was worn for the Egerton Rose Queen festival and was hosted by the local cricket club in 1958. \n\nAt the time, the village, which is now part of Greater Manchester, housed workers from local bleaching and dying firms. The festival was an event that the whole community would turn out for, and involved a parade through the streets of the village culminating with a coronation of a local girl as the Rose Queen, who would then join the parades at other villages\u2019 festivals. \n\nThe dress was made by a local dressmaker and was designed to compete with the other local Rose Queens, so was extensively embroidered and draped in ribbons and bows with a full skirt and an impressive and heavy cloak over 3.5 metres in length.",
