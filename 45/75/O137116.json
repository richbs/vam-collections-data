The luxurious sheen of the handle with the lapis lazuli finial and the confidence of the triangular boss and anticlastic curve similarly recall the opulent Art Deco style. The piece is bought to life through the fluidity of the metal, the rich finishing and bold style complement Callender's minimalist approach.",
