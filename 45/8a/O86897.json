It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe farce Springtime for Henry by Benn W. Levy was first produced in London at the Apollo Theatre in November 1932 with Ronald Squire, Jack Buchanan and Gilbert Miller. The week at Brighton was advertised as a visit of the 'actual production from the Apollo Theatre' with the West End Company. Ronald Squire first appeared on the stage in 1909 and by 1932 was a very well established actor with a string of West End parts to his credit. He went on to make many films in Hollywood including Around the World in 80 Days (1956) and The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958).",
