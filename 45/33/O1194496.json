The design shows the interior of a hatworks showing men in a workshop steaming, shaping and ironing top hats with the completed ones on a shelf above. It is known as 'La Chapellerie'. The porcelain service was meant to illustrate, in a picturesque way, the progress of technology through its application to different crafts.  \n\nKing-Louis Philippe bought the service and gave it to Prince von Metternich on 16th May 1836.",
