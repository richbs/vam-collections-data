It is intended to linger in the viewer's memory. This provocative dress and shawl were featured in Red or Dead's first catwalk fashion show in 1989. \n\nRed or Dead, founded by Wayne Hemingway in 1983, was heavily influenced by \"street style\" and aimed to offer non-elitist, affordable and creative style for all. They were first invited to show at London Fashion Week in 1989, where they presented their \"Space Baby\" collection for Spring/Summer 1990. The show closed with a traditional halter-neck, princess-line wedding gown with long train and matching ruffled shawl - made entirely in futuristic clear vinyl. In stark contrast to more traditional white silk fabrics, the dress is waterproof, wipe-clean, and hard-wearing. However, its transparency made it unsuitable for a religious ceremony. Its primary role was to act as a memorable close to the designers' first catwalk show.",
