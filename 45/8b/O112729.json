The subject is one of the many medieval coaching houses in the East End of London that were destroyed to make way for new railway lines and stations. St Paul\u2019s Cathedral is visible in the background, its 17th-century grandeur emphasising the ramshackle nature of the Oxford Arms\u2019 wooden galleries. Henry Dixon\u2019s photograph is not only a factual record, but also reflects the nostalgic appeal of the subject matter.",
