James of Bow Street, London, during his second London period when he lived in Bow Street, Covent Garden, from 1795 to 1800. \n\nIt advertises animals in Pidcock's menagerie at Exeter Change, an exhibition hall in London's Strand. The menagerie was divided into three rooms and included African lions, tigers, beavers, emus and ostriches. An advertisement referring to the two-headed heifer, or young cow on this token appeared in the 29th January 1791 edition of the London Chronicle. According to The Morning Chronicle in 1808, the animals could be viewed for a shilling a room, or all three rooms for two shillings and sixpence. Gilbert Pidcock began with a small travelling menagerie, but in 1793 bought the stock of Thomas Clark, a dealer in wild birds and animals who had the lease of Exeter Change. Pidcock kept his animals there but toured them to London fairs and the provinces during the summer. Pidcock died in 1810 aged 67, and was succeeded by Polito and then Cross. All the animals were removed to the Surrey Zoological Gardens in about 1828, after which Exeter Change was demolished.\n\nAn advertisement referring to the two-headed heifer as a live exhibit when they still belonged  to Thomas Clark appeared in the 29th January 1791 edition of the London Chronicle: 'Now  exhibiting at the Lyceum Strand. The surprising Heifer with two heads. This very remarkable  creature has two Heads, Four Horns, Four Ears, Four Nostrils, through each of which it breathes,  &amp;c. This truly wonderful Curiosity is the only one of the kind in Europe; and what is more  astonishing, it takes its Sustenance with both mouths at the same time, to the admiration of the  Faculty, and the Beholders in general; and it also the received opinion of John Hunter, Esq.,  Professor of Anatomy, that it has two hearts. One of the Heads, together with the Horns,  represents that of a bull, and the other a Cow. The height of the animal is thirteen hands, and  each Horn measures twenty-five inches long. Admittance One Shilling. N.B.- Most money given  for all sorts of foreign Beasts and Birds, if alive, by G. Pidcock. A capital collection of Wild Beasts,  with wagon, horses, &amp;c, to be sold. Enquire as above'.",

The surprising Heifer with two heads. This very remarkable creature has two Heads, Four Horns, Four Ears, Four Nostrils, through each of which it breathes, &c. This truly wonderful Curiosity is the only one of the kind in Europe; and what is more astonishing, it takes its Sustenance with both mouths at the same time, to the admiration of the Faculty, and the Beholders in general; and it is also the received opinion of John Hunter, Esq., Professor of Anatomy, that it has two hearts. One of the Heads, together with the Horns, represents that of a bull, and the other a Cow. The height of the animal is thirteen hands, and each Horn measures twenty-five inches long. Admittance One Shilling. N.B.- Most money given for all sorts of foreign Beasts and Birds, if alive, by G. Pidcock. A capital collection of Wild Beasts, with wagon, horses, &c, to be sold.
