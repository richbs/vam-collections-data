In the 1960s and 70s he became recognized for his political posters, which dealt with race, politics, and the Vietnam War. This print, then and now, was inspired by the 500-year anniversary of Columbus' voyage to America, and it aims to compare historical and contemporary imperialism.. The left panel is based on a 15th-century book depicting Spanish explorers slaughtering native Americans; the right-hand panel shows an appropriated photograph of media coverage of the Gulf War.",
