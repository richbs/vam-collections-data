These were chosen by eminent Korean potter and professor Shin Sang-ho, whose own work the Museum has been collecting since 1991.\n\nLee is one of several modern Korean potters for whom their nation\u2019s rich ceramic heritage, and especially that of the common people, is a fertile bed of inspiration. This work reveals his interest in punch\u2019ong ware \u2013 slip-decorated stoneware produced in the 15th and 16th centuries. After applying a grey\u2013green glaze characteristic of punch\u2019ong ware, Lee has liberally coated the walls with a semi-translucent slip (clay mixed with water), into which he has incised a bold abstract pattern. This is an interesting counterpart to a more common punch\u2019ong technique, whereby white slip is inlaid into the leather-hard clay itself.",
