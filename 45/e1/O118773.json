            "public_access_description": "This figurine of Dorothy Green (1886-1961) is one of several wax figurines executed by Agatha Walker in the 1920s, mostly of actors and actresses in character in successful London stage productions. The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers. Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents Dorothy Green as Mistress Ford in The Merry Wives of Windsor which opened at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith, on 22 December 1923 with Edith Evans as Mistress Page.  Dorothy Green was a very experienced Shakespearean actress having toured with Frank Benson's Company and also worked in Stratford with the New Shakespeare Company. Merry Wives was another notable production for Sir Nigel Playfair, the owner of the Lyric Theatre, who had purchased its lease when it was a derelict building in 1918 and transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",
