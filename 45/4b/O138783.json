With his battered opera hat decorated with a single, long-stemmed flower, and his striped pullover, the silent Bip became identified with Marceau in the same way that Charlie Chaplin's downtrodden little man became indelibly associated with Chaplin. Indeed, seeing Chaplin's act inspired Marceau's career.\n\nAlbert Houthuesen (1903-1979) was born in Amsterdam but came to London with his mother in 1912 after the death of his father.  After attending  the Royal College of Art, he became a teacher and subsequently a full-time artist.  His work covered a wide range of subjects and mediums but he always loved the theatre, dance and clowns. He was so enthusiastic about Marceau's work that he bought all the front row stalls seats one night during the run and invited his friends, on the condition that each guest bring a flower or posy which were to be thrown on stage for Marceau at the curtain-call.",
