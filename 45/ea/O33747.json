The top is of hardwood inlaid with ivory and features a curious juxtaposition of Christian religious motifs with animals and figures depicted in a provincial Mughal style. The centre of the table is inlaid with an inscription, 'Lovvado sea Osantissimo Sacramento' (Portuguese for 'Blessed is the Holy Sacrament'). This indicates that this table was used for adminstering the sacrament of Communion. The table was formerly thought to have been made for the Jesuit chapel at Lahore in that part of the Punjab which today lies in Pakistan. Although it was undoubtedly made for a new church somewhere in Asia, there is no evidence to suggest which one.",
