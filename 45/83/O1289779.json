Placement of the text associates the edges of the page with the walls of a room and each phrase corresponds loosely to the image it precedes, partially visible before the page is turned. Elements of a home environment are listed, conveying a sense of absence.\n\n'Home Manoeuvres' was published to coincide with McLean's exhibition entitled 'The Floor, The Fence, The Fireplace' at Anthony d'Offay Gallery in London, in March 1987. The text is by McLean himself and writer and critic Mel Gooding and was published by the Knife Edge Press which they formed together in 1985.",
