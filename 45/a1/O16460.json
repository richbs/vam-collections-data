In this picture a woman in a wedding dress and veil, presumably about to get married, is having second thoughts. The title hints at her uncertainty, and her demeanour together with the bunch of 'forget-me-not' flowers pinned to her dress suggest that she is thinking wistfully of another man. The viewer is left to speculate on the reasons for this. Has she made the wrong choice? Did the other suitor fail to propose? Has she perhaps accepted this marriage in a spirit of compromise, fearing that it may be her last chance? Marriage was the aim of most women because it gave some measure of independence, and the alternatives were limited and generally unrewarding. Many women married unsuitable men rather than live marginalised lives as spinster daughters.",
