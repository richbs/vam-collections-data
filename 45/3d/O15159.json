Underglaze iron oxide was used for creating designs on celadons during the Koryo dynasty (918-1392), but became especially popular in the 17th century. Underglaze copper-red decoration was first developed in the 12th century, but was virtually unused until  the 18th century. Dating from the 18th century, this jar is painted in underglaze copper-red with large lotus plants. Gaps in the thickly applied glaze allow the red body colour to show through in several places.",

It is one of several examples of decorated white porcelain showing a boldly painted lotus flower. Porcelain decorated solely in underglaze red was produced at small private kilns rather than at the official kiln established at Punwon after 1752. When acquired, this jar was thought to be seventeenth-century, but it has now been redated, on stylistic grounds, to the eighteenth century.\nThe jar was among a group of twenty-one pieces of Chinese and Korean pottery acquired in 1913 from S. M. Franck & Co., an importer of goods from the Near and Far East, a firm from which the Museum had made regular purchases since 1883. The jar cost \u00a310 and was recommended for acquisition by ceramics curator Bernard Rackham, who described it as \u201ca remarkable specimen.\u201d It was similarly regarded as a masterpiece by his successor, William Honey, who published extensively on Korean ceramics during the 1940s and wrote of this piece: \"There is a great jar at South Kensington, an old possession of the Museum, which was the first example to reveal to me the peculiar beauty of the Yi dynasty wares. . . . I like to regard this rugged pot as a test of ceramic education.\"\n\nLit.
