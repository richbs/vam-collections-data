It is known today for the manufacture of tiles and other industrial ceramics, and also for the production of highly wrought, unglazed tableware made from fine red clay. By comparison, medieval Tokoname wares were extremely crude. The larger forms were usually coil-built in slightly irregular shapes, and the use of large, single-chambered tunnel-shaped kilns gave rise to slumping and the uneven depositing of fly ash on otherwise unglazed surfaces. These rough and unfinished looking pots, whose distinctive qualities are the natural result of the limitations of medieval ceramic technology, have had a particular appeal to artists working in the increasingly industrialised environment of modern Tokoname. \n\nOne of the first Tokoname-based potters to look to such wares for inspiration was Esaki Issei (b.1918), an influential figure under whom Takeuchi studied as teenager. Takeuchi's ceramics, like those of his teacher, are characterized by a high degree of technical control. The potting of the dish shown here is sharp and well defined, and the application of the ash glaze has been carefully calculated. While making direct reference to medieval sources, Takeuchi imbues his work with cool austerity that is unambiguously contemporary in feeling.",
