Trained in Fine Art, her jewellery skills were self-taught; while her interest in jewellery was fuelled by the contemporary designs of Paco Rabanne and ethnic art she had first encountered at the British Museum where her father was Keeper of Ethnography.  The 1970 exhibition of her work at London's Ewan Phillips Gallery, for which this piece was made, attracted considerable attention from the media,  from fashion show organisers and art schools.  In its large scale, its provocative relationship with the body, and its championing of non-precious materials her jewellery was highly innovative.",
