Each of these four aspects is distinguished iconographically. This image, with a rosary and flame in the upper hands, is Vyakhyanamurti, Siva as the expounder of the sastras. Four-armed Siva is depicted with the uncut hair of an ascetic, seated in the virasana (heroic) posture, the lower right hand raised in the gesture of teaching in silence (cinmudra). The rocky landscape upon which he sits is an allusion to his Himalayan retreat where he instructs through mind-speech the secrets of the sastras to the holy men (risis). With his right foot he suppresses the dwarf-like figure of Apasmarapurusa, the demon embodying ignorance and forgetfulness. The wild animals of the mountain, carved in low relief, gather around him to hear his profound message. \n\nIn the medieval period images of Daksinamurti came to occupy a position on the south wall of the central shrine of a Hindu temple, displacing Ganesa in the south Indian temple schema in the early Cola period. By being positioned south-facing, Daksinamurti was able to look down from his temple as if still seated in his beloved Mt Kailasa in the Himalayas. This sculpture would have originally occupied a niche on the south elevation of a late Cola temple.",

The rocky landscape upon which he sits is an allusion to his Himalayan retreat where he teaches in silence the holy men (risis) the secrets of the sastras. With his right foot he suppresses the dwarf -like figure of Apasmarapurusa, the demon of ignorance and forgetfulness. The animals of the mountain, carved in low relief, gather around him.  Daksinamurti, the \"Lord who faces South\", represents Siva as the supreme teacher of Yoga, music, jnana (knowledge) and all the arts and sciences. Each of these four aspects is distinguished iconographically. This image, with a rosary and flame in the upper hands, is Vyakhyanamurti, Siva as the expounder of the sastras. Images of Daksinamurti should occupy a position on the South wall of the central shrine of a Hindu temple.",
