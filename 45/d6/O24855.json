Her three-quarter profile shows a left ear with a large hooped earring. She wears a necklace arm bands and six bangles on her wrists.  She is sitting with her legs akimbo and her feet crossed and obscured by the folds of the light-weight garment she wears on the lower part of her body. Her hair is drawn  back from her face into a large netted snood or padded wreath carved with criss-crossed lines, behind which falls a long folded scarf that reaches to the ground on either side. On either side of her head there is a background of leaves and what appears to be a fruit carved with lines to create a diaper pattern on the left hand side.  The woman is seated on a rounded stool decorated with a diaper pattern containing quatrefoil motifs. The carving is pierced through at four points on the inner sides of her arms and between her calves and her scarf",
