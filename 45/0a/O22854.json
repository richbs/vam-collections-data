The swastika was originally a Buddhist symbol but evolved to represent 'ten thousand'.  Together the bat, shou character and swastika form the decorative theme 'ten thousand happiness and longevity'. On the base is the mark L\u00fcxin Tang zhi (made for the Hall of Faith-keeping) in seal script.\nL\u00fcxin Shuwu (Library of Faith-keeping) was the studio name of the Xianfeng Emperor, and L\u00fcxin Tang (Hall of Faith-keeping) was probably a variant of that name. The quality of the dish and the very neatly-written mark definitely point to the piece being an imperial ware.",
