            "public_access_description": "When MacMillan began creating Romeo and Juliet in 1964 he intended the ballet for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable and he even choreographed a \u2018Balcony pas de deux\u2019 for them to dance on Canadian television. The television pas de deux had been designed by the Australian artist Kenneth Rowell and it was Rowell who expected to design the full production. The Board at Covent Garden did not approve this choice and MacMillan turned to his long-time collaborator. MacMillan was happy to work on his ninth ballet with Georgiadis and its success led to repeated collaborations on multi-act ballets: Manon (1974), Mayerling (1978), The Sleeping Beauty (1987) and The Prince of the Pagodas (1989).\n\nWhen MacMillan contacted Georgiadis the designer had a busy schedule but found he could devote 20 days to designing the three-act ballet and the preliminary design in the V&A\u2019s collection was presumably made at this time. The design suggests an arrangement for the urban exterior of the market place but with separate balconies rather than having a practical separate upper arcade. In the design the steps appear to run upstage but in the set as realised there is a main, curved staircase in the centre with others running downstage at the sides. For the costumes both MacMillan and Georgiadis studied Quattrocento paintings costumes and poses not treating them literally but through the filter of mid-twentieth century theatre and fashion.\n\nThe creation of Romeo and Juliet proved somewhat traumatic not least as the company\u2019s American impresario, Sol Hurok, insisted that the premiere in both London and New York should be given to Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. This upset MacMillan and his chosen cast selected for their youth, acting abilities as well their dancing his production having been inspired by the youthful Judi Dench and John Stride as the lovers in Franco Zeffirelli production at Old Vic 1960-61. The production was nevertheless an enormous success receiving a 40 min ovation with 44 curtain calls on its opening night. Obviously the presence of Fonteyn and Nureyev contributed to this but Georgiadis designs were among the stars of the show.",
