            "public_access_description": "The Engraved Passion (1507-1512) was one of four major series of religious prints made by D\u00fcrer, and helped to establish his reputation as an outstanding Renaissance printmaker. The others were the woodcut series of the Life of the Virgin, the Great Passion, and the Little Passion, all published in 1511. The Engraved Passion consists of fifteen small format plates and tells the story of Christ's betrayal by Judas, his crucifixion and resurrection. D\u00fcrer is renowned for inventing new and imaginative ways to depict Christian stories, and in the Engraved Passion the compositions of each plate are dramatic, intricate and complex, with emotive contrasts of light and shadow. Unlike the more populist woodcuts, they were designed to appeal to a more exclusive market of connoisseurs and collectors. Because the series was issued over several years, it is likely that individual images were sold separately. It was also sold in sets for devotional use, and was widely copied by other printmakers and in other media.",
