The two women, one on each side, lie as if dead and three more flee in terror. In the background trees and clouds. Another half-figure of a female is seen on the left, near a fallen urn. At the left is a tree, and clouds of smoke are to be seen in the sky, perhaps the signs of the defeat which led to Cleopatra's suicide. A statue of <i>Diana of Ephesus</i> is visible in the background. The relief is monogrammed 'I.E.'.\n\nElhafen (1658-1715) was trained in Innsbruck, and then travelled to Italy, probably between 1675 and 1678. Subsequently he worked in Vienna, and then in D\u00fcsseldorf, where he was based at the court of Johann II Wilhelm, the Elector Palatine from 1703/4 onwards. Elhafen worked in ivory above all, although he also produced small-scale sculptures in wood. He specialised in relief sculptures and many of these are based on prints.",

            "public_access_description": "This relief was made by Ignaz Elhafen in Germany in ca. 1697-1715. It represents the Death of Cleopatra. The monochrome colouring of material meant that ivories such as this could ape in miniature the ancient marbles much valued by connoisseurs and collectors of the time.\n\nElhafen (1658-1715) was trained in Innsbruck, and then travelled to Italy, probably between 1675 and 1678. Subsequently he worked in Vienna, and then in D\u00fcsseldorf, where he was based at the court of Johann II Wilhelm, the Elector Palatine from 1703/4 onwards. Elhafen worked in ivory above all, although he also produced small-scale sculptures in wood. He specialised in relief sculptures and many of these are based on prints.",
