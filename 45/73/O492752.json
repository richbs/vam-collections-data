            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of a demon wrestling with a rakan (disciple of Buddha). \n\nIn Japanese folklore oni are devious creatures with an ugly appearance capable of causing mischief and misfortune. This finely carved netsuke exaggerates the oni's grotesque appearance through its detailed features, such as its jowls, bulging eyes, sharp teeth and two protruding horns that neatly contrast to the smooth finely formed features of the disciple. The netsuke illustrates the struggle of the devilish nature of the oni against the pure and innocent nature of the disciple. \n\nThe most widely used materials for making netsuke were traditionally wood or ivory. Since trees grow abundantly throughout Japan, wood is readily available and many varieties are comparatively cheap. There is also a long tradition of expertise in woodcarving in Japan. The small size of netsuke often makes identification of the wood used impossible. This example, however, can be identified as boxwood. This wood is ideal for netsuke carving, as it has a fine, dense and even grain, while also being durable. It has a pale and creamy colour that acquires an attractive patina, or it can be polished to a high lustre.",
