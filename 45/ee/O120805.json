Worth London was an offshoot of the original. It created refined, well-mannered garments for a mainly English clientele for the London social season.\n\nMrs Roy Hudson was a friend of Miss Whistler, Worth's head vendeuse (personal saleswoman).  She purchased Worth gowns between 1947 and 1962. This dress dates from about 1955, when Owen Hyde-Clark was the chief designer. Worth was known for delicately embroidered dresses in shades of champagne and rose, and this dress is typical of the house's style.  \n\nThe skirt is cut as a complete circle.  It needed many layers of petticoats to fill the skirt and show the embroidery to its best advantage. \n\nWorth (London) Ltd closed in 1967.",

Clients were offered designs by Elspeth Champcommunal, a former Parisian designer and editor of British <i>Vogue</i>, alongside Parisian ones.  In 1953 Owen Hyde-Clark, who had worked with Maggy Rouff in Paris and Bradley's in London, was engaged to design Worth's boutique range.  About the same time the Parisian couture house Paquin bought Worth and in 1954 sold the name to Sydney Massin, who launched Worth (London) Ltd.  Once client, Mrs Roy Hudson, was a friend of Miss Whistler, Worth's head <i>vendeuse</i>.  She purchased Worth's gowns between 1947 and 1962.  Dating from c. 1955, when Hyde-Clark was also responsible for couture, are two pink silk evening dresses worn by Mrs Hudson, one long [T.124-1973] and the other in the fashionable shorter length [T.217-1973] that was acceptable for all but the most formal occasions.  Worth was known for delicately embroidered dresses in shades of champagne and rose, and these dresses are typical of the house's output (pl.4.10).  However, the V&A also recently acquired a plain navy satin evening dress with matching stole.  Worth (London) Ltd closed in 1967.",
