This cottage scene seems to have been a special favourite, for at least seven different copies exist by various hands.\n\nThis etching is unusual in the figure of the boy with his back to the viewer which creates a huddle of figures emphasized by the densely shaded shadows on the left side and highlighted by the blank paper to the right. The man seems to be playing a hurdy-gurdy. The subject of the print relates to that of the Eulenspiegel of 1520, by Lucas van Leyden, which Rembrandt bought for a huge sum of 176 guilders at an auction in 1642. It too features a family of beggars and the man is playing the bag-pipes.",
