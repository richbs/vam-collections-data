Painted principally portraits and also theatrical subjects. Exhibited 40 works at the RA between 1810 and 1833, 90 at the BI 1810-39, and 59 at the SBA 1827--40 (when he was described in the catalogue as 'the late ... '). All works were submitted from London addresses.\n \n<b>The Rev Chauncey Hare Townshend </b>  \n1411-1869 Neg 51759 \nCanvas, 75.6 X 62.9 cm (29 3/4 X 24 3/4 ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nPresumably the portrait exhibited at the RA in 1828. For the sitter, see pxix. M Haworth-Booth draws attention to the writer Edward Bulwer's description of Townshend after their meeting in about 1825: ' ... singularly calm and pure. In spite of a beauty of face, which at that time attracted the admiration of all who even passed him in the streets, his manner and conversation were characterised by an almost feminine modesty', and he adds that Townshend's 'beauty of countenance' was so spectacular that 'those who knew Byron said it was Byron with bloom and health' (The Dawning of an Age; Chauncey Hare Townshend: Eyewitness' in <i>The Golden Age of British Photography,</i>1839-1900 1984, p12). This contemporary description accords with Townshend's appearance in the present portrait, and it is interesting to compare it with Wilkie Collins's characterisation of him some 30 years later, as Mr Fairlie in the novel <i>The Woman in White.</i>The sitter is shown with his dog; for a portrait of another dog owned by Townshend, in the 1850s, see the painting by Francois Bocion also in the V&A collections from the Townshend Bequest (1621-1869, C M Kaufmann <i>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings:II. 1800-1900</i>1973, p9, cat no23).\"",
