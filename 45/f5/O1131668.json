She wears a copy of the elaborate type of dress worn by women for formal ceremonial occasions at Queen Victoria's court.  There were special rules about these 'court dresses', and one of the most important was that the back of the skirt had to extend into a train.  They were quite difficult to walk in, especially as everyone who was not royal had to walk backwards away from the queen on leaving her.  They were also easily damaged, but remained part of the rules of court dress for women until 1939.",
