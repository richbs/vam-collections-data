The rider is integral and the whole is cast in two halves down the length and held by tongue and slot joints. The rider's left arm is separately attached. The integral key protrudes from the right side and links through the mechanism to a metal post in the rider's right hand which holds the lasso. When wound; the horse moves and the lasso spins. \n2. ring of metal; with a coil in the centre which sits on the post. \n*The mark is under the body This appears to be also an exact copy of the Marx toy; even down to the colouring; however; it is seems a faded version; the sharpness of the colours dulled.",
