The rich diversity of his work in India developed after his arrival in February 1858, where he photographed the  aftermath of the Indian Mutiny of 1857 and devastation in Delhi, Cawnpore and Lucknow,  famous for its massacre of Europeans by the Indian army. Beato's war photographs of India range from portraits of commanding officers to vast Indian landscapes and derelict forts and palaces.",

Beato, who was born in Venice between 1825 and 1830,  but became a naturalised British subject. Beato is most recognised as a war photographer where his travel from Europe provided the opportunity to record military war in India after the Mutiny of 1857, the opium wars in China in 1860 and Japan in 1862. Beato later died in Burma, ca  1908-1909.",
