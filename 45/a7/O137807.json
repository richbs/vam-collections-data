In the 9th century Amalarius of Metz (a liturgical writer) considered that the censer is the body of Christ, the burning incense inside it is the Holy Sprit and the fragrance represents the good works of Christ.",

By the 13th century these architectural forms were simplified, like this censer or a comparable censer in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Both objects have a red, light blue, green and yellow champlev\u00e9 enamelwork from Limoges (France). Unfortunately, the state of conservation for such early censer examples is often very poor, due to the swinging, friction and repeated heating to which they were subjected.",

Incense has been used since ancient times to symbolise the prayers of the faithful rising to God. It is placed on hot charcoal in the bowl of the censer, and as the censer is swung to and fro, the smoke billows outwards and upwards to perfume the whole church. \n\nRitual cleansing and anointing play a crucial part in Christian worship, as they do in other religions. Water, salt, incense and oils are used in ceremonies such as baptism and confirmation, and in the blessing of individuals and of sacred objects like altars and bells.\n(SSSG Label text)\n\nMedieval theology attached a high symbolic importance to censers. In the 9th century Amalarius of Metz (a liturgical writer) considered that the censer is the body of Christ, in which is the fire of the Holy Sprit and that the fragance represented the good works proceeding from Christ. In the 13th century William Durandus, bishop of Mende wrote that the incense itself was an emblem of prayer and the censer was a metaphor for the Body of Christ.",
