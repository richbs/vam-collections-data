Panetta \n\n\u2018Structural Unity in new pedestal furniture\u2019, article from \u2018Design\u2019 1957, page 105:\n\"These pedestal chairs and tables designed by the American architect Eero Saarinen for Knoll Associates Inc, embody a revolutionary concept in furniture design. The pieces illustrated (fixed and swivel chairs, dining table, coffee and side tables) are prototypes, designed for mass production. The chair shells are of moulded plastics growing from a singe tapered aluminium stem. They represent the beginnings of a large programme that will eventually include complementary sofas and lounge chairs. By the elimination of legs, which as Saarinen says \u2018become a sort of metal plumbing\u2019 that in moulded chairs of this type leads to separation of seat from legs, a new spatial concept and a new organic unity was created. This unity is accentuated by single neutral colours \u2013 white, grey, beige and black with strong colours in the changeable cushions of upholstered foam rubber. The designs were conceived about four years ago and after many dozens of drawings, quarter-scale models were made and set up in a scaled model-room. Saarinen was assisted by Donald Pettit together with a Knoll design research team. The new furniture, after being installed in Saarinen\u2019s house in Bloomfield Hills, where the family and friends acted as guinea pigs, was submitted to severe tests beyond those of normal domestic use. For instance, to simulate the exertion of a heavy man pushing up out of the arm chair, a 300 pound pressure was put on the arms 21,000 times before any deflection, which proved to be not permanent, was noticed. Saarinen has said, \u2018I wanted to make the chair all one thing again. All the great furniture of the past, from Tutankhamen\u2019s chair to Thomas Chippendale\u2019s have always been a structural total.\"\n\nNotes on Craftsman from: Hollis, R. 1970.
