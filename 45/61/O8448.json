            "public_access_description": "The firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. was established in 1861. It employed artists such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones, who were instrumental in starting a new trend in the design of stained glass. \n\nThe Gothic Revival was a \u2018boom period\u2019 for church building and furnishing. But most of the stained glass that was created was noted for its slavish copying of medieval glass. Morris and his friends moved away from this historicism. Their designs for stained glass show a remarkable freedom in style and a softening in the choice of colours and tones.\n\nIn 1864 the firm completed a series of windows for the Cathedral of St Peter in Bradford. Dante Gabriel Rossetti designed many panels for these windows, including a full-length version of Jacob and the Mess of Pottage. The panel here is probably a trial piece that was never displayed.\n\nJacob was one of the Old Testament patriarchs. He was the younger of the twin sons of Isaac, Abraham\u2019s son. The older twin, Esau, was meant to inherit everything. When Esau returned from a long journey, Jacob offered him a mess of pottage to satisfy his hunger. In exchange, he was to give Jacob his birthright as the elder son. Esau agreed to the exchange. \n\nIn medieval schemes, this Old Testament story often prefigures the Betrayal of Christ by Judas.",

Out of the 20 panels, which were never further described other than 'early Morris & Co. glass', only this one came to the museum at Holliday's death in 1927.\nIt seems that the attribution to Burne-Jones, and possibly the date of '1860', begins with Rackham in 1927 when he lists the new acquisitions. He does not describe the subject matter.\n\nHistorical significance: This is one of the earliest panels executed by the firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.
