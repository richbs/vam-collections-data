Although the fall-front form was originally devised as a portable desk, the size of this example suggests that it was made more as a showpiece designed to be mounted on a stand and displayed. The decoration of the exterior of this cabinet reflects the high Mughal style of setting rows of flowering plants in alternating patterns against a plain ground. This enchanting device is characteristic of the reign of Shah Jahan and may be found adorning buildings erected by the emperor, such as the Saman Burj, Agra Fort (c. 1637). \n\nThe basic formula of employing rows of flowers as a principal form of decoration remained popular to the end of the 18th century and throughout the period was applied to various media from carpets to album covers. The taste for marrying rows of flowers to the exterior of cabinets may also have found an impetus in high-style European furniture, whose decoration also reflected the contemporary western taste for exotic blooms, whether in pietra dura or marquetry.",
