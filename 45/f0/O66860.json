It remains one of the most popular carpet patterns and appears with many variations:  radically different effects can be achieved by simply changing the proportion of the  motifs or by using colour to highlight particular parts of it. The use of colour in carpets is a design factor which is often over-looked.  One pattern is used across the field of this carpet, but it looks quite different within the red lozenge where colour has been used to emphasis different elements of it.",
