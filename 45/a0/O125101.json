ISBN: 1854375830.\nExhibition catalogue.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 121, 123, 124\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe sketch has been laid down on thin card.\n\nNo. 174 [322-1888] <i>recto</i> is a study for the painting 'Waterloo Bridge, from Whitehall Stairs, June 18th, 1817' exhibited by Constable at the Royal Academy in 1832, and once in the collection of Mr. Harry Ferguson; the composition had engaged Constable intermittently from 1819.  A full discussion of the relationship of many sketches and alternative compositions is given together with 14 illustrations by Sutton (<i>loc. cit.</i>) pp. 248-55: he gives full references to earlier literature and quotes hitherto unpublished material.  Meanwhile an oil sketch for the mezzotint by David Lucas has been rediscovered (collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon).  G. R. Rennie's Waterloo Bridge was opened by the Prince Regent on 18 June 1812: it is presumed that Constable saw the ceremony, since he was in London.  The first known reference to his having conceived the idea of painting the opening ceremony is found in his letter of 17 July 1819 to John Fisher \"I have made a sketch of my scene on the Thames-which is very promising\" (Beckett, VI, p. 45).  It is not entirely clear to which phase in the long history of the work No. 174 [322-1888] belongs, and the woodland sketch on the <i>verso</i>, which is an early work, does not provide any relevant information.  Holmes identifies No. 174 [322-1888] tentatively with the picture referred to by Constable in his letter to Fisher of 22 January 1824: \"I have done the little <i>Waterloo</i>, a small balloon to let off as a forerunner of the large one\" (L. ed. S., p. 162).  This view has been widely accepted, but the phrase surely refers to a somewhat larger and much more finished version, of the type Constable was likely to exhibit.  It is more possible that No. 174 [322-1888] is the sketch of 1819 of which Constable wrote to Fisher, and which he showed to Farington on 11 August 1819.  The entry in Farington's <i>Diary</i> (Greig, Vol. VIII, p. 225) reads: \"Constable called, and brought a painted sketch of his view of Waterloo bridge &c and the river as it appeared on the day of the <i>opening the Bridge</i>  I objected to his having made it so much a 'Birds eye view' and thereby lessening magnificence of the bridge and buildings.-He sd. He would reconsider his sketch\".  In favour of the identification of No. 174 [322-1888] with this sketch of 1819, it may be noted that it does in fact give a bird's eye view of the bridge and buildings-as do all the versions with the exception of the type represented by that belonging to Viscountess Camrose.  The style of No. 174 [322-1888] is hardly more advanced than that of No. 171 [122-1888], which is known to have been painted in 1819.  No. 174 [322-1888] certainly represents a stage of the composition before 1826, when Constable added two feet to his canvas after visiting and sketching the terrace of Lord Pembroke's house:  the house and terrace form the left foreground of the exhibited picture (see L. ed. S., p. 214, Constable's letter of 7 July [1826] to Fisher, and Leslie's footnote on it).  (See also No. 175 [604-1888])\n\nThe oil sketch No. 174a  [322-188 verso] bears some resemblance to those made by Constable in Helmingham Dell, but these provide no basis for a definite identification.",
