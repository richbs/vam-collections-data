He practiced as an architect but took up printmaking  in mid-life, and studied linocut printing under Claude Flight. His subject-matter revolves around metropolitan life. This image transforms the staircase of Russell Square Underground station into a dynamic structure. In its expression of movement and energy it suggests the influence of  Vorticist artists like Wyndham Lewis and Edward Wadsworth, as well as the Italian Futurists.",

Having pursued a career as an architect (he lectured on the subject and wrote a book on English medieval architecture in 1912), Power enrolled at Heatherley's School of Fine Art in 1922 as a mature student at the age of fifty.  In 1925 he joined the newly formed Grosvenor School of Modern Art as a lecturer on architectural ornament; a year later, when Claude Flight came to the school to teach linocutting, Power attended his classes.  Through Flight he learnt to appreciate the expressive qualities of the linocut and its potential to capture the forms and spirit of the modern are.  Power's subjects often derive from metropolitan life and pursuits, and when Flight organized exhibitions of his pupils' work between 1929 and 1937, the work of Power and his artist colleague Sybil Andrews attracted particular attention.  The pair, who formed a close relationship until 1938, also collaborated on a series of bold and colourful posters for the London Underground. \nPower's vision transforms the spiral staircase at Russell Square Underground Station into a dynamic structure of the machine age, expressed in terms of rhythm and movement.  It its counter-thrusting energy it evokes the work of the Italian Futurists and the English Vorticists.  At the same time there is a strong influence from the contemporary fashion for things Japanese: the staircase unfolds like the swirl of a Japanese fan and the newel post recalls the form of a bamboo pole.  The composition, with its black outlines and flat areas of colour, is cut at the margins in the manner of Japanese woodblock prints.  Similar elements appear, for example, in the contemporary posters of Edward McKnight Kauffer.  Power exploits the particular quality of linocut to the full, revelling in the free energy of the cut line and the spontaneous textures of the coloured inks as they are pulled from the soft linoleum block.\"",
