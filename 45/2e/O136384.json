Miss Stampfle (p.127) relates some forty of the drawings to <i>Diverse Maniere\u2026</i> and regards ten drawings as specifically preparatory, two of which she reproduces in Figs.12 and 13.  She goes on to discuss the relationship between the sketches and the etched plates and to note that some designs were also carried out as practical commissions. \n \nFor further comment and reproductions see: \n F.
