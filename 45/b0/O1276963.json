Until the 1920s the firm\u2019s major commissions were for ecclesiastical and domestic objects, but from the early 1930s onwards they increasingly specialised in civic plate, including cups and trophies.\nA. Edward Jones maintained close links with the Vittoria Street School of Jewellers and Silversmiths. Successive heads of the Vittoria Street School commissioned the firm to make up their designs, including R. G. Baxendale, Head of the school from 1952 to 1974. It is likely due to this relationship with the design school that A. Edward Jones continued to produce new designs throughout the mid-20th century, during a time when many firms relied instead on producing reproductions of historic pieces.",
