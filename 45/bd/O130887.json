They refer to the legend of the triple marriage of Saint Anne, and her three daughters by her three husbands. Saint Anne sits in the centre, with the Virgin and Christ Child, and behind them are her husbands (Joachim, Cleophas, and Salomas) and Saint Joseph.  The side groups depict Mary Salome and May Cleophas with their husbands and children. \n\nThis work was associated to the Master of Ottobeuren, named after the reliefs in the abbey of Ottobeuren, later identified with the sculptor Hans Thoman, active in Memmingen, Swabia in the early decades of the sixteenth century. In 1502-5 he worked in the workshop of Hans Herlin, whose influence can be seen in the present group.",

The overpaint, probably dating from the 19th century, was removed in 1931. The dowels under the reliefs' bases are later additions. The benches were originally silvered.\n\nHistorical significance: These reliefs are from a small domestic altar. They were associated to the Master of Ottobeuren, named after the reliefs in the abbey of Ottobeuren, later identified with the sculptor Hans Thoman, active in Memmingen, Swabia. In 1502-5 he worked in the workshop of Hans Herlin, whose influence can be seen in the present group. The composition and the facial features of the Virgin, Saint Joseph and Saint Anne's husband behind the Virgin bear in fact similarities with the relief of the Holy Kindred ascribed to Herlin, formerly in the Skulpturengalerie in Berlin (destroyed in 1945). Nevertheless, the drapery is carved much more fluidly than in the latter, and is closer to that of the Adoration of the Magi, also formerly in the same museum. A similar treatment of the drapery can be seen in two reliefs by Thoman, in the Vorlarberger Museum, Bregenz, depicting Saint Martin and the Beggar and the Decapitation of Saint Maurice, datable to around 1515-20.",

            "historical_context_note": "The Holy Kindred was a popular subject in fifteenth and early sixteenth century German and Netherlandish art. It forms part of a series of themes dealing with the genealogy of Jesus Christ, and is entirely centred on Saint Anne. Early names for the Holy Kindred were very explicit: it was called the Genealogy of Madam Saint Anne or The Apostolic Descendance of Saint Anne. Representations of the Holy Kindred include a whole gallery of people. Gathered around Saint Anne we find her three husbands (Joachim, Salomas and Cleophas), the three daughters, their husbands and children.\nThe origin of this surprising genealogical motif has no foundation in scripture. Mentioned in Jacopo da Voragine's Golden Legend, the apocryphal legend of the triple marriage (Trinubium) of Saint Anne was popularised in 1406 thanks to a vision of Saint Colette, a nun and mystic of Corbie. According to her vision, Saint Anne appeared to Colette with her three daughters and their children. Interpreted by some authors as a feminine transposition of the masculine genealogy of the Jesse Tree, the Holy Kindred disseminated rapidly throughout Northern Europe, not least thanks to the very popular cult in honour of Saint Anne.",
