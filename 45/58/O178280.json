The silver-gilt bowl represents the sun, the rays of which penetrate the clouds ranged down the spiralling oxidised black stem and which refer to Lord Carrington's diplomatic career. The griffin wears two collars. One, inscribed with Lord Carrington's motto 'TENAX IN FIDE', is securely fastened, the other, inscribed R.S ME FIERI FECIT, records the commissioning of the cup by Sir Roy Strong. The artist heard of Sir Roy's resignation as he was working on the griffin, and symbolically fashioned the collar unbuckled and starting to work loose. Further details about the design appear on the explanatory panels laid down on the sheet. The Carrington Cup is in the Collection of Metalwork, Victoria & Albert Museum [M.64 and A-1988]",
