The address of the Interior depicted in the painting is 30 All Saints Road, London, W11.\n\nTom Dixon began welding when he set up Creative Salvage in 1985, creating one-off stylish and functional artifacts made from scrap and salvage metal. He is now the best-known of the 'baroque salvage' artist/designers (as they have been called). The painting shows the artist sitting in his 1986 armchair made from concrete reinforcement rods, overlooked by a skeleton. The other furniture in the room, screen, candelabra, table, second chair - are either existing pieces of ones he was working on at the time. The is also a double-bass in the room. The frame of the picture is made from a mixture of metal scrap and castings from scrap.",
