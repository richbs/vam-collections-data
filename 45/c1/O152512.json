The material provided designers with exciting possibilities in terms of shape and colour, and was perfectly suited to the sharp lines and geometric shapes of Art Deco.  In this instance, a marbled effect has been created by adding lead phosphate during the moulding process.  In the Journal of the Royal Society of Arts (1943), John Gloag summed up what he saw as the attitude of many designers towards plastics in the words, 'these materials can do anything - let's do everything'.",
