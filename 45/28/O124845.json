            "public_access_description": "Design for a cane-head. The top is formed as a cap which is possibly a liberty one. This style of headgear was eventually worn by some who supported the Revolution 1789-1799.  The sides of the cane-head are decorated with a classical scene.  The drawing is by an anonymous designer in about 1780.  The design and inscription appear to refer to the temple of Janus who was the two-faced god of gates, doors, doorways, beginnings, and endings in Roman mythology. The design and inscription also refer to the two faces or hypocrisy of the law-maker.  \n\nThe cane took over from the sword as a decorative accessory and an essential part of a European gentleman's wardrobe.  It also continued to fulfil some of the functions of the sword as a weapon. The design is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
