One of Napoleon's best officers, Murat was equally famous for his ostentatious looks, rendered here by his lavish epaulettes and tassels and the heavy curls of his hair and side-burns. \nOn the reverse, the French fleet is seen approaching Capri and a cluster of lifeboats and ships with broken masts that convey the British defeat. In the background, clouds of smoke rising from the island express the ferocity of the battle.",

One of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's most successful officers and brother-in-law (he was married to Caroline Bonaparte), Joachim-Napol\u00e9on Murat (25 March 1767 - 13 October 1815) received numerous titles from the Emperor of the French. After being made Marshal of France in 1804, he became Prince of the Empire in 1805,  Grand Duke of Berg and Cleves in 1806, and was King of Naples and Sicily from 1808 to 1815. \nMurat's portrait shows him heavily decorated with military medals and orders, notably with the military star, the insigna of the <i>L\u00e9gion d'Honneur</i> (with profile of Napoleon) and the <i>Plaque du grand aigle de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur</i> (the imperial eagle holding lighting in its claws). \nThe reverse of the medal shows the capture of the island of Capri from Hudson Lowe's troops on 16 October 1808.\n\nAccording to Forrer (1907, III, 54), Louis Jaley (1763-1838) was a pupil of Moitte and Dupr\u00e9. He specialised in commemorative medals, most notably of the Napoleonic era.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, memorabilia of the Empire became collectible, notably sought in Great Britain.",
