The back of the box is a panel made of rough wood which slides out when pulled. On one side is the iron key for the brass clockwork mechanism together with the control switch.The mechanism operates both the dancers and the musical box. The music is produced by a cylinder covered with small spikes which connect with a comb like set of metal teeth. From the top set of cogs on the mechanism is attached a shaft, the bottom of which is attached to a bar. The bar runs beneath the dancers which are each mounted on a metal rod. These rods extend down to meet the bar which see-saws, alternately hitting the bases of the rods.The mirrored walls shown in the scene are backed with cardboard and the top is cardboard.\nThe scene is a three sided mirrored ballroom with a red cloth curtain, each side trimmed with gold metallic paper. Across the front top is a band of similar cloth. The floor is of printed paper over wood, showing birds, trees,, flowers and fruit. Each of the mirrors is trimmed with gold metallic paper and along the top with a band of blue paper printed with gold stars. A lead chandelier is suspended from the top. There are also two additional battery operated spotlights (later additions).\nThe dancers are two bisque blonde haired German dolls, one dressed as a woman, the other as a man.The woman is in a purple jacket trimmed with gold, a cream skirt covered with black lace, and black lace attached to the top ofthe head. The man is in a purple jacket with green and gold trim, green breeches and a green cap which extends to a long point at the back, decorated with gold trim and a gold and purple tassel",
