The chain-mail perimeter of the blade is balanced by the chain-mail interior of the handle. Interlocking rings hammered flat and bevelled at the edges create this striking effect. The war-like connotations of this decoration seem contradictory to our preconceptions of dining as an entertaining and relaxed activity.
