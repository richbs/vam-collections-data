This scheme appears frequently in Charels de Moelder\u2019s work of the 1690s, and, with its Classical associations, would have provided an attractive design for the late-seventeenth century patrons wishing to purchase fine silverwork for their homes.\n \nDe Moelder\u2019s designs would have been available for goldsmiths to purchase, and they would probably have used them as stock images or as inspiration. From these images, luxury items for the table or the toilette could have been made in bulk or customised for wealthy patrons by mixing various elements of de Moelder\u2019s prints. This image is only one part of a larger plate possibly cut down by a later collector to enjoy more for its inventive quality rather than its functional use as a pattern.",
