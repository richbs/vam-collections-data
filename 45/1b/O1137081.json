The following is the full text of the entry: copies after GUERCINO 720 Cephalus, with his dog, contemplating the dead Procris, who lies on the ground with an arrow in her breast Inscribed in ink in an old hand 'Guercino'; inscribed on the mount in ink 'PH' (in monogram) and in pencil '660', and on the back of the mount in ink 'S.D.L. 63'; also on the back in pencil in a modern hand 'Aminto and Sylvia from Tasso' Pen and ink and wash 8 1/2 x 10 1/2 (206 x 267) Dyce 305 PROVENANCE Benjamin West (Lugt 419); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE Dyce Catalogue no. 305 (as by Guercino); Catalogue of the exhibition 'Omaggio al Guercino', Cento, 1967, p. 78 A similar drawing is in the collection of Mr Denis Mahon (no. 50 in the Cento exhibition catalogue). Another version was in the Crozat and then in the Mariette collection (no. 144 in the Mariette sale catalogue, 1775). Its present whereabouts is unknown. There is an engraving of it dated 1767 by Vincenzo Vangelisti. As Mahon states in the Cento catalogue, it was doubtless Guercino's original drawing and was made as a study for the picture painted for the Marchese Cornelio Bentivoglio in 1644 as a present for the Queen of France, formerly at Dresden and destroyed in the last war. Mahon considers our drawing an excellent early copy of the Mariette drawing. He suggests that his own drawing may have been made by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who owned it and may have copied our drawing. A similar composition, with variations in the poses, is found in a drawing at Princeton (48-733. J. Bean, Italian drawings in the Art Museum, Princeton University, Princeton, 1966, p. 33, no. 41 and pl. 41); and again in another drawing at Dijon, which is probably a copy of the Princeton drawing (no. 768. Gernsheim photo 4355. Engraved in Monuments des arts du dessin recueillis par le Baron Vivant Denon, 3, Paris, 1829, pl, 208).",
