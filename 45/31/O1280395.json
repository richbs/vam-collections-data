The individual pages of the book are made from thick grey board, reminiscent of the solidly-paged board books from childhood. Each die cut page contains a scrap or scraps of metal laid-in, along with collaged illustrations cut out from newspapers or magazines and a textual platitude embossed in blind letterpress. The platitudes are banal sayings and rhyming phrases, such as 'express your mess' or 'cheers to the fears', which essentially mean nothing but sound like chapter titles of a self-help book. The title 'Happiness pursuit' reiterates this feeling of a pseudo-philosophical or psychological tract. The pieces of metal used in the book, dubbed 'metallic platitudes', are scraps of found materials of various shapes, sizes and textures from the A.R.T. (Amsterdam Rubbish Trust).",
