The resulting influence of these factors on the artists of the area created the fantastic psychedelic posters of the Fillmore. Art dealer Jacaeber Kastor said of the posters, \"They couldn't just tell you the information about the show. They had to tell you what kind of people you might meet, what kind of far out trip you might have or perhaps even reveal the mysteries of the universe. Wow. Quantum mechanics, visual mudwrestling, Acid test pop quiz on a phone pole!\"\n\nThe artist of this poster, Victor Moscoso, is an American illustrator and comic book artist best known for his psychedelic designs of the 1960s.  Born in Spain, Moscoso moved to the States early in his childhood, and went on to study art at Cooper Union in New York City and at Yale University.  In 1959 he moved to the west coast of America, attending the San Francisco Art Institute, remaining to take up a post teaching lithography after his graduation.  During the late sixties, he produced concert posters for Bill Graham (at the Fillmore) and the Family Dog (Chet Helms, at Fillmore, and later the Avalon Ballroom).  He is also known for his involvement with the underground comics\u2019 scene, and was a regular contributor to Zap Comix.\n\nThis gig at the Matrix featured Big Brother and the Holding Company, a seminal San Francisco psychedelic rock band featuring Janis Joplin on vocals.",
