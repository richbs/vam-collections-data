His imaginative and lavish costumes and sets informed by historical styles proved an effective complement to many productions, especially Mozart and Rossini operas.  He also designed programme covers, working variations on his designs for the productions on which he had worked that year.  This design, for the 1954 season's programme, features symbols connected with Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville) - a guitar (for the serenading Count) and fans and a mask (hinting at disguise and subterfuge).  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nThe programme cover design for the 1954 season at Glyndebourne is based on Messel's designs for The Barber of Seville, performed that year at Glyndebourne.",
