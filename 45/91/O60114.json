            "public_access_description": "The elevation plan of the fa\u00e7ade shows three levels of architecture of the Marciana Library created in order to hold Bishop Bessarion donation of 750 codex and 250 manuscripts to the state-city of Venice. The ground floor level shows a front door behind Romanic arcades and columns, each arcade is surmounted by a winged head, flanked by two male figures. The front door however is surmounted by a Saint Marc\u2019s lion head and decorated with two caryatids. A moulded frieze showing trophies, musical instruments and shields divides it from the first floor. The first floor also shows Romanic arcades, columns and a baluster. Each arcade is surmounted by a male head in alternation with a lion\u2019s head and flanked by two winged females. A larger moulded frieze showing putti holding floral garlands divided this level from the upper level which has a baluster supporting statues.\n\nThe donation took place in 1468, however the construction of the Marciana Library could only start in 1537 and was executed after Jacopo Sansovino's design (1486-1570). The setting back of the library in relation to the campanile had a profound impact on the realignment of the public space of Piazza S. Marco. Although not finished in his lifetime, the Library is generally held to be Sansovino's architectural masterpiece, and it was praised by Andrea Palladio as 'the richest and most ornate building since ancient times' (Quattro libri dell'architettura, Venice, 1570).\n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
