The trade routes between states like Venice and the cities of the eastern Mediterranean resulted in a two-way cultural exchange that profoundly affected art and design.  The geometric inlay of coloured woods and bone is similar in style to the designs found on tiles and stained glass from Turkey, but is known in Italy as marquetry alla certosina after the Certosina church in Pavia which houses a famous altarpiece decorated in this way.  This box was perhaps intended for storing toilet items or jewellery, and inside the lid it has a mirror, which though modern, may be a replacement for an original glass that got damaged.",
