She originally trained as a sculptor, as is evident in her work, which is often presented in 3-D. Her drawings - in particular her cut-out landscapes in Perspex boxes and snow domes - depict imaginary worlds which evoke fairytales and theatrical illusions. Presenting these drawings as three-dimensional self-contained worlds, she creates spaces which are spatially plausible yet ambiguous and contradictory. They have the precision and clarity of a perfectly observed reality, but also of an obsessive fantasy. \n\nThis interest in landscape, architecture and optical illusion is a central theme in Woodfine's recent work. This exquisitely-drawn scene is immediately reminiscent of the card models of castles and forts that used to be popular children's toys. Newfoundland takes the potential of these models one step further, and the cut-outs are assembled as elements of a miniaturised stage-set, exploiting the allusiveness which comes from using a part to suggest the whole, with each element standing for something larger.\n\nHer drawings have obvious affinities with illustration, especially children's book illustration, with theatre and with cut-out toys, but also with architectural drawing and architectural models.",
