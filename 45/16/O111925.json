(1867-1956), British painter, etcher, graphic artist and designer.\n\nBrangwyn, who was largely self taught, was born in Bruges where his father, W. Curtis Brangwyn, the architect, ran an embroidery studio and workshop.  His family returned to London in 1875 and he was educated at a day school teaching himself to draw by copying at the Victoria and Albert Museum.  There was insufficent money to send him to an art school, but he was befriended by Harld Rathbone and A.H. Mackmurdo, through whose influence he was bale to get a job at Morris & Co., where he was employed in enlarging the designs for tapestries.  He remained with Morrisa from 1882 to 1884.  He exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1885 when he was barely 18 years old.\n\nAfter leaving Morris & Co. he travelled extensively, gathering material for his painting and graphic work in the East, in Africa and in Spain, still working for Morris in between trips.  In 1895 he assisted with the decorating of Seigfried Bing's gallery in preparation for the transformation into the Maison de l'Art Nouveau, and also designed stained glass for Bing and for Tiffany in New York.  He designed his first complete interior in 1900, for a house in South Kensington.  Brangwyn was also offered the task of decoratong and furnishing the Biennale Exhibition held in Venice in 1905, and again in 1907.  The furniture and panelling fopr the 1905 scheme was made to his design by the firm of J.S. Henry who, like Wylie and Lockhead in Glasgow, made a speciality of furniture in the Art Nouveau style.  Brangwyn's designs, in contrast, were of the starkest simplicity.  He exhibited a range of \"cheap\" furniture with the decorastive panels which he executed for the exhibition at Ghent in 1913, again designed on the most simple lines.  \n\nDuring the whole of his mature years he worked on major decorative commissions including those for the Rockerfeller Centre in New York which he executed in collaboration with Jose Maria Sert and Diego Rivera.  In 1919 he was elected a Royal Academician.  He continued to design furniture, pottery, metalwork and jewellery, rugs, embroideries and fans, and to make elaborate and large scale etchings. He was knighted in 1941.\n\nIsabelle Anscombe and Charlotte Gere, <font -u>Arts and Crafts in Britain and America</font>, London, Academy Editions, 1978 pp.208-9",
