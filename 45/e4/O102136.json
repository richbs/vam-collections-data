Calling for the withdrawal of the Soviet Army from the territory of Hungary it expresses the desire of the whole population to be free and independent.  The motif of the fat nape of a neck has a long tradition in the visual culture of social criticism (for example in the painting of Gyula Derkovits, in German activism and in Billy Wilder\u2019s film \u2018Five steps to Cairo\u2019). In this new context there are several connotations: the cruelty of a faceless power, going away and being shot through the back of the head. The Russian inscription was legible for all Hungarians, who were obliged to study the Russian language. The poster was one of three designs made by the artist of his own accord and offered to the Hungarian Democratic Forum. His original slogan for this poster was more elegant and ironic: \u2019tovarishchi!\u2019(adieu!). \u2018Koniec\u2019 (\u2018the end\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s over\u2019), was the word that appeared on movie screens at the end of Soviet films (shown in large numbers in all Soviet Bloc countries), and sounds harsher and more belligerent.\n\nImitating the appearance of a woodcut print is a characteristic feature of the artist\u2019s style. The historicising effect gives a sublime quality to an accusing and bitter image and evokes a rich cultural inheritance stretching back to the woodcut sheets of the Reformation.",
