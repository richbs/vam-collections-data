This band is outlined with rope mouldings which emphasize the curves of the cusps and spring from deeply drilled squared-off foliate motifs on a flat plane.  The top and bottom edges have similarly-carved cavetto borders of flame and petal mouldings. There are also fragmentary remains of pierced foliage decoration on the undersides of the cusping, above and in front of which there are fragments of a dependent band of fleur-de-lis (<i>gagaramala</i>).  On top, in the interstices between the cusps there are leonine <i>kirttimukha</i> heads.",

(1815-1884), former Governor of Bombay, in 1877.\n  As John Guy writes in <i>The Peaceful Liberators</i> (see reference below) the high degree of stylistic uniformity suggests that these pieces were collected from a single temple, or at least sites that were contemporary.  They are related to known Solanki dynasty temples of the 11th and 12th centuries: inscriptions record that endowments were made to the Shatrunjaya temples during the reign of Siddharaja Jayasimha (1095-1142), a Solanki ruler renowned for his patronage",
