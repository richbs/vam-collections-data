Margaret Tempest illustrated the first 30 of these, from 1929 until 1970. The individual characterisation in her images made them household names. In fact artist and author often disagreed as to who could take the most credit for creating the characters. Tempest also wrote and illustrated 20 books of her own in the 1940s and 1950s, including the Pinky Mouse and Curley Cobbler series. \n\nTempest's characteristically subtle watercolour tones emphasize the faireis' delicate wings. The form of these wings recalls of those of insects.Their minute appearance is conveyed by the effort that three fairies make to open the cage door and free the trapped bird.",
