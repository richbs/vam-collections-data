            "historical_context_note": "18th Centry Slipware\nMade in North Staffordshire; about 1700-1800\nLead-glazed earthenware with impressed, applied or trailed white slip decoration\nFrom about 1650 attempts had been made by Staffordshire potters to mass-produce their slipware dished using convex fired-clay moulds cut with simple patterns. The technique of picking out moulded relief designs in contrasting slip was further developed by potters in the early 18th century, notably Samuel Malkin. Other methods, such as freehand trailing of slip designs and inscriptions, were applied particularly to cups and multi-handled posset pots intended for communal drinking. The 'combing' of slip lines into feathered designs soon became standard decoration for baking dishes.\nSlipware continued to be made in North Staffordshire long after the development of refined late=turned wares, such as white salt-glazed stoneware and red lead-glazed earthenware. Some Staffordshire vessels of the mid 18th century combine the qualities of these finer wares with the red and white clay decoration of slipware, using carved or incised 'sgraffuto' techniques. But by the end of the 18th cetnury, slipware production had moved from the industrialised Staffordshire potteries to rural potting centres such as Derbyshire and Shropshire.\nCountry Pottery & Slipware\nMade in the West Country, the Midlands and the North East; about 1750-1900\nThe contrasting colours of common red clay and the much rarer white pipe clay were used by potters in a number of inventive ways. In the West Country, notably Somerset, Dorset and DEvon, the local coarse clay was dipped in white slip and carved or scratched with designs and inscriptions. At pottery centres such as Sunderland, and Buckley in North Wales, sturdy functional slipwares continued long after the advent of cheap Staffordshire pottery, while at Verwood in Dorset, archaic forms continued to be made as late at the 1950s. \nMade in Sussex, Lancashire & Yorkshire\nCountry potters of deffernet areas devised distinctive regional forms and individual types of decoration. In Sussex, simple patterns were stamped into the iron-rich clay and inlaid with white slip, inscriptions being made printers' type. Slip-trailing and the use od simple red and white 'agate' clays continued in use until well into the 20th century in parts of Yorkshire, Lancashire and elsewhere. As a result of the Arts & Crafts Movement, country pottery gradually became more self-conscious - 'artitic' rather than vernacular.",
