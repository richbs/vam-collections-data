His investigations and a subsequent court case revealed that two young shore-rakers named William Smith and Charles Eaton had manufactured and sold a large number of bogus antiquities to an antique dealer between 1857 and 1858.  These objects were supposed to have been found during excavations for the new dock at Shadwell, London.  They show a considerable variety in design ranging from flat circular discs - apparently imitating medieval pilgrim badges to bogus reliquaries.  The objects were cast in plaster moulds, usually in lead alloy, possibly plumber's solder,or in an alloy of copper, zinc and lead known as \"cock-metal\".  Some have been dipped in acid and coated with river mud to give the impression of age.  However in spite of their grotesque appearance and numerous anachronisms - particularly in lettering and dates - a number of prominent antiquaries were deceived by these objects.  One went so far as to state in open court that it was difficult to say what actual use was originally made of such articles because they were a new class altogether, but they were all evidently connected with some religious proceedings and he had no doubt that when the subject came to be considered antiquaries would be able to assign some origin to them.\n\nWilliam Smith had apparently been selling objects found in the Thames to curiosity dealers as early as 1845 but his partnership with Charles Eaton appears to date from some years later.  They apparently worked in Rosemary Lane, Tower Hill.  Accounts of the number of these fake antiquities produced vary, but it seems likely that at least 2,000 different objects were produced, including necklaces made from fragments of pottery, and clay figures.  The Victoria and Albert Museum has a representative collection of these curiosities and other examples are to be found in The Museum of London and in the Cuming Museum, Southwark.",
