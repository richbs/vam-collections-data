Lopokova created the role of the maid Mariuccia and it perfectly suited her mischevous, bubbling personality; she remained unrivalled in the part, dancing the majority of performances given by the Diaghilev Ballet until she left the company in the early 1920s, although she returned to give occasional performances until the ballet was dropped from the repertory in the mid 1920s.  She probably gave the fan to Cyril Beaumont after the performances in the 1921 London season.  \nThe fan came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: Beaumont acquired a number of props and costume parts from various dancers, usually appropriately identified and inscribed.  The custom of giving parts of a costume as souvenirs has a long history and there is the legend that Nijinsky's dresser would sell petals from his Spectre de la rose costume to his fans.  Beaumont's collection included such small props and costume accessories as fans, masks and scarves and must have caused the Wardrobe a small headache as these items disappeared.",
