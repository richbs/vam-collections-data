Here St Martha is being immersed head first in a well. These reliefs, together with a scene on the wall opposite (The Bodies of the Martyrs are Burned 1884-651), are from a series of eight depicting the martyrdom of these Christians from Persia, who were executed in Rome under Emperor Claudius II in the 3rd century CE. They originally adorned a shrine containing relics of these martyrs in the church of San Lorenzo in Cremona.  The shrine was commissioned by the abbot, Antonio de' Meli, before his death in 1479, and was completed by 1482.  They were later incorporated into pulpits in Cremona Cathedral, where they remain today.  The plaster casts were made by an Italian firm based in Milan.",

The scenes originally adorned a shrine containing relics of these martyrs in the church of San Lorenzo in Cremona.  The shrine was commissioned by the Abbot, Antonio de' Meli before his death in 1479, and was completed by 1482. With the suppression of San Lorenzo in the early 19th century, the shrine was sold off, and, between 1805 and 1820, the eight reliefs of martyrdom were incorporated into pulpits in Cremona Cathedral, where they remain today. Two roundels from the shrine of the Persian Martyrs also survive:\n1.The Nativity, bearing the inscription \"CORP.S.M.MARII ET MARTHAE\" in the Museo Archeologico, in Milan.\n2.The Annunciation, bearing the inscription \"ANTO. DE MEL JS. I.V.DOCT.ABB.F\" in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris.",
