These were mainly Scottish and supported the exiled royal house of Stuart. The Duke of Cumberland, leader of the English forces, is surrounded by Scottish lords kneeling in surrender.  In the background, the English troops fire on fleeing rebels.  It is hard to establish the exact number of participants and casualties. What is certain is that the Jacobites were slaughtered in vast numbers, while the king's troops suffered few casualties. The vigour with which the Duke of Cumberland put down the rebellion earned him the nickname 'The Butcher'.",
