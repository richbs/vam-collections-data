The portfolio includes two works by the Computer Technique Group, plus single works by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer, William Fetter, Maughan S. Mason, Donald K. Robbins, and Kerry Strand. The complete set was acquired by the Museum in 1969, at a cost of \u00a35. \n\nThe original plotter drawing for Running Cola is Africa was created by members of the Computer Technique Group in late 1967 or early 1968, at the IBM Scientific Data Centre in Tokyo. The book published to coincide with the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition includes the following information about the artwork: \n\n\"A computer algorithm converts a running man into a bottle of cola, which in turn is converted into the map of Africa. \nIdea by Masao Komura, data by Makato Ohtake, programme by Koji Fujino (CTG)\" (p.75-76)\n\nEarly references to the group include the English-language spelling Komura, but the artist himself prefers the spelling Kohmura. \n\nThis copy of Running Cola is Africa was donated to the Museum by the Computer Arts Society. Some of the Society's founding members had been involved in the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition.",
