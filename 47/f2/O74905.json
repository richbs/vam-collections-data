            "public_access_description": "This modest work is an important early miniature portrait by John Hoskins, who originally trained as an oil painter. This work is datable to about 1615 and shows the still dominant influence of Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619). The red curtain background is typical for this time, a development of the flat blue background of Elizabethan (later 16th-century) miniatures. Red paint is laid in flat, but the artist then used a wet brush to lift the red paint in strokes, giving the effect of folds in a curtain. Hoskins has also painted the woman's pearl earring using Hilliard's jewelling technique. This involved laying on a raised blob of white lead paint with some shadowing to one side. This was then crowned with a rounded touch of real silver that was burnished with, to quote Hilliard, \u2018a pretty little tooth of some ferret or stoat or other wild little beast\u2019. This brought the silver to a sparkling highlight, while actual gold is used to paint the pearl\u2019s gold setting. Silver tarnishes with age, and so this pearl now appears black. Twenty years later Hoskins was painting pearls and gold in a more painterly fashion, using white and yellow paint rather than actual gold or silver. This change was influenced by Charles I's court painter, Anthony van Dyck, who arrived in London from Antwerp in 1632.",

Curiously, it has been largely overlooked in the post-war literature, possibly because of its inherent modesty, or possibly because the anachronistic dark fruitwood frame detracts from the Hilliardesque, jewel-like character of the miniature. Recently, however, Reynolds in the new edition of <i>English Portrait Miniatures</i> (1) has related it to the group of very early Hoskins' miniatures at Windsor, and illustrated it as the prime exemplar of Hoskins\u2019 beginnings.  \n \nThe costume and especially the saffron dye on the collar point to the date of c.1615, earlier than almost any other signed Hoskins miniature but closely comparable in technique with the still Hilliardesque work of the 1620s (as in Cat. No. 20 [P.32-1941]).The form of the monogram is very exceptional, but may be explained by the equally exceptional rarity of such early work. The painting of the red-curtain background emphasises one aspect of Hoskins' dependence on the Hilliard-Oliver tradition, and the style of portraiture overall suggests that early in his career Hoskins may also have been close to William Larkin.(2)\n\n1 Reynolds 1988. \n2 See for example the portraits attributed to Larkin by Strong 1969, nos 345-8.\u201d\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1942</u>, London: HMSO, 1955.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n<b>\nHOSKINS, John (d.1665)</b>\n\nMiniature portrait of an unknown lady.\n<i>Signed with monogram</i> IH.\n<i>On parchment on card.
