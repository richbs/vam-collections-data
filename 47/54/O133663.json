Introduced to Thomas Stothard RA c1793. Worked as theatrical scenery and panorama painter, notably for Henry Barker. Exhibited nine works at the RA between 1812 and 1818, eight at the BI 1817-36, and five watercolours at the SBA in 1835. From 1820 increasingly painted in watercolours; founder Associate of OWS 1824, Member 1825. Numerous illustrations for books, including Shakespeare, Scott and Burns; many drawings engraved for annuals and magazines. Several engravings, watercolours and drawings are in the V&A collections. Died 13 May 1866; despite a long and industrious life, had received a charitable annuity from the RA since 1858. \nLIT: DNB \nThe Barber and Others Purging Don Quixote's Library \n1852-1900 Neg HF967 \nCanvas, 30.5 X 25.4 cm (12 X 10 ins) Ashbee Bequest 1900 \nThe subject is taken from chapter 6 of part 1, book 1 of Cervantes's Don Quixote, first published in 1605. The episode depicted occurs towards the beginning of the Don's adventures and follows his housekeeper's realisation that his excessive reading of books about knight errantry had resulted in his misadventures so far. The local barber and priest determine to commit the offending books to the flames; the Don's niece comments that 'there is no reason to pardon any of them, for they have all of them caused the trouble'. \nWright had exhibited 'Don Quixote Being Fed by the High-born Ladies' at the RA in 1815 (see 1855-1900, below), and in 1816 exhibited 'The Scrutiny Performed by the Curate and the Barber in the Library of Don Quixote', which seems to have been exhibited again at the BI in the following year, the size given in the catalogue (presumably including the frame) as 24 by 22 inches. Two larger and more highly finished versions of the same subject and its companion (below) were recorded in an English private collection earlier this century; it may be that the present works are preparatory oil sketches. \nEXH: ?RA 1816 (32); BI 1817 (36) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
