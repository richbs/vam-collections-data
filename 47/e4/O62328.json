            "history_note": "This Videosphere television set was acquired by Pamela Powers' partner as a result of a points award scheme instigated by Alfa Romeo in the early 1970s. As an employee of Alfa Romeo he earned points for each sale he made and was able to convert the points into gifts which were selected from a catalogue.  The JVC Videosphere was chosen for Pamela Powers, son, Adam Carey, in around 1970 or 1971.  Adam, who was about 11 years old then, used the television in his bedroom at home in Chelsea.\n\nHistorical significance: The form of the JVC Videosphere alludes to a spaceman's helmet.  In the late 60s space travel had captured the public imagination and was influential on popular and high design.   Dated to 1970 the Videosphere can be seen as a direct result of the popularity of the first moon landing which took place in 1969.\n\nThe Videosphere is known to have been produced in both orange and white versions.  Such bright primary colours were typical of pop design, as was the choice of hard wearing, durable ABS plastic.", 
            "place": "Japan", 
            "production_note": "The design has generally been dated to 1970.  According to JVC UK the serial number of this example indicates that it was not made until 1974, and the model was apparently only available until 1976.  Records at Die Neue Sammlung Museum, Munich, who also have an example of the Videosphere, suggest that the TV was designed in 1970 and produced between 1971-74.\n\nReason For Production: Retail", 
            "historical_context_note": "The Videosphere was aimed at a youthful market and was amongst the first television sets to be specifically styled as a second set for the home, notably the teenager's bedroom.",
