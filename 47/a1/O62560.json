The right hand is in kataka mudra; the left arm in lola hasta.   The hair is dressed into a high bun and surmounted by a lotus-bud (now broken).   Behind the head there is a flowerlike siras cakra (disc for hanging garlands).  The patterned lower-garment is worn with a girdle with beaded festoons.   There is no sash, although there is a loop in front reminiscent of the conventional sash loop.   Other details include a sacred cord, keyura armlets, makara kundala ear pendants, a long plait of hair extending below the right shoulder, garlands on both shoulders, and padasaras on the feet.  The figure stands on a circular lotus pedestal with holes for fixing the image to a processional carrier.  When acquired by the Museum, the surface of the metal was heavily encrusted with carbonate matter formed during earth burial and has since been cleaned by the electrolyte process.",
