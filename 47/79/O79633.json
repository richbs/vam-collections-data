The vase was probably purely ornamental and intended to be displayed on a mantelpiece or other domestic furnishing. A Derby auction catalogue of 1773 states that 'Antique' vases were 'particularly adapted for the Decoration of Chimney Pieces, Cabinets, Toilets. &c.' This particular vase, however, is too large for a glazed cabinet or lady's dressing table.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe market for vases in the 'antique' style grew rapidly in the late 1760s, as the Neo-classical style gained ground. The demand for them was so great that, in addition to copying genuine Greek and Roman antiquities, manufacturers copied vase designs, usually prints, of the 16th to 18th centuries. This vase reproduces one that the 16th-century Italian artist Polidoro da Caravaggio painted on the facade of the Palazzo Milesi in Rome in the 1520s. Derby's immediate source for the design was probably a print by Giovan Battista Galestruzzi (born 1618; died after 1681). Engravings after 'Polydoro' are listed in an inventory of prints owned by the Derby factory in 1791. Polidoro's fantastic vase designs were also copied by the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), who used them as background devices in his portraits.",
