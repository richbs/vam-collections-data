To illustrate the faults of popular wallpaper patterns to a class of schoolchildren, his fictional official contemptuously describes a paper with repeated naturalistic images of horses. However, it is unlikely that a paper such as this one in the V&A\u2019s collection would have been used in an ordinary domestic context. The subject matter would have made it an appropriate decoration for a public house, a games room or a sportsmen's club.",
