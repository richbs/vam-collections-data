The name of the embroideress, Kadambini, is inscribed in a corner. The coverlet bears a label of the Bengal Home Industries Association. While obviously influenced by the 'kantha' idiom the embroideress has adopted a colour scheme which would not be found in earlier more traditional 'Kanthas' but is related to folk painting.",
