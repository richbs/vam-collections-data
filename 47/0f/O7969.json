The shell-shaped back and the swags and pendant masks were appropriate ornament for the Classical interiors designed for English Court circles by the architect Inigo Jones (1573-1652).\nLike Jones, Francis Clein spent several years in Italy, before working for Christian IV of Denmark on the decoration of the Royal Palace at Rosenborg. He came to England in the mid-1620s and was appointed designer to the Mortlake tapestry manufactory. He also designed interiors at Ham House, Richmond and Holland House, Kensington. This chair has no history of ownership but is similar to a chair from the Gilt Chamber at Holland House, which was decorated to Clein's direction in the 1620s. The shell-shaped chair back echoed the shell-decorated niche above the central door in the Gilt Chamber. Recent cleaning of this chair by staff of the Conservation Section has revealed traces of original gilding.\nBy 1670 such chairs were no longer fashionable and those designed by Clein for the Long Gallery at Ham House appear as garden furniture in Henry Danckerts' oil painting of King Charles II being presented with a pineapple in the grounds at Ham.\nAs relatively little furniture of royal quality remains from the early 17th century, this chair is a rare survival.\n[Tessa Murdoch]"

They are also recorded in the Gilt Chamber of Holland House, London.\n\nPeople\nThe 18th-century diarist Horace Walpole believed that the chairs at Holland House were designed by Francis Cleyn, chief designer at the Mortlake tapestry works from 1626. Chairs like this would have been popular with the select group of courtiers known as the 'Whitehall Set'. They were close to Charles I and shared his taste for the latest fashions from Italy and France.",

Based on the Italian <font -i>sgabello</font>, a trestle stool with cartouche-shaped supports and a back, this chair has arms the shape of which recalls French <font -i>caqueteuse</font> armchairs. The design was probably inspired by furniture seen during Clein's Italian visit and the work of Inigo Jones with whom he was closely associated. The shell shaped back and the swags and pendant masks were appropriate ornament for the Classical interiors designed for English Court circles by Inigo Jones. This chair is a rare survival of courtly furniture from the early 17th century.",

A pair of similar chairs are shown in the Picture Gallery at Arundel House in the Strand in the portrait of the Countess of Arundel painted by Daniel Mytens in 1618. Evidence from contemporary inventories suggests that this type of Italianate furniture was sometimes displayed with Italian marble tables. By 1670 such chairs were no longer fashionable and those designed by Clein for the Long Gallery at Ham House appear as garden furniture in Henry Danckaerts' oil painting of  Ham, as seen from the south front.",
