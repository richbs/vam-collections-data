            "public_access_description": "Homage to the Queen was choreographed by Frederick Ashton as the Sadler's Wells Ballet tribute celebrating the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June, 1953. From surviving notes, it appears that Messel envisaged the ballet opening with a spectacular procession, incorporating folk and mythological figures; it would close with an Apotheosis showing Elizabeth I as Queen of the Past, handing on the orb to Elizabeth II as Queen of the Present, before leaving her 'surrounded with all the virtues and gifts.'  The young Elizabeth was to be transformed into a symbol of virtue.\n\nWhat Messel wanted, in fact, was nothing less than a 17th century Jacobean court masque in the manner of Inigo Jones. Such lavish, fantastical designs would have cost more than his sets and costumes for the main ballet, so on stage the procession of homage was reduced to a simple entry for the queens of the four elements - Earth, Water, Fire and Air - and their attendants and, after the ballet, an apotheosis when the spirit of the first Elizabeth passes the orb to the second. \n\nThe drawings for Homage to the Queen show Messel working towards a design concept. His lion and unicorn appear in another of the sketches, dancing in front of a vast litter on which sits Elizabeth I. However, the procession was not realised in this form and the lion and the unicorn did not appear.\n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",
