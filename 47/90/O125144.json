            "bibliography": "Parris, Leslie and Ian Fleming-Williams, <u> Constable </u> London : The Tate Gallery, 1991. ISBN 1854370707 / 1854370715. 544 p. : ill. (some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 198-199\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\u201cWhen the canvas was received in the Museum the sketch of Willy Lott's house was treated as the more important of the two sides in the <i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>. The side now framed for exhibition has the appearance of having been folded about 1 1/2 inches from the left-hand side and this roughly corresponds with the top of the sketch on the other side. There is a line of darker colour about 4 inches from the right-hand side. \nNo. 329 [787-1888] <i>recto</i> is a version of the composition seen in No.100 [326-1888] of 1811. The colder tonality and sketchier finish suggest that it may have been worked up by Constable in his studio from No. 100 [326-1888], which is the open air sketch, and that this may have been done at the same time as No. 329a [787-1888, back], which is here assigned to c.1830.  Further, it may have been intended, as was No. 329a [787-188, back], to be the sketch for a plate in <i>English Landscape Scenery</i>, but no engraving of it is known to have been started. Holmes, p. 249, dates the recto c.1830. \nNo. 329a [787-1888, back] is painted upon a portion only of the canvas and leaves about 21- inches unpigmented. The unpigmented part is inscribed in ink M. L. [Maria Louisa Constable]. This is the sketch used by Lucas for the mezzotint 'Willy Lott's House' (S. 33). The mezzotint was intended for <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> and was in an advanced state by March 1832, but it was not published during the artist's lifetime. Lucas issued it in his supplementary volume to the work in 1845. Shirley (S. : L., p. 196) gives these facts and reproduces as the original sketch for the engraving No. 110 [166-1888](recto); but No. 329a is much closer to the plate than either Nos. 110 or  110a. The main difference between the mezzotint and No. 329a is that the former has a figure on horseback in the right foreground: this was originally a standing figure and was altered by the artist during the proof stages (S. : L., p. 196, No. 33a-e). It is stated in the list of the engravings in Lucas's publication that the figure on horseback is Constable's father, and that the sketch No. 329a then belonged to Miss [Maria] Constable. The deviation from truth of colour and form, the suppression of the middle distance, the simplification of the foreground and the very sketchy quality of the trees, suggest that Constable made this sketch from No. 110a (or from the left-hand side of the study for 'The Hay Wain', No. 209 [987-1900]) for the engraver's use. On the other hand, the river appears to be in flood in both No. 329a and the mezzotint, which might imply a further reference to the motif. In either event it may be dated c.1830. Davies, p. 24, accepts No. 329a as the basis of the engraving, in preference to Nos. 110 110a.\u201d",
