The oval face and heavy-lidded eyes, as well as the comparatively large size of this piece, suggest it was made in the Philippines, when those islands were under Spanish rule, probably by a Chinese or possibly Filipino sculptor. It is likely to date from around 1700. Such ivories were usually made for export to Spain; the archangel St Michael, in the guise of a warrior, was frequently depicted.",
