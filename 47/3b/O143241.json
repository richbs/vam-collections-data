She challenged the formality and complexity of the fashions of the time, and was critical of designers such as Christian Dior (1905-57).  Pat Cunningham, editor of Vogue said, 'Femininity had gone too far - you needed stage-coach luggage to pack your frocks in and ladies' maids to fix the trimmings and petticoats. Chanel simplified clothes to meet modern needs.'  \n\nIn 1957 Dior died, leaving Chanel once more the undisputed leader of fashion.  In this year she won the Neiman-Marcus award for fashion, and in 1958 Vogue declared her 'more truly of today' than many designers half her age.\n  \nThis dress was worn by the 1950s model, Anne Gunning Parker (later Lady Nutting).",
