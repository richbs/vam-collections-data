The partitioned pegbox has the sides carved in relief with acanthus bordering, and the back pierced and carved with fine floral scrolls and strapwork. The finial is a carved figure of Orpheus playing a lyre, with putti below. Of six original pegs for the playing strings, two have been removed and their holes filled. Wrest pins for twenty-five wire sympathetic strings are distributed across both halves of the pegbox. The wires run to an oblique fixed bridge with hitch-rail immediately below. Tailpiece, attached to an asymmetrically placed hook-bar, and fingerboard are decorated with marquetry of engraved ivory on tortoiseshell with figures in classical dress, and with strapwork.'\n\nAnthony Baines, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-Keyboard Instruments</i> (London, 1978), pp. 12-13.",

Sainprae was most likely of French Huguenot origin, but this is the only surviving instrument to bear his signature, and nothing else is known about him. However, this example is made to the highest standard, and the exquisitely carved finial represents Orpheus playing a lyre. The ornament is related to the numerous patterns for Laub und Bandelwerk (a late phase of strapwork coupled with floral motifs, the equivalent of R\u00e9gence ornament in France).\n\nThe baryton was a central European instrument that enjoyed a vogue between about 1640 and 1800. The most famous baryton composer was Josef Haydn (1732-1809) who wrote a large number of pieces for his patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy (1714-1790), a Hungarian nobleman and an enthusiastic amateur player.",
