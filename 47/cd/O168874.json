The layers are most commonly divided as follows:\n\nQuilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. If the top is a single piece of fabric in which the design is formed primarily through the stitching, such as this example, it is known as a 'wholecloth quilt'.\n\nWadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. \n\nReverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design.\n\nThis cot cover was probably created in the later part of the eighteenth century, and may have been recycled from dress materials. The reuse of textiles was a common activity at this time, particularly given the economic investment in valuable silks. It is possible that the family created this quilt from a piece of silk readily available within the home.",
