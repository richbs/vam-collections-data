The design, the elements such as the wheels and folding handle, and the manufacturing methods used are probably derived from what was easily available within a light engineering environment.  The wheels in particular are of a generic type much used at the time in making trolleys, wheeled frames and trailers.\n\nThis object is not, as one might assume from its fairly primitive design and finish, a one-off.  The museum has two examples of this type of pushchair, and declined the offer of a third.  It seems likely that all were made in the Greater London area as a by-product of industry, and found a ready market at a time when such items were in short supply.",
