His early work was associated with Minimalism. \n\nThe imagery of this print is entirely made up of text printed in regular columns. The title Length 4 is a reference to the fact that all the words are English four-letter words. Some are crossed out, not because they are wrong, but because there are (deliberate) errors in the printing. Of course a 'four-letter word' is also a swear word. Ferguson's work here satirises the idea that some words can be arbitrarily considered bad, inelegant or inappropriate in some contexts. This print is part of a series, a book-work, a 'dictionary' arranged by word-length, which questions the ways in which we use and classify our language. And since we define and describe our world through language, these questions are extended to wider issues of division and classification, political and social.",
