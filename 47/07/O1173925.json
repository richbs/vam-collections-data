She was an actress in the great classical tradition of tragedy, the heiress of Sybil Thorndike.  Marriage and motherhood led her to abandon the stage, to which she returned after a twelve year absence to play the Empress Eugenie in a one-woman show.  Her performance won rave reviews in London and was seen at over fifty festivals and venues in England and abroad.  This was her last role.",
