The most obvious application is in the context of medicine and pharmacy, but they were also essential pieces of equipment in the household, where they were used not only to prepare food, but also simple medicines and cosmetics. Similarly they would be found in the studios of artists and craftsmen, as well as the laboratory of the alchemist. This example is a conical mortar decorated around the rim with plain mouldings. On the body there are foliate swags below which appear two lions passant and two stags standing between trees.",
