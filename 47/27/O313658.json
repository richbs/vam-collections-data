He worked in Milan and later in Spain where he became clockmaker for King Philip II. He also worked with the medallist Trezzo and they were friends.\nThe sculptor, gem-engraver and medallist Jacopo Nizzola Trezzo (b. Milan ca. 1515 - d. Madrid 1589) served Cosimo II de'Medici as gem-cutter. His earliest medal is dated 1550. Later he worked for Philip II of Spain in the Netherlands (1555-1559) and in Madrid (1559-death). He is highly esteemed as a gem engraver and his medals were modelled with great esteem and delicacy of detail.",
