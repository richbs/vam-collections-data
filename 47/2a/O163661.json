The straight stitches and long and loose.  The various elements of the design are not always symmetrical.  There is a wide composite border on all 4 sides: from the outside, narrow band with small lozenges in straight stitch either side of a band of needleweaving.  A wide band divided into pointed cartouches with a pulled thread ground of small holes on a grid pattern separated by X-shaped segments of embroidered straight stitches, predominantly diamonds made of 2 large triangles but at the ends of the long borders are segments of stepped diamonds. A repeat of the embroidered bands and needleweaving follows.  In the middle of the narrow borders is a pulled thread hexagon instead of a cartouche.\nThe field is divided into four openwork sections: a diamond with two long sides and an ordinary diamond, a repeat of both. The pattern has small holes on a grid system.  There are three embroidered stars in the lowest diamond, one in the next, two in the one above, and 1 in the top diamond.  The rest of the ground is worked in lines of diamonds formed by 2 large triangles.  At the top these form a pointed arch with spandrels in pulled thread work - hence the suggestion that it could be a prayer mat or a hanging.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\nAlthough this Museum Number was assigned in 1995, this piece was probably acquired and originally numbered in the 19th century.  It has a parchment label on which the new number has been written.  I think the original number had worn off, could not be identified from existing records and the piece was therefore 'acquired' as an untraced find.",
