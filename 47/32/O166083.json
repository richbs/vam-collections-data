            "public_access_description": "At the start of the 19th century, the British market was flooded with a new range of printed cottons. They were used for clothing and furnishings, including the creation of light, bright coverings for the bedroom. Printed textile panels became popular. Many celebrated military victories and coronations. Some were associated with particular causes. Women began to include such panels in their patchwork, revealing an engagement with politics and public debates.\n\nThe cotton panel at the centre of this bedcover was printed to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. It shows the moment in Westminster Abbey when the crown was placed on her head. The youth and charm of the 19-year-old Victoria captured the public imagination, and fabrics such as this were a popular way of declaring patriotism and loyalty within the home.",

Her portrait could be found throughout the country: in magazines and advertisements, and on commemorative textiles such as this one. Victoria\u2019s youth (she was crowned at the age of 19) and charm were perceived by many as a new start for the monarchy. After witnessing the throngs of people that turned out for her formal procession, Queen Victoria wrote: \n'...many as there were the day I went to the City, it was nothing \u2013 nothing, to the multitudes, the millions, of my loyal subjects who were assembled in every spot to witness the Procession. Their good-humour and excessive loyalty was beyond everything and I really cannot say how proud I feel to be the Queen of such a Nation.'",

It shows the scene in Westminster Abbey when the crown was placed on her head. Commemorative prints were particularly popular in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, but as this example shows, printers continued to view royal events as lucrative subjects for textiles. As Linda Parry has shown, the design is loosely based on an original engraving by the lithographic artist G.E. Maddeley, but the image has been distorted and simplified to suit the printing process. The reduction in the quality of both design and printing suggests that it was made primarily for export, so it is interesting to note that a second quilt with this textile exists in America, and forms part of the collections of the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York State.",
