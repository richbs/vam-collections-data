It includes \"a mahogany long-case clock by Mitchell & Mott of which I have the history from 1785\".\n\n10 March 1955 minute paper, Lowe to Molesworth\ndescribes Mrs Cooper's American furniture as \"disappointing\u2026of poor quality and extremely ugly\".  The only possible exception is the long case clock, though even this was not of top quality.  \n\nThe minute paper describes the clock \"Mahogany with satinwood banding.  Cresting with floral painting by Mitchell and Mott, New York\".\n\nAccording to Mrs Cooper and to a document pasted inside the door \nThis clock was brought into their family by Sarah Ondernouk at the time of her marriage in 1785 and remained at the family house at Fort Neck until 1927.  This is odd, for according to Nutting's Furniture Treasury, the firm of Mitchell and Mott was not established until 1793.\n\n23 March 1955 letter, Joan Cooper to Ashton\nexplains that the clock was the property of her mother, Mrs Barnardiston.  She asks \u00a350 for the clock and a chair.\n\n14 June 1955 purchase listed\nas \"long-case clock North American, late 18th century.  Mahogany with satinwood banding\".",
