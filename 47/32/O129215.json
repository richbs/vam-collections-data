It created enough bulk to support the dome-shaped skirts of the fashionable 1860s silhouette, and provided plenty of warmth without adding too much weight. \n\nThe brightly coloured paisley design was used for petticoats and other accessories such as handkerchieves. Indian influences can be seen in the tear-drop 'buta' motifs which are printed on a red ground in blue, green, yellow and black. The bright red vegetable dye is based on madder and became known as Turkey or Adrianople red. It was a popular print, and with improved production methods, became readily affordable. Goose down was also plentiful and inexpensive.",
