They were particularly popular in the late nineteenth century and the finest examples from this period were made in France. The Roullet-Decamps company was one of the pre-eminent makers of automata and the pouncing tiger is one of its archetypal automata from the late nineteenth century. The company made different versions of the tiger. The simplest example just crawled and the most elaborate had an open mouth and both pounced and growled. This tiger moves its head, slowly crouches and suddenly pounces. It was purchased by the donor\u2019s great grandfather and remembered by succeeding generations as a toy that was brought out on special occasions and played with sparingly.",
