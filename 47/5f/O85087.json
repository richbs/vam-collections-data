It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Mayo had appeared at the Grand the previous May, but in September he was on the bill with Harry Taft, also one of Cooke\u2019s subjects.\n\nBorn Sam Cowan in Lambeth, London, in 1881, Mayo made his first appearance at a Sunday morning concert at the Victoria Club in the Blackfriars Road. He first appeared in music hall in 1898 at the Alhambra, Sandgate. He often dressed in a dressing gown and motoring cap, and sang comic songs including \u2018She Cost Me Seven and Sixpence\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ve Only Come Down for the Day\u2019. He was often billed as \u2018The Immobile One\u2019 because of his trick of standing still on stage with a lugubrious expression while singing comic songs. Later he toured his own revues and was popular in pantomime. \n\nMayo went on to tour with his own revues, and appear in variety and pantomime a review of his act heading the variety bill at the Theatre Royal Aldershot in June 1931 the reviewer called him: 'The inimitable Sam Mayo, one of England's best-known comedians and humorists' [sic] adding: 'Part of Sam's charm is his pained expression while he sings the most funny songs, playing his own accompaniments on a grand piano.'",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall singer and comedian Sam Mayo (1881-1938), billed as 'the Immobile One' because of his ability to maintain a lugubrious expression whilst singing ridiculous songs.  He was born Sam Cowan in Lambeth, made his first appearance at a Sunday morning concert at the Victoria Club in the Blackfriars Road and his first music-hall appearance in 1898 at the Alhambra, Sandgate. He often dressed in a type of dressing gown and motoring cap and sang comic songs including 'She Cost Me Seven and Sixpence' and 'I've Only Come Down for the Day'. This caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in the music hall in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
