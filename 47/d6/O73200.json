            "public_access_description": "This jade piece is a tour de force of intricate carving, almost certainly from a workshop under imperial patronage. The box is carved from a single block of translucent pale green jade whose original size would have been no smaller than 40cm x 40cm. Then the jade block was carved into a group of eight geese in various positions, some preening, some about to take flight, some entangled amid sinuous waterweeds which are finely carved in openwork. The whole piece is divided horizontally into two halves so that the body of each goose is hollowed out to form a small box. The lower half of each body has an internal riser over which the lid fits. The carving is naturalistic, with details of the birds' heads and feathers indicated by incised lines. \nThis object might not have served any practical function, but it would have stunned everyone who set eyes on it. It was a vehicle through which the jade carver showed off his virtuosity. It was also a sure way for the owner to win the esteem of his peers.",
