The Italian architect Domenico de Cortona was chosen to design the building in 1519. The choice of an Italian architect reflected a conscious effort to establish prestigious Italian Renaissance art forms in France, though the labour was supplied by French masons. The work is sculpted with a crowned salamander, an emblem of King Francis I of France (reigned 1515-1547), for whom the Ch\u00e2teau was built.",

            "historical_context_note": "Francis I (born Sept. 12, 1494, Cognac, France: died March 31, 1547, Rambouillet) also called  (until 1515) Francis Of Angoul\u00eame, Fran\u00e7ois D'angoul\u00eame King of France (1515\u201347), the first of five monarchs of the Angoul\u00eame branch of the House of Valois. A Renaissance patron of the arts and scholarship, a humanist, and a knightly king, he waged campaigns in Italy (1515\u201316) and fought a series of wars with the Holy Roman Empire (1521\u201344). He commissioned Ch\u00e2teau Chambord, the largest of the Loire ch\u00e2teaux, one of the most extravagant commissions of its age. The Italian architect Domenico de Cortona was chosen to design the building in 1519. The choice of an Italian architect reflected a conscious effort to establish prestigious Italian Renaissance art forms in France, though the labour was supplied by French masons. The size of the ch\u00e2teau was immense with over 440 rooms, 85 staircases and 365 chimneys and stables to accommodate 1200 horses, it stands in a park surrounded by a wall of 22 miles in circumference. The exterior of the chateau is richly embellished with coats of arms  proclaiming the wealth and power of the owner although Francis I stayed at Chambord less than forty days in total.",
