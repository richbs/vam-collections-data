It represents a scene in a drawing room with a woman and children engaged in sewing, embroidery and lace-making while a servant offers the lady of the house refreshments from a tray of fruit and a lidded jug.  It was made as a scene for the biblical story of The Legend of the Prodigal Son, and is one of a series of six relating to this story. Sheets like this relating to various biblical stories were probably the basis for an early form of German Toy Theatre.\n\nThe series also includes a sheet of characters, with four boars and a trough. From the way the characters are portrayed and set out on the sheet it appears that it was meant to be cut up and used in performance in conjunction with a text. It is unlikely that the images were meant for one static three-dimensional image like a 'Nativity', but rather for performance.",
