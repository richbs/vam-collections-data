Illustrated with upwards of One Hundred and Twenty Views.  London: Published by William Spooner, 377 Strand.  Novr. 5th, 1844  \n(William Spooner was at this address from 1837 to 1846.)\nPasted to the outside of the bottom right panel is a green label marked:- Sold at dunnett's Toy Warehouse, Cheapside, London.  William Dunnett, last of a family of toymen, was listed at 3 Cheapside from 1840-1853.  Pasted to the inside of the folder is a small green label:- Deighton Bookseller & Stationer Worcester.\n\n\nTHERE IS NO BOOKLET WITH THIS GAME, HOWEVER, THE OVERALL RULES WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE TRAVELLERS OF EUROPE.  THE PREFACE TO THEAT BOOKLET OF RULES. IS AS FOLLOWS:-\nThe compiler of `The Travellers', who has on many occasions successfully catered for the entertainment of youth,  has in the present game, aimed at the higher object of blending instruction with amusement; and while he has attempted to impart the elements of geographical knowledge to very young learners , he has not neglected to make the medium as pleasant and amusing as that of any one of his former popular games.  The Study of Geography, in itself so interesting, when pursued through  the formal details of a chart,, may not at first offer an attraction to the youthful student; but by means of an emulative game, in which the distances and positions of the various countries and capitals are geographically defined, and in which the leading cities of  Europe are illustrated  by correct representations, the publisher has thought to stimulate the young inquirer to that thirst after knowledge, which may be perfected in maturer years.\nThe pictorial illustrations of cities are derived from the most recent views on approved authorities, as the  Whale Fishery in the Northern Ocean, and the Giant's Causeway in Ireland; or some peculiar custom is portrayed, as sledge travelling in Russia, and the perilous sports of the remote inhabitants of Finland and of Siberia.\nLittle, it is presumed, need be said in favour of a mode of information at once so pleasing and so exact; or of an amusement which will leave on the youthful mind many of the solid advantages of a more regular instruction.  The publisher, therefore, presents this little game which equal confidence both to parents and to children, in the full assurance that to the former  it will afford all the satisfaction, and to the latter all the amusement, which either he or they can desire.  To those little wayfarers who, by so many various routes, seek the object of the heart's constant affections - Home - he recommends not only the patience and perseverance of more matured travellers, but that as they meet or cross each others' path on this extended stage of travel, they should cultivate that kindness and good humour which sweeten the path of life - to the child as well as to the man - in the city and in the desert, as well as by their own cheerful and contented firesides.\n\nIn the Travellers of Europe the players move along set lines in one of four directions;  it is likely that this game is played by the standard method of moving from numbered square to numbered square as all are marked from 1 to 104.  It is also probable that as a player landed on a square, he had to recite the appropriate passage from the booklet.\n\nRules placement: booklet",
