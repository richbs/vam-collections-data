His hands are raised in blessing; his feet rest on a ledge. The folds of his garments are treated very decoratively by the sculptor. Between his knees is the cross which rises from the base of the panel and bears the bearded figure of Christ, his head inclined to the left, long hair hanging on his shoulders, and wearing a lonicloth and the torse. Behind the throne at the top of the panel two angels stand to left and right on brackets, swinging censers. Two more angels kneel to left and right at the base of the cross, each holding a chalice between them with one hand to receive the blood of Christ; their other hands are raised. The Holy Spirit is not represented, but there is a dowel hole at the top of the cross by which the Dove was doubtless attached.\n\nThe canopy at the top of the panel is damaged. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Traces of red decorated with flecks of white are on the angels' wings. The upper background is gilt with the remains of gesso decoration. The crown, hair and beard of God the Father are gilt as are the angels' censers and the canopy. There are four lead-plugged holes with latten wires attached at the back of the panel. The bottom has been cut away.",
