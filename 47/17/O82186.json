This medium is more durable than paper. Although these portraits were called 'plumbagos', meaning black lead, they were usually drawn in graphite and sometimes in ink. This portrait is done in graphite.\n\n\u2018Plumbagos' developed in the Netherlands in the late 16th century within the print trade. They developed from the printmakers\u2019 original drawings on paper, from which a print would have been engraved. 'Plumbagos' were introduced into England when the monarchy was restored in 1660, by printmakers who returned home from exile abroad. As the taste for 'plumbagos' became established, artists who were not printmakers also began to produce them.\n\nRobert White was a pupil of David Loggan, who was also a 'plumbago' artist. He engraved about 400 portraits, some of them after his own drawings. He also engraved title-pages and landscapes. He was famous for his exactly drawn 'plumbago' portraits on vellum.",
