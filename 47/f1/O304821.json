The gilt leather wall hanging in the pawnshop in Treviso, dated in the first half of the 17th century, has a very similar pattern as the panels, but not identical. \n\nFormerly described as 'Florentine, 16th century'. There is, however, no exact information available (not in Italy or elsewhere) to keep this attribution any longer standing. The whole group of  panels and hangings that were acquired from Bardini were, without any exception, being described in this way, although for instance inventory number 732-1890 has proven to be of a Dutch origin. Information supplied by Eloy Koldeweij, October 1996.\n\nPurchase price of \u00a31000 for a group of leather objects (museum numbers: 682-1890 to 732-1890).",
