            "public_access_description": "This poster advertised Malcolm McLaren's Punk festival at the 100 Club, Oxford Street, September 1976. McLaren was trying to stamp his role on the emergence of Punk in Europe by setting up two nights of gigs at the 100 Club. The first night included performances by Sex Pistols, The Clash and the first gig by Siouxsie and the Banshees (on this poster, spelt Suzie). They formed specifically to fill space on the bill after McLaren asked the Bromley contingent, journalist Caroline Coon's name for followers of the Sex Pistols and McLaren and Westwood's shop Sex, if any of them could play. Sid Vicious, later to be bassist with the Sex Pistols and then known as John Simon Ritchie, was drummer in this incarnation of the band.\n\nJamie Reid's (b. 1947) cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren (1946-2010), later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
