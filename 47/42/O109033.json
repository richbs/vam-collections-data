St Mark is represented with his 'attribute' or identifying symbol, a winged lion.\n\nThe four plaques were probably once part of a large religious object such as a custodia, a towering architectural canopy which was carried over a monstrance during the annual parade and pageantry of the Corpus Christi festival. Custodias were unique to Spain and reflected a national appetite for massive silver forms. \n\nA further 16 plaques thought to be from the same source are also in the V&A (M.510:1 to16-1956), depicting scenes from the life of Christ. They were possibly made by Enrique de Arfe, one of the most successful Renaissance goldsmiths in Spain, or by a goldsmith associated with his workshop. He trained in Cologne in Germany but spent much of his career on commissions for church silver, especially custodias, in Spanish cathedrals.",

Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
