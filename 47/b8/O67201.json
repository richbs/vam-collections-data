It remains one of the most popular carpet patterns and appears with many variations:  radically different effects can be achieved by simply changing the proportion of the  motifs or by using colour to highlight particular parts of it. This is an incredibly fine tapestry-woven carpet, known as a kelim,  with a small-scale pattern with constant colour changing; it will have demanded great skill and concentration from the weavers.",
