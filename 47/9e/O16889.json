This one was originally in the collection of Sir Elijah Impey and Lady Impey, who commissioned over 300 pictures in Calcutta between 1777 and 1782. Sir Elijah was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Fort William. He was a man of great intellect and wide-ranging interests. The Impeys were passionately interested in the flora and fauna of India and formed a private menagerie at their house, where they assembled birds and animals. From 1777 they employed three Indian artists to paint their collection. One of them was the Muslim painter Shaykh Zayn al-Din, who probably came originally from Patna. \nIn 1775 Warren Hastings, the first British Governor-General of India, had sent an embassy to the Panchen Lama in Tibet. He privately commissioned its leader to bring back specimens of flora and fauna for the menagerie. They travelled via Bhutan, and it seems likely that they acquired this shawl goat on that occasion. There was great interest at the time in whether the wool of the goat could be a financially rewarding commercial venture.",
