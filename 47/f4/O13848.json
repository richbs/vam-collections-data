It is said to have been worn by Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers of New York, later Lady Fairhaven. \n\nThe bodice is waist length, panelled with satin and edged with black moir\u00e9 ribbon.  It is trimmed at the back with a made-up bow with long pendant ends.  The dress fastens at the shoulder over a boned, green silk bodice lining.  The sleeves are long with a high pleated shoulder.  Collar and cuffs are faced with gold beaded tulle.  The skirt has a slightly draped front, with the back flared and arranged in deep pleats.  It is mounted over a green silk petticoat, and boned and taped to a bustle shape at the back.  The skirt may have been altered and have lost a side panel.  \n\nA machine-woven label 'Worth Paris' has been stitched to the waist tape. Charles Frederick Worth (1825-95) was a celebrated Parisian couture dressmaker.  He was born in 1825 in Bourne, Lincolnshire, and started working at the age of 12 in a draper's shop in London. Eight years later he moved to Paris, where he opened his own premises in 1858. He was soon patronised by the Empress Eugenie and her influence was instrumental to his success. Made-to-measure clothes from Worth, as from the other great Parisian fashion houses, were an important symbol of social and financial advancement.",

Broughton died before he could be elevated to a peerage, their eldest son Urban H.R. Broughton (1896-1966) became 1st Baron Fairhaven of Lode on 20 March 1929, while Cara became 1st Lady Fairhaven. This barony became extinct on Urban H.R.Broughton's death, but a later barony, Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey, co. Cambridge, was granted to him in 1961, with a remainder to his brother, Henry (1900-1973), to enable this title to continue after his death without male heirs.\n\nThis forms part of a large donation of late 19th and early 20th century garments and accessories (with a few historical textiles) donated to the Museum in 1972 by Cara's grandson and Henry's son, Major Ailwyn Broughton and his wife, a year before Ailwyn became Lord Fairhaven following his father's death.\n\nSome of the nineteenth century garments are thought to have been worn by Cara's sister, Anne (1865-1924), although the relative severity and simplicity of this dress would have been considered appropriate for the young and unmarried daughter of a wealthy American family.",
