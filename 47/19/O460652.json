It was the fashionable dress worn for cocktail and evening wear. It was made for me in 1948 in Peking by a Shanghai tailor since they were reputed to be the best tailors and dress makers... The tailor came to our house to measure up and then again for fittings... \nAs far as I can recall I only wore the dress on two occasions. Once in 1950 when I organised a Chinese Evening Ball for the Officers and men of the American Eigth Army Airforce in Brize Norton, where I served as the Senior British Hostess to the Base. The second time was at the wedding reception of a friend at the Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane.'",
