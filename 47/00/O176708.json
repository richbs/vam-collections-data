Holkham Hall was built 1734-1736 for the first Lord Leicester, and designed in the neo- Palladian style by Leicester and Lord Burlington, assisted by William Kent and Matthew Brettingham. The interiors were still being installed in the 1750's, shortly before and during the period of Chambers's visit. The temple in cat. 142, designed by William Kent 1730-1735, is much modified by Chambers, who omits an arch in the portico and completely alters the sides. The North State Bedchamber (5712.396) was not finished until 1759, its chimneypiece being imported from Rome in 1754. The chimneypiece in cat.raz is now in Lady Leicester's Sitting Room. The chimneypiece in 5712.426, after Inigo jones, is now in the entrance room to the Strangers' Wing. It was used as the basis of design in the Treatise. Matthew Brettingham claimed responsibility for the gate, 5712.261. For Narford Hall, see 5712.398. The items shown here in 5712.407 are an earthenware bowl of St. Porchaire ware and a detail of an Urbino maiolica pilgrim flask. Chambers has profoundly modified the bowl, adding, among other things, finials and swirling gadroons and classicizing the supports. The result is something resembling an ancient marble basin. The flask is very similar to lot 223 in the Narford Hall Sale.",
