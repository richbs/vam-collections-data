Abstract shapes are embroidered in gold and silver on the fabric.\n\nThis dress might have been designed by Natalia Goncharova, a Russian artist who emigrated to Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution. Natalia Goncharova (1881-1962) had a long career with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. She produced astonishing costumes that were inspired by her Russian background and her work as an avant-garde artist. Like many Russian refugees in Paris, she also designed dresses. These strongly reflected her work for Diaghilev. Between 1922 and 1926, she worked for the Maison Myrbor (House of Myrbor). This exclusive shop was owned by the Italian Marie Cuttoli. It sold fashion, rugs and curtains designed by the international avant-garde.",

            "history_note": "This dress was worn by Miss Emilie Grigsby (1876-1964) who was a wealthy independent American who came to England from New York. She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nThe embroidery motifs on this dress are similar to design elements in the patchwork appliqu\u00e9 motifs on the Myrbor/ Natalia Goncharova pieces also from Emilie Grigsby's wardrobe (see T.157-1967, T.158-1967 and CIRC.329-1968). At the time of acquisition it was thought that this dress might also be from Myrbor. Given the provenance, the dress could certainly be Myrbor, but this requires further research to ascertain.",
