In the ceremony of Havdalah aromatic spices are inhaled to revive the soul, after the departure of the special shabbat soul.   Typical spices used at this time were wild myrtle, balsam, jasmine. rosemary, nutmeg or mixed spices. \n\nThis spice box is one of the earliest known spice boxes of tower form. It dates to the 13th century. The first literary mention of a container for Havdalah spices appears in the 12th century. The incorporation of miniature architectural forms was a common practice in the medieval period and can be seen in this object as well as in censers. lamps and reliquaries.\n\nThis rare spice box was acquired by the museum in 1855 and at that time thought to be a Christian reliquary.",

Central to Judaism is the observance of the Sabbath. This is a holy day, set apart from the rest of the working week. It begins one hour before sunset on Friday and ends on Saturday evening when three stars can be seen in the night sky. \n\nThe Jewish year revolves around a number of festivals, such as Passover. These originated in ancient times and embody multiple layers of meaning, from agricultural festivals to historical events.",
