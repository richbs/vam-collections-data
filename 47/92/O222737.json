In the centre of the body is a roundel  containing a relief depicting a woodland hunting scene  where a bowman on foot has struck a mounted archer in  the throat, while the stag runs off into the distance.  In the two spandrels at either side of the scene are  two quatrefoils containing men's busts in medieval  costume. Above the roundel are the Royal arms. On  either side of the crest of arms are two cartouches  containing fruit swags and winged shields, below which  are bull's heads. At either side of the main roundel  are figures of medieval huntsmen. Around the base is  fine acanthus decoration, in the centre of which is a  stag's head and, to the side, heads of hunting dogs.",
