The Old Vic had been the home of the National Theatre Company since 1963, and this was the first production to be staged at the theatre after the Company had moved out to its new building beside the River Thames.\n\nThe American artist Betty Guy is best-known for her international cityscape and landscape watercolours with pen and ink, as well as illustration work and mono-prints. 'Watercolour has to happen almost magically,' she says. 'Watercolour is its own master -- you go along with it'.  Betty Guy was also known as the company artist for the San Francisco Opera, so theatrical subjects were also a favourite.",
