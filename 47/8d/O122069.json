Warp loops form a fringe which is 9 cms. long with 1 row of knots and then evidence that groups of threads were plaited (but not secured by a further knot).  There is a lazy line just left of the centre; it moved from lower left to upper right.  Upper: 4.5 cms. plain weave as lower end but without the plait.  There is a fringe which is 18 cms.\n\nDESIGN: Field: described as in use: red ground with a pointed niche: the point having 4 sides and ending in a small diamond and doubly hooked at the base of the point.  The blue outline of the niche divides and enters the field at the lower end.  The light red squared zigzag on the blue ground has a 4-petalled flower in each square and terminates with a carnation.  Within the re-entrant is a yellow and blue vase with handles; to either side is a white inward facing ewer from which rises a floral sprig.  Above the vase is a yellow stem which ends below the point of the niche in a dark blue carnation.  Around this are small yellow carnations coming from the edge.  The branches from the sprig are in alternate pairs of yellow and dark blue.  The upper branches bear rosettes, small carnations and a pair of stylised tulips.  There is a band of small motifs including upside down ewers between the re-entrant and the bottom of the branches.  Outside the blue niche border, along the sides and lower end, the red field has small multi-coloured flowerheads (sides) and diagonal lines (bottom).  The joined spandrels are dark blue and dark red angular tracery (with projections) tipped with white or yellow and with a line of stylised flowers at the very top.\n\nBorders from the centre:\n(1) red ground with a sequence of mostly blue or yellow stylised blossoms with yellow leaves and other blossoms.\n\n(2) Yellow ground with diagonal blocks each containing a rosette and a pair of triangles and each divided by a line of 4 flowerheads.\n\n(3) blue ground with a light red twisted ribbon, each section containing a small floral motif\n\n(4) dark blue ground with afloral meander - the stem is yellow/dark pink or yellow/red; the flowers are naturalistic and spiky predominantly red and yellow and dark pink\n\n(5) red ground with yellow angular meander.",
