Their apparent demonic nature, witnessed by their wild countenance - wide flaring eyes, projecting fangs and coarse features \u2013 make them most suitable for their role as guardians of the temple threshold. They typically stand in a casual, passive posture, perhaps leaning on their weapon of choice, a massive club, or, as in this example, the figure is highly animated, having assumed a pose borrowed from theatre and temple dance. It is a fearsome posture, intended to strike fear into the hearts of the disbelievers. \n\nThe dvarapala is elaborately dressed, in the manner of a Keralan temple dancer, and wears a particularly flamboyant head dress directly inspired by the tradition of Keralan theatre. The dancing posture is that of a warrior, intended to intimidate his opponent, as are the snakes which entwine his club. His braided hair flies outwards as he dances, his wide eyes flaring and his open mouth revealing two fangs which demonstrate his demonic origins. The expressiveness of this figure is in keeping with the temple arts in Kerala, which tend to stress the emotive content above other sentiments.",
