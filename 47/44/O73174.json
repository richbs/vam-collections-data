After their apprenticeships, German pewterers had to embark on a further seven to nine years as journeymen, before they could become masters. They travelled abroad to enhance their skills and acquire new designs. Journeymen's guilds looked after their interests and regulated their behaviour.\n\nThe manufacture and distribution of pewter was controlled in Europe by the civic guilds. The earliest pewterers\u2019 guild was that of Nuremberg, which was established in 1285. Nuremberg was especially celebrated for its metal wares and it is not surprising that some of the earliest guilds controlling the metal trade should have been established there. The pewterers\u2019 guild in Paris was also an early foundation, being established before 1300. At their zenith before 1600, the pewterers\u2019 guilds  controlled every aspect of the trade, from purchasing the raw materials to maintaining the quality of the metal and managing the apprenticeship. They sometimes had civic responsibilities beyond their craft, such as the upkeep of a local church, and they were often  patronised by a saint whose life had in some way been associated with their trade.\n\nSome of the most interesting and monumental wares made in pewter are the drinking vessels used by the craft guilds of Germany. German tankards were widely used for toasts and their decoration often reflects this custom. For example, it was customary to toast the saints and apostles and many German tankards are engraved with their images, or have religious medallions set in the centre of the base. Another popular German toast was the \u2018Minnetrincken\u2019 - the toast to absent friends. The vessels were of various forms, the large standing cup with cover being the most common. These standing cups often have a figure on the cover, dressed in the clothing of the craft of the particular guild, such as a miner or a shipwright, and holding a banner decorated with the title of the guild or its coat of arms. \n\nGuild cups are usually of monumental size as they had to be large enough to hold sufficient liquid for the entire livery to drink. They also served as centrepieces for the table. Very large tankards were used for the drinking ceremonies of the guilds. These are heavy enough when empty but when filled could not possibly be handed round. They were known as \u2018schliefkanne\u2019 - literally, a \u2018pot that has to be dragged\u2019 - and would be filled with beer for the livery when an apprentice had served his time and was made \u2018free\u2019 of the Company. In Germany, guild cups were known as \u2018Wilkomm\u2019 cups - \u2018welcome\u2019 cups - and they were used for special toasts associated with the guilds. They could be simple two-handled cups, passed from hand to hand, or standing cups with covers. Toasts were often very formal. First of all, the covered cup would be handed to the Master of the Guild. The warden would then turn to his neighbour who would remove the cover and stand aside, theoretically to protect the drinker from attack. The drinker then raised the cup, proposed the toast, wiped his lip with a napkin. The cover was then replaced and passed to the next in line, and so on. The larger the vessel, the more difficult this was to do - especially if a cup and cover, which has no handles, was used and if hot spiced wine was the beverage. The whole toasting process demanded a certain amount of practice and skill if one was to perform the various actions without dropping the cup or cover or forgetting one\u2019s lines.\n\nGerman cups show considerable ingenuity in their design. In addition to the formal cup and cover, or large tankard, guilds often used drinking vessels in a shape peculiar to their individual crafts. A shoemakers\u2019 guild would have a cup in the form of a shoe (1333-1872), a hatter\u2019s guild a cup formed as a hat, a shipwright\u2019s guild, a ship. The variety of designs is considerable. One characteristic shared by guild pewter is the abundance of names and dates engraved all over them, which makes them of particular interest to the collector.",
