The armholes are formed by cutting into the fabric from the selvedges and then the selvedge is folded and stitched together to form the shoulder seam. The ground is a ribbed silk in blue [blue/purple weft and a grey warp formed by a combination of white and black yarn].\n[a] Along the shoulder seams at the front, from a 1 cm zigzag edge of white metallic thread, a series of tapestry-woven weft in the same white metallic thread forming regular and angular \u2018tongues\u2019: one 17 cm long  inside two 60.5 cm long; the latter terminate in a short line 5.5 cm long almost forming a circle at the end. \n[b] Along the hem at the back and front a series of short tapestry-woven lines 5.5 cm long, alternately silver and gold in a broken zigzag line.  \n[c] Down the sides of the front panels, a 1.5 cm band of gold thread decorated with a central red stripe, edged with blue/purple breaking into regular lozenge or rectangular stripes.  The band is edged with four green lines of weft.  This band is edged by two narrow weft stripes of metal thread either side. \n[d] On the back, from the armhole edge, in the top section, which is a loom width, there is a section of pattern [c] followed by a 3 cm tongue of metal thread 31.5 cm long leading into a wide Y-section of metal thread 42.5 cm wide and extending across the whole loom width. There are numerous narrow weft lines following this outline.  The stem of the Y-shape is patterned with a lozenge shape and \u2018tower\u2019 form in blue/purple flanked by a partial green stripe either side.  Another 3 cm tongue of metal thread follows.\n[e] The centre back neck has a warp band 7 cm with zigzag edges either side of gold metal thread, around the actual neck at the back is a 3 cm panel of metal thread embroidered in  close diagonal stitching leading into four rows of small metal thread spiral roundels joined with white silk [creating the impression of spangles] with a line of faded purple chain stitch. Narrow weft stripes of the same extend 21.5 cm.\nSilk: Warp: black and white combined to form grey, red, blue/purple, light green\nMetal Thread: silver strip open S-wound on white silk core and silver-gilt strip open S-wound of yellow silk core.  The metal threads are often carried on the back from one group of tapestry-weaving to the next.\nDecoration on the shoulder seams uses faded purple silk and silver strip close s-wound on a silk core [probably white].",

Abbas are versatile and elegant garments; Bruce Ingham writes in 'Languages of Dress in the Middle East', 'they can be worn while standing, sitting or driving and can be used as a cover for  the whole body while sleeping ... when walking [it] may either be allowed to drape from the shoulders or the sides may be gathered up slightly and held under one arm so that the ends do not get caught ... when receiving a guest, the right-hand side ... may be  taken off the shoulder and brought round under the arm to be held together with the left-hand edge under the left arm. This leaves the right hand free for shaking hands.' This abba was given to the Museum by Naser od-Din Shah, Shah of Iran from 1848 to 1896.",
