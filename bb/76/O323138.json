It is hinged to a pierced semicircular plaque, also cast with imitation filigree decoration, set with a facetted red paste in the centre.  The top edge consists of four stylised birds.  This plaque is attached to the lowest by three rings (one missing).  The lowest plaque is a rounded rectangle, cast in imitation of filigree, and set with three facetted pastes, two red and one green.  There are 14 loop-in-loop chains hanging from the lower edge, each with a flat round disc of sheet silver hanging from each end.  Four more loop-in-loop chains are attached to each side of these central plaques.  They are of varying lengths, so that they hang down in swags when worn.  Each is decorated along its lower edge with more disc pendants.  The four chains on each side end in a plain ring, which is attached to a small cast plaque, with a hook on its back.",

This piece of jewellery, called a prochelnik because it was worn on the forehead, is a head ornament.  The central part was hooked into the head scarf, so that the decorative part hung down over the forehead, while the two hooks at the sides were attached to the scarf at the sides of the head, above and behind the ears. It is made of metal, cast and plated to imitate more expensive silver filigree jewellery.   In the 19th century the rural populations of the Balkans were much poorer than their equivalents in other European countries, and many could not afford jewellery of precious metal.  \n\nLike most traditional jewellery in the region, it was first worn at marriage.  The contents of the dowry varied according to the wealth of the families involved, and from place to place, but a belt clasp and a prochelnik were compulsory pieces everywhere.  This prochelnik is filled with symbolic meaning.  The four birds above the central part represent cocks, an ancient symbol of fertility, and the dangling disc pendants were intended to avert all kinds of evil.  It is typical of the Sliven region.  \n\nThis was described as a Norwegian breast ornament when it was given to the Museum in 1939, along with many other pieces of Norwegian traditional jewellery.  The disc-shaped pendants and coloured glass pastes are superficially similar to Norwegian jewellery, but the details are quite different.  Scandinavian disc pendants are attached through a hole in the disc, not by a projecting loop, as here.",
