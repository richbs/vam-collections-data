Each player with one plane would follow one of the routes.  The shells may belong to the planes and be 'dropped' on the target, the first one being the winner.\n\nHowever, the shells may be used as defence items.  Possibly each of the 7 players would hold one shell and be able to use it once during a game to knock out an opponent.  On the other hand there may be an EIGHTH player  who holds all the shells and he may during a game be able to defend the target.\n\nRules placement: none",
