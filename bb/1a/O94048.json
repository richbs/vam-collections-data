The stone relief is broken off at a point just above her knee, wearing a sleeved tunic of Iranian style over an<i> antariya</i>.  The neckline dips down between her breasts exposing a <i>kantha</i> (flat necklace) with two arrow-head-shaped pendants. Her hair appears as a curving fringe under a chaplet-type headdress, the top of which is missing. She is also wearing cylindrical plug earrings. The woman is shown standing against a drapery with her left hand  holding something shaped like a garland which is now lost that loops across to the missing left arm of the man on the right.\n  He is badly damaged and only his head survives in any detail. He too is looking to his left with heavy lidded eyes and incised pupils , similar to those of the woman. Both have small, slightly retrouss\u00e9 noses (hers is a bit damaged) and smallish mouths with full lower lips.  The man sports a drooping curved moustache and has rich jewellery in his ear and round his neck.  He has two wreaths in his hair, the lower one of leaves and the upper wider one made up of flower-heads.",
