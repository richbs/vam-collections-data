Men's socks were usually made of cotton, merino or silk. Finely spun silk socks such as these were expensive and often reserved for evening wear or special occasions.\n\nOwnership & Use\nDelicately embroidered silk socks complemented the low-cut shoes that were worn with evening dress. They were often worn with suspenders to help keep them pulled up.The 19th-century fashion for black extended to men's socks, but brighter colours were also worn, such as scarlet, bright blue, green and tartan - sometimes to match the tie or cravat. The writer Lytton Strachey wears olive green socks with a grey suit and a green tie in a portrait of 1904 by Simon Bussy.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTechnological innovations and improvements in machinery meant that socks could be manufactured in greater numbers as the century progressed. The firm of I. & R. Morley was one of the largest firms. It exhibited spun silk shirts, children's gloves and men's socks with spun silk at the 1851 Great Exhibition. By the 1870s new methods of producing spun silk socks meant that, although still a luxury item, they were affordable by the middle classes.",
