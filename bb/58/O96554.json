To be seen on the hunting field was an essential attribute of social success. This waistcoat is from an important collection previously in Castle Howard, Yorkshire, that includes seven scarlet hunt coats and one blue hunt coat as well as waistcoats, breeches, stockings and boots. \n\nThere were many different hunt membership rules regulating the colour of the coat, collar and buttons. The foxes and initials engraved onto the buttons of this waistcoat show that the wearer belonged to the Bedale Hunt. He would have worn it underneath the field hunt coat.",
