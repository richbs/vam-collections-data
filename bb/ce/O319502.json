The head-piece is in the form of a skull cap with a circular crown and a plain band attached all round. Onto the band is gathered a long piece of linen forming a cloak to cover the wearer. This is open in the front where there is a triangular embroidered insertion. The crown of the cap is divided into four compartments each containing flowers and leaves.  The band of the cap is decorated with sloping lines of flowers and  leaves and of drawn fabric stitches, and with a border to match. Below the cap at the front of the covering is a band of ornament with, underneath, a panel of drawn fabric work through which the wearer was able to see. This panel is surrounded by formal ornament and plants The triangular insertion on the front is embroidered with a large cone pattern, smaller cones on either side and two fish. It is bordered with bands of drawn fabric work, leaves, flowers and cones. The front, just below the eyepiece, is lined with a small piece of linen printed with flowers and leaf motifs in red and brown.",
