It is cast in two halves along the length and held by tongue and slot joints. The rider is also cast and held together and to the horse with tongue and slot joints. The clockwork mechanism is in the body covered with a brown metal plate cut away to allow the legs to move. The integral key protrudes from the right side of the body. When wound the legs move so the horse appears to leap along. \n*The horse and rider are probably American and much cruder in design than the German ones with the horse's body almost rectangular and the legs thick and rather shapely although there has been an attempt to show correct shape. It is said to represent George Washington but more likely to be Paul Revere. It could have been issued for the 150\nanniversary of his ride in 1775 - ie 1925.",
