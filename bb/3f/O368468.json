There is also a button inside the middle of the slit and another at the waist. The back is cut and the centre seam becomes a vent at the waist. The sleeves are cut in two pieces, slightly curved and have a slight fullness at the shoulder. This is top stitched. The pockets have a vertical scalloped facing which fastens with three buttons. There is a turned down collar with a slight point at the centre. It is faced with pale blue satin, pieced, not quite symmetrically, on either side of the front. The cuffs are faced with pale blue satin. The coat fastens from neck to waist with wound beige silk buttons. The button-holes are re-enforced with matching silk.",
