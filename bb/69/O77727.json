It could thus have served as a presentation drawing to Sir Henry Cole, the Director of the South Kensington Museum.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe division of this design into squares is a process called 'squared for transfer'.  This technique facilitates the enlargement of a design.  A grid containing an equal number of squares is ruled on the original drawing and on the surface destined for the enlarged design.  The design is then transferred, square by square.  The number of squares in this design, however, does not match the number of tiles in the tile panel. There are, in fact, 104 squares in the design and 33 tiles and five parts of tiles in the tile panel.\n\nPeople\nHenry Scott, a Royal Engineer officer employed on building the new Museum, compiled a list of the ladies he was employing as porcelain painters.  They were Amy E. Black, Miss Walker, Miss Judd, Miss Earle, Miss Hall, Miss Cambridge, who were all paid at the rate of 6d an hour, except Amy Black who received 9d.",
