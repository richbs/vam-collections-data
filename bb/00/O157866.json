This one includes in the centre an aerial view of St Peter's Baslica and its colonnades designed by Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680). Around the border are views of the Temple of the Sibyl at Tivoli, the Forum of Nerva or Transitorium with portico and relief of Minerva, the Forum of Augustus, the Arch of Janus Quadrifrons, the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the Temple of Vesta, the Arch of Titus, the Temple of Vespasian in the Roman Forum, the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, the Tomb of Cecilia Metella, and the Capitoline Hill.\n\nThese views were taken from engravings and so the Colosseum is shown here before its restoration which began in 1805 and the Pantheon is shown without its bell towers which were only removed in 1882 but may have been omitted here for aesthetic reasons.",
