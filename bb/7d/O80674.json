Here he shows the moment of returning calm as a rain shower ceases and the air lightens, an atmospheric effect well known in the rainy climate of Britain. To add scale and life to his picture, the artist shows a lad equipped with a landing net and a long fishing rod. The precise location of the scene is uncertain--the title is given as Whitsand Bay, Devon, but since there is no place by this name in Devon it seems more likely to be either Whitesand Bay near Land's End, or Whitsand Bay near Torpoint, both in Cornwall.",
