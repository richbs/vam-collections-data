            "physical_description": "Manchu Woman's dragon robe (longpao). Semi-formal wear. Right side fastening (the five buttons have been taken or possibly cut away), long and tight sleeves, horse-hoof cuffs. No side seam. Mid-blue silk plain weave new lining. The lower sleeves are made of navy blue plain weave damask with half a roundel containing dragons. The main body of the robe was originally in a strong and bright yellow but is now very much faded up.  \n\nBeneath the arms and the front flap the original colours of the silks remain- bright yellow ground, deep and pale blue, bright pink and red, jade green and white, with a little lilac, brown and orange. The yellow has elsewhere faded to cream, the green to blue, the red and pink to buff shades, the lilac to grey, and the blues have lost their intensity. \n\nThe kesi design consists of five-clawed dragons, three on the front, plus one beneath the flap, three on the back and one on each shoulder, chasing flaming jewels among tightly curled cloud bands and bats, with the twelve symbols (The Sun and Moon discs, the three star Constellation, the Rock, the Axe Head, the Fu symbols (resembling two Es back to back), the Golden Pheasant, the Double Dragons, the pair of Sacrificial Cups, the Flames, the Water Plant and the dish of Millet Seeds). The lower part of the robe contains long lishui and waves among which are the Eight Precious Things.\n\nThe sleeves, below the level of the yellow kesi with its proper edging of li-shui and waves, have an extra band of kesi, with dragons in profile chasing a pearl above mountains, wave and shallow li-shui on a dark blue ground, then a section of dark blue damask; then another band of dark blue kesi ending in a horse-shoe cuff with dragon full-face above waves with some of the Eight Precious Things, and surrounded by cloud-bands, bats and peaches. A band of the same design, with dragons in profile flanking dragons full-face, is round the neck of the robe.\n\nThe yellow colour and use of all twelve symbols indicates that the silk kesi was intended for an imperial sacrificial robe. The sleeves, with extra band of kesi and horse-shoe cuffs were intended for use on a woman's robe. It cannot be assumed, however, that this was the robe of an empress, for the sleeves and sides have not been sewn together in the making of the silk, and the sleeves may have been added simply to complete a robe shape for sale.",
