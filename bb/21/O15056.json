The references to India in these notes suggest that Palmer's intended subject was a topical one, related to the Indian Mutiny of 1857-8; there are other watercolours of about the same time with similar inspiration. The Indian Mutiny, like the Crimean War also in the 1850s provided several types of subject for the artist who wished to paint topical rather than historical drama. The composition and to a certain extent the colouring reflect Palmer's admiration for the Franco-Italianate classicism of Claude Lorrain, although the exaggeratedly craggy rocks are more like those in landscapes by Salvator Rosa, for example The Broken Bridge in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, which Palmer visited during his Italian tour of 1837-9.",
