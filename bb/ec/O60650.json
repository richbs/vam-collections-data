It is usually represented with tendrils and vapour or pearls issuing from its jawless mouth. The character shown here is presumably a nature-spirit (\u2018yaksha\u2019), possibly a water-spirit judging from the turbulent foliage.\n\nIn architecture the \u2018kirttimukha\u2019 frequently appears above doorways and on capitals, usually as a protective presence. Relief panels like this one appear on the square-section capitals of Gupta columns and elsewhere in Gupta period (320-about 540 AD) temples. We do not know where this panel with half a grotesque face was originally placed. However, it does compare closely with a column in a ruined Hindu temple at Pipariya in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe \u2018kirttimukha\u2019 motif became prominent during the Gupta period in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. By the 6th century it had attained its standard form in India. No precise Indian model is known, though it does relate to some of the mythological faces of the Kushan period (1st century AD-320 AD), such as the \u2018makara\u2019. Its origins may relate to Hellenistic heads of gorgons. In Greek mythology, these were women with snakes for hair.",

By the sixth century the kirttimukha had attained its standard form in India, and appears regularly as a crowning ornament of sculptural relief panels and on  bronze throne backs above the image of the deity. It is also used in representations of jewellery from an early period.\n\nIn architecture it frequently appears above doorways and on capitals, usually positioned as a protective presence. Relief panels of this type appear on the square section capitals  of Gupta columns and elsewhere in Gupta period temples. The original placement of this panel with half a grotesque face is unknown, but it does compare closely with a column in a ruined Hindu temple at Pipariya in Madhya Pradesh. This character is presumably a nature-spirit (yaksha), possibly acquatic judging from the turbulant foliage.",
