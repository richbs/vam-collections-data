In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nB. Hitch's illustration, 'Early to bed and early to rise', was published ca.1900 in Ernest Nister's Bright Eyes Story Book (no. 2275), accompanying the verse: \n\n'If you would be healthy, wealthy too, and wise, \nGo to sleep when stars do peep, and with the sunshine rise!'",
