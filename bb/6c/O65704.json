            "public_access_description": "The strikingly ugly Mother Shipton appeared as a stage character in the late 17th century, and by 1712 the marionette performer Martin Powell made her the subject of his play Mother Shipton and the Downfall of Cardinal Wolsey. In 19th century puppet theatre she mainly appeared as a solo turn - a pipe-smoking fortune teller, but also became conflated with the French trick puppet figure La M\u00e8re Grigogne, who could produce multiple offspring from beneath her skirts. This wooden head of Mother Shipton has holes for the smoke tubing in the neck, an effect which was presumably worked from below or side stage. There is no remaining indication of how the figure was suspended.\n\nThe real Mother Shipton was the subject of British folklore stories from the mid 17th century. Born Ursula Sontheil in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, in 1488, the daughter of a reputed witch, strange events reportedly happened around her from an early age and she became a prophetess, apparently foretelling among other events the Civil War, the Fire of London, the dissolution of the monasteries, 'carriages without horses' and the Spanish Civil War. Despite her repellent appearance she nevertheless married the York carpenter Tony Shipton in 1512 when she was 24 and set up home in Knaresborough, to which people reportedly came for her prophesies. Samuel Pepys mentions Mother Shipton in his diary; when Prince Rupert was told of the Fire of London his first words were: 'Even now Mother Shipton's prophesy is out.' She died near Skipton in Yorkshire in 1561, an event she foretold.",

            "bibliography": "Lecture by W.H. Whanslaw to The Puppet Guild\n'Now, in that first exhibition, an old lady turned up with a whacking great puppet, you know, about this height.  Enormous thing.  It was Mrs. Clunn Lewis, the widow of the famous Clunn Lewis, who was one of the last of the old peripatetic puppeteers, who roamed the country lanes of Kent with a marionette show.  He played a harp to draw his crowds, a little Irish harp, and he drew his shows and she'd been a male impersonator in her time (and I can quite believe it).  He sort of bottled and did all the goods and she was front of house manager, and old Clunn used to do all the shows.....  Now, she turns up with this ghastly figure.  Mind you, it really was hideous, there's no getting away from it.  It was an old Mother Shipton.  And you know how they used to let themselves go.  I've got the Clowes Mother Shipton and it's so horrible I don't want to show it to my friends. It's a ghastly thing, with warts all over its face.  But when it was dressed and had a wig on, it must have looked foul.  It would smoke, and that's what this thing did.  This thing smoked a clay pipe and sat there smoking and looking about and Mrs. Clunn-Lewis caused a sensation in so much that the Guild invited her to talk about puppets at one of our meetings.... and Mrs. Clunn Lewis, we thought she was going to do us a show, but she did an awful lot of chatter and showed us three puppets.  However, that was that.'",
