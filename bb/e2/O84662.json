            "history_note": "Figures purchased for \u00a331 from George Jennings, along with W.21-1911 and W.22-1911.\n\nCommentary from Tracy\nThese corbels are said to have come from St Mary, Bury St Edmund\u2019s although it is difficult to imagine from where. They do, perhaps, remind us somewhat of the stone corbel-busts in the south aisle, which are similarly topped by a crenellated parapet. But there is nowhere for them on the magnificent timber roof of the nave which appears to have survived mainly intact. The positioning of a large tenon directly above the figures is rather puzzling since angel-figures on medieval church roofs were nearly always cantilevered out from the wall. On hammer-beam roofs it was common practice to incorporate, on the wall posts, an inhabited canopied niche below the springing of the brace. An angel with outstretched wings would be positioned below this or at an angle of thirty degrees to the wall. Also on hammer-beam roofs the angels could be placed at the same angle on the innermost extensions of the beams. They are also found fixed to the collars of the roof, but, again, at an angle to the perpendicular. The arrangement in the V&amp;A\u2019s specimens allows for the figures to project at an angle to the wall but restricts their function to that of \u2018corbels\u2019. \n\nThe museum\u2019s angels, without or with only perfunctory wings, are too small to have been used on the roof of a major space. The use of angle figures in lesser contexts is not particularly common but an instance can be cited at Long Melford, Suffolk, in the south aisle of the Lady Chapel. The corbels here are used in association with a cambered tie-beam roof of modest span. The building of the Lady Chapel can be dated precisely to 1496 (Buidlings of England, Suffolk, 345). Stylistically, however the museum\u2019s angels seem to be closest to those on the hammer-beam roof at March, Cambs of c.1500 (Buildings of England, Cambridgeshire, 437). \n\nNotes from R.P. 1412/M (?) and 130M\n\n17 January 1911 Purchase Form\nlisted, among 6 objects purchased, as\n\"a set of 3 gothic corbels in great relief of half length figures of angels playing musical instruments\".\nCondition listed as \"chipped &amp; damaged\".\n\n6 January 1911 letter Jennings to Skinner\noffers several objects including \"three oaken corbels.  Gothic ecclesiastic of half length figure of angels playing musical instruments ab. 18 inches high bought at Ipswich abt. 10 years ago.\"  He refers to photographs (not in RP files).\n\n23 January 1911 Bracket Minutes\ndescribe the corbels as \"characteristic examples of English architectural carving of the 15th century\".  The examples offered would fill a gap in the Museum collections.\n\nAdditional notes\nA very similar musician corbel, in stone (15th century), forms part of the solar fireplace at Sutton Courtenay 'Abbey', Berks., illustrated in Margaret Wood, The English Medieval House (London 1965), plate XVII.E",

            "historical_context_note": "Corbels (or brackets) acted as supports. Often they would  be fixed high up on the wall of a medieval church, so as to  take the weight of an arch or vault rib. Because of their  lofty position, they frequently took the form of carved  angels. Similar work can still be found in other churches in Suffolk.\n\nThis corbel forms part of a set, said to have come from the  parish church of Great St Mary's, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.  This highly important church in East Anglia  was enlarged  between about 1420 and 1480 and provided with a  lavishly carved interior, which influenced other churches in  the region. The V&A acquired these corbels from a  collector, who had purchased them in Ipswich.\n\nThe angel is represented playing a lute with a gittern, a plucked  stringed instrument with a relatively short neck.  Angels holding  musical instruments were popular medieval subjects.  Other corbels in the group  include one with an  angel playing a harp and another with a lute.",
