Down-ward sloping arms which are tenoned inoto the back uprights (and repaired) and mortised onto turned front uprights. Plain back uprights and stretchers. The bottom rail of the seat is moulded. The seat boards (grained side to side) are nailed down.\n\nCondition \nThe panelled back is cracked (vertically, in the centre), and two modern oak battens have been screwed to the back of the panel. The crest has two replacement sections, and is likely (on the basis of analagous chairs, and the awkward overhangs) to have had twin 'earpieces' though there is no clear evidence of these. The front stretcher is very worn. There is a replacement plank in the back of the seat. Two fillets of wood have been added under the back feet, and the height of the chair was probably originally 2\" taller.",
