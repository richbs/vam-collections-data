These imitate Italian painted tin-glazed earthenwares (known as maiolica), but only rarely did they reproduce designs precisely. On this example, a Renaissance-style portrait of Queen Victoria is surrounded by 'grotesque' ornament. One of a pair, this plaque is an ambitious and technically accomplished object, and indeed, the two were displayed by Minton at the Paris Exhibition of 1855. The second plaque, depicting the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, is now in the Swiss Cottage, Osborne House, Isle of Wight.\n\nPeople\nThis plaque was painted by Thomas Kirkby (1824-1890), who was born in Trentham in Staffordshire. Kirkby was employed by Mintons from 1841, and was said to have painted the first piece of majolica produced by the firm. He certainly played an important role the production of the wares. These portrait plaques, made after designs by Silas Rice, clearly demonstrate his accomplishment as a pottery painter.",
