The Mahanta (high priest) of the Shiva temple is shown seated on a striped rug in front of the temple, with a second man behind him. In front stand three women: Elokeshi, the young wife of the clerk Nabin Chandra Banerjee, is shown veiling her face with a part of her sari with her right hand and holding up a plate of offerings (naibedya) for the shrine with her left. Behind Elokeshi stands her younger sister Muktakeshi with her face veiled, and to the right stands Telibou (wife of oil seller), the female servant in the family who acted as procuress, looking boldly at the waiting Mahanta.\n\nThe Mahanta has been depicted wearing string necklaces but not the sacred threads of a brahmin, also he has been shown with Vaishnavite mark on his forehead although he is a Shaivite priest. The forefinger of his righthand rests thoughtfully on the beard of his cheek.\n\nAll three women as well as the Mahanta have been shown adorned with ornaments which are stock-in-trade of the 'patuas'.",

Lockwood Kipling collection, given by Rudyard Kipling 1917\nThe Tarakeshwar murder case was a scandal which rocked Calcutta society in 1873. A Clacutta clerk had murdered his wife when he found that with the connivance of her family she had become the mistress of the Mahant (high priest) of the Tarakeshwar Shiva temple in Hooghly district. All the different stages of the affair up to and beyond the conviction of the clerk for murder and of the Mahant for adultery were depicted by the Kalighat artists, reflecting the general bitterness at the increasing moral corruption supposedly caused by modern, westernized modes of behaviour. In this picture the Mahant is seated on a rug in front of the temple in Tarakeshwar. The three women standing before him are the ill-fated Elokeshi, wife of the clerk Nabin Chandra Banerjee, (who holds up a plate of food in one hand while veiling herself with the other), her younger sister and the female servant of the family, who acted as procuress in the affair.\n\nPublished: W.G.

            "history_note": "The Tarakeshwar murder case of 1873 was a public scandal in Calcutta based on an affair between Elokeshi, the young attractive wife of  Nabinchandra Banerji, and the mahanta or chief priest of the Shiva temple at Tarakeshwar. Upon discovery of the affair, on 27 May 1873  her jealous husband Nabinchandra Banerji cut Elokeshi's throat with an 'aish boti' (fish chopper). In the trial that followed Nabin was sentenced to life imprisonment and the Mahanta was fined and imprisoned for 3 years. Different variations of this affair favouring the various characters occur in several Bengali plays and Kalighat images between 1875-80.\n\nThe 'pata' formed a part of an album, containing 196 prints, paintings and pen and pencil drawings, together with 37 loose pages of paintings, calligraphic drawings and outline pen drawings. The collection was formed by the late J. Lockwood Kipling when he was Director of Lahore School of Art. The collection was received from his son the late Rudyard Kipling on 8th August, 1917.\n\nHistorical significance: Calcutta was the Capital of British India from 1833-1912.  By the 1830s, artists had arrived from rural villages in Bengal and began to produce paintings that reflected local history, mythology, customs and conflicts of a colonised society. As a popular art form, these artists are recognised for their use of brilliant colour, simplified images and swift brushstrokes that became the hallmark of Kalighat painting in the 19th and early 20th century.",
