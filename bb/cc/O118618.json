The ability to transfer-print images photographically on to a ceramic base meant that they could be produced cheaply and sold to tourists. The loop attached to the back indicates that this was designed to be hung on a wall.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) was born in Roncole, near Parma in northern Italy, and by the age of twelve had already composed several pieces and studied with a local organist.  In 1832 he went to Milan to study with Vincenzo Lavigna, composer and former La Scala musician. He settled in Milan in 1839 where his opera Oberto was accepted at La Scala and further operas commissioned. His next opera Un giorno di regno, failed but the successful production of Nabucco in 1842 meant that his fame was assured throughout Italy and abroad  His most famous operas  Rigoletto, La Traviata and Il Trovatore were written between 1851 and 1853; he wrote Aida between 1870 and 1871, while his famous tragic opera Otello was started in 1879 but not completed until 1886.  When he died in 1901, a wealthy and respected man, over 28000 people lined the streets for his funeral.",
