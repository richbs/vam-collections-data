Reputed to have made his stage debut at the age of four, Leno was first engaged by the then manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Augustus Harris in 1889 and appeared in the annual pantomime there for a number of years. In 1896 he made a famous appearance as Widow Twankey opposite Marie Lloyd as the principal boy, Aladdin, and in 1901 he performed for King Edward VII at Sandringham, after which he was dubbed 'the King's jester'.\n\nAt this time the pantomimes at Drury Lane were mounted on an epic scale. Months in the planning those mounted by Augustus Harris (between circa 1879 and 1896) often cost between \u00a36000 and \u00a38000 to produce. These spectacular productions were mounted on an annual basis and often featured stars of the day in leading roles",
