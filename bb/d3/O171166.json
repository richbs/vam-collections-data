Like Catholic women elsewhere in southern Europe they often wore elaborate crosses as jewellery.\n\nThis small pendant is all that remains of a much larger five-part pendant ending in an elaborate matching cross.  Its original design was based on 18th century aristocratic jewellery, but the use of garnets and pearls is typical of Italian traditional jewellery of the 19th century.  Crosses like this were worn throughout northern and central Italy, often with matching earrings.\n\nThe original five-part pendant cross was bought for \u00a33 8s. as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
