The ivory body of the tankard terminates, at the top and bottom, in a pierced silver-gilt foliate strap. A plain polished silver-gilt rim ends the body of the tankard, mimicking aesthetically the foot. The flat cover has six putti carved in ivory surrounding a female figure as a finial. The highly ornate S-scroll handle has a herm at its largest curve. The thumbpiece is a silver-gilt S-scroll.",

            "public_access_description": "Ivory was a particularly luxurious material in the 17th century, and princely collections often featured ivory tankards. Augsburg was the leading centre of production for such pieces. The goldsmiths probably subcontracted the carving of the ivory to local sculptors. This example is decorated with the mythological scene of the Judgment of Paris. Paris, a Trojan Prince, was asked which of three Greek Goddesses was the most beautiful. He chose Aphrodite, who have him the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen, as a reward.\n\nThe Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Schatzkammer is one of the few collections of its kind formed in the late 20th century. The Schatzkammer, or treasury, was a new concept in the 16th century. It referred to a special chamber in which the most precious artefacts of a princely collection were housed.  Gold and jewelled objects were mounted alongside exotic natural curiosities, including rock crystal, nautilus shells and ostrich eggs. Together they demonstrated not only the wonders of nature and the technical achievements of the artist, but also the intellect and culture of the patron. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
