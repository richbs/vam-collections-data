He was then starring at Collins\u2019 Hippodrome, Stoke-on-Trent, during the week of 31 October 1904. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums. Stratton is seen without stage make-up, and below in character for one of the four songs he sang during that engagement. He received \u00a3200 for the week, apparently twice the fee ever paid for any other act in the Potteries. \n\nStratton was born Eugene Augustus Ruhlmann in Buffalo, New York, in 1861. He appeared in the USA and Canada as a black-faced performer. He made his first appearance in Great Britain with Haveley\u2019s Minstrels at Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre in London in 1881, and then in Piccadilly with the Moore and Burgess Minstrels, as a comedian, singer, dancer and principal tambourine man. His first success was as \u2018The Whistling Coon\u2019, an act that he bought from the veteran minstrel Sam Raeburn. He made his music hall debut in 1892 at the Royal Holborn with a soft-shoe and song and dance routine. He made his name with songs that included \u2018Lily of Laguna\u2019. He was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats from 1893 and became its King Rat in 1896. He gave his last appearance at the Queen\u2019s Theatre, Poplar in 1914, and died in 1918.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall performer, minstrel, singer and dancer Eugene Stratton (1861-1918), at Collins' Hippodrome, Stoke-on-Trent, during the week of 31 October 1904.\n\nBorn Eugene Augustus Ruhlmann in Buffalo, New York, Stratton appeared in the States and Canada as a black-faced performer, making his first appearance in England with Haveley's Minstrels at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1881. When they returned to the States, Stratton joined the Moore and Burgess Minstrels in Piccadilly where he worked as a comedian, singer, dancer and principal tambourine man. He made his music hall debut in 1892 at the Royal Holborn with a soft-shoe and song and dance routine and made his name with songs including 'Lily of Laguna'. The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
