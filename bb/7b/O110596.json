Flat collars and the wide circles of gathered linen that made up ruffs had to be held up at the back of the neck in order to frame the face properly. Theses supporters  were called a range of different names: \u2018supportasse\u2019 (a French term), underpropper, pickadil or rebato and made of a variety of materials, such as whalebone, card and wire.  This example is made of pasteboard shaped over a last, padded with wool and covered with shaped strips of satin. \n\nThe two holes on the underside allowed the supportasse to be laced to the back of the collar of a gown or doublet. A ruff or starched collar was then pinned on top.",
