She is clad in a loose, long sleeved robe, the skirt of which is caught up in her left hand and thus displays part of a figured underskirt. She also wears a necklace, earrings and a high turban from which a veil falls behind. It shows a dress which is a slightly fanciful European interpretation of a Turkish costume, which became popular in France and Britain in the early eighteenth century. \nA snuff rasp was used like a nutmeg grater for grating dried tobacco into snuff. A perforated metal section was fixed inside the ivory cover for grating. Snuff taking was a popular pastime in France for the wealthy and fashionable. There was the rumour that a regular dose of snuff would protect against the plague. The tobacco was grated from the solid tobacco roll known as a \"carotte\".\nThe ivory carving on these rasps is often rather crude, while the subjects depicted, often mythological figures, or exotic ladies, are typical of decorative objects made from a rare and costly material to be sold as lucury good.",
