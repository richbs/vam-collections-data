The wearing or carrying of gloves by either sex was a conspicuous mark of rank and ostentation. They were  worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. Gloves were popular as gifts and  were often  given by a young gallant to his favourite mistress. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe range of motifs on the glove, particularly the types of flowers, mixed with strawberries and birds, gives a good indication of the burgeoning interest in gardens and other natural subjects at the period.\n\nMaterials &  Making\nGloves required a fine and supple leather. Doeskin and kid were the main types used. Although embroidery was the principal form of decoration for accessories, tapestry was also used. Small tapestry- woven articles, including gloves, were made  by professional workshops for direct sale to the public in London shops.",
