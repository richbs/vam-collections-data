Between about 1800 and 1835 he traded under various names and partnerships, including Goulding & Co, and produced fine woodwind instruments. By about 1800 the recorder had been largely replaced by the transverse flute in orchestral music, so this instrument would have seemed rather old-fashioned. This example terminates in a flute-like tube rather than a cone, which was more typical of recorders. The aim was probably to make it sound more like an orchestral flute.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
