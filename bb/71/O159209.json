The Museum Number is in the top right hand corner. Plain weave white cotton tape has been added around the edges on the front. Pieced: below the border and in many other places, some of the patches are obvious from the front because the design is disturbed.  The seams can be seen and felt on the back. There is a border along the upper end which may not be original: there is a patch on the left and then a pattern of alternating groups of 3 pale blossoms with a downward pointing red and yellow flower.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in yellow and what may be faded pink.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: edged in blue: a downward pointing almost circular arrangement of white flowers alternating with an indistinct large pale flower pointing to the lower right with round buds edged in green and outlined in blue.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs which are difficult to determine because of the piecing: [a] alternating diamond blocks each with a floral arrangement from a vase: a bulbous yellow vase outlined in blue with large central pink blossom and 2 black-edged flowers; the other has a similar vase but with red and green banded flanges and 3 blue and dark blue flowers.\n[b] Blue outlined vase with pair of large pink leaves, large central pink blossom and a 2nd large pink blossom to the left alternating with a similar vase, a pair of pink flowers and 3 black-edged irises.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, beige, cream, yellow, light blue, dark blue, green, light green, white, black [or dark brown], pink.",
