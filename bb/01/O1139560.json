Several cast members on tour played the parts they took in the production at the Duke of York's Theatre, which opened on the 26th December 1911 and closed on the 10th February. Other actors seen here replaced actors in the West End company who didn't go on tour.\n\nThe photograph was taken to commemorate the 1000th performance of Peter Pan and given to Pauline Chase, seated in the centre with her dog.. Its silver frame is from the Bond Street firm Asprey of London, specially engraved. Pauline Chase, born Ellen Pauline Matthew Bliss in Washington in 1881, is best known for her long association with Peter Pan. She played a Lost Boy in the original 1904 production at the Duke of York's Theatre and first revival, and took the title role from the second revival in 1906 until the end of the Christmas 1913 production, after which she retired. She made one film appearance in 1916 in the satirical film The Real Thing at Last, scripted by Barrie.\n\nThis photograph is by James Bacon and Sons who had studios in Edinburgh and Newcastle in 1912.",
