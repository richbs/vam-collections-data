He has subsequently made work which questions the value and integrity of a coherent artistic identity. Turk does this with wit and economy, by paraphrasing already well-known works of art from the recent past. He also examines what the paraphernalia of 'genius' consists of - a signature; an identifiable style; a marketable identity. \n\nIn this wittily titled self portrait, Turk, represented with his eyes closed, plays with the notion of self portraiture.  The scale and 'photographic' qualities of this piece bring in to question the style of contemporary portraiture, in particular the work of German photographers such as Thomas Struth and Thomas Ruff.  Like much of Turk's work, this photograph is self-referential and focuses on the presentation of the artist persona.",
