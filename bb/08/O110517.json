It has a dark blue velvet band on the front and at both wrists. The mantle is gathered at the front and at the back where a flower made of purple silk is applied.\n\nThe mantle was made by the House of Worth in about 1909. After the death of the founder Charles-Frederik in 1895, his son Jean-Phlippe took charge of the artistic direction of the company. A man of refined taste, Jean-Philippe had studied painting with Corot and showed a strong interest in the many artistic movements arising at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe mantle shows the influence Fauvism and Japonism had on colours and fashion styles during this period. Another powerful influence on fashion was Les Ballets Russes, with their Oriental-inspired themes and costumes. Evening mantles, such as this one, would become increasing fashionable especially during the early 1920s, when the public responded to the rage for anything Oriental.",

After the death of his founder Charles-Frederick in 1895, his son Jean-Philippe took charge of the artistic direction of the House of Worth.  A man of refined taste, Jean-Philippe had studied painting with Corot and showed a strong interest in the many artistic movements arising at the beginning of the new century. \n\nThe mantle shows the influence the artistic movements Fauvism and Japonism had on colours and fashion styles during this period. Another powerful influence on fashion was Les Ballets Russes, with their Oriental-inspired themes and costumes.\nEvening mantles, such as this one, would become increasing fashionable especially during the early 1920s, when they responded to the rage for anything Oriental.",
