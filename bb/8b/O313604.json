He trained as a goldsmith and developed considerable skills in engraving crystals and dies. For Pope Clement VII he created his masterpiece, a crystal casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.\nBelli was strongly influenced by Raphael and Michelangelo.\nHe had a facility to work very quickly, and Vasari noted that Belli had flooded the world with his works. \n\nA quadriga is a chariot drawn by four horses (a two-horse team was called a biga, a three-horse team a triga). It was used for races or as a triumphal chariot.\nRacing quadrigas where very popular in ancient Rome, where the chariot was driven standing upright.\nOn coins the quadriga was used as a symbol of victory and it is often driven by Victory herself.",
