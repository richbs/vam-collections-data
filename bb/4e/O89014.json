            "public_access_description": "Georgia Russell is interested in objects which carry invisible histories. Books are a favourite subject, but she has also worked with maps and wallpaper. While visiting the flea markets in Paris she became fascinated by the idea that so many second-hand books had a succession of owners, each with a different personality; that each book was in some way representative of the culture in which it was written; and also, that the books had a sculptural presence independent of their content and purpose.\n\nShe explores these ideas by 'un-making' books. In this case, by slicing into the paper jacket she has created three-dimensional patterns which suggest flames, seaweed, a skeleton, and other organic forms. In the process she invests the book jacket with new energy and a new identity, while it still retains vestiges of its original form and meaning. As a Scot, books and other artefacts relating to Scottish history have a personal resonance for her.",
