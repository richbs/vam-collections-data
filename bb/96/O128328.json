It depicts Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood, in profile facing to the left. Lord Hood (1724-1816) had a distinguished career in the Royal Navy, gaining advancement from success in the Seven Years War against France. Following further service in the American War of Independence, Hood entered parliament.  At the outbreak of the French Revolution he was made Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy. He became an Admiral in 1794 and was created Viscount Hood of Whitely two years later. He was described by Nelson as \u201cthe greatest sea officer I ever knew\u201d.\n\nThe wax is modelled by John Loch\u00e9e, active 1775 to 1790, who was a wax portrait modeller. Many of the waxes from 1786 to 1790 are depicting the Royal Family. He supplied Josiah Wedgewood & Sons with reliefs in wax between 1774 and 1788.",
