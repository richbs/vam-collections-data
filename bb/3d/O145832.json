Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nAnette Wohlleber (born 1962) trained at the Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung in Pforzheim and Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Canada. Her whimsical, highly individual compositions bring together many different materials and surface textures, while evoking memories and the imagery of dreams.",
