Previously in the collection of Lord Hatherton.\n\nHistorical significance: The portrait shows the Pope at the age of 86, and thus must have been modelled between his 86th birthday, which was celebrated on 13 July, 1676, and his death nine days later. The Pope, though stricken with dropsy, continued to give audiences until five days before his death. The beard is shorter and wider than in other representations of the Pope, and the head is related neither to the half-length marble figure of the Pope in benediction from the Bernini workshop in the Palazzo Altieri nor to the plaster reproduction of a lost bust by Bernini in Santa Maria di Montesanto.",
