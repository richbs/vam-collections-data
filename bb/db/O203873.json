Harriet's dress, a cap and kerchief over a bodice and apron, identifies her as a country girl. On the wall are two frames pictures of men on horseback and two identical elaborately framed oval mirrors on either side of a three-part window with the central part arched. The hall manager stands (left) behind a counter and talks to a Rake who uses an eye-glass to look at Harriet from a distance. Harriet is handed a card by the 'Bawd', who is dressed fashionably and with her hair piled high under a hat. In the shop are a crowd of people. Next to the window a man strokes a girl on her chin. The window is a Serlian window.",

This set, published in 1780, is based on an earlier set by William Hogarth entitled 'The Harlot's Progress' (1732) and shows how his influence on printmaking remained strong fifty years on. \n\nThis print depicts the interior of the Statute Hall, a place where employers paid a fee to inspect prospective servants. However this print echoes a contemporary book by Richard King entitled 'The Frauds of London', which accuses Statute Halls of operating to procure prostitutes.",
