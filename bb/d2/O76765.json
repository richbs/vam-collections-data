Made around 1410, its closest analogy in terms of technique and decoration is with a rare group of lacquered wooden covers for Tibetan Buddhist scriptures. It once had removable extension legs. A variety of uses has been suggested for this table. The red lacquer has been decorated in the qiang jin (incised gold) technique, whereby the pattern is incised with a sharp point, and subsequently filled with gold leaf.",
