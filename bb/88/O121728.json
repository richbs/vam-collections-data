It would have included a paten, or plate, to serve the consecrated bread. \n\nPaul de Lamerie (1688-1751), who supplied the set, was one of the most important English silversmiths of the period. He was the son of French Protestant parents who fled to England to escape religious persecution. By the time this piece was made he was goldsmith to George I.
