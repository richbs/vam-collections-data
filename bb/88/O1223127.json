Although the pantomime is unknown, there were similar brick characters designed by Dykwynkyn in Harlequin and the House that Jack Built, or, Old Mother Hubbard and her Wonderful Dog,Theatre Royal Drury Lane, 26 December 1861, which included a vision featuring a Mason, Drainpipes, a Carpenter, a Hodman, an Old Brick and a Young Shaver, Liliputian Labourers, Pigmy Plasterers, Tiny Tilers, Miniature Masons, Baby Bricklayers, Short Sawyers, Dwarf Drain Makers and Child Carpenters played by: 'a Host of Juvenile Auxiliaries.' In an article of 1867 the playwright T.W. Robertson described Dykwynkyn as 'the presiding genius of all theatrical Christmas revels.'\n\nFor his pantomime work Keene used the name Dykwynkyn which he characteristically signed on an artist's palette on the ground. He was also responsible for designs for a number of other lavish productions of the day, and for these he was billed as Mr. R.W. Keene.",
