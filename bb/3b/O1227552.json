            "public_access_description": "Liz Collini (born 1955) has an MA in Fine Art Printmaking from the Royal College of Art (graduated 2007) and has exhibited widely in the UK, and internationally. She is an artist who works with prints and drawings, making different forms of texts using simple but often ambiguous words and phrases. She has described her work as follows: \"The written word holds many paradoxes, not least those of absence and presence. There are gaps and overlaps between reading and viewing, text and image, the hand and the machine. I try to create breathing spaces in which we can pause and look back at language. Whole narratives can be compressed into a single word or familiar phrase. The drawings' resemblance to plans and blueprints reflects the strange provisionality of written language; the things about which we write are always elsewhere. I work only with Times New Roman (the default font) and my own handwriting to minimise questions of typography.\" \n\nThis is a preparatory drawing for the print (E.327-2011) which was commissioned as a site-specific exhibit for semi-permanent display in the Prints & Drawings Study Room. The resulting work is very literal embodiment of word as image; the phrase, devised by the artist, is the result of time spent in the Study Room listening and observing activity. The lettering has been constructed using explicit measurements and includes marginalia and annotations generated as a natural extension of the process of drawing the lettering and reflections on the site specificity of the piece. With its references to typography, the design process, and architectural plans, the work has a rich resonance in the context of the Study Room, and the collections of the Word & Image Department.",
