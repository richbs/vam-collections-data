It occupies an axial position, focusing the attention of the faithful from the outer halls of the temple directly into its spiritual heart, the \u2018garbhagrha\u2019 (\u2018womb chamber\u2019). \n\nImages of this scale and larger were usually housed in a pillared hall  (\u2018mandapa\u2019). This building stood independent of the temple but allowed Nandi to face directly into the eastern porch to the linga (phallis symbol of Shiva) sanctuary. This made explicit Nandi's intimate relationship with Shiva. \n\nNandi symbolises the religious duty (\u2018dharma\u2019) of a devotee. As Shiva\u2019s ultimate devotee, Nandi is in turn first worshipped by those intending to pay homage to Shiva himself in the temple sanctuary. He is represented as a bull-calf and always couchant. Nandi in the form of a processional vehicle (\u2018vahana\u2019) is represented standing. Processional Nandis are typically constructed of wood which is then either painted or covered in sheet silver, depending on the wealth of the temple.",
