            "public_access_description": "The Ginori company, founded in 1735 in Doccia near Florence, built its reputation on imitations of Italian lustred wares and maiolica of around 1500. Under the Marchese Lorenzo Ginori Lisci (d.1878), director from 1848, the pottery produced designs reflecting more varied and more contemporary tastes but also continued making its successful lustred wares. In 1896 the pottery came under the ownership of Giulio Richard who already owned other factories.  Combined, the new company was known as the Societ\u00e0 Ceramica Richard-Ginori.\nThis and five other pieces of Ginori were purchased by Henry Cole (1808-82)  then Director of the South Kensington Museum (V&amp;A) in 1859 directly from the  manufacturer. The dishes are V&amp;A 5443, 5444 and 5445-1859, the ewer is 5446- 1859, the other two pieces are plain white water-pots 5448 (&amp; 5449-1859 no longer in the Museum collection). Cole visited Florence in late  1858 and early 1859 to acquire works of art for the collection. He was accompanied  by Charles Drury Edward Fortnum (1820-99) a collector and connoisseur who advised Cole on many of the purchases.",
