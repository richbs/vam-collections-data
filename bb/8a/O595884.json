Some motifs, for example the book at lower left of the image, appear to have been copied in reverse from Wyriot's card. The style of the card suggests an earlier date, however it may be a case of a provincial goldsmith having a Parisian card copied in an old fashioned manner.\n\nThere is a slightly different example of the card in the Victoria and Albert Museum, Prints and Drawings, E.216-1950, image and text size: 193 x 140, which gives Thierce's address as La Rochelle.\n\nJacques Thierce is not listed in Nocq, however there is a Sim\u00e9on Thierce, active c. 1714, rue Saint- Louis, Paris, which may be a relation.'\n\n- Phillippa Plock, 2008 (from Rothschild collection database)\n\nReference: Henry Nocq; <u>Le Poin\u00e7on de Paris.
