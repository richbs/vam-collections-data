            "history_note": "These sand toys were bought from the Evelyn Way Kendall Collection sale, at Sothebys, London on December 16, 1999.  Three of the items are mid 19th century and the fourth was constructed by Mrs. Kendall's husband Henry W, in 1940.\nThe Kendall Collection was very large and housed in a purpose built display near Boston, Mass.  Sadly the collection was not on view to the general public even though it was part of a large complex which included a whaling museum open to the public.  Few people had the privilege of seeing the collection in situ, however, I (Caroline Goodfellow) did see it in 1994 and spent an afternoon there.  Unfortunately Mrs. Kendall, along with others of her age and purchasing power, had changed many of the dolls from their original state, re dressed, cleaned and \"repaired\".  Many of the costumes were swopped around the dolls and it is only possible to know this now through old photos and sale catalogues.\nThe toys, including the sand toys, were usually left alone and suffered little in the manner of the dolls.  There has been some repair work, however, as Henry Kendall enjoyed the mechanical toys it is likely he did the work.\n\nHistorical significance: Although some instructions indicate that the toy could be used for weather forecasting, they are not weather forecasting equipment.  The reason it could be used is when the weather is damp it makes the flow of the sand more difficult and the mechanism will stop.  Fair dry weather is best for the toy.",

            "historical_context_note": "Sand toys operate by fine sand from a hopper trickling on to a paddle wheel.  Sets of paper cut out figures with jointed limbs were attached to the paddle wheel by thin wire and these moved when the wheel turned.  Known as a mechanical device with a long history, this type of sand toy was made up about 1800 in France where it continued until about 1880.  The origins are French but other countries copied the principles including England and Germany and much later, the United States.  Other mechanical methods which were more robust replaced this method.  Often the subjects were whimsical or commemorative.  Nineteenth century examples are rare as the toys were fragile and easily broken.  They were also not made in great numbers.  There is one example in the Museum of London, one in the Castle Museum York and one in the Museum of Childhood, Edinburgh.\n\nBGM has one English sand toy and one made in Germany.  These will be the first ones of French origin in the collection.  \n\nThere are two of ladies dancing.  One of these has the original instructions by Gerard Campagni, a French toymaker.  These dated from the 1850 to 1860 period.  The fourth sand toy was made by Henry Kendall in 1940 to show how these toys worked.\n\nRecently, the Getty Museum asked to borrow our sand toy of an acrobat.  The request was refused as the example was too fragile to travel.  The toys are interesting as they use a mechanism known to the Egyptians which on the other hand was not particularly successful in more recent toys.  Sand toys are occasionally reproduced today using the same principles.",
