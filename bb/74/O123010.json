It consists of a cabinet with frieze drawer and central cupboard closed by two hinged doors. The cabinet is supported on turned balluster legs resting on a solid plinth. The carcass is mostly pine except for the oak backboard. The drawers are oak with a pine front. The drawer bottom is set into rebates and nailed. The ornament, applied to the inside and out of the doors and cabinet sides, consists of floral designs with tulips, acrnations and other flowers. The inside cupboard doors are decorated with birds. The motif is both cases is identical suggesting they derive from a print. The legs have been stained and most of the lower section is late apart, possibly, from the frieze drawer.\n\nPart numbered drawer 7 has a label at its back which reads 'Whitby fossils'",

It is not the best I ever saw\u2026but it is genuine & has not been tampered with.  If the sides were cleaned they would come out nicely\u2026.The stain is original - but I should think the shelf between the stretchers was added and should be taken away - the stain seems to be (?) or elm.  It is necessary to have a piece of this marqueterie in the Museum so that you can have a progressive collection\u2026..\"\n\n1/5/19 minute, H C Smith to Brackett\nInspection report: \"It is a piece of extremely high quality and appears to be genuine throughout\".\n\n1/5/19 Brackett to the Director\nrequests approval for purchase. \"It is a floral marquetry cabinet of the late 17th century (English)\u2026we ought certainly to have an example of this.\"\n\n6/5/19 Condition on arrival at V & A\nDamaged; panels cracked; 1 leg cracked, 2 others worm eaten.\n\n20/5/19 minute, Brackett to the Director\n\"This is an English cabinet of the late 17th century decorated on the doors and on the drawers inside with marquetry of flowers and birds in various woods and ivory: on a stand formed of 5 baluster legs, resting on a plinth.  It is said to have come from a country house in Yorkshire, and is a typical example of a type of cabinet not represented in the Museum\u2026.We consider it to be a genuine and attractive example, possessing only one doubtful or unusual feature - namely the plynth supporting the legs which differs from the arrangement of stretchers usually found in these cabinets.  The plynth, however, is not modern and may be original\u2026\u2026..(Macquoid) might advise some alteration to the plinth if the cabinet becomes our property\".\n\n3/6/19 letter, Macqoid to Brackett\nMacquoid advises \"you will be wise to remove the lower shelf - it cannot be original and of course the stretchers may not be but no one would notice the latter for so few ever remain to those cabinets - clean it very carefully with much hard rubbing with spirits of wine then wax it with pure bees wax\u2026.2/3rds of a jar shredded up then the jar filled up with good turps - wash the furniture lightly before using tall (?) stuff will look charming brilliant & not dusty.  It is necessary once a year & takes away, except in the case of day light stuff, the dusty appearance of neglect\".\n\n1/8/19 memo, Cecil Smith to Secretary\nSmith recommends the purchase.  \"It is a specimen of English work such as is badly wanted for the collections\".\n\nNotes from R.P. 62/2067\n\n17/8/62 \nsent to conservation for repair of a split door and raised inlay.\n\n11/10/62\ncabinet sent on long loan to City Art Gallery, Temple Newsam House, Leeds\n\n28/10/76\nreturned to V & A",
