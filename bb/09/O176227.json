The front rail of the seat is decorated with, in the centre, a shell and has a shaped lower edge; the cabriole front legs, each decorated with a leaf at the top, are joined to the back by baluster rails.  These rails and the back legs are similarly connected.  The leather work is fastened with brass-headed nails.\n[Chair back] Fragment of an embossed gilt leather panel, formerly in use as the back of a chair, consisting of two parts. The original back has been repaired by putting in another piece of gilt leather, also dating from the early 18th century. The pattern of both parts consists of scrolling bands and floral ornaments, the part in the middle is a fragment of the so-called 'damask' pattern.  Formerly attached to a Norwegian chair with brass nails.",
