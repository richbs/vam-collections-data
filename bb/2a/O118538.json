The art of inlaying small fragments of different coloured woods in geometrical patterns was a speciality that flourished throughout Andalucia from about 1500. It originated amongst Arab craftsmen from North Africa, where trees are more scarse and woods used more economically. Although Italian craftsmen at this time had an equivalent, known as tarsia di toppo, they preferred juxtaposing dark and light woods to create a three dimensional effect to Arab-influenced geometrical patterns. This box was probably presented to the Certosa by a visiting Spanish pilgrim or member of the Carthusian order.",
