The obverse side shows a domestic scene taking place in the grounds of a country residence where a child of a noble family is being encouraged to walk. The parents are fashionably dressed, and the women have frontage caps. Nearby a shepherd sleeps whilst his flock grazes. The entire leaf is painted and has a decorative border. There is a ground wash of silver, some of which is visible in the sky and on the ground. The reverse has also been given a ground wash of silver and is painted all over with flowers including roses, peonies and jasmine. The pierced decoration of the sticks and guards, although quite intricate, is rather crudely done.\n[Fan box] Fan box covered in imitation leather and lined with pink silk.",

The principles of construction of the Japanese version were adopted, but with European decoration. Carving and painting skills specific to fan production soon developed. A  wide range of pictorial subjects became popular for fan illustration.\n\nOwnership & Use\nA fan was an essential accessory in the formal dress of a wealthy woman.  Although its original function was to cool the face, the fan soon became an important tool in non-verbal communication. The manner in which a lady held and moved her fan conveyed her feelings toward those around her.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis rare late 17th-century fan depicts a domestic scene in a pastoral setting. The little boy or girl is in a child's dress, specially equipped with tapes from the shoulders to steady the child when learning to walk.",
