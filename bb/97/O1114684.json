It is associated with the new designs she created for a re-staging of the company's famous work The Firebird in 1926 (originally designed by Alexandre Golovin in 1910). This was one of several ballets that Goncharova designed for the Ballets Russes, she and her husband, (the artist Michel Larionov) met Sergei Diaghilev and Alexander Benois in Paris in 1914, who initially  suggested that Goncharova should design Fokine's ballet Le Coq d'Or.  \nShe continued to paint throughout her life but became best known for the designs she produced for theatre, opera and ballet. \n\nThe costume is associated with one of the thirteen Princesses who have been enchanted by the evil Kostche\u00ef. They are first seen at night by Prince Ivan who soon falls passionately in love with one of them and, with the help of the Firebird, defeats Kostche\u00ef and breaks the enchantment which has held them captive.",
