They were active in Florence from the early 15th century and elsewhere in Italy and France well into the 16th century.\nAndrea was the Nephew of Luca della Robbia, who founded the workshop and invented the technique of enamelled terracotta. Andrea della Robbia, who inherited the workshop, tended to use more complex compositions and polychrome glazing rather than the simple blue-and-white schemes favoured by his uncle.\nTrained as a marble sculptor in the studio of his uncle Luca, Andrea della Robbia also became an excellent modeller, unrivalled in his ability to capture the life of his subjects in glazed clay.",
