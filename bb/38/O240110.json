The sitters include Augustus Vernon Harcourt (1835-1919) and his wife Rachel (nee Bruce), the grandparents of the donors.  Harcourt was a chemistry don at Christ Church, Oxford from 1859 to 1902, when he retired to the Isle of Wight.\n\nThe autochrome is a colour transparency on a glass plate and was one of the earliest processes for producing colour photographs.  Each of these autochromes is in its original envelope, inscribed with date (18 June 1912), time (1pm and 2:30pm) and exposure details (4-6 seconds).  All three are enclosed in what appears to be the original Lumiere Autochrome box, labelled later by hand, 'This little box contains valuable Glass.'",
