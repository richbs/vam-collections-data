It was sponsored by the Canadian Auxiliary Services and like all ENSA productions was mounted under the umbrella organisation of NAAFI, the Navy and Army Canteen Board of First War.  When the second World War became inevitable, Basil Dean thought about entertainment for the troops, and secured funding for the military side of the provision of an entertainment division of NAAFI.  ENSA began as ANSA- the Actors' National Service Association - but when this title was rejected as being too narrow, it was replaced by ENSA, soon wryly dubbed: 'Every Night Something Awful'.\n\nListen To This! was produced by John C. Mather who started organising similar revues for the Kinross Home Guard in Scotland in 1941, when he was just 19.  He went on to become a producer of several war-time revues including Jills and Jive, Turn On The Heat!, Round-About and The Glamour of the Veils.  There was a separate Revue division of ENSA, run by Archie de Bear.",
