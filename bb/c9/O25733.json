There is a wide, open space like a public square in the centre of the shopping precinct.  There are single-storey shops on the left side and a bridge over to shops beneath a low rise block in the centre background.  This design is what is known as a presentation drawing.  Such drawings were finished to a high standard and were presented to clients.  This is an example of the sort of shopping centres that exist in many city and town centres in the United Kingdom.",
