They were mounted upon an ebonised casket, plaques 1-12 being fitted into niches round the sides, the remainder decorating the lid. The casket was further adorned with pierced silver strips and plaques in the Renaissance style and was supported on 4 feet in the form of double-bodoed lions holding sceptres.\u2019 \nThe casket was found to be modern when examined on acquisition by the Museum. \u2018... The composition of plaques 1-20 was not quite the same as that of 21-23 but all were of old silver... it was concluded that they were probably made in about 1530 by an artist working under the German influence in Spain. The possibility that they were German was discarded since nothing similar appears to be known in that country ... The nearest parallels were found to be the plaques decorating the hexagonal base of the Custodia by Enrique de Arfe at Cordova Cathedral.\nThe plaques 21-23 (fourth and fifth series) depicting the Virgin and St. John and the Descent into Hell, which all have flat backs, appear more appropriate for a processional cross. In this connection it is worth noting that Cordova Cathedral owns a processional cross by Enrique de Arfe as well as a Custodia.\n... The conclusions are that the plaques are part of a Custodia and of a processional cross and because of the incompleteness of their iconographical schemes, there must have been more of them and that they probably derive from the same Spanish treasury and were mounted up by an ingenious dealer for a rich client in the second half of the last [19th] century.\u2019",
