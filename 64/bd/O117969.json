Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. This image was taken in 1952 when Bing lived in New York, having been forced to emigrate from Europe in 1941 during the Second World War. This was her second trip back to Paris, where she had lived throughout the 1930s. The effect of war and the atom bomb led to Bing capturing more impersonal, distanced perspectives of the city.\n\nIn this photograph we do not see the vendor's face, just hands clutching at the handbag. Bing had become a tourist in Paris, and as well as hinting at hard times during the war, this image conjures up the commercialisation and movement of the modern city. We are positioned as a potential tourist/buyer, looking down upon the souvenirs of the city.",
