            "public_access_description": "This page from a royal Mughal album bears a Persian inscription in black ink identifying the person depicted, Mir Jumla, and the artist, Shiv Das. Mir Jumla was the title of Mir Muhammad Amin, an Iranian from a prominent family in Isfahan. He travelled from Iran to the Deccan and entered the service of the Qutb Shahi ruler of  Golconda who gave him the title. After some years, he returned to Iran, but arrived at the court of the Mughal emperor Jahangir (r. 1605-1627) in 1618. Mir Jumla was soon given high office, being appointed Khan-i Saman, the equivalent of Lord Chamberlain, as early as 1620. He kept this position under Jahangir's son and successor, Shah Jahan, and died in 1637.\nThe portrait was probably painted by Shiv Das between Mir Jumla's arrival in the Mughal empire in 1618 and his promotion in 1620. Little is known about the artist other than that he worked in the royal atelier in the late 16th and early 17th century under Akbar (r.1556-1605), and remained there during Jahangir's reign, but his surviving work is relatively rare. The borders surrounding the painting, densely decorated with gold flowering plants, Chinese clouds and hovering insects on indigo-dyed paper, were almost certainly also done in Jahangir's reign.",
