By the 16th century, this idea had developed into a game, and was most prevalent in Italy. Although still predominantly played as a form of gambling, people started playing variations of lotto at home with specially customised boards with numbers or symbols on.\nIn Victorian England the lotto format began being used as an educational toy for children, much like the example here. This game was used to improve a children's knowledge of animals and teaches them the animals' Latin names, which countries and continents they can be found in, and their eating habits.\n\nJaques & Son have been making toys since 1795. The company was started by Thomas Jaques and then passed down to his son, John and in turn his son John II. During the 19th century, Jaques & Son were one of the most prominent manufacturers of board and card games.",
