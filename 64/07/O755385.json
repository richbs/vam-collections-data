London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"William PAYNE  (1755/60 - c.1830)\nPuslinch Bridge near Yealmpton, Devon, c.1790.\nSigned in the plate <i>W: Payne. </i>\nEtching coloured by hand. \nCircular, cut to a diameter of 21.3cm.\nE.2523-1928\nBequeathed by Mr Alfred Winter\n\nThis print reproduces, reduced and in reverse, a watercolour by the same artist.<sup>1</sup>\nWilliam Payne was a watercolour painter who excited widely at the Royal Academy, the Society of Artists of Great Britain, the British Institution, and the Society of Painters in Watercolours.  He executed a considerable number of views of Devon, which had been his early home.  He was also a successful teacher and his etching would have formed part of his teaching practice as examples for pupils to colour, or coloured by Payne himself, as models for them to study and copy.  Two hand-coloured etchings by Payne in the British Museum<sup>2</sup> have printed labels on the back with the artist's name and 1790 address.\nThe contemporary demand for drawings and watercolours to study and copy is demonstrated by the existence, from the early nineteenth century onwards, of a number of establishments in London which lent works out to subscribers at much lower rates than the cost of private tuition.  This print was probably not coloured by Payne, as in addition to differences from the watercolour (e.g. the colourist has indicated two figures riding on the wagon where there is only one in the watercolour), the handling of the washes here is too slapdash to be the work of the usually careful Payne. \n\n1.
