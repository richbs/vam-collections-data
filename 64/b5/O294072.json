In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company's offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company's reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco.\n\nA. Oliver Goldsmith designed this frame, titled 'Oops',  in 1974. The style follows on from an earlier, heavier Goldsmith frame called 'Goo Goo' (T.244S-1990) created in 1964. This 1974 design took the same round eye as Goo Goo, but added thinner arms. The company sold this frame for both eyeglasses and sunglasses.",
