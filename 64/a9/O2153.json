Here, the bowl and foot of a humble jelly glass have been blown separately into a mould to form a mesh pattern (as a cheap imitation of facet-cutting), and the two pieces joined with a small 'knop' (a decorative bulbous swelling) of molten glass. The foot is domed to raise the pontil scar well above a polished mahogany table (the scar is the rough mark left when the pontil, or metal rod, used for handling the glass during manufacture is broken off). The edge is folded to strengthen it and terminate the mesh-moulding. It is said that a glassmakers' 'chair', consisting of a 'gaffer' in his special chair working in a perfectly-orchestrated way with three assistants, could make a three-piece wine glass in four minutes. No doubt this jelly glass would have taken about the same time.",
