Schools of kendo developed to test the former and official blade appraisers were established to test the latter. The more respectable samurai took their blades to these professionals, who tested them in various prescribed ways, the cutting attestations (\u2018tameshigiri\u2019) being inscribed on the tang (\u2018nakago\u2019) of the blade (the part of the blade that goes into the handle). Blades tested in this way were generally made by smiths who needed to prove that their blades were efficient as well as beautiful objects. The swords were tested on condemned criminals or their corpses, which were sometimes bundled together to increase resistance to the cut. Up to seven bodies at one time are alleged to have been cut through in a single blow. Swords were also tested on bundles of wet straw (which has the same resistance as the human body) or on thick sections of bamboo. \n\nThe custom of testing swords was observed and commented upon by the Portuguese Jesuit priest Rodrigues, who wrote \u2018They [the Japanese]...show great pity and compassion [for the killing of animals] but they do not feel this when they kill men in a bloodthirsty way and test their swords on corpses. Some lords may ask other nobles for some men who have been condemned to death in order to see whether their sword cuts well and can be trusted in emergencies. They often sew up bodies which have been cut up by swords and put together the severed parts so that they may once more be cut.\u2019\n\nThis blade has an inscription that says that in the year 1682 it was tested and used to cut through two bodies.",
