The carved crest rail with two C-scrolls and scrolling leaf flanking a putto mask with coronet, is tenoned into the rear uprights. A replaced section on each upright conceals the joint. The rear uprights, which rake above the seat, are spiral turned, with vase finials, and appear to have been extensively repaired. The bottom rail is carved with two C-scrolls and is tenoned into the rear uprights. The three vertical elements of the back which enclose two cane panels appear to be replaced: the two outer elements are carved with a pair of 'horsebone' scrolls, the central, narrow, pierced element (or muntin) is carved with two S scrolls. \nThe four seat rails are carved with shallow leaf motifs on their upper face and a curling leaf occupies the moulding on the upper arris. The side, central and rear stretchers are spiral-turned with rectangular blocks at the joints. The front legs are carved in the form of outward facing lion heads with scrolling acanthus throughout their 'bodies', on bobbin feet. The front stretcher is carved to echo the crest, with two C-scrolls with scrolling leaf ornament. \nAssembly marks are visible on the side and mid-stretchers and back legs.\nWith a dark stain overall.\n\nReplacement parts: the carved elements of the back (incl. crest and bottom rail), seat rails, front stretcher, front legs (?)",
