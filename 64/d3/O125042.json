At the base, a band of indentations is supported by a mask between scrolling foliage. At the top is a triangular pediment.",

            "public_access_description": "This drawing is from a group of ten designs for pier glasses, tall, narrow mirrors intended to fill the pier, the space between two windows, sometimes surmounting a pier table, by Joseph Sanderson (about 1690-1747). He designed this pier glass in about 1740 and signed the drawing with his initials 'J. S' at bottom left.\n\nOn this design, the upper part of the frame is overlaid with a flower basket on trailing foliage, with curved grooves to both sides. At the base, a band of indentations is supported by a mask between scrolling foliage. At the top is a triangular pediment.\n\nThis group of ten designs for pier glasses was formerly contained in a bound album of drawings, by different designers, assembled by Charles John Shoppee (1823-1898), the architect, between 1850 and 1880. It has since been disbound and the drawings sold.\n\nJoseph Sanderson and his cousin, John Sanderson (d. 1774) were partners in building, and there is a possible connection between the designs and Barrington Hall, Essex where they worked. The Shoppee album contained elevations for Barrington Hall by Joseph Sanderson. The house was built for J. S. Barrington about 1740 and subsequently abandoned. Much of the furniture ended up with an unrelated family at Bradfield Hall, Berkshire. Amongst the furniture sold from Bradfield was a pair of giltwood pier glasses, now at the Treasurer's House, York. The pair of pier glasses is somewhat comparable to the designs.",
