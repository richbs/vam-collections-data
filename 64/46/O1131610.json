One is by carving, soaking in brine and then completely drying out.  Another is to air dry the peeled apple and then carve it.  Some 'wet' methods use vinegar or lemon juice mixed with salt.  By the time the apple has finished the preservation process successfully and is ready for the finishing touches of paint, hair etc it has a firm wrinkled brown appearance which lends itself to the portrayal of characters and grotesques. 19th century examples are usually very hard, and have an almost wood-like texture.  \n\nApple-headed dolls are still made, predominantly in Canada and the USA.",
