The names of the deceased, Antonio and Catharina Maggi da Bassano, a celebrated jurist and his wife are inscribed on the imitation pavement in the upper loop of the frame. \n\nIn commissioning this unusual round marker, the lawyer Antonio Maggi da Bassano departed from the typical rectangular tomb slab. The books, serpent, parchment rolls and inkwell are symbols of the scholar, while the hourglass and candlesnuffer remind us of fleeting time. The blank space in the middle may once have held an engraved brass panel that gave access to the tomb.",

            "history_note": "Purchased by Robinson in Venice for \u00a370. In his description for the museum officials, he called it a \u201c\u2026circular frame or architrave surrounding a square tablet of Istrian stone,\u201d with \u201c\u2026a long inscription round the marginal band, a shorter one on a square tablet...\u201d This could suggest that the center, now empty, was once filled. However, he may have been referring to the faux parchment at the top of the tomb slab. The description also included the note that the memorial was originally located in a building of the University of Padua. \n\nIt is not clear why Robinson later changed this statement in his letter to the Times of 24 October, 1883, in which he claimed that it came from Brescia, and was meant to honour Antonio Maggi Bassiano. In the letter, he also stated that \u201c\u2026the square center of the medallion is missing; it was doubtless an inscribed marble or bronze tablet.\u201d \n\nPope-Hennessy noted that the tomb, with its inscriptions, was described in a 1560 guide to Padua as in the church of San Pietro in Padua. Pope-Hennessy also noted that Giacomo Salamonio recorded \u201cfurther verses, which seem to have been carved on a tablet set in the square aperture.\u201d (Pope-Hennessy, 514) Though Pope-Hennessy did not mention Robinson\u2019s original description of a square tablet set in the middle, this may have been his source. However, there is no record of such a tablet associated with the tomb slab upon its arrival at the museum.  \nPope-Hennessy\u2019s theory also may have been inspired by his translation of the verses recorded by Salamonio.  In Salamonio\u2019s text, they were printed in italics; perhaps due to having been written in Italian and not Latin. Pope-Hennessy believed that the verses indicated that the tomb was damaged, however they could also refer to the tomb being opened in order to bury further family members. \n\nIt is difficult to determine the original location of the tomb, but it appears from Salamonio\u2019s description that it was near the high altar.\n\nHistorical significance: The round format of this tomb slab is highly unusual for an Italian Renaissance tomb. Its innovative shape was noted by Salamonio, who described it as \u201clike a shell.\u201d (Salamonio, 116).  The tomb\u2019s original placement near the high altar, its size and the elaborate inscription demonstrate the prestige of Antonio Maggi as the alderman of various towns in the Veneto, all listed on the inscription.\n\nThe tomb slab is elaborately carved with both decorative and symbolic motifs. The square frame in the center, out of which scroll heads curve at the top, bottom and sides, is covered in a delicate vegetal pattern.  The area between the circular border and the square frame is filled with symbolic objects. The iconography  relates to Maggi\u2019s life and more general symbols for death.\nThe books inscribed DECRET  and DIGEST refer to Maggi\u2019s work as a lawyer and symbolize his knowledge of canon and civil law. The serpent found at the top left  might have a variety of meanings. Though generally negative, serpents could also be seen to symbolize wisdom, prudence, logic \u2013 all useful qualities for a jurist. It might also be seen as symbolizing Time and death. The box with the open lid might also refer to scholarly work. The peach below the hourglass symbolizes truth. The rolls of parchment and inkwell to the upper right likely refer to Maggi\u2019s work as an alderman or jurist.\nThe hourglass with the scroll inscribed FVGIT, FVGIT (it flees, it flees) refers to the fleeting qualities of time, while the candle snuffer\u2019s scroll is inscribed SIC EXTINGVIMVR OMNES (so all men are extinguished.) Both are therefore memento mori; intended for the viewer to be aware of his or her own temporary existence.\nThe pinecone was a symbol of immortality, but also fertility. The branches of palm in the upper left symbolize victory over death. Laurel, as found in the upper right, was a common symbol for victory.  The pomegranate in the lower right symbolizes resurrection, and the olive is the lower left is likely a sign of peace.\nThe coat of arms at the bottom are those of the Maggi family, and balance the faux parchment inscribed with the names of Antonio and Caterina found in the top scroll head.",

            "historical_context_note": "Round tomb slabs such as this one are unusual. Pavement tombs were more commonly rectangular. \n\nA possible  precedent for the form of Maggi\u2019s tomb is found in the tomb marker of Cosimo il Vecchio de\u2019 Medici by Andrea del Verrocchio in the church of San Lorenzo in Florence (c.1464-1467). Cosimo\u2019s tomb marker was series of porphyry and serpentine discs joined by white marble bands and framed in a square. One white marble band creates a circular border, while two others in the form of elongated ovals intersect and frame a porphyry square in the center. Faux parchment inlays at the top and bottom have are inscribed with Cosimo\u2019s name and his status as Pater patriae (a name meaning father of the nation, awarded to him after his death). \n\nThe Medici arms appear in the four corners of the square. Bronze grates in three squares at the bottom, left and right of the square visually connect the crypt with the upper church. Though Cosimo\u2019s tomb is flat and is made of inlaid stone, the Maggi tomb, though sculptural, evokes its general form.\n\nDonatello brought the influence of Florentine sculpture to Padua during his sojourn there from 1443-53. Exchange of ideas also took place during artists\u2019 travels and through pattern books and sketch books.. It is possible that the unknown artist who sculpted Maggi\u2019s tomb had seen Cosimo il Vecchio\u2019s tomb, either in person or in a drawing, and changed the flat forms of the inlay into an updated 16th century sculptural form. \n\nOn the Maggi tomb, the inside border which appears to curve out of and around the square frame is also reminiscent of patterns found in Cosmati pavements (mosaic inlaid floors popular in churches during the 12th and 13th centuries, though the style was based on earlier Byzantine models). Such pavements often had funereal connotations. Similar patterning appears in the church of San Vitale in Ravenna, where Maggi served as alderman.",
