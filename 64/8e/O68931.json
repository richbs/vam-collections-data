Westwood\u2019s career in fashion was galvanised by McLaren and together they launched memorable fashion moments, including Punk in the early 1970s and later their Pirates collection. McLaren and Westwood conducted a design relationship between 1971 and 1983. In 1990 and again in 1991 Vivienne Westwood was named British Designer of the Year; she has also received an OBE.\n\nWestwood\u2019s unique mix of practicality and inventiveness, her preoccupation with silhouette and the manner in which she manipulates fabrics result in dynamic fashion. Westwood herself once said, 'You have a much better life if you wear impressive clothes.\u2019\n\nThis ensemble is from Westwood and McLaren\u2019s \u2018Buffalo\u2019 collection (also called \u2018Nostalgia of Mud\u2019). The garments in the collection, including this jacket and skirt, featured asymmetrical cuts and rough  materials such as sheepskin and shell or horn details.",
