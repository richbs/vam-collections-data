This goblet is decorated with the arms of William V, Prince of Orange, and those of his wife, Frederika Sophia Wilhelmina of Prussia. It must have been commissioned by a royalist. During the last quarter of the century, both royalists and patriots were keen to express their support by toasting to the success of their champions. Diamond-point engravers favoured imported English lead-glass, because it was soft and easy to engrave. Its lustrous surface also provided a good background for the matte engraving. These qualities enabled engravers to develop an entirely new style. Instead of scratching lines into the glass surface with a diamond-point, they could now build up a picture by thousands of minute, dot-shaped scratches. By varying the density of the dots, these skilled engravers would create an illusion of depth with highlights and shaded parts.",
