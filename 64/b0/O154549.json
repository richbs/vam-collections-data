            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nJewellers of the late 20th century found new ways of drawing out gold's natural beauty. By exploring surface treatments and textures they created an effect very different from the bright metallic glint of polished gold. The jewellers restored an elemental simplicity and grandeur to this most enduring of metals. Yasuki Hiramatsu's strong forms of crumpled gold foil reveal the inherent softness of the metal.\n\nHiramatsu came from a family of metalworkers and is considered to be the first contemporary artist jeweller in Japan. He used traditional Japanese goldsmithing techniques, yet transformed these into modern vessels and jewellery with Western principles. The gold is thinly rolled almost paper-thin, then folded, crumpled, pounded or beaten to create highly textured surfaces. For Hiramatsu it was important how the light would fall and enhance the surfaces. His work is however characterized by its simplicity.",
