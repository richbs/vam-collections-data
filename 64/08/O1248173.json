            "public_access_description": "Jenny Wiener's complex iconic images of measurement are witty explorations of the systems and constraints of mathematics in an aesthetic context. Wiener's practice centres on measurement. She starts from the perception that nothing is as it seems, and uses her analytic mind and quirky humour to question the assumptions and components we use to define and assess, qualify and quantify.  Her concern is that we are increasingly reduced to numbers: serial numbers, pin numbers, illogical scorecards, random statistics and units of measurements - measuring everything and nothing.  In her practice, she selects measures and then applies forensic dissection to varied subject matter , including famous paintings (notably Crivelli and Cezanne) , or as here, the artist's workshop, combining intricate technical drawing with layers of coloured geometric shapes. In his introduction to Wiener's book/catalogue 'Measuring the Tale' Richard Osborne wrote: \"Jenny Wiener's work is subtle, analytical and almost perverse. Almost because it has a wonderful reasoning all of its own, which stretches the logic of measurement to the point where the rigorous patterns of everyday coherence begin to dissolve into the metaphysics of improbability. There is a dash of whimsy, a soupcon of artistry and a great deal of intelligence that go into this mix of the mythical, the numerical and the perceptual. This is postmodern art in the best sense of the word; it is art about the possibilities of art and the probability of perception being confronted by the inadequacies of tradition. Let those who look for reassurance look the other way.\"",
