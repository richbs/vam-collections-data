            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 215-16\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"NEWTON, Gilbert Stuart, RA (1794-1835) \n\nBorn Halifax, Novia Scotia, Canada, 20 September 1794, of American parents; his uncle was the portrait painter Gilbert Stuart with whom he studied in Boston. Travelled to study in Florence, and visited Paris, where he made friends with C R Leslie (see entry above) and returned with him via Brussels and Antwerp to London 1817. Entered RA Schools. Exhibited 27 works, mostly portraits and literary subjects, at the RA between 1818 and 1833, and 22 at the BI 1819-31. Elected ARA 1828, RA 1832. Several of his works were engraved. Visited America 1831-2 and married there; on return, confined in the Chelsea asylum for the insane, where he died 5 August 1835. The Art Journal in 1864 thought him 'not a painter of great originality or power; but his works are characterised by much elegance both in design and execution'. \n\nLIT: \tGentleman's Magazine 1835, pp438-9 (obit); Athenaeum 15 August 1835, pp625-6 (obit); H Murray The Gems of Stuart Newton, RA 1842 (collection of engravings after his works); Art Joumal1847, p280, 1864, pp13-15 \n\nPortia and Bassanio \nFAl66 Neg 59112 \nCanvas, 106.7 \u00d7 91.4 cm (42 \u00d7 36 ins) Signed and dated 'G S Newton 1831' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1831. Hung in the Great Room, the work was titled in the catalogue 'Subject from the Merchant of Venice' and the following lines appended: \n\n\tPortia: \tWith leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself; \n\t\tAnd I must freely have the half of anything \n\t\tThat this same paper brings you \n\nThe lines are from act 3 scene 3 of Shakespeare's play; the episode depicted is after Bassanio has chosen the right casket and so has won Portia's hand in marriage. His friend Solanio brings him a letter with the news of Antonio's financial failure and Shylock's insistence on his pound of flesh. The painting was possibly intended as a pendant with 'Lear attended by Cordelia and the Physician', also at the RA in 1831 (152, now private collection, London). The same model sat for both Cordelia and Portia. Newton had exhibited 'Shylock and Jessica' at the RA in 1830 (144, now Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA), which was compared favourably by the Athenaeum with the same subject by J M W Turner. 'Portia and Bassanio', and the original pai8nting of Olivia's Return' (1831-1909, p217) were listed in the Athenaeum obituary among seven of Newton's works of especial merit (15 August 1835, p626).\n\nEXH: RA 1831 (7); American Artists in Europe 1800-1900 Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, 1976-7 (45); Shakespeare's Heroines Art Gallery, Buxton, 1980 (26)\n\nENGR: G T Doo 1837 (impr in V&A collection)\n\nLIT: Shakespeare's Heroines exhibition catalogue, Buxton Art Gallery, 1980, p56\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
