An early pair were supplied by the Jewel Office (a state department storing, lending and buying silver for officials) to the Duke of Argyll in 1719. The sauce tureen appeared in about 1765 as the Neo-classical style began to gain ground and vase shapes became fashionable. Sauce tureens and sauce-boats were often sold in sets of four, although one of the largest and grandest dinner services, made for the Duke of Leinster in 1745\u20137, contained ten sauce-boats. \n\nThis sauce tureen was ordered by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769\u20131852), from the London goldsmith Robert Garrard to supplement a silver service presented to him by Portugal in 1816. The Portuguese service was a major diplomatic gift of thanks for the Duke of Wellington\u2019s victories over Napoleon I in the Peninsular War of 1808\u201314, resulting in Wellington\u2019s expulsion of French troops from Portugal.",
