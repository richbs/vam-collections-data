These beads were mass-produced in Europe \u2013 particularly in the glass-making centres of Venice, Bohemia and the Netherlands \u2013 and transported to African countries to be used in trade.\n\nThe beads became an important element in artistic expressions of cultural and ethnic affiliation amongst Xhosa and Zulu-speaking peoples. Elaborate pieces of bead embroidery were worn by men and women and, through colour and design, communicated the wearer\u2019s ethnicity, age, regional roots, wealth and status. Xhosa and Zulu women continue to produce and wear large quantities of beadwork, particularly on ceremonial occasions. \n\nBritish people were able to collect examples of beadwork such as this necklace through their involvement in conflicts like the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 and the South African War of 1899-1902, or via their work as colonial agents.",
