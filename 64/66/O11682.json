Below the  top is a card disc printed in blues to represent water; disc is mounted on a yellow plastic stand.  In the centre of the stand is the base of the control tower which passes through the brown plastic 'mountain' in the centre of the top and is capped by a yellow plastic knob; the knob ultimately turns the disc.  The playing surface and disc is housed on a plain card base.\n\nPLAYING PIECES\ndice - one white marked 1 - 6; one black marked 1 - 3\n8 gunboats, red plastic hulls on rings which fit into the cut away areas on the playing surface, blue plastic deck, yellow plastic gun\n4 Nautilus (players' markers), in two parts - blue, red, yellow and green",
