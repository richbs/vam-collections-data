Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n<b>The Princess Royal </b>\nFA126 Neg 67937 \nCanvas laid on millbaord, circular, diameter 8.9 cm (3\u00bd ins) \nInscribed on back as below \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nInscribed in ink, probably by the artist, on a label stuck on the reverse: 'H.R.H The Princess/Royal/painted by C R Leslie/Feby 20th 1841'. Leslie recorded: \n'In 1841, I painted a second picture for the Queen [the first was the Coronation painting, see FA129 below] - The Christening of the Princess Royal. I was admitted to see the ceremony, and made a slight sketch of the Royal personages as they stood round the font in the room. I made a study from the little Princess a few days afterwards. She was then three months old, and a finer child of that age I never saw. \n\nThe finished painting, in the Royal Collection, was engraved by H T Ryall in 1849, and is reproduced in H and A Gernsheim <u>Queen Victoria: a Biography in Word and Picture</u> 1959, p70. \nQueen Victoria's first child was born 21 November 1840, and baptised Victoria Adelaide Mary Louisa on 10 February 1841 at Buckingham Palace. She was to marry in 1858 King Frederick III of Prussia, who was (briefly) Emperor of Germany in 1888; thereafter she was known as the Empress Frederick. She died in 1901. A very similar, but not identical, portrait in miniature of the Princess in her christening robe painted by Miss Ross after a sketch by Sir William Ross is also in the Royal Collection. The 1819 watercolour of Queen Victoria as an infant by J G P Fischer, also in the Royal Collection, presumably shows the same christening robe and bonnet. \n\nLIT: <u>Leslie</u> I, ppl71-2 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
