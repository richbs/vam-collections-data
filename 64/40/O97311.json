It was not only the men of the Chinese aristocracy who took to horse-riding; by the Tang dynasty Chinese women are often depicted on horseback. Like the men, they too adopted the dress of their horse-riding neighbours, the so-called 'foreigners dress' (hufu), consisting of a belted knee-length tunic with splits up the side worn over loose trousers gathered at the ankle and tucked into high boots. Indeed the hufu became the fashion in 7th and early 8th century Chang'an and there are many images of groups of women, some in the long traditional female Chinese robes - which were worn decollete at this period - and others in hufu such as this. This piece has a cobalt blue lead glaze which is seen in China from the beginning of the 8th century. It arrived along the Silk Road from the Near East, probably in the form of glass cabachons. These only needed to be ground down and fritted with lead glazing material to make them ready for use. The amber of the lapels was from iron and the green of her shoes from copper, both used in the 7th century. She may be holding a small dog - although the modelling is indistinct. Pet dogs were fashionable among the Chang'an aristocracy. The most famous Chinese woman of the mid-8th century, Yang Guifei, the emperor's favourite concubine, was known to have a small 'Samarkand' dog which she used to distract the emperor's opponents when they were playing cards so she could cheat on his behalf.",
