Their production was encouraged by organisations and institutions to offer spriitual comfort and guidance during times of duress.

The text often ran sideways so that those in neighbouring beds could read the text.  Hobbies magazine of 1899 suggested that 'invalids find considerable comfort in such coverlets'.\n\nThis example has embroidered panels, but others used ready printed textiles such as those promoted by Robert Mimpriss; an entrepreneur and textile printer born in 1797.",

Their production was encouraged by organizations and institutions to offer spiritual comfort and guidance during times of duress. Churches, Sunday schools, Bible classes, Temperance groups, ladies\u2019 sewing circles, hospital wards and asylums all advocated the benefits of recording Christian scripture while engaged in the act of stitch. Hobbies magazine in 1899 suggested that \u2018invalids find considerable pleasure in such coverlets . . . The words are  sometimes arranged upon the coverlets that the occupants of neighbouring beds can read inscriptions upon the part that hangs over the edge.\u2019 This design principle is evident here. Most examples, such as this one, date from the mid- to late nineteenth century. While some were made for the maker\u2019s own use, others were created as objects to be sold at church fairs and auctions. This example has embroidered panels, but others used ready-printed textiles, such as those promoted by Robert Mimpriss: an entrepreneur and textile printer born in 1797.",
