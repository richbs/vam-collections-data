The gowns were believed to have originated in Asia or the Orient where the loose style and decorative silk, calico or chintz fabric of which they were often made were more common. \n\n \n\nThey were usually worn wrapped round the body like a kimono, sometimes fastened at the waist with a belt, but those resembling a coat secured with buttons also existed. \n\n \n\nA gentleman would wear a banyan in the morning, often when receiving guests informally. Banyans were worn mostly indoors as a lounging garment, but by the late 18th century, under the influence of Romanticism, were sometimes also worn outside.",
