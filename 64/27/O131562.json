The separation or Rhine quarrel between a Rhine Baron and his son. By C. Lasch. In frame. Signed. German. Dated 1847'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of the Romantic imagery developed in Western Europe during the 19th century and in Dusseldorf in particular which, by 1850, had replaced the Dresden Akademie as the favoured place in Germany to study art.\nLasch essentially produced portraits and genre scenes and relatively few history paintings such as the present one. This rare subject matter scene appears on two paintings by Ary Scheffer: <i>Count Eberhard of W\u00fcrtemberg cutting the Table-cloth between himself and his Son</i> and <i>Count Eberhard by the dead Body of his Son</i>, both Municipal Museum, Dordrecht.  \nThis type of works was quite popular with collectors and this painting may have been bought by Townshend, who was an erudite man of letter, because of the subject matter.",

            "historical_context_note": "The word Romanticism derived from the medieval term 'romance' and was first used by the German poets and critics August Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel to label a wider cultural movement beginning with the late 18th and ending towards the mid 19th century. Romanticism started first in Western Europe as a literary and philosophical movement and only gradually involved the other arts, explicitly around 1800. Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. The interest in the exotic and the non-Western, illustrated in France by such a painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863), as well as the medieval revival, witnessed in England by Horace Walpole (1717-1797), are perhaps the most identifiable parts of Romanticism. It is really in the Post-Napoleonic period that this movement gained ascendancy. Its greatest proponents were among others Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824) and Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriant (1768-1848) in France, Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) in England, Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) and Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) in Germany. In the visual arts, it was largely played out by 1850, but in music it persists for another generation.",
