Krizia collections are renowned for their eclecticism, but also their distinctive, clever and light-hearted designs and this winged pleated dress is highly representative of the originality of the label. \n\nKrizia's penchant for pleating started with an accordion-pleated raincoat in the Autumn/Winter 1978-79 collection, long before pleating triumphed on the national and international catwalks. This was followed by experimentation with technique and with the properties of materials - the label played with different types of horizontal, knife and spiral pleating; lacquered linen gazar pleating, silk organza pleating and, from 1987-88, Fortuny style pleating. Every now and again the pleats reappear in Krizia designs, renewed and recreated.\n\nOver fifty collections a year are created for the various Krizia labels, including menswear, childrenswear, knitwear, glasses, handbags, ties, perfumes, kitchen furniture and much more. There have been a number of different designers in charge of design but as of 2007 Mariuccia Mandelli still very much a hands-on designer at her house.",
