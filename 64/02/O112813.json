On the lid, within a foliated border three letters, in Gothic script, of uncertain reading.  On the rear, in late Gothic script, the letter M.  On the right-hand end, the letter M in late Gothic script, differently rendered.  On the left-hand end, the letter A in late Gothic script.  On the front, sprigs of roses.  Two brass hinges, the upper sides terminating in trefoils.  Similar hasp side in reverse filling on the front into lock, also of brass.\n\nGeneral Remarks:  The hinges are contemporary with the casket , but appear to have been put on without observing the leather pattern.   This is the kind of shoddy work that occasioned differences between gaigniers and garnisseurs.",
