Thomas Chippendale included designs for Chinese chairs in his Director, first published in 1754.\n\nPeople\nThis Museum has two chairs from the set of eight ordered by the 4th Duke and Duchess of Beaufort from the London workshop run by William Linnell and his son, John.  The original design for the chair by John Linnell is also in the V&A (museum no. E.71-1929). \n\nPlaces\nIn addition to the set of eight chairs, the Linnell firm also supplied the bed, the dressing table and a pair of dwarf bookcases for the Chinese Bedroom at Badminton House, Gloucestershire. The completed room was seen by  Dr. Pococke in 1754 who commented on the 'Bedchamber finished and furnished very elegantly in the Chinese manner'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThese chairs and the bed that they accompany were redecorated in black and gold in the 1830s and 1840s to match the commode and dwarf bookcases. The form of the chair is also different from that shown in John Linnell's design.  The tracery of the back is rectilinear and the arms are curved rather than straight.",

            "history_note": "Commissioned by 4th Duke and Duchess of Beaufort as part of a set of eight chairs for the Chinese bedroom. Designed and supplied by the workshops of William and John Linnell, Berkeley Square, London.\n\nWhen Dr. Richard Pococke visited Badminton in 1754 he referred to the `Bedchamber finished and furnished very elegantly in the Chinese Manner' <u>Travels through England</u>, II, p. 31). The 1835 Inventory (Badminton Archives, 401.4.4 (2), f. 33, No. 25) mentions \"Eight Chinese Elbow Chairs, scarlet Moreen bottoms\" in The Chinese Room. George Smith in <u>Household Furniture</u> (London, 1808) describes Moreen as \"Superfine cloth ... for the draperies of dining Rooms and libraries\".\nBetween 1849 and 1913, six of the set were placed in the Chinese Room and two in the Chinese Dressing Room. \nOn 30th June 1921 all eight armchairs were sold as lot 49 at Christie's. The current upholstery was added some time after the sale of the armchair at Christie's, 17th December 1959.\n\nHistorical significance: During the 1740s and 1750s, Chinese-inspired furniture was very fashionable. Engravers and aspiring cabinetmakers ranging from Battey Langley to Thomas Chippendale included designs for Chinese furniture. Joseph Goupy designed an octagonal House of Confucius at Kew, with walls made up of open lattice work. In 1750, William Halfpenny published New Designs for Chinese Temples, which included this type of Chinese lattice work. Despite her criticism of \u2018the barbarous gaudy gout of the Chinese', Mrs Montague had a Chinese room at her own house in Hill Street, St. James's, decorated with very similar pieces of furniture by William Linnell, the highly fashionable cabinet maker of Berkeley Square. The Duke of Beaufort's Chinese furniture, already at Badminton by 1754, is probably the last example of English Rococo-influenced Chinoiserie, before William Chambers, who had actually been to China, published his <font -u>Designs of Chinese Buildings, Furniture, Dresses, Machines and Utensils</font> in 1757.\n\nA reproduction of this model was included in the Ann Getty House Collection, San Francisco, launched in 2004",

            "production_note": "No bill for the furnishings of the famous Badminton Chinoiserie room has survived but there is strong evidence for the attribution to the Linnells. William Linnell supplied Mrs Montague with similar furniture for a Chinese Room at her house in Hill St., St. James's, London, in 1752. A design for a chair, very similar to the set of eight `Chinese' chairs, which  belonged to the Duke's bedchamber, survives in a bound collection of drawings by William Linnell's son John, compiled in 1800 and now in the V&A's collection of designs (Museum number: E.71-1929).\n\nThe chair in Linnell's drawing is predominently red, with some of the frets painted blue and yellow, and traces of pigment have been found under the black japanning of this chair. A surviving bill of 1843 (Badminton House, Park and Farm Accounts, 2B 3/4/16) states that a firm by the name of Harley & Langs was supplying \u2018gold leaf, gilders tools, brass ornaments lacquering furniture & ca & ca for J. Coffey's use for 1 year to Mich's [29th September] 1840'. It is very likely that Coffey re-japanned the set of chinoiserie chairs at that time.",
