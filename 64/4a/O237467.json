Although Randolph Caldecott is chiefly known as an illustrator, his interests and work were more varied. This statuette was modelled from the skeleton of a cat, a dead cat and a live cat.\n\nRandolph Caldecott (1846-1886) was a British artist and illustrator. He first worked as a bank clerk in Whitchurch and Manchester while attending evening classes at the Manchester School of Art. In 1872 he moved to London and studied briefly at the Slade School of Fine Art. He did a lot of book illustrations and was one of the first to avoid the then so popular black-and-white effects. He also worked in watercolours and oil drawings.\nCaldecott drew his images amidst the vernacular architecture and landscapes of his childhood with a vivid sense of humour. His representation of animals was especially spirited. Apparently even Van Gogh and Gauguin were admirers of his work. Caldecott is commemorated in a memorial by Alfred Gilbert at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London.",
