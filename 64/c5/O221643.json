Brogi worked on this collection in conjunction with David Blundell, however, all of the designs and illustrations in this collection of material are by Brogi. At the start of 1997 Brogi was promoted to Head Designer for Sonneti. Brogi works initially in pencil on paper, the image is then outlined with various point sizes of black fineliner ink pens, to give basic definition. This black and white image is then scanned onto a computer and manipulated further, with the addition of colour and shade, to achieve a fabric-like effect. The end result is a highly finished, glossy illustration. Brogi's style encompasses practical outdoor-wear with the popular '90s culture of snow and skate-boarding `streetwear'.",
