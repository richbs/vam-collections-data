At this period, long-established couturiers typically catered to a regular clientele with sedate, ladylike tastes. Heim broke from tradition with a dramatic mini-caftan in sunray-pleated purple silk. The hem flares out to reveal frilly lime-green silk shorts attached to an underdress. This design would not have looked out of place in a King's Road boutique for young people.\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R.L.Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes were sold by high end London boutiques.",
