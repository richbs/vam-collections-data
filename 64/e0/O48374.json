On the puffed sleeves are dark red and pink bands separated by white lines, indicating bands and slashing; the fitted lower sleeves are secorated with lines forming lozenges each enclosing a white dash simulating slashing.  The doublet is open down the front revealing a white shirt.  The trunk hose is banded like the sleeves.  The tights are red brown and the shoes clear blue with white dashes indicating slashing. Around the waist is a sword belt, the hilt of the sword is visible at the right hip.  Surrounding the design are pencil sketches showing costume details.  The design is inscribed with the name of the role, the actor and fabric details.",

            "history_note": "This is one of 25 designs by Hugh Stevenson for a programme of excerpts from Shakespeare devised for a British Council tour in the early 1950s.  It was performed by a small company led by Walter Fitzgerald and called for costumes that would clearly indicate the different characters while allowing for quick changes.  This Stevenson achieved by creating a basic costume in the Elizabethan style for each actor to which were added robes, tunics, overdresses or accessories.   \nThe designs are part of the collection that came to the Museum from the dance historian and publisher Cyril Beaumont and may originally have formed part of the London Archives of the Dance.\n\nHistorical significance: A group of designs showing how a designer solves the problem of creating costumes for a programme of extracts from various Shakespeare plays (which means allowing for quick changes), by creating several basic costumes which can be adapted, or to which accessories can be added, to indicate specific characters",
