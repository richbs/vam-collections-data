The original Ayrshire work skirt is\n gathered to the narrow waistband, with picot-edged robings and a\n central panel finished with whitework embroidery at the hem; at a\n later date two strips of machine-made lace have been inserted into the\n central panel above the embroidery, and both the central panel and the\n picot-edged hem have been tucked.  The garment fastens at the back of\n the bodice with drawstrings at neck and waist.",
