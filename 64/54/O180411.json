After working with modulated line, in a series of drypoints, Albers went on to make a series of lithographs collectively titled 'Graphic Tectonic' with very precise linear structures.  He then began work on a series of wood- and lino- cuts, in which the geometric patterns drawn against the organic pattern of natural wood grain, represent an evolution of the geometry of Graphic Tectonic. In some of these relief prints, organic patterns of the wood grain in the printing block are highlighted through contrast with very precise, straight-line, geometric patterns which Albers carves into the block. In others, like 'Adapted'  Albers plays with curvilinear forms, but after these prints of the mid-1940s he abandons curved lines altogether.",
