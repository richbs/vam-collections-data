            "public_access_description": "The art of engraving gemstones can be traced back to ancient Greece in the 8th century BC and earlier.  Techniques passed down to the Egyptians and then to the Romans.  There were major revivals of interest in engraved gems in Europe during the Byantine era, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  At each stage cameos and intaglios, these skillful carvings on a minute scale, were much prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment.  The formal composition and elaborate Gothic architecture of the canopy over the Virgin in this cameo suggest a northern European origin.  There are parallels with similar groups showing the Virgin on altarpieces in Germany and Switzerland from the 1480s and 90s.  Engraved gems often underwent changes of use and setting, sometimes even being recut.  This cameo has had a small hole, now plugged, drilled towards the top over the canopy.  This was probably a fixing point used when it embellished, along with other engraved gems, a silver gilt cup during the 1600s.  The cameo is recorded in the sale catalogue, prior to its acquisition by the Museum, as having been 'formerly set on the summit of the jewelled cup ... where it had been for at least two hundred years.'",

Robinson in his 1860 Uzielli catalogue entry for this gem, the cameo 'was formerly set on the summit of the jewelled cup, No.656 in this Collection, where it had been for at least two hundred years; originally, however, it was most likely set as a pendant jewel.'  His entry for No.656 refers to a 'cylindrical cup and cover, in silver gilt, set with jewels... and thirty-seven cinque-cento cameos.
