This type of story stemmed from Morality plays, which were sponsored by the trade and professional guilds in towns throughout medieval Europe. \n\nAlthough the Sorgheloos story was a popular one, few designs or roundels depicting it survive. There are several roundels in collections with the same images as the two in the Victoria & Albert Museum (Museum numbers: C.65 & 66-1929), but we do not know their design sources.\n\nThe story concerns a young man (Sorgheloos or 'Carefree' in English) who squanders his fortune on gambling, loose women and corrupt friends. When he becomes penniless, his friends desert him and he ends up destitute. So, unlike the parable related by St. Luke, the story of Sorgheloos does not have a happy ending.\n\nThe other characters in the story are Weelde (Luxury) - a woman; a male companion called Gemack (Ease/Comfort), another male character called Pouer (Poverty), Aermoede (Wordly Pleasure or Luxury) - a woman; and Lichte Fortune (Fickle Fortune).\n\nIn this roundel, Sorgheloos has lost all his fortune and most of his friends. He attempts to return home to his family and friends, but they reject him. He is carrying Aermoede on his back. A contemporary proverb says: 'He who cannot support luxury must have poverty'. A later woodcut illustrating this scene includes the figure of Pouer (Poverty) clinging on to Sorgheloos' back and weighing him down.",
