Her female figures are depicted as headless torsos to highlight the imposed perception of women in Pakistan and their non-recognition as individuals. The circle is a recurring symbol in her work which she uses as a means of conveying the constrained lives of human beings. Circles also indicate the hallowed space of various rituals as well as the sun and moon. \n\nIn this image there are five headless nude figures emerging from a circle. In the top right hand corner there is a much smaller circle with a flower inside.",
