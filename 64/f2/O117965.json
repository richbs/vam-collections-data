Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. This photograph was taken when Bing was relatively new to the city and was completing many magazine assignments. It shows the influence of Bing\u2019s contemporary, the photographer Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz who was also living in Paris at that time. Kert\u00e9sz also took documentary images of everyday life. In this photograph, the chairs behind the main subject almost take on human form. Bing also photographed chairs in isolation, influenced by the Surrealist movement.",
