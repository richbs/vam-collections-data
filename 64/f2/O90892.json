            "public_access_description": "This is a detail from the front opening of a gown said to have been worn by a bride at her wedding, but it is not designed for movement or necessarily for close inspection. It is made from a length of green silk been embroidered with couched metal thread and lines of glittering sequins, in a floral pattern that had been printed or drawn on the fabric. The silk was cut into the pieces required for the robe. Cutting and seaming through embroidery seems like sacrilege in an age and culture where hand-decoration is expensive, but it is not an uncommon practice where labour is relatively cheap. The edges have been decorated with an elaborate trimming of metal thread that has been twisted and stitched into a complex floral motif. As the silk has no backing the trimming is floppy and reveals the unsightly tacking stitches that hold the individual metal threads in place. However, this is a presentation gown in which the wearer was expected to stand perfectly still. This style of garment is designed to trail on the floor, with each panel elegantly arranged over and around the woman\u2019s feet. With the bride immobilized in this way, each part of the trimming could be carefully adjusted to create a breathtaking vision of green and gold.",
