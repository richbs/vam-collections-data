His street photographs are often deliberately unreadable, refracted or reflected in mirrors or windows. This image is one of a series of self-portraits in which his camera becomes part of his silhouette. He has implicated the viewer in the picture by placing us in the position of the photographer, standing where the artist once stood. The image collapses the distance between interior and exterior, reflection and surface. In this way Friedlander broke the conventional rules of photography to revitalise the medium.",
