Mintons evidently thought the sculpture it was based on was by the French artist Claude Michel, known as Clodion (1738-1814). In fact the bust is a variant of a well-known sculpture of a shivering girl, \u2018La Frileuse\u2019 (or \u2018Winter\u2019), by the French artist, Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741-1828). In Mintons' version the girl\u2019s cloak has been removed, and she has been re-defined as Venus. \n\nParian porcelain was developed in Staffordshire during the1840s, and was initially used for making copies of marble sculpture. These were sold in some numbers for relatively modest prices, enabling a wider range of buyers to own small-scale sculptures, and display them in a domestic setting. Parian porcelain is usually white and was often left unglazed, particularly when used for sculptural works. This bust was described as Minton\u2019s \u2018first specimen of Parian tinted in the mass, combining the colours of terracotta with the advantages of a vitrified porcelain.\u2019 Messrs Minton exhibited a white Parian porcelain version of this model at the London International Exhibition of 1862.",

In fact the bust is a variant of a well-known sculpture of a shivering girl, \u2018La Frileuse\u2019 (or \u2018Winter\u2019), by the French artist, Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741-1828). In Mintons' version the girl\u2019s cloak has been removed, and she has been re-defined as Venus.",
