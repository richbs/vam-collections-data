            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 56\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"CRUIKSHANK, George (1792-1878)\n\nBorn London 27 September 1792, son of the caricaturist Isaac Cruikshank, with whom he trained as a graphic artist perhaps as early as 1799. After James Gillray\u2019s death 1815, he became the leading political caricaturist of the day. In the 1820s he turned to book illustration, receiving many commissions to provide plates for novels; the success of Dickens's <i>Sketches</i> by Box (1830) was largely due to Cruikshank's designs. In the 1840s his success and reputation declined, especially with the advent of <i>Punch</i> (1841). Many of his later works are concerned with the cause of temperance, and he enjoyed considerable success with his series of prints 'The Bottle' (1847). A prolific maker of prints during a long working life (there is an extensive collection in the V&A), the number of works in oil is small; he exhibited eight at the RA between 1830 and 1867 and 15 at the BI 1833-60, the subjects principally literary and genre. Died London 1 February 1878; a good deal of his studio collection was presented to the V &A by his second wife Eliza. \n\nLIT: G Reid <i>A Descriptive Catalogue of the Works of George Cruikshank</i>  3 vols, 1871; W Bates <i>George Cruikshank</i> 1878; B Jerrold <i>The Life of George Cruikshank</i> new ed 1898; A Cohn <i>George Cruikshank: a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9</i> 1924; <i>The Inimitable George Cruikshank</i> University of Louisville Libraries, Kentucky, USA, exhibition catalogue 1968; W Feaver <i>George Cruikshank</i> V&A exhibition catalogue 1974; H and M Evans <i>The Man Who Drew the Drunkard's Daughter </i>... 1978; M Wynn <i>George Cruikshank: His Life and London</i>1978; G Buchanan-Brown <i>The Book Illustrations of George Cruikshank</i> Newton Abbot 1980 \n\n<b>Tarn O'Shanter</b> \n72-1880 Neg 57165 \nCanvas, 54.6 x 67.3 cm (21\u00bd x 26\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'GEORGE CRU[IK]SHANK [18]54' on window ledge tl \nPresented by Mrs George Cruikshank 1880 \n\nCruikshank exhibited two paintings of Tarn O'Shanter in 1852, which may be one and the same painting. At the BI, the catalogue gives the measurements including frame as '29 by 34 inches', and the following quotation appended to the title: \n\nAnd wow! Tom saw an unco sight! \nWarlocks and witches in a dance; \nA winnock-bunker in the east, \nThere sat auld Nick, in shape o'beast; \nA Towzie tyke, black, grim and large, \nTo gie them music was his charge. \n\nThe RA catalogue for 1852 gives another quotation: 'And scarcely had he Maggie rallied,/When out the hellish legion sallied'. \n\nEither quotation - from Robert Burns's famous poem <i>Tam 0' Shanter</i> (first published in 1793) - could apply to the present picture; the inscribed date of 1854 may have been added later, although it seems unlikely. \n\nThe <i>Art Journal</i> described the BI painting as 'one of those highly-coloured eccentricities which this artist has recently exhibited'. \n\nThe story of Tom O'Shanter suits Cruikshank's interests in both the supernatural and the perils of alcohol. Tarn, returning from market day in Ayr, rides drunkenly through a storm; as he passes the haunted Kirk-Alloway, he sees a scantily-clad girl dancing among a crowd of witches and warlocks led by the devil playing the bagpipes. They chase Tarn: he rallies his horse Maggie, but 'out the hellish legion sallied'.\n \nEXH: ?BI 1852 (421) and/or RA 1852 (1272); <i>George Cruikshank</i> Arts Council 1974 (380, as undated but c1855); <i>Victorian Narrative Painting</i> Bristol Cathedral 1977 \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1852, p74\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
