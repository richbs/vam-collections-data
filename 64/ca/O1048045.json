Such scenes may be read as affirmations of bourgeois domestic virtues. Granted that the extent of Lady Hawarden's religious faith is not known, perhaps this and similar scenes should be accepted simply as variations on her theme of 'studies from life'. Here the act of praying gives Clementina and Elphinstone Agnes an opportunity for theatrical self-expression and gesture.'",
