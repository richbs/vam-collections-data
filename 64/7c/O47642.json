Many designers base their concepts on the original 1911 production, designed by Alfred Roller, although David Walker, in designing the opera for English National Opera in 1975, found Roller's work a little vulgar, while describing his own work as 'a bit like Harrod's best.'  There was a handsome over- sumptuousness about Walker's costumes that married well with the sheer welter of words and notes that characterise the opera.\n \nThe role of Octavian was written not for a tenor, but for a soprano.  The costume therefore in its strong lines and weight is designed to help the singer suggest a young man.  In colouring and style it relates to the costume worn by Sophie, the girl with whom Octavian falls in love even though he is acting as emissary from Sophie's older admirer, Baron Ochs; the costumes therefore almost hint that there is a fundamental understanding between the young couple even before they themselves realise they are in love.",
