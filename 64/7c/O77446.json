The British troops were led by John Churchill, 1st  Duke of Marlborough. One side of the medal shows a profile bust of Queen Anne, the other Marlborough on horseback. He is receiving three keys from a kneeling female allegorical figure,  who wears a mural crown to represent the three cities.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe medal was struck in bronze. Struck medals were produced from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. A flat disc was placed between the dies, which were then compressed, so that the design was reproduced on the metal. This technique meant that a high number of medals could be made using the same dies over and over, whereas the technique of casting medals was generally more complex and suitable only for smaller numbers.\n\nPeople\nThe War of the Spanish Succession was fought to resolve the question of the Spanish throne following the death of Charles II in 1700. Philip of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV of France, had been named the sole heir but his claim was disputed. War ensued, with the Holy Roman Empire, the United Provinces (the Dutch) and Britain on one side, and France and Spain on the other. \n\nJohn Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722), was the supreme commander of the British forces and a great military strategist. He was created Duke in 1702, partly at the instigation of his wife, Sarah, a confidante of Queen Anne. His most famous victory was the Battle of Blenheim in 1704,  when the French were defeated outside Vienna. With the return of the Tories to power, and his wife's quarrel with Queen Anne, he was dismissed. In 1711 he had to flee to Holland upon false charges of corruption. He returned to England at the accession of George I in 1714.",
