The woodcuts are printed on a traditional Kozo paper, while a more experimental approach is conveyed by the cut outs on the front and back leaves, the end sheets made from patterned vinyl and the binding made from needlepoint mat.\n\nClaire Van Vliet clarifies the work's emphasis on structure and use of materials in the accompanying Note for standing order patrons: 'The covers are needlepoint mat, something I have wanted to use for a long time in a binding. This book had been in the works for five years and had never quite gelled. When Elizabeth Steiner was here last October to work on our collaboration on book structures she had a model of backstitch binding that made the whole project finally click'.",
