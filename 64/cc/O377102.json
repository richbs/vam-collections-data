            "public_access_description": "This snuff box is whole-heartedly neo-classical in its use of ornament derived from classical architecture and in its treatment of the subject of love.  The box is oval and is mounted with oval and circular scenes, each of which is framed in a laurel wreath.  On the lid and base a band of guilloche ornament completes the decorative scheme.  A band of egg moulding runs around the side of the lid.  A number of the figures are seen in profile as they might be on a classical gem.  The altars, the ewers, and, not least, the superb goat's head tripod, which parallels a fashionable piece of French furniture, known as an ath\u00e9nienne, are all classical in origin.\n\nThe box was made (or at least begun) in 1763-4.  An early Paris design for a neo-classical snuff box is dated 1759 (see V&amp;A museum no. E.897:30-1988), and by 1763 the Baron de Grimm reported that the expectation was that a box would be neo-classical in design (see V&A museum no. 916-1882). \n\nLouis-Claude Porcher was baptised in 1737.  His address is known until 1791.  The name of Roucel on the bezel indicates that the box was sold by, and probably made to the order of, Louis Roucel, goldsmith to the king, who was admitted as a master of the goldsmiths' guild by royal privilege in 1763, the year this box was made.",
