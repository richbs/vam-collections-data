The clockwork is housed in the body covered with a metal plate cut away at the corners to allow the legs to move. The plate is partly coloured yellow with the centre and the integral key plain. The key is a twisted S shape. When wound the back legs collapse then spring open and the horse appears to leap along. The same movement is repeated in many of the early and later designs. This type of mechanical horse was developed by Gunthermann and it is probably one of them but appears to be unmarked. The horses came boxed so it may be that at the date only the box was marked.\n\n*The horse may be pre-1900.",
