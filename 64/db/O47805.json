He sits at a fantastical organ-cum-writing-desk with large bellows to each side, each bellows standing on a low structure of two curving steps and surrounded by four thin metal candlesticks linked by curving metal bars, the candle holders containing white candles with exaggerated dripping wax. Between the bellows are foot pedals from which thin metal pipes lead up to a desk or music stand on which are sheets of paper. The Phantom holds a quill pen in his right hand and wears a white diagonal half mask covering the right hand side of his face. Multi-coloured fabric swatches are attached by metal pins to the right hand edge. The design is signed and is inscribed in pencil with the production title, the theatre, the scene, the name of the character and the actor, and costume details.",
