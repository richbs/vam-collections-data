Barrie's play Peter Pan at London's Duke of York's Theatre. She played a Lost Boy in the original production and first revival, and took the title role from the second revival in 1906 until the end of the Christmas 1913 revival, after which she retired. She made one film appearance in 1916 in the satirical film The Real Thing at Last, scripted by Barrie.\n\nThe photograph is by Lafayette, the Dublin firm founded in 1880 by James Stack Lauder using the professional name James Lafayette, following in the footsteps of his father who had opened a pioneering photographic studio in Dublin in 1853.  Lafayette opened studios in Glasgow in 1890 and in Manchester in 1892, and became well known as a society photographer who provided portraits for the growing number of illustrated magazines at the turn of the century.",
