Mrs Stratton whose London premises were located at 104, Piccadilly, was commissioned to make the Princess's bridal dress and several other garments for her trousseau. This was a very prestigious commission which confirmed her position as one of London's leading court dressmakers.\n\nPrincess Beatrice (1857-1944) was Queen Victoria's youngest daughter. She married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896)  on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, in the Isle of Wight.",

Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (1857-1944), the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, who married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896) on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, Isle of Wight. The cuttings were preserved, and presumably taken, by Mrs Caroline Augusta Gammack (1852-1916) who worked as a stock keeper for Mrs Stratton. \nThe Graphic, 'The Princess Beatrice's Trousseau', 27 July 1885, described the Princess's departure bonnet to which this spray of heather relates, as, 'a chef d'oeuvre of the Marie Stuart shape, which is so becoming to the Princess; the foundation of ivory velvet, delicately outlined with silver; was trimmed with white Scotch heather - which flower in Scotland is considered an omen of good fortune; a small plume of ostrich feathers and a white osprey were arranged to take from the flatness of the brim on the front; nestling unobserved amongst the heather was a small spray of orange blossom'.",
