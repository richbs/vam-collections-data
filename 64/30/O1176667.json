Skinheads liked being tidy and clean, everything had to be just right; half-inch turn-ups, half-inch braces. I liked the reggae music that early skinheads were into. I used to go to a club called Mr Bee's in Peckham where they played reggae and soul. The club was always full of black Jamaicans - I used to go with my friends and people were always really friendly.

All the elements of the outfit were purchased in Brighton, where John G Byrne lives.\n\n\"'I was only eleven when I first became interested in skinheads and I was about twelve when I really became part of it,' explains John G Byrne, a gay skinhead living in Brighton. [...] 'Skinheads liked being tidy and clean, everything had to be just right; half-inch turn-ups, half-inch braces,' he says. It figures that the early Skinheads inherited this attention to detail from their subcultural predecessors, the mods.
