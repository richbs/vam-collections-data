Indian ornaments often had beautiful enamel work on the inside, which protected the soft gold from being gradually abraded by contact with the wearer's skin.\n\nThis piece was bought for the Great Exhibition and may have been specifically made for it or it may have been purchased simply as a good example of existing work of this kind.",
