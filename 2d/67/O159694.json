The mark on the piece however is for the ceramic artist Alexis Boissonnet (1879-1956). Boissonnet was a French c\u00e9ramiste who made effective use of glazes on stoneware.  The son of a porcelain manufacture supplier, Boissonnet was active from c.1900.  He worked with the sculptor Pierre  Devaux and their work \u201cla Rh\u00f4ne et la Sa\u00f4ne\u201d was highly praised at the Parisian Exposition Universelle in 1900 just before this vase was acquired for the Museum. In 1902 Boissonnet took part in the Universal Exhibition at Turin, as a member of the independent group representing the School of Nancy. In 1902 he also exhibited at Lille and, in 1905, at Limoges and St. Petersburg. After teaching in  several french factories, during World War I, he worked on stoneware production and then took over the family business of St. - Vallier Ceramique (Drome) in 1918 until 1933 (when succeeded by his son). The factory was established by his father in 1863 and still operates today under the name Novaceram.",
