The central flowering stem has a number of long green pinnate leaves rising up from its base. There are four four-petaled red flowers with black stamens and two further flowers in bud. The definition and shading of the flowers is achieved by hatching and crosshatching in darker tones.  The leaves are painted in two tones of green with a darker green for the hatching. The painting has an unembellished border of strips of dark grey paper pasted on the main plain buff paper border with marginal strips of beige paper and a pinkish strip on the inner margin added as a gutter for the album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
