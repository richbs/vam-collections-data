Harry Beard Collection.\n\nSkimmingtons definition: a ludicrous cavalcade, in ridicule of a man beaten by his wife. It consists of a man riding behind a woman, with his face to the horse\u2019s tail, holding a distaff in his hand, at which he seems to work, the woman all the while beating him with a ladle; a smock displayed on a staff is carried before them as an emblematical standard, denoting female superiority: they are accompanied by what is called the ROUGH MUSIC, that is, frying-pans, bulls horns, marrow-bones and cleavers, &c. A procession of this kind is admirably described by Butler in his Hudibras. He rode private, i.e. was a private trooper. \n\nDefinition taken from The 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, originally by Francis Grose. \n\nThis print is presents very similar elements 22to the one by William Hogarth's engraving \"Hudibras Encounters the Skimmington\", 1822",
