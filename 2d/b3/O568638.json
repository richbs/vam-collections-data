The rocker makes lots of dotted indentations in the surface of the plate which hold ink.  To allow a gradation of tone, certain areas of the plate are burnished \u2013 the surface is smoothed - so that their ink-holding capacity is reduced.  Mezzotint allows subtle variations of tone to be achieved.\n\nPeople\nCharlotte Augusta, Princess of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttell (1737-1813) was a daughter of Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales, and sister of George III.  In 1764 she married  Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick at St. James\u2019s Palace.  During the Napoleonic Wars her husband died from wounds received in battle, and the princess returned to Britain in 1807, granted protection by George III.\n\nPhilip Corbutt was the alias of Richard Purcell (fl. 1746-1766), an Irish engraver who settled in London during the 1750s.  \n\nSubject\nThis engraving was produced at some point during the 1760s, certainly after 1764 when the princess married the Duke of Brunswick, and it is possible that this print was made to commemorate the match.  The princess looks to the right, with a tiara in her hair and wears an ermine lined robe; the clothing is generalised, a silk gown with the robe worn over the shoulders.  Reynolds believed the particularities of contemporary dress should be avoided in portraits to give them a timeless quality and elevate the status of portraiture.",
