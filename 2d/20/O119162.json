            "physical_description": "Powder flask, German, dated 1603. Walnut with ivory, bone and horn, engraved with fine detail emphasised with a black mastic; of flat curved shape, decorated on the front with a figure of a huntsman with spear thrusting at a stag that is chased by a hound, overlooked by a squirrel nibbling a nut, near an acorn. The background and sides the sides of the flask with scrolling stems, berries, and larger round fruits bordered with a double line of stringing. The base is veneered with ivory, engraved with a coat of arms, the initials B.W.I.T. and the date 1603. The back is plain but for a double band of stringing. The top is mounted with an iron lid, with sprung nozzle. Attached through two cord loops on metal ring screws is a thin cord of pink silk and silver/silver gilt threads, terminating in two pink and silver tassels. Linked to this thin cord is a thicker cord with blue and pink threads to which is fixed a large red tassel, both though to be 19th or 20th century.\n\nNote on materials\nThe ivory has been used for all the larger pictorial elements, and the two larger sizes of circles. \nThis identification is based on the strong 'grain' type structure associated with Schraeger lines that is clearly visible.\n\nBone has been used for the long thicker stringing that forms the border to the pictorial element.\nThis is based on the vessel structure that is visible, combined with the slightly whiter colour in comparison with the areas thought to be horn.\n\nHorn has been used for the sinuous stringing within the pictorial area and for the smallest circles.\nThis is based on what appears to be a fibrous/vessel structure that is completely translucent in places.\n(Strictly speaking, bone and horn have the same vessel structure and can only definitively be distinguished by sampling and examining under high magnification. See Rivers and Umney, Conservation of Furniture, Oxford 2003, pp. 199-201).\n\nDesign sources\nThe motif of leaping stag confronted by a spearman and pursued by a leaping hound may derive, at least in part and reversed from Jost Amman (Hollstein, part II, no. 277, p.93, third tier). The man to the right of the powder flask scene corresponds closely with the figure of the man to the right in Virgil Solis\u2019 \u2018Hare Hunt with a Falcon and a Stag Hunt\u2019, though the position of the legs is reversed (Hollstein Vol LXIV, p. 190, No. 519). The squirrel with nut, against a background of swirls, may well derive from Virgil Solis (Hollstein vol. LXIV, no. 573, p.244 'Frieze with 18 Birds and a Squirrel').",

This flask depicts a stag hunt on one side and scrolls on and berries on the other.  This powder-flask is signed B.W.I.T. and dated 1603. Although the initials remain unidentified, this work would have been made by a German or Austrian craftsman who specialised in decorating gun stocks and powder flasks with ivory inlaid hunting scenes on walnut backgrounds. The most famous exponent of this art was Caspar Lickinger of G\u00fcnzberg, who flourished in the 1590s.",

            "historical_context_note": "Powder flasks were used to carry gunpowder.  A  measured quantity of powder was drawn off by using the  spring-loaded pivoting cap on the nozzle. Firearms became more and more sophisticated during the  16th-century but still required a number of accessories to  load and operate them. The main charge, placed in the  barrel with the shot, was carried in the powder flask.  Smaller priming flasks contained fine-grain powder for  priming the pans of wheel-lock firearms. Flasks were  attached to a bandolier, a type of sling worn over the  shoulder or around the waist, from which hung the  various accessories required for a weapon including  spanners for the mechanism, measured charges, powder  flasks and priming flasks.\n\nArms and armour are rarely associated with art. However,  they were influenced by the same design sources as other  art forms including architecture, sculpture, goldsmiths'  work, stained glass and ceramics. These sources had to  be adapted to awkwardly shaped devices required to  perform complicated technical functions. Armour and  weapons were collected as works of art as much as  military tools.\n\nLike the pistols and guns that accompanied them,  decorated flasks were costly items. Inlaid firearms and  flasks reflected the owners' status and were kept as much  for display as for use. Daggers, firearms, gunpowder  flasks and stirrups worn with the most expensive clothing  projected an image of the fashionable man-at-arms. The  most finely crafted items were worn as working jewellery.",
