An alternative elevation to the candelabrum has been erased. \n\nThe candelabra standing to either side of the throne were originally planned as gasoliers but later changed to candles. This drawing would seem to represent part of this process which was finally completed by March 1847. The drawing features one extra tier of branches that was not executed. \n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
