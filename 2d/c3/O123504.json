            "public_access_description": "This plaquette commemorating the funeral of Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot was made by Oscar Roty in 1894 in France.\n\nCarnot (1837-1894) was a popular French statesman, fourth President of the Third French Republic. President of France from 1887 until his assassination in 1894. He was stabbed by an Italian anarchist called Sante Geronimo Caserio.\n\nOscar Roty was the leading French medallist of the late 19th century. \nHe studied painting under Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran and sculpture under Augustin-Alexandre Dumont. In 1875 he won the Prix de Rome for engraving and, supported by his more conservative mentor, Jules-Cl\u00e9ment Chaplain, was elected to the Institut de France in 1888. In 1889 he won the Grand Prix at the Paris Exposition Universelle and was appointed an officer of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur. In 1907 he was awarded the Salon medal of honour for sculpture, an unprecedented award for a medallist.\n\nRoty\u2019s great career reflected his role in what Roger Marx called \u2018the Renaissance of the medal in France\u2019. This was evident at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, where struck medals by Roty and other medallists sold in tens of thousands.",
