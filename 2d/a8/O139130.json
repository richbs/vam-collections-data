The Patent Museum, managed by the Commissioners of Patents, was installed on the ground floor at the southern end of the Brompton Boilers, the iron-framed building erected in 1856 to house the first collections of the South Kensington Museum.  In 1891 the frame, without the carving which had been removed, was acquired by the Museum from Mr Secand.",
