The tops are usually made from straight pine, in narrow sections, edged with cross-grained walnut, moulded to a thumb section. Every variety of marqueterie, from the ivory jessamine flowers and leaves to the finely scrolled, can be found in these tables. Frequently the back is inlaid to correspond to the front, showing that they were made to stand away from a wall.

The 'triad' would often be placed against a pier between windows, serving in the grandest rooms as a formal element without specific practical use, but in more modest domestic contexts as a dressing table, with the table often covered with a cloth. Various combinations of different veneers and marquetry are found, sometimes also japanning, and with silver mounts. Conspicuous, twist-turned legs were widely used. Similar tables survive in relatively large numbers and varied quality, while far fewer stands have survived. A broadly similar floral marquetry table (of particularly fine quality, with inlay also in the round),and with partly ebonised legs was installed at Ham House between 1679-83.  \n\nIt is generally considered that brightly coloured and naturalistic floral marquetry was produced in England by about 1670, following developments by Parisian cabinet-makers from about 1661. John Evelyn\u2019s second edition of Silva (1670) describes the use of hot sand shading in \u2018Flower-works\u2019 by \u2018Our Inlayers\u2019, perhaps implying that it was practiced by English specialists, not (only) Netherlandish or French immigrants. Bowett suggests that the high cost of marquetry may have encouraged the use of small oval or quadrant panels (produced by specialist workshops and supplied to other cabinet-makers) during the period c1670-85, but that \u2018all-over\u2019 floral marquetry was available to those willing to pay for it.\n\nThe technique of floral marquetry\nThe design was drawn on paper, pricked and transferred to a working paper using a \u2018pounce pad\u2019 with fine bitumen powder, or graphite or coloured chalk. The design was cut into its individual elements and each glued to its respective veneer, with reinforcing paper on the other side. Several veneers (for the same design) would be clamped into a packet and sawn out using a marqueteur\u2019s \u2018donkey\u2019 or jigsaw. After cutting, individual elements could be shaded using hot sand. The ground veneer would be sawn out in a similar way by assembling and glueing the pre-cut elements into the floral design on top, allowing for small variations in the whole design. Once the floral marquetry and the ground veneers were cut, the whole design would be assembled (face down) on paper, glued to the wooden substrate (paper uppermost), and dried under pressure.\n\nJohn Evelyn describes the use of coloured native woods such as \u201cBerbery for yellow and Holly for White\u201d, alongside others imported from Asia and the Americas: \u201cFustic [Chlorophora tinctoria], Locust, or Acacia; Brasile [Caesalpinia], Prince [Dalbergia cearensis] and Rosewood for Yellow and Reds, with severall others brought from both the Indies\u201d. Marqueteurs also used dyes on receptive native woods such as pear, sycamore or holly to achieve varied tones of a wide range of bright but fugitive colours including black, blue, green, yellow and red.\n\nSee Adam Bowett, English Furniture 1660-1714, (Woodbridge, 2002), chapter 2, Case Furniture 1660-89",
