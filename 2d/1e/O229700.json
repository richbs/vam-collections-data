Along one end the green velvet is marred by the impression left on it from a now-removed diagonal boteh, infilled with a flowering stem.  The mark suggesting couched metal thread. At each corner is a square of voided red silk velvet on a yellow ground woven with a metal strip [silver] weft. The pattern is floral, with a flowerhead within a festoon. The inner border is a ribbon with a blue cotton ground and a repeating pattern of a rose and two buds in white cotton and red, orange and green wool. The outer border is pieced and bias cut; it is composed of near-matching pieces of woven silk and metal thread [silver strip open S-wound on yellow metal thread] with a floral scroll.  Some pieces are without metal thread and have a more open weave; some have more naturalistic flowers and a white bird in their pattern.\nBacking: two different fabrics. [1] the large centre is pieced red plain weave block-printed with rows of small blue, brown and white flowers with black outlines. The back of this is roughly stamped in two places with 'the work of Samad'[?] at the seam which is also marked by two piece ends. [2] the outer part of the border is yellow cotton block printed in tightly packed rows with red and white roses with green leaves and outlines.\nFacing: bias-cut blue cotton.\nThere is evidence of cotton wool wadding between the yellow cotton and the green velvet, suggesting that the entire piece might have been padded.  In this case, the missing central panel might well have been an embroidered [and quilted?] cover of the type found in the Collection.",
