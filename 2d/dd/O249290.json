Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.7</b> <i>Jasmine</i> wallpaper \n<b>a</b> Original design \nWilliam Morris, <i>c</i>.1872 \nPencil and watercolour, 90.3 x 64.1 cm \nWilliam Morris Society, Kelmscott House, London (D3) \n\n<b>b</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Jasmine, 31</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, first issued 1872 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 68.6 x 50.0 cm \nV&A (E.475-1919) Given by Morris & Co. \n\nThis is a fine example of the design structure perfected by Morris in the early 1870s. The background is an all-over pattern of hawthorn leaves, blossoms and branches on a disguised vertical meander. A scrolling tracery of jasmine, delicately but clearly defined, provides the foreground. The two layers are so well integrated that, from a distance, the paper gives an effect of subtle broken colour. One of the firm\u2019s earliest printed textiles was <i>Jasmine Trail</i> and Morris\u2019s first known fabric design was <i>Jasmine Trellis</i> (cat.no.M.38). Both are, however, much less complex designs than the paper. \nThere are three other known drawings for this wallpaper: one is at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and two are in the Berger Collection. \n\nThe many deletions and substitutions in the printing record indicate initial difficulties with the pattern and it appears that the number of blocks used for its production was reduced from twenty to eleven. Attempts made in 1874 to print it in wash colours seem to have been unsuccessful. \n\nThe Burne-Jones\u2019s used <i>Jasmine</i>, probably in this colour-way, in the drawing-room at The Grange, their house in Fulham (see fig.86).' \n\n'cat.no.M.38' refers to V&A object T.70-1953.",
