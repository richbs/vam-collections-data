            "public_access_description": "Leslie Hurry was equally acclaimed as one of Britain's most famous surrealist painters and a major theatrical designer.   His designs were superb drawings and gave the costume makers information not only about the physical, but the emotional, state of the individual character.  An opera, like Forza del destino had a large chorus, none of whom could be dressed alike, and could call for as many as a hundred different designs, from kings to peasants.\nAlthough theatre designs are often considered works of art and are sought after by museums and private collectors, their artistic worth or decorative qualities are secondary to whether they 'work' on stage.  The success of a costume design cannot be judged until it is translated into fabric, texture and decoration by the costume makers and seen as part of the whole stage picture.  Some designers are very knowledgeable about costume making and produce very detailed designs, with notes on fabrics and making techniques, others create an 'atmospheric' drawing, which gives the feeling of the costume, and they then either work closely with the costume maker to realise their concept or have trusted makers who know their work and can create the effects they have in mind.",
