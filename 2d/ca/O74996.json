Their wealthy owners engaged in few commercial exchanges requiring cash although embroidered bags were sometimes used as 'gift wrapping' for a gift of coin.  Some served as 'sweet bags', filled with dried flowers or scented powder, to perfume clothing and deter moth.  The attachment of a pincushion to this purse suggests that it might have been used as a sewing kit.  An X-ray of the pincushion reveals a needle, lost in its depths.  \n\nBoth are made of an even, plain-weave linen, which has been completely covered with silk floss, silver-gilt and silver file threads.  These are stitched over every intersection of the warp and weft, in tent stitch and single-stage stitch, covering the ground.  This form of decoration, was also used on furnishings such as curtains, bed hangings, table carpets, chairs and cushion covers.\n\nThe decoration of this purse and pincushion is identical to a knife case with two knives, T.55-1954, acquired at the same time, and all three may have been made as a set.  Seventeenth-century inventories often list purses, knives and pincushions together, indicating that these were essential accessories for both men and women.",
