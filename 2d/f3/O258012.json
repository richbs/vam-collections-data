            "historical_context_note": "Warner & Sons was founded in 1870 as a silk-weaving company in Spitalfields, London by Benjamin Warner and became one of the best-known producers of high quality domestic woven and printed furnishings.  In 1993 Warner's launched an exciting new range at Chelsea Design Week by young British designers Neil Bottle, Paul Simmons and Alistair McAuley.\n\nNeil Bottle graduated from Middlesex Poly in 1989 in Printed Textiles.  He has been extremely successful with his hand-printed and painted scarves, ties, waistcoats, wallhangings and cushions and regularly exhibited at the Chelseas Crafts Fair.  His work is available through all the main crafts outlets and also through major retailers such as Liberty.  \n\nThe designer has had to adapt to the rigours of exact repeats for mechanised production and toned down their colours and images to suit a mass market.  Together with Paul Simmons and Alistair McAuley, Bottle's talent was spotted at a very early stage by Eddie Squires, Design Director at Warners and the success of the collection was due in equal part to his skill and commerical sense.  The mass produced range forms a fascinating counterpoint to the individual works of the designers.",
