Spert was also commander of the vessel 'Harry Grace de Dieu', and it is possible that the ships depicted on the coat of arms were originally modelled on his ship.  Trinity House developed into the chief pilotage authority of the United Kingdom, controlling the lighting and marking of British coastal waters. \n\nThis carving is said to have come from some former almshouses of the corporation in Deptford. The original polychrome decoration was even brighter, with naturalistic colouring for the four seascapes.  The current paint dates from the 19th century.",
