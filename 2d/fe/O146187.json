The upper and lower borders are delineated by two chevron bands.  The bottom border has downward pointing pink flowers.  The top border has pink flower heads in profile alternating with pink and blue ones.  The two side borders have pink-petalled flowers outlined in dark blue.  There is a solid blue line either side of the side border.  The top and the side borders include a green zigzagged line.\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in dark blue and yellow with details in pink and white. There are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark blue ground with pink cross within a dark blue octagon in the centre of a tear drop shaped flower, a three-petalled pink blossom outlined in blue and an iris-like flower in blue, dark blue, pink and mauve.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] small flower heads pointing in every direction.  At regular intervals there is a triangular pink flower with dark blue details on a thick upright stem. [b] diamond shaped section; floral spray in a small brown vase alternating with a spray in a small light blue and dark blue vase.\nThreads: 2S silk: red, yellow, mauve, orange, white, green, light blue, blue, dark blue, pink, beige.",
