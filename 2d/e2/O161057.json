Their names in Latin are handwritten on a narrow band painted to look like a scroll above their heads. These men were the among the closest disciples of Jesus Christ. The word 'apostle' means one who was sent out to spread the Christian message.\n\nThe subject of the Apostles was a stock form of decoration used by potters in the small town of Creussen from 1620s onwards and many dated examples exist. Creussen was in the German region of Franconia when this particular version was made in 1672 but in 1815 it became part of Bavaria. Each figure was moulded in relief and then applied to the stoneware surface before being coated with a dark brown iron wash and salt-glazed. Afterwards the main decorative features were picked out in overglaze enamels and gilding was added. The tankard is mounted in pewter.",

The Weckherlin Collection was acquired by a fellow Belgian, the art dealer, publisher and patron of the Pre-Raphaelite  painters, Jean Joseph Ernest Theodore Gambart who came to  London in 1840 and took British citizenship in 1846.  He  displayed the collection in his London house \"Rosenstead\",   Avenue Road, near Regent's Park, until a gas explosion caused him to reconsider the long-term security of his remaining pots -  he sold 62 objects to the Museum for \u00a3800. The tankard was then worth \u00a34.5s.\n\nThe town of Creussen was in the German region of Franconia when the tankard was made. Since 1815, Creussen has been in Bavaria. The subject of the Apostles was a stock form of decoration for the potters of this town from 1620s onwards and dated examples can be found is a number of museum collections.",
