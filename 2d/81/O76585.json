The broad border contains a hooked diamond with a highly stylised plant between. This has a small square centre and leaves at each corner. A small area of plain web survives at each end.\n\nWARP: white wool; Z2S; depressed; 24 threads per inch (94 per dm)\n\nWEFT: brown wool; Z-spun, unplied, 2 parallel threads per shoot; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 12 knots per inch (44 per dm)\n\nPILE: wool; 5 colours: red, dark blue, purple, black, white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 threads; 144 knots per sq. inch (2068 per sq. dm)\n\nSIDE FINISH: 4 cords overcast with brown wool\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: missing but 2\" (2 cms) plain weave with some evidence of purple weft followed by white and then red.  Upper: missing but evidence of plain weave with dark brown weft.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark blue ground with 16 bands each of 7 motifs, either 3 or 4 stylised rosettes and 3 or 4 purple octagons with red centres.  The diagonals achieved by these major motifs are countered by the placing of a small white diamond with red or purple centre in every interstice, creating strong vertical and horizontal lines.\n\nMain border: red ground with dark blue/mottled black hooked lozenge and within it an 8-petalled red and purple flowerhead.  A pair of narrow stems ending in 2 stylised leaves frames the lozenge and each unit is separated by a quartered square.\nInner border: dark blue ground with the same 2-coloured flowerheads as the main border, bordered by a narrow purple-ground stripe with small red floret.\nOuter border: pseudo-reciprocal running dog pattern, purple on \none side and the other is a narrow dark blue hook with red base.\nOutermost border: black ground with diagonal red blocks.\nNote: where black has been used, it is corroded.\nAsymmetrical knot, open to the left; 144 knots per sq. in (2,068 per sq. dm).",
