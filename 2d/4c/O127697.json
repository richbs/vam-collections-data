The yellow printed silk leaf was applied to a sheet of magenta card and designed to fold in three to make the folder.  Silk and satin playbills and programmes were commonly produced in the 18th and 19th centuries to mark special evenings at the theatre, often lavishly fringed and sometimes even illustrated with an engraved image, but were rarely produced after the in the mid 20th century.\n\nThe wallet features the royal crest and Latin motto for the theatre, a resum\u00e9 of the story of the opera, and credits for the singers and members of the technical staff.  It also notes that the programme was printed in Edinburgh by Messrs R. and R. Clark Ltd., on silk manufactured by Messrs Winterthur Silks Ltd., of Dunfermline. This was the manufacturer who in 1947 wove the silk for the wedding dress of Queen Elizabeth II designed by Sir Norman Hartnell, using silk from Chinese silkworms.",
