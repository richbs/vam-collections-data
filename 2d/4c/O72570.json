Features boldly hatched and stippled in brown and sanguine, shaded with grey and touches of blue and black and with white highlights in the eyes, on a pale carnation ground; hair in dark brown wash, lightened with pale gouache and with some lining in darker colour; robe in brown wash, hatched and shaded with darker colour and with the lights in pink-grey gouache; cuffs and cravat in white and grey over brown; curtain in red wash, worked over with darker colour and the lights in pink; background to the right a pale brown wash cross-hatched in darker colour and lightened above in pale gouache; the sculpture modelled in grey-brown gouache, shaded with darker colour, over pale brown wash; on vellum stretched over oak panel. \n\n<u>Frame: </u>Eighteenth-century ebony-faced mitred frame, rising from straight outer edges (the upper surface of which is gilded) through a series of cyma recta and thread mouldings to an emphatic bolection, before descending through a small bolection and cyma recta (the latter gilded) forming the upper surface of a rebate which holds the flat modern glass. The ebony is mounted on an oak carcase with lapped joints, and the whole backed with modern, black-painted fibreboard, which once held a glazed back covering the various old labels (see above). The hanger is a simple brass ring in a folded brass clip nailed to the carcase.",

            "public_access_description": "This is a copy in miniature after the large-scale self-portrait in oils by Peter Lely of 1660 (in the National Portrait Gallery, London). It was an established practice in the 17th century to copy in miniature works by Old Masters. Charles Beale the younger was the son of Mary Beale, the oil painter, who was friends with Sir Peter Lely. His father, Charles Beale the elder, was retired from the Patents Office and lived the life of a connoisseur and collector. He was keen that his son should learn to paint, probably not for economic reasons but to acquire the knowledge and skill to be able to converse with other members of cultivated society. At the age of 17 the younger Charles was sent to learn to paint miniatures with Thomas Flatman, another friend of the Beale family. \n\nThis miniature was painted only two years later and is signed \u2018CB\u2019. This work is different in technique to other works by Beale the younger, but it is attributed to him despite the fact that Beale the elder had also learned miniature painting from Flatman. Young Charles also spent time sketching in Lely's studio, but this copy was probably after a version of the self-portrait that hung in the Beale family home in London.",

And on the vellum wrap-over: Mr LiIly this inscription identified by the later nineteenth-century hand (see below) as <i>Sir Robt Walpole</i>'s writing. Another early ink inscription, also on the vellum wrap-over, deleted. A nineteenth-century ink inscription on the sealing paper: <i>Bought at Strawberry Hill Sale 1842 - 17 gs</i>;  and in a later hand: <i>Copy of a portrait of Sir Peter Lely (probably by himself)</i> by L. Cross: 1679 .Also a label cut from BFAC 1888 exhibition, relating to the Lely self-portrait, then in the possession of the Earls of' Iersey and attributed to William Dobson; inscribed in the late hand (above): <i>The same subject.</i> \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Eighteenth-century ebony-faced mitred frame, rising from straight outer edges (the upper surface of which is gilded) through a series of cyma recta and thread mouldings to an emphatic bolection, before descending through a small bolection and cyma recta (the latter gilded) forming the upper surface of a rebate which holds the flat modern glass. The ebony is mounted on an oak carcase with lapped joints, and the whole backed with modern, black-painted fibreboard, which once held a glazed back covering the various old labels (see above). The hanger is a simple brass ring in a folded brass clip nailed to the carcase. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> According to the inscriptions, Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Or ford; acquired by Horace Walpole as his father's heir in 1744-5, and presumably brought to Strawberry Hill when Horace Walpole acquired the house in 1747. Bequeathed in 1797 with the house and contents to Mrs Damer, who subsequently resigned the whole property to Elizabeth, Dowager Countess Waldegrave; thence by descent to George, 7th Earl Waldegrave; his sale 6 May 1842, lot 65 (\u2018a very beautiful miniature'), bought Gosling, 7 gns; subsequently in the possession of Vere,Viscountess Galway, and sold by her, Christie's 14 July 1905, lot 57, (attributed to 'Lawrence Crosse'): bt Durlacher \u00a353.11s., from whom purchased by the Museum, 1905. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Geffrye Museum 1975-6, no. 50; BM 1987, no. 169. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 39 (unknown British painter, <i>Portrait of a Sculptor</i>); Goulding 1914-15 pp. 16, 122 (as by Beale); Foster 1914-16, vol.

An immediately post-Restoration image of the artist as a heroic and dynamic figure, the Self-Portrait seems to recall intentionally the imagery of professional artists established by Van Dyck in the <i>Iconographia</i>.\n\nThe authorship of this copy by Beale was first publicly stated by Goulding, who had worked on the head and shoulders version at Welbeck. The monogram is of the type identified by Vertue as belonging to the younger Beale, but the lower loop of the <i>C</i>, which should make the lower part of the <i>B</i>, is slightly broken in this example, which makes the B look more like a P. The consequent reading of the monogram as that of 'Lawrence Crosse' (i.e., Peter Cross) must have been reinforced by the evident stylistic similarity between this and some of Peter Cross's early works. That such a small break in the calligraphy could cause confusion serves also to emphasise the common source of all these marks in Lely's <i>PL </i> monogram. \n\nAnother copy, head and shoulders only, is at Welbeck Abbey, also attributed by Goulding to the younger Beale. A drawing formerly attributed to Mary Beale but now (1) correctly assigned to Charles Beale is in the British Museum. It is thought to be the common original of the Welbeck Abbey and the V&A copies, but since the Beale parents evidently owned the original- 'Mr Lilly's own picture HL', (2) presumably  both the miniature copies would have been done from the painting rather than from an intermediate drawing. \n\n1 Croft-Murray and Hulton 1960, vol.
