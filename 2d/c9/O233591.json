Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nSigurd Bronger (born 1957) trained in Oslo and at the Vakschool Schoonhoven in the Netherlands. Collage often features in his work. In this case photographic portraits of four RCA students are held within the pendant or miniature case. His irreverent approach to materials may be seen in the cotton wool which is set like a gem into the lid.",
