This watercolour \u2013 which is  \nprobably the one entitled <i>A Farm Yard  \nNear Risborough, Bucks</i> that was exhibited  \nat the Old Water-Colour Society in 1846  \n(201) \u2013 is the most finished composition to  \nhave been worked up from these studies.  \nPalmer made a replica of it, a practice  \nthat he sometimes engaged in when he  \ndid not want to lose a composition on  \nsale. A.H. Palmer records that the work  \n\u2018used to hang on the wall, Furze Hill  \nHouse, in a picked position\u2019 (V&A 1926). \n \nThe picture is one of the elaborately  \ncomposed English rural scenes that  \nPalmer continued to produce in the  \n1840s alongside his continental subjects.  \nUnlike his later idylls, these focus more  \non daytime activities rather than evening  \nor nocturnal effects. This scene shows  \na young girl driving a herd of sheep  \ntowards a farmyard where a man is  \nopening the gate. The title, \u2018Entering the  \nFarm Yard\u2019, given on the card that was  \nonce attached to the drawing before the  \npicture was mounted, would suggest that  \nPalmer originally intended this event to  \nbe the picture\u2019s main theme. He was  \nprobably aiming to rival such popular  \npainters of rustic genre scenes in the  \n1840s as William Collins and William  \nMulready. \n \nWV\u2019\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.
