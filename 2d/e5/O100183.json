            "public_access_description": "In the mid eighteenth century glass coolers would have been used in order to rinse and cool wine glasses on the dining tables of wealthy people.  They would have been filled with iced water and whenever the diner seated nearby wanted a drink, he or she would motion to a servant standing behind their chair.  He would bring a tray with a glass of wine and a carafe of water as wine was usually drunk diluted at this time.  After the glass was emptied it could be placed in the cooler to be 'refreshed' until another drink was required.\n\nIn the exhibition catalogue Daily Pleasures: French Ceramics from the MaryLou Boone Collection, (2012, Los Angeles Country Museum of Art), Antoinette Fa\u00ff-Hall\u00e9 explains that the grotesque animal decoration found on pieces made at the Moustiers fa\u00efence manufactory of Ol\u00e9rys-Laugier is unique.  They can however be seen as part of the continuing popular French tradition of grotesques best known from the designs of the seventeenth century artists Jean B\u00e9rain and Jacques Callot. The basic outline of the designs would have been applied to the surface using a poncif, a paper pattern on which the outlines would have been drawn and pierced with tiny holes.  By rubbing charcoal over these perforations, the design could be positioned in exactly the right place.\n\nMoustiers is a small town perched on a mountainside in Provence in the south of France.  In the 18th century it was no more than a village, but due to the ready availability of clay, wood and water, it was home to two important fa\u00efence potteries and other more minor ones, less well-known today.  In the late 17th century Pierre Cl\u00e9rissy founded the most important dynasty of potters who worked there, but the other pottery of note was founded by Joseph Ol\u00e9rys in 1737.  Ol\u00e9rys (1697-1749), had worked in Marseilles as a potter and as a pottery dealer.  In  1726 or 1727 he left to work for the Count of Aranda at Alcora in Spain where he set up a manufactory.  He mastered the art of producing high temperature colours, grand feu, there, however after ten years he was forced to leave by the native potters, jealous of his success.  He returned to the south of France and went into partnership with his brother-in-law Jean-Baptiste Laugier to found a pottery at Moustiers.  The OL mark found sometimes on their wares is a combination therefore of both their initials.  On this glass cooler, the mark has been painted on the flag held aloft by the grotesque figure riding backwards on the dog-like animal on one side of the vessel.",

Los Angeles Country Museum of Art, October 2012- March 2013, catalogue editor Elizabeth A. Williams, with contributions by Meredith Chilton, Antoinette Fa\u00ff-Hall\u00e9, Catherine Hess, Victoria Kastner and Elizabeth A. Williams. See nos. 28 and 29, pp 146-149 for three further examples, including a pair, no. 29 with similar decoration of grotesques in a palette of green and ochre. The catalogue entry for the first of the glass coolers (28) by Antoinette Fa\u00ff-Hall\u00e9 make the following points: high class tablewares were produced by the Proven\u00e7al fa\u00efence manufactories because there was a market for such objects among the local aristocracy of this wealthy region; one did not serve oneself to beverages that stood ready on the dining table, when a diner wanted to drink he or she asked a servant: a tray with a glass of wine and a carafe of water would be brought (wine was usually diluted). To refresh the glasses they were dipped bowl first into a 'rafra\u00eechissoir' or cooler that was sometimes large enough to hold several glasses. Others, like this one, had room for only one glass and the notch in the rim served to secure the stem of a glass once it had been plunged upside down in the water.\nCommissaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, M.
