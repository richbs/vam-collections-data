Cripplegate Institute had a well-equipped theatre which was working in the early 1900s, originally including backcloths and wing borders.  Some of the grid ironmongery and other bits of equipment were marked 'Britannia' so the donor felt it possible that the stage machinery also originated from the Britannia Theatre in Hoxton, which operated from 1841 until 1923 when it became a cinema.",
