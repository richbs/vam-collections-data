It can hardly have been a long one, since his letters to Fisher at the time show that he was busy in London moving into his new house on Charlotte Street, and completing his unfinished work.  In his letter of 6 December to Fisher (Beckett, VI, p. 106) he mentions the altar-piece commissioned from him for the church at Manningtree and it is possible that he may have drawn No. 253 [814-1888] on a quick visit connected with that business.",
