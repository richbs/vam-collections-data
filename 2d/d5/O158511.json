The leather (probably cow, and not textured) is now a dark brown colour but where it has not discoloured the original rich red colour can be seen. The lid does not extend the full depth of the chest, but its rear edge is inset, and held on three external, strap hinges concealed under the leather. The exposed edges of the lid have a projecting lip that meets, in closing, a reciprocal rebate on the chest. The flat top of the lid is ornamented with studs forming the monogram of William III and Mary II, surmounted by a crown. On the front corners of the chest and lid are 6 pierced, brass angle reinforcers (squiers). The ends decorated with straight rows of studs, and the back plain. At each end is a wrought metal (apparently brass) bail handle.\nWith a steel key of late 17th century date.\n\nOf nailed construction. The ends are vertically grained, and at drawer level they are faced inside with horizontally grained thin boards to support the dust board which is housed in a groove cut into the ends. The bottom consists of front to back boards nailed up into the front and back. Underneath the bottom, along the front, middle and back are three battens forming sled feet. The drawers of softwood, nailed, with front to back boards nailed up.\n\nThe main cavity is lined with plain white paper, apparently applied over marbled paper (of which traces survive on the exterior). Underneath the main cavity are with two drawers, one above the other, fitted with pierced, brass lock plates, and two ring handles on pierced floral back-plates, with traces of a textile (possilby silk) behind the upper drawer PR handle. The drawers are lined with plain paper but traces of marbled paper survive on the drawer undersides, suggesting that the drawers may have been lined in the same way.\n\nSome old leather patches have been applied to the surface, and there is evidence of old consolidation.",

High quality textured leather from Russia (known as \u2018Russia  leather\u2019) made them lightweight and water-resistant. Decorative studding and conspicuous  mounts were used for the purposes of identification and to show the high\nstatus of the owner. Originally the leather was a rich red colour (as remains visible on the underside of the lid), and the brass mounts and studs were golden. The original effect would have been much brighter and more impressive than today.",
