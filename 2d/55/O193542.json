It commemorates the 14th Cross of Liberty Day, which was celebrated in Adavere in 1989 - the 70th anniversary of the creation of the Cross.\n\nThe Cross of Liberty was instituted on Estonian Independence Day, 24 February 1919, in order to \"give recognition for services in the Estonian War of Independence\" when Estonia achieved the independence from Russia. It is therefore a powerful symbol of the Estonian fight for freedom. \n\nThe Cross of Liberty Day has been celebrated since 1929 to honour the chevaliers of the Cross. The tradition was interrupted in 1940 when the Soviet Union occupied Estonia. It was symbolically reinstated in 1988 when the movement for regaining Estonian independence was growing. \n\nThe Cross of Liberty has three classes: first class \u2013 for individual courage demonstrated on the front, second class \u2013 for military services and third class \u2013 for civil services. Each class has three ranks. The cross featured on the poster is first class, rank one. \n\nThe Cross of Liberty was designed by Nikolai Triik and manufactured at the French company Maison Arthus-Bertrand. It is composed of a distinctive \u2018cross potent\u2019 with crossbars at the four ends of the cross. The central motif depicts an \u2018E\u2019 for Estonia and a flexed arm brandishing a sword. The V formed by the arm stands for \u2018Vabariigi\u2019 (\u2018Republic\u2019).",
