This was achieved by applying different coloured slips (liquid clay) to an earthenware body. The slips could then be worked through, such as dragging a comb, to create marbled patterning. In appearance marbled wares are similar to earlier agate-ware. Agate-ware involved wedging different coloured clays together to form the body. The patterning was therefore solid throughout rather than being a 'marbled' covering. Agate-ware was more time-consuming and expensive to perfect than surface 'marbling' and was mainly produced during the early to mid eighteenth century, whereas marbling continued into the nineteenth century.",
