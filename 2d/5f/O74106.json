These, together with the evidence of a complete tomb lined with such slabs excavated in the north-western province of Gansu, show that the slab probably originated in Jin dynasty territory. This state was established by a different ethnic group from the majority Han Chinese. The complete set of slabs probably depicted popular Confucian tales later known as the 'Twenty Four Exemplars of Filial Piety'. It was during this period that this set of tales was being structured, and it often inspired tomb decoration. Support for Confucian values was important to ruling groups not themselves Han Chinese, striving to cement their legitimacy as holders of the Mandate of Heaven.",
