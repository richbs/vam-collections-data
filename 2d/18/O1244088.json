            "public_access_description": "The Designers Guild was founded in 1970 by the then husband and wife team of Robin and Tricia Guild.  Tricia and designer Chris Hasey produced their first range of textiles based on a collection of Indian hand-printed fabrics.  Launched at the opening of their first shop on the King's Road, Chelsea in November 1971, the collection was an instant success and was extended with co-ordinating wallpapers and furniture.  The Designers Guild brand has since become synonymous with colourful soft furnishing, accessory and lifestyle products which are marketed internationally.\n\nSince the opening of her first retail establishment, Tricia Guild has reworked traditional designs and motifs in many creative ways, combining texture and pattern in bright, modern colourways.  Her successful experimentation with scale and painterly approach to design produces fabrics with amazing depth, richness and vitality.  The Designers Guild range includes floral and geometric fabrics, plains, checks and stripes, jacquards, silks and velvets, which appeal to both the domestic and contract market.\n\nTricia Guild has received several awards, including the 2003 International Elle Decoration Design Award for best fabric design.  She has written numerous books on colour and design and in 2008 was awarded an OBE for services to interior design.\n\nPerrault is available in nine colourways and is suitable for curtains and soft furnishings.",
