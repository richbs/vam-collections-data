The groom was a Buddhist and his bride a Roman Catholic and the wedding was conducted at the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Farm Street, London. Lucas purchased the suit from Mr. Fish, a fashionable shop which had opened the year before in London's Clifford Street. It was owned by the tailor-designer Michael Fish who had formerly worked as neckwear buyer for Turnbull & Asser.\n\nMichael Fish became well known for his flamboyant and unconventional designs influenced by hippie culture. He used transparent and vibrantly coloured fabrics and designed mini-skirts and kaftans for men. This suit represents another aspect of 1960s menswear which drew on historical British tailoring. The frock coat's stand collar and lapels and defined shoulders and waist were designed to create a modern version of the Regency dandy.",
