The design shows an overall pattern of scroll-framed lobed panels, with curving sides and pointed ends, set with interlaced formal flower-headed scrolls appearing as gilded against a ground of dark green, the areas between the lobed panels filled with similar decoration of larger size set against a black ground.The panel is just over half the size recorded in 1856.",

            "public_access_description": "This leather panel was one of a set of three which the Museum bought from the Paris International Exhibition in 1855. The panels show different stages in production, from the first moulded design, with no colour, to intermediate states, with the moulded decoration covered partly in metal foil which is varnished to give the effect of gold leaf, and partly with colourful paints and varnishes.\n\n'Gilt leather' as it is generally called, was first produced in the 17th century but was fashionable again in the 1850s and was produced in a variety of historic styles.  The firm of Jacques Michel Dulud, who may have made these panels, exhibited at several international exhibitions, including the Great Exhibition in London in 1851.  The firm was best known for making panels in the Gothic or Renaissance style (as here) but could also produce good imitations of 17th and 18th-century styles.",
