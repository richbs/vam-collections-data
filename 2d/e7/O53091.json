The carved decoration of a harp and shamrocks on the card table was typical of the rest of the furniture which was designed and decorated to illustrate the history, antiquities, animals and vegetation of Ireland. The suite included an upholstered armchair, a pole screen, a tea poy, a wine-table, a chair and a wine cooler. The wine cooler is now in the collection of the National Trust of New South Wales, Sydney.",

Several Irish firms, including Arthur Jones, Dawson Bell of Belfast, and J. Curran of Lisburn,  exhibited examples of furniture made from native timbers such as bog yew or bog oak. These pieces were decorated with national emblems, such as harps, shamrocks and the Irish wolf-hound, as well as with motifs illustrative of Irish history, some copied from drawings of original relics, such as horns and bronze reaping hooks.",
