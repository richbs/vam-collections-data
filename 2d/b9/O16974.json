            "public_access_description": "William Morris was an English designer, writer and activist.  In 1861, Morris founded his own firm, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., which became Morris & Co., in 1875. As both a designer and theorist for the arts, his importance cannot be easily overestimated, and his influence continues.  This wallpaper is printed in distemper colours on paper.  It was printed by the wallpaper manufacturer, Jeffrey & Co. for Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.\n\nThis wallpaper was manufactured in 1873-1874 and seven years afterwards, Morris asked in his publication Some Hints on Pattern Designing, whether it is 'not better to be reminded however simply of the close vine trellises which keep out the sun [...] than having to count day after day a few sham-real boughs and flowers, casting sham-real shadows on your walls, with little hint of anything beyond Covent Garden in them?'  This wallpaper is an example of such a 'close vine trellis'. By 1890, Morris & Co.charged \u00a30.40 to \u00a30.50 per roll for 'Vine' wallpaper.",

Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.8</b> <i>Vine</i> wallpaper \n<b>a</b> Original design \nWilliam Morris, <i>c</i>.1873 \nPencil and watercolour, 81.5 x 65.2 cm \nInscribed with instructions \nV&A (E.1074-1988) \n\n<b>b</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Vine, 50</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, first issued 1874 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 81.5 x 65.2 cm \nV&A (E.485-1919) Given by Morris & Co. \nNOT ILLUSTRATED \n\n<b>c</b>\nWallpaper sample, <i>Vine, 80</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, this colourway first issued 1875 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper and oil colours on foiled and lacquered crape-embossed paper, 94.0 x 48.5 cm \nWilliam Morris Society, Kelmscott House, London (WMS/WP/1/138) \n\nLike <i>Jasmine</i> this too uses the \u2018layered\u2019 format. The background of stylised willow leaves is overlaid and interwoven with a vertically meandering slender vine stem bearing, in almost circular scrolls, bunches of grapes and groups of leaves. The central portion of the design, a complete repeat, is fully worked and coloured and the beginnings of the adjoining repeats are clearly traced in. Notes, in Morris\u2019s hand, give instructions on the order of printing from the blocks. \n\nAfter publication as an ordinary distemper print, <i>Vine</i> was very soon brought out on a gold crape-embossed ground, a material which had earlier appeared in Jeffrey\u2019s own range, but which the firm was now using for the first time. The gold, glimpsed through the deep greens, is reminiscent of the firm\u2019s early painted furniture. It demonstrates the move into richer wallpaper effects and, at 40s. a roll, was extremely expensive; the ordinary distemper print cost 12s. \n\n<i>Willow</i>, issued in the same year, is a simple pattern derived from the backprint of <i>Vine</i>.'",
