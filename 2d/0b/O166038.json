Kui Xing is the chief star in the Big Dipper constellation, but he is also called God of Literature, and worshipped by candidates to the imperial examinations. Dreaming of Kui Xing in the night before the exams was considered an auspicious sign.\n\nThe god is often represented holding a writing brush in his right hand and a scroll or a tablet in his left hand; here, a trapezoidal grain measure is balanced in his upturning left foot. The measure (dou) represents a container for wisdom and inspiration, but also holds an astronomical meaning: dou is the Chinese name for the Dipper, a part of the Big Dipper constellation.",
