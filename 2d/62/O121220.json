By the first half of the 19th century it was the main centre of production for small silver items in the region.  The silversmiths specialised in popular and devotional jewellery.  They sold their work at markets throughout the Alpine region, and at major international trade fairs all over Europe.  \n\nJewellery set with Hirschgrandln (deer\u2019s teeth) was very popular as a hunting souvenir throughout the Alpine region in the 19th century, and is still being made today.  This ring is typical of traditional rings from that area.  It is marked on the inside of the shank with the unicorn\u2019s head mark of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.",
