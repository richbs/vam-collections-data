            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis detailed design is highly finished and executed in detail in a way that illustrates that fineness which can be achieved in the technique of painting on earthenware, given a first firing, which, after glazing and a second firing, produced tin-glazed earthenware known as maiolica.  Poynter inscribed on the design 'the brown lines mark the divisions of the tiles'.  This grid of lines enables the viewer to imagine how the design might look as a panel of tiles which would not be the case if the design were just a picture without the visual guide that the superimposed grid provides.  This design could thus have served as a presentation drawing to Sir Henry Cole, the Director of the South Kensington Museum, giving a good idea of how such a panel might look in the Refreshment Roo of this Museum\n\n\n\nPlace\nThe Refreshment Rooms were opened during 1868. They consisted of three rooms, the central room, now known as the Gamble Room,  which has a semi-circular northern side, following the plan of the Lecture Theatre above it; and a smaller, square room on either side, the Grill Room to the east and the Green Dining Room to the west, now known as the Poynter Room.  Poynter designed the whole of this latter room between 1866 and 1874.  The tile panel for which this is the design was made and can be seen above the original stove, to the left side in the Poynter Room. \n \n People\n Poynter was Director of the National Art Training School and women artists from the school painted his designs onto blank tiles supplied by Minton, the ceramic manufacturer.  Henry Scott, a Royal Engineer officer employed on building the new Museum, compiled a list of the women he was employing as porcelain painters.  They were Amy E. Black, Miss Walker, Miss Judd, Miss Earle, Miss Hall, Miss Cambridge, who were all paid at the rate of 6d an hour, except Amy Black who received 9d.  It is possible that these women were the names of the women painters on ceramics who painted parts of this design onto the blank tiles.",
