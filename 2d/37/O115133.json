Moser, the Keeper of the Royal Academy and the leading gold chaser of his generation, was asked to chase models of the designs proposed for the gold and silver medals of the Academy.  This model is the reverse of the gold medal.  The model was one of three models for the medals which Moser exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1770.  The models were intended to be followed by the engraver cutting the dies for striking the medals, a task undertaken by Thomas Pingo.\n\nThe scene of Minerva directing a  youth to the Temple of Fame was proposed for the medal by Edward Penny.  It appears from the Council Minutes of the Royal Academy that the design may have been modified or approved by Giovanni Battista Cipriani, who was voted a silver cup for his work on  the design of the medals and the diploma letter.\n\nThe Council resolved that the date of 1768, the year of foundation of the Royal Academy, should appear on the medal.   The year 1767 on the model possibly refers to the foundation of a so-called Royal Academy in 1767, a controversial enterprise in which Moser was involved.",
