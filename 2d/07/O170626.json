In the centre foreground is the semi-recumbent figure of the Dead  Christ, supported by the Virgin, who kneels behind, supporting his head with her right  hand and holding his arm with her left. To the right kneels St Mary Magdalen, with her right hand on her breast and a jar of unguent in her left. To the left is St John the Evangelist, with the head turned to the spectator, supporting the right shoulder of Christ. The whole group rests on a shallow base enamelled in dull green. The flesh areas are pigmented throughout, as is the whole surface of the Magdalen, the red cloak of St John the Evangelist, and the red dress of  the Virgin. Enamelled areas comprise the loin-cloth of Christ (white), the cloak of the Virgin (blue with a green lining tied by a yellow strap), her belt (yellow), her coif (white), the robe of  St John the Evangelist (blue), and the lining of his cloak (yellow).",

The figure of Christ, with the hands of St John and the Virgin attached was cut in two to fit into the kiln for firing. The Magdalen was broken during the original firing, probably due to air being trapped in the clay which expanded when heated. This prevented a second firing for the tin-glazing and the figure was therefore painted instead. On acquisition the group was stated to have been 'formerly in a private chapel in Siena.'",
