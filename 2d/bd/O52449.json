This picture was described in the words of a contemporary as having 'a roundness and sweetness which is never sensual.' \nPeople:  William Dobson (1817-1898) had begun as a prolific painter of religious themes, hoping to revive popular interest in them. He went on to paint less weighty subjects, of which this picture is an example. Combining this theme with that of orientalism increased its appeal to the public. From 1842 until 1894 he exhibited many pictures at the Royal Academy.\nSubjects Depicted:  Dobson is not known to have visited the Middle East, and this is a studio work put together with more or less authentic props. The girl wears a turban and a striped silk brocade robe of a type common in Syria in the 19th century, but both were worn by men rather than by women in Arab societies.",
