It is of a type of celadon known as Longquan ware and is closely related to the Guan ware made some 300 kilometres away (see p.44). But while the Guan kilns were only established after the Song court moved to Hangzhou in 1126, those at Longquan had been in production since the third century. The arrival of the Song court and its affluent ministers in the south brought prosperity to Lonquan, as state officials demanded a quality no less refined than Guan ware. To satisfy these important customers the potters improved their products to the extent that the best Longquan wares are almost indistinguishable from Guan pieces. Although all Longquan wares are green-glazed, the varieties of shades and textures are numerous. Their qualities were highly esteemed and Chinese writers compared the subtle variations in green to jade, to young beans and to the sky.\n\nLongquan's success resulted not from imperial patronage but from efficient management. When the Guan kilns ceased production after the collapse of the Song dynasty in 1279, those at Longquan continued to flourish under the new rulers, the Mongols. The kilns were on average 40 metres long and had a firing capacity of up to 10,000 pieces. The volume of Longquan celadons exported overseas can be gauged from the cargo of the 'Sinan wreck', a ship sunk near Korea en route to Japan: 0f the 17,000 ceramics on board, more than half were Longquan wares.\nLiefkes, Reino and Hilary Young (eds.) <u>Masterpieces of World Ceramics in the Victoria and Albert Museum</u>.
