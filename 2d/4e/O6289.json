They were also topical, with their views of the Crystal Palace.  Though made in Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic), their subject matter and  title in English, 'The Industrial Exhibition for 1851', marked them as a souvenir to British customers.\n\nHistorical Associations\nAt the time of the Great Exhibition, Bohemia, for centuries famed for its glass-making, formed part of the vast Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Several Bohemian glass manufacturers exhibited ruby glass in the Austrian Section at the Crystal Palace, but it is not known which, if any of them made these vases.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe vases are stained red by brushing on copper oxide. After firing,  this thin coloured layer is cut away to reveal the clear glass beneath, which has then been wheel-engraved with the images of the Crystal Palace. Until 1840, the Bohemian, Friedrich Egermann (1777-1864), had been the only maker of red-stained glass, having discovered staining with copper in 1832.  After several glassmakers broke into Egermann's workshop to learn the secret, knowledge of the technique quickly passed with them to France, from where, in turn, it was sold to St. Louis.  Soon the technique was practised throughout Europe and America.",
