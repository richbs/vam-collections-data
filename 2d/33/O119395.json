The significance of the aquamanile's shape may therefore relate to Henry the Lion (1129-1195), Duke of Saxony and Bavaria. Perhaps the vessel was made in tribute to him. In addition to this possible regional connection, the lion had a more general signification. It was a popular symbol of lordship and power. This object could have been designed to convey the status and importance of its owner.",
