His original memoirs were written in the early 16th century in his primary language, Turki, and the translation was commissioned by his grandson, the Mughal emperor Akbar, so that the contents could be widely read in his empire. At least seven illustrated copies of the Baburnama have survived, datable to between 1589 and the end of Akbar's life in 1605. This page depictsthree horsemen on a mountain road and is part of an incident which took place in 1525. Babur and a group of men including his son, Humayun, who succeeded him as emperor were encamped near Bagram and were told that a rhinoceros had been seen nearby. As Humayun had never seen one before, they rushed to find it and this illustration shows part of the royal entourage in pursuit of the animal which is not depicted. The painting was probably done in about 1590.",
