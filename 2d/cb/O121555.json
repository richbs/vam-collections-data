The embroidery is in counted stitch in pink, green, white, yellow threads. This kind of embroidered border was in fashion in the 19th century.\n\nThe garment has a hidden press stud front side fastening in the '<i>yi</i>' style, and a hidden zip-fastener in the side seam. It has a high stiffened collar that closes at the front with a hook and eye, caps sleeve and slits at the side (ca. 25 cm). There are bust darts at the front and waist darts at back and front.

            "public_access_description": "The qipao was traditionally the costume of the Manchu people, and the style was adopted by Chinese women from the Qing Dynasty. By the twentieth century the shapes and styles of the traditional dress were changing. One of the adaptations made was to shorten it and tailor it more sharply so that it outlined the contours of the body, allowing freer movement. \n\nThe qipao, or cheongsam as it is also known, became fashionable amongst women, especially those living in urban areas. To some, the qipao was a risqu\u00e9 garment because it exposed female flesh and accentuated the curves of the body. It is often associated with the high life of Shanghai and its glamour, and the style was popularised by cinema and the advertising industry.\n\nThis dress is made from fine, turquoise green wool. It has short sleeves and a stand-up, stiffened collar that closes at the front with a hook and eye. The top of the dress is in the 'apron' style and this shape is decorated with a broad band of counted thread embroidery on a black gauze ground. The embroidery motifs are different flowers in pink with green foliage. Matching bands of embroidery are sewn around the collar and sleeve ends, and diagonally across the corner of the left hem at the front and the right hem at the back. This embroidery is likely to be older than the dress itself. It was originally destined for a more traditional lady's robe of the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.",
