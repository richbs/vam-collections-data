In 1859 Charles Baudelaire suggested with some asperity that photography should stick to recording monuments and abandon any other claims on the attention. Bisson Fr\u00e8res were among the most impressive photographers of French church architecture. Their large-scale works faced competition from cheaper and more popular branches of photography, and after a trade depression in the early 1860s their studio closed in 1864. The prints continued to be issued by another firm in Paris.",
