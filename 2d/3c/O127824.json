            "history_note": "This panel originally formed part of a painted ceiling in Spain, most likely in a domestic setting. Its original setting remains unknown, but after being dismantled, this panel and nine others (Museum Nos: 207 to 216 - 1894) were bought in Paris by M. Stanislas Baron, a dealer-cum-collector, who was based in Rue Grange-Bateli\u00e8re 28 (Paris), and specialised in Medieval Arabic, Spanish and Sicilian textiles. Baron subsequently sold these panels to the South Kensington in May1894 for 100 francs. This item was entered in the Registered descriptions as costing eight shillings, like each of the others in this group.\n\nHistorical significance: Ceilings with painted beams and panels are more often associated with Christian Spain, and this included Catalonia, whose coats of arms are emblazoned on No. 216-1894 of this set. Nevertheless, this panel is an interesting example of Middle Eastern influences, noticeable in the scrolls and stylized treatment of the elephant. Although somewhat crudely executed, it is a good example of the Islamic style of decoration found in interiors of houses even in the predominantly Christian parts of Spain.",

            "historical_context_note": "Ceilings in Christian Spain, during the Middle ages, were often supported by large, decoratively painted beams with painted panels like this example recessed between them. Examples include the ceiling over the cloister of the Monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos, south of Burgos, and the one over the Chapel of Santa Ag\u00fceda in Barcelona. Just as complex geometrical ceilings, supported by box-core pendants and inscribed with Arabic calligraphy, were characteristic of Moorish buildings, those with painted beams and panels were more often owned by Christians, and found in larger and more important rooms.",
