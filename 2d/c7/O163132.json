            "public_access_description": "Numerous small white clay pellets have been carefully applied before firing to this salt-glazed stoneware beer tankard. The pellets contrast pleasingly with the darker background and are a decorative technique characteristic of 18th-century wares from Altenburg, a small town on the border between Saxony and Thuringia in eastern Germany. In this case the main feature of the decorative scheme is a crowned heart containing the three letters 'IHS'. These letters are usually referred to as the \u2018sacred monogram\u2019, being the beginning of the Greek form of the name Jesus. The crowned heart probably symbolises Christ\u2019s divine love and kingship.\n\nMost stonewares made in Saxony and Thuringia were intended for local consumption. However the Lutheran town of Altenburg was one of just two potting centres which sold some of its wares further afield. The pieces were designed to be mounted in pewter and the lid of this tankard is dated 1775 and bears the initials of its owner, \u2018MDS\u2019. The sacred monogram 'IHS' was used by both Lutherans and Roman Catholics so the owner of this tankard might have been a local Lutheran or a Roman Catholic in another German or Central European region. Among other Christian motifs used to adorn Altenburg wares were the Virgin and Child, Christ as the Lamb of God, the Cross sometimes shown with the Crown of Thorns, the Head of Christ surrounded by winged angel heads, as well as Adam and Eve and their Temptation and Expulsion from Eden. Several of these subjects are particularly well-suited to Roman Catholic taste, indicating a non-local market for some Altenburg wares.",
