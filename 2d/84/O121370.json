Samson began in the 1830s, making copies of ceramics in museums and private collections, and replacement pieces for dinner services and sets.  He established his factory in Paris in 1845 producing pieces inspired by and copied from the work of famous factories including Chinese export porcelain, Meissen, S\u00e8vres, Chelsea , Derby and all the major factories of England, France and Germany, as well as tin-glazed earthenware or faience. He claimed to mark all pieces with his own double 'S' mark as well as the mark of the original piece, but in many cases his own mark is missing.\n\nShylock is the Jewish money-lender in Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, who wants to claim the 'pound of flesh' from Antonio that is owed to him by his bond, the agreement he made with with Bassanio when he lent him 3,000 ducats.",
