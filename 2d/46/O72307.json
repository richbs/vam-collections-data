Working more often with sculptures and installations than with paintings, their work is characterised by geometric shapes and compositions and a paring down of form to the simplest of elements. This was a kind of reaction to the excesses of Abstract Expressionism, but nevertheless Marden's work still exhibits traces of the painterly textures and variation found in the latter. This screenprint shows him handling the medium in a very painterly way - brushing the ink directly onto the screens so that earlier layers show through in a slightly uneven way. Around the same time he was creating 'layers' and 'skins' of paint on canvas using a mixture of oil and wax.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Brice Marden (born 1938)</b> \n\n<i>Untitled</i>, 1973 \n\nThough Marden's work of the 1970s is often identified with Minimalism, he actually has little in common with that austere 'industrial' aesthetic and the self-sufficient language of the grid.  A sensual materiality characterizes even his most severe geometric abstractions.  Throughout his career there has been a close correlation between his printmaking and his painting, with experiments in one medium feeding into the other.  As a graduate student at Yale, Marden had followed a course entitled 'Painting, Printing and Drawing', which gave equal emphasis to each medium; in the 1960s he also worked as a printer at the Chiron Press, then run as a screenprinting shop by the artist Steve Poleskie.  However, the specific impetus for Marden's own screenprints came from having seen Jasper Johns' <i>Flag I</i> and <i>Flag II</i>, both made with master screenprinter Hiroshe Kawanishi at Simca Print Artist in New York. \nMarden was particularly impressed by the way in which Kawanishi had managed to create a very painterly surface, quite unlike the uninflected surface that characterized the commercial screenprint.  To achieve this he encouraged artists to draw directly onto the screen with tusche.  Marden adopted this method, painting onto the screens using long vertical strokes, in the same way as he was then applying paint to canvas.  The effect is enhanced by the slightly uneven application on the tusche, which allowed the earlier layers of colour to show through on the surface in places.  In this print the matt opacity on the pigment is the equivalent on the light-absorbing encaustic (oil and wax) that Marden was then using to create an opaque 'skin' on canvas. \nThe composition of this print mirrored, and perhaps inspired, a change in his painting at this time.  Previously his canvases were divided in half again, destabilising the composition and creating a different rhythm.  This division was adopted in <i>Winter Painting</i>, 1973-5 (Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam), and other works from this period.  However, in the paintings the division is physical, with separate canvases that abut one another.  In the print this division is achieved illusionistically by fine lines printed from hand-cut screens.\"",
