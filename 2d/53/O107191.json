One shouldered strapless dress of raw silk, with waist seam and pannelled bodice and skirt; the skirt is wrapped over from left to right and is cut away on a curve at the front, reaching to below the knee at the back.  the low-cut bodice is shaped over the bust and cut on a low curve to the back.  The raw silk is blotch dyed in shades of dark and light greens and blue greens, mauve and pink.  From the back of the left shoulder, across the bust to over the waist and following the curve of the outer skirt front, terminating at the hem on the left on the same line as it began at the shoulder, is a linked line of variously sized stylized 'leaf' motifs in felt, roughly painted silver with touches of purple and iridescent green studs; each leaf is outlined in narrow tubular crin, the inner edge of which is outlined in black; inserted into some of the 'fronds' are lines of graduated oval shiny red plastic bosses.  The bodice is lined with white cotton and has bust forms, the skirt with white raw silk; at the hips is a short tulle underskirt.  The dress fastens down the back with hooks and eyes.",
