It is based on a composition by Moderno of about 1500-5 showing this scene with medallions of the Judgement of Solomon and Achelous. The scene has been adapted from an upright to a horizontal format.\nModerno (Galeazzo Mondella) (1467-1528) is the pseudonym of this goldsmith and medallist active in North Italy and later in Rome. He signed certain pieces of his work with OPUS MODERNI (opus is the Latin term for 'work' - which then means 'work of the modern'). The modern here is referring to the Ancient World, in contrary to the Naturalism of the Gothic. His earliest works may date around 1485-1490, and his earliest dated work is 1490.\nModerno specialised in small bronze plaquettes exploring religious or antique themes, and catered for a clientele of learned humanists.\nHercules (Greek name is Heracles) is one of the most important heroes in Greek mythology and represents the characteristics of masculinity, strength, courage and sexual prowess. He was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, a Theban princess. He is regarded as the embodiment of physical strength and courage.",
