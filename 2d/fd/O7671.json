Each half is padded and the outsides are of orange brushed nylon with the insides of cotton printed in colours to show blue decorated with patterns of carrots. The front half which is the left side when open has a plastic window stitched in at the top and the name Sylvanian Families embroidered on the lower half.  When open, the printed cloth shows curtains, a carrot clock, mirror, umbrella and stand.  White ribbons are attached to the curtains and another white ribbon forms a loop from which the hanger is hung.  The back half which is the right side when open is plain.  When open, the printed cloth shows two beds each with a white cotton lining so figures can be placed in them.\nThe two halves are joined by a small tag and have a velcro fastening to hold them closed.  At the top of both halves are two bright green ribbed nylon ribbons.\n*At the back in the seam are the remains of a white label or tag which probably gave washing details and material information.\n[miniature (size attribute)] Moulded lime green.  It is designed to be hung from a ribbon loop on the left side.\n[Cutout] Photograph of a grey Sylvanian Families rabbit, dressed in pink and white check and white apron; mounted on thickish paper\n[Box] Cardboard printed in colours to show both illustrations and photographs together with the maker's details, trademarks, titles and descriptions.  It is top opening.\n[Bag] Designed to cover the playhouse before use.  Printed on the front in black are warnings about the danger of suffocation (in French and English)",
