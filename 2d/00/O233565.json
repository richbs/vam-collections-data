Their best known single at the time, it reached number six in the charts and was the first to receive any radio airplay, due to seemingly having less controversial content than previous singles. The back cover shows a reverse-colour version of the artwork used in the campaign posters, of two buses featuring the destinations 'Nowhere' and 'Boredom'. This was typical of the Sex Pistols' desire to be seen as being, and representing, angry young men with no purpose or opportunities.\n\nThe design showcases Jamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
