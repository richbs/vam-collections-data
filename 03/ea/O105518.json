The dance covers a range of movements, sometimes gracefully calm, sometimes sprightly and sometimes impassioned hip swinging, making great use of the castanets.  \nWhen Pauline Duvernay danced the Cachucha in London in 1836, she had the greatest success of her career.  The complex rhythms and varied moods of the choreography, plus the personal charm of the performer, enchanted an audience who were growing tired of pure ballet and fascinated by national dances from Spain or Eastern Europe.  Duvernay is wearing the traditional dress of the stage cachucha - Spanish comb and mantilla, fitted bodice and full bell-shaped skirt, with flounces of black lace.  Reports say that the costume was red, but most prints show it as pink.  \nDuvernay retired from the stage in 1837 when she married Stephens Lyne Stephens, supposedly the wealthiest commoner in England.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched. The lithographs produced in London are notable for capturing the personality and style of individual performers in a theatrical setting.  They are a fitting tribute to one of ballet's richest periods. \nIn the days before photography, such lithographs were expensive souvenirs, bought by the individual dancer's admirers.  \nBefore the development of colour printing, the basic black and white prints were hand coloured.  There is often considerable variation from one print to another, both in colour and quality of the work.  The most important souvenir prints, such as this one, would only have been sent out to the best colourists, and it is often very difficult to tell the best hand colouring from early colour printing.  In the days before photography, such lithographs were expensive souvenirs, bought by the individual dancer's admirers.",
