Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, June-September 1970.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'C36\nGeorge Cruikshank (1792-1878) \n<b>Eleven Proofs of the etchings and text, and the music for The Loving Ballad of Lord Bateman, 1839</b>\nEach inscribed with a variant of  <i>Designed Etched and Published by George Cruikshank, 1839</i>. \n\nEach 3<sub>1/2</sub> x 3<sub>1/4\n</sub>9441:1-12\n\nThe little book 'The Loving Ballad of Lord Bateman', 1839, was the last collaboration of Dickens and Cruikshank. Cruikshank had heard a cockney version of this traditional ballad sung outside a public hose, and repeated it to Dickens. Dickens touched it up and added some facetious notes for the published version, which Cruikshank illustrated with a series of jaunty etchings, over which Dickens was unusually enthusiastic. 'You never did anything like those etchings - never.' Henry Burnett noted down the tune hastily, interning to make a fair copy, but Cruikshank felt the crudely-written notes would add to the humour of the pieces. \n\nThackeray also designed illustrations for this ballad, but they were not published in his lifetime.
