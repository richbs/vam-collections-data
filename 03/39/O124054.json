His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Country Wife (1675), a comedy about deceived husbands and unfaithful wives by William Wycherley (1640-1716), provided Messel with one of his first opportunities to design costumes and sets for a \u2018serious\u2019 drama production.   First performed at the Old Vic Theatre, London in 1936, the staging of this play was somewhat controversial, given the immoral subject matter, though the acting and production won critical approval.\n\nMessel adds characteristic touches of bright colour to the charcoal grey interior of Margarey Pinchwife\u2019s bedroom, such as the pink flowers sitting on the window sill.  The things inside the open cupboard, including a hanging pale yellow hat and blue cloth, is painted in a style reminiscent of a seventeenth century Dutch genre painting.",
