He is shown with his characteristic un-cut locks piled up on his head and extending across his shoulders as a <i>jatamukuta</i> (crown of hair).  He stands upon a double lotus base under a triple-umbrella canopy draped with foliage on either side. The lotus petals on the base are carved with petals in alternate postions the two layers seen in other sculptural pieces from Orissa.\n      Two celestial beings on flat discs bearing garlands fly on either side of his head under smaller triple-canopies mounted over heavenly hands holding a drum on the left hand side and a pair of cymbals on the right. The Jina is flanked by two smaller attendant whisk-bearers on either side also on lotus bases. His attribute of a bull sits below his base with two kneeling devotees or donors on either side. The Jina has a flat undecorated nimbus and the attendants too have flat back plates set against an unadorned architectural setting carved in flat planes with two pillars supporting a cornice with triangular finials.",
