The bands of undulating rope design, filled with floral and leaf patterns in a range of stunning colours on a red ground, exemplifies the renowned and uniquely Burmese textile known as acheik-luntaya. This garment would have been worn by a lady of the court either as a tabet (stole) or a yinzi (breast cloth), forming an ensemble when worn with a wrap skirt known in Burma as an hta-mein and jacket known as an ein-gyi.\n\nThe garment dates from the reign of King Thibaw (r. 1878-1885), the last ruler of the Konbaung dynasty. It was found in the apartment of Queen Supayalat, the chief queen of King Thibaw, by the donor's husband, Colonel Pollard, who was a member of the British force that annexed upper Burma in 1885.",
