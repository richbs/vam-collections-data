Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958\n\n<b>Head of a Monk</b> \n1392-1869 Neg L897 \nCanvas, 30.5 x 26.6 cm (12 x 10\u00bd ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nFarr dates this study to about 1841-2, drawing attention to Etty's two visits to a Trappist monastery near Antwerp where he bought a monk's habit for use as a studio accessory. In a letter to his niece of 6 July 1841 quoted by Gilchrist, he saw 'several of the Brotherhood, - each of fine old Picture, - ... very fine studies. I should like to have sketched some of them.' He shows the monk peering from the window of (presumably) his cell, in the manner of a Dutch 17th-century painting. A 'Head of a Monk - a study for the [oan of Arc' was lot 786 in Etty's studio sale at Christie's 13 May 1850.\n \nLIT: <i>Gilchrist</i> II, ppl22-3; <i>Farr</i> no 17, pp91-2, 134\"",
