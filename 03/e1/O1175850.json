Each of the fours side panels are fitted with three horizontal lengths of stainless steel that are bowed in consecutively opposite directions. These cause the series of bamboo strips that run vertically down each of the side panels to undulate in a wave-like pattern, the direction of undulation alternating from one panel to the next.",
