The library was used by designers within Courtaulds and was also available for the use of Courtaulds\u2019 customers. Following the acquisition of Courtaulds by the international corporation Sara Lee and the subsequent change in the business it was decided that the V&A would be the most appropriate location for the collection to enable it to be appreciated and used more fully. The Library was donated to the V&A by Sara Lee Courtaulds in 2001.\n\n(from The Mortons : Three Generations of Textile Creation (exhibition catalogue, V&A, 1973), : Drift was a piece-dyed drapery fabric exploiting the relatively newly available possibilities of staple-fibre rayon spun with irregular slubs to reproduce the effects of silk-noil yarn spun from raw silk waste.",
