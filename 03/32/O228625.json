The field is worked with alternating rows of small blue and pink upright flowering bushes.  The inner corners each echo a quarter of the central medallion.  A band of small flowering bushes with serrated foliage and flowers in different stages of development form the border in alternating light and dark palettes. This border is flanked by two narrow bands of scrolling foliage and delicate flower heads in pink and blue. The edges of these narrow bands delineated by couched lines of black and yellow silk.  The intersection of the narrow border creates squares in the corners, worked with flowers.\nThe braid of black silk thread is wound tightly into bundles by a metal thread [silver strip close S-wound on a yellow silk core].  One quarter of the braid along the lower edge is missing. The silk thread forms a tassle at the centre of the upper edge.\nThe backing is pieced and printed with tiny white flower heads on a mauve ground [the mauve has faded to light brown in places].",
