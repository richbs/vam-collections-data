            "public_access_description": "This ornament formerly belonged to Captain Tristram Charles Sawyer Speedy (1836-1910). It was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by his goddaughter in 1936. Speedy was an army officer and colonial official. In 1860 he travelled to Ethiopia to assist the emperor Tewodros II (Theodore) with military training. Speedy returned in 1868, this time as civilian interpreter to a British military expedition aimed at releasing British subjects held hostage by Tewodros. The expedition ended with the capture of the emperor\u2019s fortress at Magdala, but not before Tewodros had committed suicide. The following death of his wife, Queen Woyzaro Terunesh, left an orphan son, Prince Dejatch Alamayou, to whom the Amharic-speaking Captain became guardian. \n\nThe ornament appears to be a device made to be strung from a belt and contain a substance for personal use. The main part is formed of a silver cone in which the substance would be put and kept in place by means of a filigree cap. When strung, the cone is covered by a filigree sheath which ends in silver conical pendants. The three parts are kept together by means of a black silk cord. It is unclear how Speedy acquired this object, which may have royal connections.",
