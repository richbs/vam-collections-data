The appliqu\u00e9 ornament is executed in shaped pieces of prepared cottons of various tints, coloured woollen fabrics, green velvet, white cotton and silver sequins. The supplementary details are painted in Indian ink and watercolours.\n\nTwo unrelated scenes from different stories are depicted in the central panel. To the left is a Naga-King with his Queen and two ministers. Another courtly pair are shown before him. In the middle and the end sections are scenes from Manohari or Manohara. The action begins on the right, in which Prince Thudanu, the husband of Dway Mai Naw (Manohari), is in conversation with his minister. Behind them another minister hold the heroine's child up to her as she prepares to fly back to her fairy kingdom called Ngwe Taung (Silver Country) to escape being offered up as a sacrificial victim. In the centre, she flies over mountains and is threatened by a belu-kinnara (demon half-human and half bird-like creature). \n\nThe borders of this kalaga are decorated with undulating foliate patterns, small panels containing equestrian figures, and a rich variety of acheik motifs.\n\nThe figures are dressed in the elaborate costumes of the Konbaung Dynasty.",

They grew in popularity from the middle of the 19th century in Burma. This kalaga of red woollen cloth, with an applique design of shaped coloured fabrics (partly painted) and silver sequins, illustrates episodes from the popular Manohari legend. The ornate costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre, themselves relating to those of the Mandalay Court of around 1880. \n\nBritain took control of Burma stage by stage during the 19th century until in 1885 the entire kingdom came under British rule. By this period the extravagantly decorated design of these hangings appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike.",
