They are usually associated with West Africa but were originally created in Europe, particularly Venice, Bohemia and the Netherlands. The history of trade beads dates to the 15th century when Portuguese trading ships arrived on the coast of West Africa to exploit its many resources, including gold, slaves, ivory and palm oil. At that time, beads were a major part of the currency exchanged for people and products. Over the following four centuries millions of beads were traded to Africa and by the 19th century European bead makers were producing a wide variety of designs specifically for the African trade. \n\nThese fancy beads were probably made by 'lampworking' (moulding glass over an oil lamp or torch), a technique which, unlike drawn glass, could be used in small cottage industries. The beads were then finished with gilding, thin trailings and dots of coloured glass.",

Its displays included glass and ceramic ware. Some of the collections were transferred to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1901.\n\nThe donor of the beads was Moses Lewin Levin, a London bead merchant whose import-export business operated from 1839 to 1913. Most of the beads he dealt in appear to be Venetian although in 1898 the Levin Company was listed as an importer of Venetian, Bohemian and German beads. The British Museum has an important collection of glass trade beads (including some on sample cards) acquired in 1865 from Lewin Levin.
