Three 12.50-metre-long, presumably triangulated trusses, \"which were inserted into a ledge at the back of stone architecture, carried the slightly vaulted roof.\" This building represents an example of the unusual combination of wood and stone in the same architectural structure for an Egyptian temple.",
