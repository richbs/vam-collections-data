The frock coat had full skirts, not just tails, and had evolved from the practical woollen coats worn in the British countryside for farming and sporting activities in the eighteenth century. By the 1830s it was the most popular coat for day wear or 'undress' and was available in many different varieties.\n\nIn the 1880s, with its sombre colours and elegant tailoring, the frock coat had become perfect for more formal day and business wear. Its distinguishing features were wide lapels, a seam at the waist and skirts which sometimes reached to the knee.",
