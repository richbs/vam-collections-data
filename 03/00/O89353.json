As the sole was quite flat and inelastic, it was made shorter than the upper to give sufficient spring for walking. Shoes of both styles could fit either foot. There were two main styles for men, one with a rounded toe curving back to the sole, and the other with a wide toe the same width as the heel.\n\nCondition: Black quilted upper slightly worn out.\n\nAccording to a reference from Mus\u00e9e Guimet:\n\n\"Footwear for the urban Han Chinese evolved from lacquered wooden clogs and rigid-soled sandals, the later often converted to a slipper with the addition of leather or cloth uppers. The form can be dated from the Zhou dynasty (1030-256 BC). An upturned toe with a cloud head shape became a fashion during the Sui and Tang dynasties and remained a feature of men's shoes until the twentieth century. The platform sole made of layers of felt or cotton cloth increased the stature of the wearer and raised the foot off cold tile floors.\" (Huang Hengfu and Chen Juanjuan, 1994)\n\nThe relatively flat soles suggest the shoes were for Han men.\n\nThe uncertainty over the material of the piping is according to Wrigglessworth (1991).",
