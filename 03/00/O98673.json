The opium is said to be grown for sale only. They do not smoke it, but are very fond of tobacco. They are great sportsmen, and gold is found in their hills. Their villages are situated in strong defensive positions. The houses are built of mud and stone much in the Chinese manner and are closely huddled together. There are no openings to let air in or smoke out.\" \n\n\"The term \"Lo-Lo\" is of Chinese origin - namely from `Law' a basket - and is applied to these people because they keep the souls of their ancestors in small baskets, just as the Chinese themselves associate their own ancestral spirits with tablets.\" Major C.
