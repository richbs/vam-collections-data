It is most commonly equipped with a metal spear point and some have rudimentary foresights. The darts are accurate up to 25 metres.\n\nThe poison used was probably derived from Antiaris toxicaria a tree well known among the forest inhabitants of the Malay peninsula. The tree has many uses from simple shade to nutrient rich leaf litter, dyes from the bark and traditional medicines from the leaves and roots. The latex sap contains a cardiac glycoside called antiarin with heart arresting potential. In Javanese tradition Antiaris toxicaria is used with an extract derived from the seeds of the St. Ignatius bean tree Strychnos ignatii to make arrow poison called upas.\nCoastal inhabitants may also have used the caudal spine of the ikan pari or stingray which is common in the waters of the straits.",
