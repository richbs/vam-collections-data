The drawing shows a winged male figure, standing among foliage and blowing a trumpet. The title of the brochure,  Illustrations of the Victorian Series and other Wall-papers, is to the right of the figure. The National Art Library (in the Victoria and Albert Museum) has several copies of the Jeffrey & Co. wallpaper brochure with its cover derived from this design. Walter Crane\u2019s monogram - his initials and a crane - can be seen at the bottom right hand corner of the design.\n\nCrane was an artist and designer, and a prominent socialist. He was a founder member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society and the Art Workers' Guild. Wallpapers by well-known designers such as Crane and William Morris were very popular in the late nineteenth century, in part because they allowed middle-class householders to display their taste and discernment, without the need for unaffordable artworks such as paintings or sculpture.",
