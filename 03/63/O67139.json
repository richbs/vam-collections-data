Because the warp is depressed and the right hand thread of each knot is lower than the elft hand thread,  the knot leans towards the right.\nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn with black wool.\nEND FINISH: lower: 1\" (3 cm) plain weave in white woollen weft with bands of red weft and one row of weft twining in red and green; a red wool plait on one side. The lower edge was created by 2 passes of weft twined through the warp loops. Upper: 1\" (2 cm) plain weave, same coloured plait; passes of purple weft; 2 rows twined to create a firm woven edge resulting in a fringe.\nDESIGN: Field: white ground with triangular indentations filled with Herati pattern of blossoms and leaves. The blossoms are blue or red and the leaves are red, green and white.  The lower part of the field was woven with the horizontal dividing element of the main part design, but the spacing is different and there is a definite line marking a change.\nBorders (from the centre):\n(1) dark blue ground with a dark yellow meander of multi-coloured rosettes and botehs.\n(2) red ground with an angular dark blue meander with diagonal hooked lozenges in red, greens, white and purple.\n(3) light green ground with a double meander in dark blue with rosettes alternating dark pink and dark blue; there are small leaves.\n(4) as (2)\n(5) as (1).\n\nCatalogue Date: 25.2.98",
