Apple scoops could also be used to remove the core of the apple.  The earliest apple scoops were made from sheep bones. This scoop is made from boxwood.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBone or wooden scoops were often carved with patterns.  More expensive scoops were made in ivory or had silver decoration. Apple scoops were suitable for making and carving by hand at home. This scoop is cleverly carved with patterns, a moving ball, a date and two sets of initials. It is made of boxwood which is a smooth-grained wood suitable for delicate carving.\n\nOwnership & Use\nScoops were personal items and there was a superstition that it was unlucky for anyone other than the owner to use one. Many, like this one, have dates on them and were probably made as gifts. The initials on this one suggest that it might have given as a love or marriage token.",
