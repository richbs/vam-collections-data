It has been suggested that it served as an amulett to be rubbed by barren women.\n\nThe purpose of this plaque is difficult to trace, as there no traces of mounts, holes or hinges. There can be no doubt that the unusual and very localised wear, which has reduced the body of the Child Christ and the heads of the Virgin and Elisabeth in the Visitation to almost formless shape, is the result of continuous rubbing or kissing over a long period of time, so it is highly likely that the plaque was either mounted as an enkolpium or was loose, to be held i the hand.",
