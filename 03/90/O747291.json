Its heavy contour lines, dramatic chiaroscuro and foreshortening are indicators of Millet\u2019s work from the late 1840s.\n\nThe work\u2019s expressivity and blue grey paper are similar to another of Millet\u2019s pastoral nudes, <i>Femme se baignant </i>1846-1850 (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris). Both the Louvre example and the present work illustrate a shift in the artist\u2019s style from the typical academic nude to one possessing looseness and unique texture.\n\nThe partial drawing on the reverse is an unfinished portrait of a woman. The similarities it holds to Millet\u2019s portrait drawings of the late 1840s, like that of his second wife, Catherine Lemaire, 1848-49 (Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA) further implicate this portion of his career as the period of execution for both the nude and partial portrait.\n\nMillet sought inspiration from Poussin and Michelangelo for many of his nudes and was also deeply moved by the arcadian figures of Narcisse Diaz, whose work he had seen at the Paris Salons and whom he met around 1847. Creating about twenty-five known oils and fifty drawings of nude figures during the 1840s, his style began to evolve from its Rococo characteristics, which formerly echoed the idyllic scenes of Boucher and Fragonard, into the naturalist style he became known for.\n\nMillet moved from Paris to Barbizon in 1849 where he became a founding member of the Barbizon school of painting whose members also included Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Th\u00e9odore Rousseau, and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny. The group advocated a push toward Naturalism and utilized muted tonalities, looseness, and soft rendurings by celebrating the lives of rural peasants.",
