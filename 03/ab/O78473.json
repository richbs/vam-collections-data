Its very ornate decoration also meant that it could be used as an item of furniture when fitted with a stand.  It combines very fine ornament with sophisticated security.\n\nPeople\nBy tradition this jewel casket belonged to Queen Mary (1662-1695) and was made to hold the dowry paid on her marriage to William of Orange (1650-1702), later William  III, in 1677.  Their crowned cipher appears on the lock plate.  On the lid is a defaced wax seal that originally bore the arms of England as used by the Hanoverian dynasty.  In the 18th century this casket belonged to Sophia Dorothea, the sister of George II (reigned 1727-1760) and wife of Frederick William, King of Prussia.  He took it to Berlin, where it was purchased by the V&A in 1937.\n\nThe Maker\nAlthough the jewel casket is not signed anywhere, the openwork decoration is blued steel and the chiselled and engraved brass ornament are very close to the locks made by the Royal locksmiths Walter and Charles Bickford. The Bickfords supplied locks to the English royal palaces and also made strong-boxes. There is a signed lock from their workshop in the V&A.  Another, smaller version of this jewel casket has been recorded.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThe acquisition in 1937 of this elaborate jewel casket, with its complicated locking system of four bolts, openwork ornament in blued steel, and finely engraved gilt-brass, was a significant addition to the Museum's collection of objects made of iron and steel. But no doubt one of the main reasons for its purchase was its royal connection and the traditional view that it was made for the dowry paid on the marriage of Queen Mary to William III; this view was supported not only by the crowned cipher of William and Mary around the keyholes but also by an eighteenth-century provenance linking it with Sophia Dorothea, sister of George II, and wife of Frederick William I of Prussia, who took it to Berlin. By 1918 the jewel casket was in the Schlossmuseum in Berlin. It was sold to the V&A for \u00a3500 to raise funds for the acquisition of part of the collection of medieval goldsmiths' work known as the Guelph Treasure, regarded as a notable part of the German heritage. The V&A's opportunity to acquire what was considered an English national treasure thus came about through Berlin's attempts to retain a national treasure of its own.\n\nLit.
