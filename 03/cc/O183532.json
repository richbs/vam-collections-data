However, when the ruling Safavid dynasty (1501-1722) moved their capital to Isfahan around 1600, the production of luxury dishes and wall tiles rapidly increased. Safavid potters worked in a wide variety of styles and techniques, often seeking inspiration from their 12th century traditions and techniques. Single colour glazes were used by Safavid potters to great effect, with coloured slip, carved or relief-moulded details as here.\n\nIn 19th century Qajar Iran, before a contemporary export market had emerged, a commercial market for historical artefacts arose, fuelled by Western collectors and museums. Historically, fragmentary material culture, particularly ceramics, including 17th century Safavid fritware, and Chinese porcelain, which had been damaged through use, was often repaired or re-purposed with metal mounts, frequently brass, to replace missing spouts, handles, lids and necks. Many examples were acquired for the Victoria and Albert Museum by Major-General Sir Robert Murdoch Smith (1835-1900) in Iran in the 1870s and 1880s.",
