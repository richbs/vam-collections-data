            "public_access_description": "Giorgio de Chirico (1888-1976) was an Italian artist who forged a style of working known as 'Metaphysical'  between about 1911 and 1917, which greatly influenced the Surrealists. It was almost certainly the feeling of impending doom during the Second World War (1939-1945) that drew de Chirico to illustrate the Apocalypse. He may have felt particularly threatened because his wife, Isabella, was Jewish. He may also have been attracted by the fantastical aspect of the Revelations of St John the Divine in the Bible (this image is from Revelations 6:13). De Chirico was also very interested in the work of great artists of the past, and would have been familiar with many earlier Apocalypse illustrations, particularly those by the Renaissance German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Parallels can be drawn between D\u00fcrer's illustrations and de Chirico's for many of the plates, although this particular illustration has an uncharacteristic nursery book feel to it.",

Edizioni Bora, Bologna, 1966 (cat. no. 111a. illus. p.165)\nTimmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Giorgio de Chirico (1888-1978)</b> \n\n<i>...e le stelle del cielo caddero sulla terra</i> (...and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth), 1941 \n\nDe Chirico's profound influence on Surrealism and the subsequent course of twentieth-century art is largely due to his canvasses from the period 1911 to 1917.  Characterized by classical sculpture or lay figures, and isolated within theatrically deep perspectives of colonnaded buildings, they project an atmosphere of nihilism, menace and pathos.  Early influences on de Chirico himself were as much philosophical as visual; Schopenhauer and especially Nietzche played formative roles.  It seems odd therefore than an artist who had admired Nietzche, the opponent of conventional Christian morality and religious thoughts, should want to illustrate scenes from the Apocalypse - after all, a kind of ultimate assertion of such thinking.  However, it was almost certainly the climate of impending doom arising from the Second World War that drew de Chirico to the Apocalypse.  He must have felt particularly threatened, since his beloved wife Isabella, for whom he had the deepest respect, was Jewish.  Doubtless he was also attracted by the fantastical aspect of the Revelations of St John the Divine (this image is from Revelations 6: 13).  In his text 'Why I illustrated the Apocalypse' de Chirico wrote of the artist being 'between and beyond the know and unknown', in a world of fantasy; and he used the metaphor of theatre to describe the way his audience might need to look upon the work. \nWith his interest in the old masters, de Chirico would have known many historical versions of Apocalypse illustrations, most significantly, for the conception of his own, the woodcut illustration by Albrecht D\u00fcrer.  De Chirico had spent several years of his youth in Germany, developing a taste for German art as well as philosophy.  But despite undoubted parallels between some of his imagery and that of D\u00fcrer, this particular plate has an uncharacteristic nursery-book feel.  It is curiously reminiscent of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's delightful illustrations to his fable <i>Le Petit Prince</i>, published in 1943 and itself a wildly fantastical and metaphysical work, if in a generally more endearing and less troubling way.  This plate, with its unexpected and probably unintended humour, and its great charm, contributes to the image of de Chirico as an enigma - a word he himself so frequently applied to his paintings.\"",
