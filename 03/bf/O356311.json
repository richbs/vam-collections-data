The scenes are in two registers divided by swags of drapery intertwined into flowers, by branches of candlesticks, and by galleries in which musicians play or onlookers in fancy dress watch the dancing. The gallery with the musicians comes in the centre of a width, with a small dance scene to either side. Above the gallery, set in an elaborate baroque cartouche, are the initials 'BHL', and the crossbar of the 'H' is split by an arrow. A large dance scene with a fiddler below the musicians gallery is flanked by an arcaded gallery with two spectators on each side, making four when the widths of the fabric are joined at this point. There are two widths of fabric in this panel joined to a strong cotton lining by a binding of yellow braid.",
