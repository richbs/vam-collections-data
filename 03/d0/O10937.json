Its pair bears the initial 'G', indicating that it held the green, unfermented tea leaves, commonly called 'Green' tea.  As tea was both expensive and extremely popular at this date, the hinged lid could be locked to prevent theft. Black tea was more popular than green tea by the mid-18th century, and was drunk with milk or cream and often sweetened with sugar.\n\nMaker  & Engraver\nThe coat of arms is that of Antonio Lopez Suasso impaling Da Costa, which also appears on a silver-gilt spoon tray by the renowned goldsmith Paul de Lamerie (1688?-1751), suggesting that the two canisters formed part of a much larger tea service. The engraving is of the highest quality, and is attributed to the celebrated painter and engraver William Hogarth (1697-1764), based on a design by his master, Ellis Gamble. There are documented links between Gamble and de Lamerie, and although this canister is unmarked, it was probably made by de Lamerie.",
