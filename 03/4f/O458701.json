            "physical_description": "A flat-topped circular box of carved red lacquer, on the high foot, decorated with figure scenes.\nFORM: A circular box with flat top and high foot. Upper and lower halves have vertical sides, with a shoulder curving towards the top and footrim. Boxes of this form were probably used for ceremonial gifts of food.\nCORE: The core is visible through breaks in the lacquer at several places, and is of softwood or bamboo. There is no visual evidence of a layer of composition, but there is a layer of coarse cloth between the core and the lacquer.\nSURFACE: The underside of the base and the interior are lacquered a glossy black. This may be a later re-lacquering. Outer surfaces covered in carved red lacquer, with a single layer of black used as a guideline. This feature is not mentioned by Garner with regard to this class of lacquer.\nDECORATIVE MOTIFS: On the foot a rectangular ground . On the curved section of the lower half are eight lobed cartouches set on a geometric ground. Four contain flowers; lotus, chrysanthemum, camellia and peony. Four contain single figures: Zhang Qian on a log raft plus three unidentified subjects.\nThe vertical portion of the lower half is carved with twenty-one male figures in non-official dress, plus servants, in an outdoor setting, engaged in calligraphy, chess, tea drinking and conversation. This is probably not a single identifiable group.\nThe vertical portion of the upper half is carved with a scene of the lanting Gathering (353 A.D.), with Wang Xizhi composing the 'Lanting' Perface in a pavilion. In all thirty male figures in non-official dress.\nThe curved portion of the upper half os carved with the Eighteen Scholars of Tang (Tang shi ba xue shi). For a discussion of this subject in the context of Ming lacquer see ''Oriental Art N.S.'' 32.2(1986), 182-187. The flat top is carved with the visit to the Moon Palace of Emperor Tang Xuanzong (r.712-756)\nPROVENANCE: From the collection of Dr. Ip Yee, Hong Kong. Sold as Lot 112 in 'Fine Chinese Ceramics, Jades and Works of Art', Sotheby's Hong Kong, 19th November 1984. Hammer price HK$70,000. Sotheby's paper labels on base.\nDISCUSSION: An example of a group of lacquers, given a mid-Ming date on the basis of a dish in the BM dated 1489. This dish bears the signature 'Carved by Wang Ming of Pingliang', while a screen in Tokyo National Museum is inscribed 'Carved by Wan Yan of Pingliang'. Pingliang is in Gansu province, and the group is thus sometimes referred to as 'Gansu type'. The characteristics of the group are: figural subject matters (often with precise schemes of allusion), relatively thin, often cracked lacquer and very detailed carving, with several different surface planes.
