It would have been created using a computer and a pen plotter, one of the few output devices available in the early stages of computer technology.  A pen plotter is a mechanical drawing \u2018arm\u2019 that holds a pen or a brush, which is linked to a computer.  A computer program would be written by the artist, often in collaboration with a computer programmer, and this would act as a set of instructions that would drive the pen across the drawing surface and dictate its route.  Plotter drawings are always linear, although close cross-hatching can enable plotter drawings to simulate an expanse of block colour. This work has been labelled 'FRAGMENT', which may indicate that it is an experimental or trial piece.",
