            "public_access_description": "The earliest porcelain figures were made for the dessert course of grand dinners and replaced the sugar paste and wax figures made since medieval times for royal feasts. Originally intended as expressions of dynastic power and to celebrate political allegiances, allegorical themes had been introduced into these table settings by the 16th century. By the 18th century many were entirely decorative. Meissen in Germany was the first factory to make porcelain figures for the dessert. It set the sculptural conventions followed by porcelain factories elsewhere.\n\nDuring the 18th century dessert was the course on which the greatest effort and expense were lavished. The food served and the fine porcelain which accompanied it reflected the wealth and good taste of the host. The increasing availability of porcelain through factories like Meissen, and sugar from the West Indies meant a greater number of people could enjoy decorative desserts.\n\nThis figure, in the form of a black woman naked except for a headdress and flowered skirt, represents Africa. The companion figure of a man represents America. They were origiginally modelled by J.F. Eberlein in 1741, who recorded that he modelled male and female 'Moors ... standing by a sugar box.' The bowls could have been used for both sugar and dry sweetmeats served during the dessert course of a grand meal. This pair of figures were originally created for use with table centrepieces from which no other Continents are known.\n\nBlack Africans offered exotic associations and were a marker of luxury within European households, where many were employed, although often unpaid, as domestic staff.",
