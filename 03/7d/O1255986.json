An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he   was elected to the Photographic Society of London in  1869 and later contributed to photographic exhibitions.    Rupert assisted the artist Sir John Everett Millais (1829- 1896), a close friend, by photographing backgrounds  for  paintings and sitters for portraits. His favourite subject,  however, was Beatrix herself and his prolific legacy  of  several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial  account of her life from infancy to marriage.\n\nRupert was also a skilled landscape photographer.   During the Potter family's extended summer holidays to   Scotland and the Lake District it was Beatrix's delight to  accompany her father on photographic expeditions.  He  photographed in particular the countryside around  Eastwood in Dunkeld, Wray Castle near Ambleside  and  Lingholm on the edge of Derwentwater.  This photograph of a river was taken on 29 August 1893 while the Potter family spent the summer months at Eastwood in Perthshire. \n\nExcited by the possibilities of the new art form, Beatrix  too became an avid photographer, inheriting one of  her  father\u2019s old cameras, 'a most inconveniently heavy  article which he refuses to use, and which has been   breaking my back since I took to that profession.'  (Journal, Friday 19th April 1895).  Beatrix went on to   employ photography in the service of her own art and,  like Millais, she photographed details, particularly in  the  Lake District landscapes, that she later incorporated in  her imaginative book illustrations.",
