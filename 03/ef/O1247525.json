The donor was born and raised in Rome, and remembers that a visiting dress-maker made all her dresses into her teens. \nIt is a typical hand-tailored dress, produced for an upper-middle class Italian child to wear to a family occasion. It has a round peter-pan collar and short gathered sleeves and is made of pale pink Italian silk, with mother of pearl buttons and two strips of drawn-thread decorative work around the skirt. All the edges are finished by hand, and the hems are delicately rolled and stitched with silk thread.",
