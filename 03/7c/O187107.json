There is a narrow part border top and bottom separated by a line of block of pink silk and metal thread.  There is evidence of a border down either side.  The ground is beige satin with 5 large botehs filling the space.  Each bends slightly to the right.  The pattern is woven with metal thread [silver strip open S-wound on a white silk core] with small details in red silk.  Between the upper part of each boteh is a narrow curving leaf filled with flower heads similar to these filling the botehs.  Between the lower part of each boteh is a floral arrangement of a pair of leaves and a central flower.  Because of the colours used, it can be hard to distinguish the details, but light playing on it does highlight the red floss silk.  There is a woven inscription in a roundel at the tip of each boteh.\nBorders: pieced. Pink ground with the same pattern woven with blue silk and metal thread which is silver strip open S-wound on cream silk core.  The same inscription, but reversed, is in the tips of the botehs in the left hand border. There is part of a border pattern down the outer edge on both side borders which is separated from the main pattern by blocks of blue silk alternating with blocks of metal thread [see main panel].\nBoth fabric may have been part of the same sash.\nBacking: printed cotton, the ground is patterned with tiny black and white triangles.  There are white medallions with a lacy edging containing a red rose and a smaller red flower.  A pair of floral sprays extend from the bottom of the medallions.  There is also a small dark round oval with an orange and red flower.",
