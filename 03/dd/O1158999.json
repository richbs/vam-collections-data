Miss Farnell began the company in Acton in London making plush and cloth animals. Dolls were introduced to the production line in 1915, and in 1937 special character dolls were produced to mark the coronation of King George VI. The trade mark of these dolls are the felt faces and the embroidered label on the right foot of the doll. Some had an acorn shaped cardboard label attached to their arm.\nFarnell went on to produce dolls in plastic in the 1960s and 1970s, which they continued up until 1974 when the company stopped producing toys altogether.\n\nAlpha Toys as they came to be known had business both in the UK and the USA. The Alpha trademark begain in 1925. This particular doll was a representation of people who attended the procession of the coronation of King George VI.",
