The following is the full text of the entry. 808 Allegorical figure of a woman Inscribed 'Spagnia' Pen and ink and wash heightened with white on grey blue paper 9 \u00bd x 8 \u00be (242 x 222) D.69-1885 PROVENANCE Bought 1885 The woman wears a crown and a sword. With one hand she supports an armorial shield surmounted by a crown, and in the other she holds a sheaf of branches (apparently laurel or olive) bound with a scroll inscribed 'Hispanarum'; at her feet a sheep, a fawn, and a pair of shears. The coat of arms is hardly legible and bears little resemblance to the arms of Spain in the 16th century, though the inscription on the scroll, evidently written by the artist, suggests that the allegory represents Spain. The drawing was formerly attributed to Giovanni di Pietro, called Lo Spagna. The new attribution was made by Philip Pouncey. Compare a similar drawing of an allegorical figure in the Ambrosiana, Milan (cod. F.236 inf. no. 1526; E. S. Barelli, <i>Disegni di maestri lombardi del primo seicento</i>, Milan, 1959, pl. 78).",
