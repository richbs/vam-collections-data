            "public_access_description": "This ewer is one of the earliest examples of Chinese porcelain bearing European armorial devices. The coat of arms on this ewer is probably that of the Portuguese family of Peixoto, attributed to Antonio Peixoto, son of Lopo Peixoto who had patent of the arms in 1511. Antonio Peixoto, a navigator and merchant, embarked on a trading mission to China together with his business partners, Antonio da Mota and Francisco Zeimoto. Sailing around the China coast in a junk laden with hides and other goods they were refused entry to the port of Canton (now Guangzhou) in 1542. They continued their journey and began to trade in Quanzhou and along the southern coast of China. Between 1522 and 1577 an imperial Chinese edict prevented trade relations with foreigners however during the 1540s a clandestine trade was flourishing. He probably bought this ewer during that trip and had it mounted in Persia on the return journey. This seems likely because the silver mounts were made at about the same time as the porcelain and were probably added as part of a repair. The cross pattern on the silver lid replicates the blue triangles and medallions around the neck.",

Having no familiarity with European vessel shapes, the potter has used a design then being made for the export to the Middle East. It bears the arms of the Peixoto family of Portugal and must have been commissioned by Antonio Peixoto, a navigator and merchant who reached the southern Chinese port of Canton in 1542. Refused entry to Canton, he went on to trade off the south China coast and became one of the first Portuguese to reach Japan. The Portuguese dominated the European trade in Chinese porcelain during the sixteenth century, when they were also a major supplier of Chinese wares to the Middle East. The silver mounts are contemporary with the porcelain and must have been added in Iran on Peixoto's return journey from China.\n\nJingdezhen potters had no experience in painting coats of arms, though they seem to have risen to the challenge very competently. The 'Great Ming' mentioned in the painted mark on the base refers to both the ruling dynasty and the country of China itself. The Jingdezhen potters evidently wanted to make it clear to their foreign customer that this fine porcelain ewer was made under the Emperor Jiajing in the great country called 'Ming' (although no one in Europe could read Chinese and few could been concerned about its date of manufacture).",
