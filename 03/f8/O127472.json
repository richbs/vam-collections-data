His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nLionel Bart, who had created the successful long-running musical Oliver!, wrote the music and lyrics for Twang!!, a comic version of  the story of Robin Hood. The production was a troubled one and Joan Littlewood, the director, walked out during rehearsals, to be hastily replaced by Burt Shevelove.  Extensive re-writing on its pre-London tour failed to save the show.  It opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in December 1965 and was savaged by the critics who found the plot poor, the script excruciatingly unfunny, and the acting flat.  Twang!! limped on for 43 performances.  It was the last time that Messel worked on the London stage.  He did not design another theatre production until the Broadway musical Gigi in 1973.",
