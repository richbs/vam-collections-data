Each panel has black silk borders embroidered with gilt thread.\nThe panels are embroidered with white, red, black, pale green, ice blue, tan, pink and pale lilac silks with some couched gilt threads against a background of couched gold thread. The scenes depicted are based on battles from the 'Three Kingdoms' period (3rd century AD). The stylisation and mask-like faces worn by some of the figures suggests that this particular interpretation was taken from a theatrical version of this popular subject.\nEach panel is lined with a coarse red cotton material which is embroidered in gilt thread with stylised <i>shou</i> and endless knot emblems and four medallions, also outlined with couched gilt thread. Characters meaning \u2018the king\u2019s cowrie temple\u2019 (<i>beizi wang miao</i>) are embroidered on the reverse in black silk, verifying that this is a temple banner.",
