Following his conversion  to  Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and   writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned   classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best   remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster, in which he was responsible for much of  the interior decoration. The Palace, commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, was  reconstructed in the Gothic style from 1840 following a devastating fire.\n\nThis design shows signs of not  being fully worked out: the five- sided palmette has a stump of a  stalk which does not lead  anywhere. The drawing may not  be in Pugin's hand. It is possible  that this design was one of those  intended for the internal  decoration of the Houses of  Parliament, but there is no  evidence that it was ever used. \tExotic fruits such as pineapples and pomegranites have a long history as popular artistic motifs,  symbolising opulence, power and hospitality.",
