A stylised mound at the bottom of the design forms the base from which the flowering tree emerges, although the usual central trunk has been replaced by a design of looser stems from which huge fanciful flowers emerge.\nThe border is unusually large in scale but beautifully drawn and dyed. It is likely that this impressive piece was made for the Dutch rather than British market.",
