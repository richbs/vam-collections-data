Unlike her siblings, the Princess never married, although it had been intended that she marry one of her Prussian cousins, favoured by her grandfather George I.  \n\nThe Princess was embroiled in controversy in 1751, when, as ranger of Richmond Park, she attempted to restrict the public's use of the grounds.  The case was brought before the courts and the Princess was eventually compelled to grant public access.  Unmarried, her later years were largely spent at her residence, Gunnersbury House in Ealing. \n \nThe original portrait was painted in 1728, the year after George II had succeeded to the throne, and it is probable that the print was made around this time.  Amelia is shown wearing an ermine-trimmed cloak, her coronet placed on a table at her side. \n \nObject Type \n \nJohn Faber (ca.1695-1756) was an English engraver and miniaturist.  His family originated in Amsterdam and settled in England around 1698, when John was an infant.  His artistic studies began as a student at the St. Martin's Lane Academy, Charing Cross, where he became acquainted with some of the leading artists working in London at that time.  Faber produced a large number of mezzotints during his career, most notably a set of Hampton Court Beauties after Godfrey Kneller.",
