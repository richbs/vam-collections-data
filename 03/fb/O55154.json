Two tapered bracing-uprights rise from the back rail to support the lower part of the back. Plain solid seats with slight indentations at the front corners. No angle-blocks or struts underneath. Plain rails curve down at each end to simple cabriole legs of square section, spatulate feet. \nJapanned in a very dark brown (perhaps intended for black and now touched up with black in many places), with gold lines along all the 'visible' edges. The seat and back have an additional band of formal ornament painted in gold inset from the edges. The back and seat of these chairs are decorated with Chinese lacquer and the mantling of the coat of arms is also in the Chinese style. Below the shield of arms is a lotus flower. In their present condition the original arms appear to have been painted over in England, presumable on the occasion of the wedding in 1759 (see below).\n\nArms painted on the back: Perchevron sable and argent, in chief three mullets or, and in base three garbs gules: the crest, an elephant armed gules. For the Hawkins family of Bignor Park, Sussex. Herbert Pakington married Elizabeth, sister of Sir Caeser Hawkins, 1st Bart. in 1759. The other chair represents the Pakington arms which had also been altered for the wedding.",
