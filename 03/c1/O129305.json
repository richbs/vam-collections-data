Fry was a promoter of decorative arts and wanted to remove the division in perception between the fine and decorative arts. In the workshop, artists produced pieces that were anonymous, signed only with the Greek letter Omega. \n\nThe Omega Workshops either designed furniture to be made by professional furniture makers, or bought second-hand furniture at auction to paint and resell. The dining chairs were carefully designed by Roger Fry with the angle between the top rail and back exaggerated by the square panel of caning in the back.",
