London, V&A Publications, 2001.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Ruslan Kotev (born 1956)</b> \n\n<i>The Tower of the Tempest</i>, 1991 \n\nRejecting what he felt to be the suffocating bureaucracy of the Fine Arts Academy of Bulgaria, Ruslan Kotev apprenticed himself for two years to the printmaker Dan Tenev and learnt his craft in isolation with his master in the manner of a medieval artisan.  He explained: 'You cannot learn graphics from looking at prints; you can only learn from one-to-one contact, from watching somebody work.  Dan Tenev gave me not only knowledge, but all the encouragement you need to understand your personal inner imagery trying to get out.'  Kotev's highly 'personal inner imagery' draws upon the visual language of the Italian architectural <i>capriccio</i>, or imaginary conceit, as well as on Bulgarian folklore and religious iconography.  The composition of <i>The Tower of the Tempest</i> recalls the biographical icon, where a central devotional image is surrounded by a narrative border depicting scenes from a saint's <i>vita</i> (life) and miracles. \nWhile Kotev avoids explicit allusions and resists literal readings of his work, the artistic imagination of Eastern Europe does seem haunted by the failed utopias of the twentieth century.  If Vladimir Tatlin's <i>Monument to the Third International</i> of 1919-20 may be understood as the tower of revolution and Boris Iofan's 1936 proposal for the <i>Palace of the Soviets</i> as the tower of totalitarianism, Kotev's <i>Tower of the Tempest</i> is an apt symbol of the collapse of the Communist system in Europe.  The year 1991 saw the formal dissolution of the neighbouring Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact and its economic arm COMECON; in Bulgaria itself, after mounting political protest, free elections were eventually won by the UDF (Union of Democratic Forces), and the deposed Communist leader Todor Zhivkov was brought to trial on charges of corruption.\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Prints, Drawings and Paintings Accession Register for 1996</u>\nThe partial text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'KOTEV, Ruslan (b.1956)\n\nThe Tower of the Tempest. 1991\nArtist's proof.\nDated within the plate <u>6.9.1991</u>.
