In a letter of 14 September 1834 to George Constable (L. ed. S., p. 318) Constable says that he will visit him again at Arundel after his stay at Petworth if he has time: this may have some bearing on the inscription Arundel on the back of the drawing. \n\nNote on Nos. 369-372 [216-1888, 215-1888, 273-1888, 801-1888]\n\nThese four drawings are from the same sketch-book, measuring about 8 1/8 x  10 3/4 ins. (207 x 272 mm.). The dates on Nos. 370 [215-1888] and 371 [273-1888] show that Constable used it when he stayed with Lord Egremont at Petworth in September 1834, and No. 369 [216-1888] was made on the same visit. Other drawings from the same sketch-book are in the British Museum: \nL.B. 12a, 12b Ruins of Cowdray. (Each 203 x 265 mm.) Each watermarked: J \nWHATMAN 1828. \nL.B. 23b Tillington Church. Dated 17 September 1834. \nOn paper extended from that of the sketch-book page. \nL.B. 24 Ruins of Cowdray: Interior: Dated 14 September 1834. \nOn paper extended from that of the sketch-book page. \nLeslie (L. ed. S., p. 319) describes the sketch-book as follows: \"While at Petworth, where Constable spent a fortnight, he filled a large book with sketches in pencil and watercolours, some of which he finished very highly\".\u201d",
