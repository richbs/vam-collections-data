The front legs are attached to the base and the movement is controlled by a rod from the mechanism to the neck of the horse. The horse is cast in two halves along the length and held with tongue and slot joints. It is lithographed white with brown; black and grey. The rider is also cast in two halves and joined to the horse by its hand extending to become the reins. The figure is lithographed in red; blue; brown and yellow. The integral key protrudes from the base on the right side and when wound the horse bucks; tossing the rider over its head and back again into the saddle. \n\n*The marks on the base are very detailed.
