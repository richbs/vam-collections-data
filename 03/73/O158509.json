            "public_access_description": "This print is among those that some scholars include in an expanded list of works engraved by Mantegna himself. There has been some debate about whether Mantegna engraved more than the seven works usually assigned to him, or even whether he engraved any himself. From 1475 Mantegna is known to have been looking for a professional engraver to work for him, but one is not known of until the 1490s.\n\nThe attribution of this work to Mantegna himself is based on comparison between the preparatory drawing and print, showing changes to the design and additional details engraved directly onto the plate without preparation. \n\nWhether this was engraved by Mantegna or someone working from his drawings, it reflects a new practice of artists reproducing their drawings in print. Collectors accepted prints taken from drawings as originals to be prized in their own right. From about 1490 Mantegna employed Antonio da Brescia to engrave copies to satisfy this demand for them - included among these is a variation of this composition.\n\nThe composition is famous for the unusual placement of the figure of Christ, with his back to the viewer as he enters into Limbo. It also shows Mantegna's interest in rock formations, which he studied from nature.",
