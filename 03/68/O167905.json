The design and decorative motifs varied remarkably little over a millennium, with only minor changes being introduced and stylistic innovations remaining infrequent.",

The design and decorative motifs varied remarkably little over a millennium, with only minor changes being introduced and stylistic innovations remaining infrequent. The later examples, especially those in Norway, are conspicuously retardataire, following models made further south many hundred years earlier. The distinctive feature of the T-shaped recesses on the side panels seen here perhaps sets the present comb apart from the earliest examples and was copied in some alter Norwegian combs, so a date in the decades before the Viking incursions in England, or shortly afterwards, seems plausible.",
