The  border around the outside of the top of  the snuffbox shows three alternatives for decorationt. This design is signed and dated 'Duval', '1770'. The precise identity of Duval is unclear: two Duvals, both without other recorded names, are possible candidates; they were respectively an engraver (who engraved work by the painter Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Boucher in 1774) and an architect (active at Versailles about 1780). The identity of this Duval is not the Swiss jeweller and box-maker Louis David Duval who worked in London and later in Russia and was still at St. Petersburg in 1770.  \n\nThis design for a snuffbox was possibly for an elite client from the Court of Louis XV, King of France, from 1715 to 1774, at Versailles, Paris. The design is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
