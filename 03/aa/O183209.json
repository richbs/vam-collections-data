The chair has an open-framed back with turned arms, rails and uprights, and is mounted on turned cylindrical upper legs with matching stretchers and a curved foot rest.  The upper  legs are mounted on rockers, which are attached with cogs to two pairs of curved and hinged legs which can be lowered to form large rockers (these have three turned cylindrical stretchers at the front and (originally) three at the back.  The chair is lockable in its different positions by means of a slotted rack which fits between the lower front and back stretchers, and is  mounted on four metal wheels, each of which has four pairs of voided heart motifs.  The seat has a perforated squared central panel, which was potentially removable to allow a pot to be inserted, but in any case provided ventilation.  There is a semicircular tray which may be lowered to rest on the arms of the chair, or swung back over the top when not in use or to allow the child to be more easily seated initially.",
