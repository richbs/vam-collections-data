He acted at the Lyceum in his youth, using the name Bernard Gould, and made many drawings of Irving, some which appeared in the theatre's souvenir programmes. His work has provided both a record of costumes and scenery and of the dramatic effect of Irving's performances.\n\nThis image shows the actor Henry Irving (1838-1905) in the title role of his 1899 production of the play Robespierre, by Victorien Sardou (1831-1908).  Set in 1794 the play focuses on the historical figure of Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), but otherwise is a work of fiction.  It was produced on a spectacular scale, with a cast of 69 actors and over 100 extras to make up the crowd scenes.",
