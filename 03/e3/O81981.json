The panel is carved in high-relief with a figure seated cross-legged and with palms joined together near the breast. The three faces turn to the front and to each side, their ribbed hair braided into three elaborate cone shapes with a lotus finial resting upon them. Except for the headgear, the sculpture is devoid of any other ornamentation or attribute. The upper torso of the image is bare, but the lower part of the body is clad. The hand and seating postures, as well as long earlobes, are notable for their Buddhist influence.\n\nThe exact provenance of this panel is uncertain. It was one of a series collected by Dr J. Anderson, who travelled through upper Burma in 1869 on the first British Expedition to Yunnan and bequeathed to his widow,  Mrs G. S. Anderson. It has also been suggested that it could have originated in Eastern Bengal.",

Its iconography did not become as conventionalized as many of the others and therefore the identification of this piece of sculpture is uncertain. The central figure could be any of the three component deities but if the apex of the three heads here can be identified as a 'lingam' it would suggest that the central figure is Shiva. An alternative identification could be Mahesha but, because of the similarity of all three faces, this is less likely than trimurti.\nSee Banerjea [1956] pp.476.477.",
