            "public_access_description": "Photographer Charlie Phillips moved to London from Jamaica in 1956 and began to document life in his local community. His photographs of people and places associated with Notting Hill depict both significant and everyday moments in the area\u2019s history. Displays of black heritage became commonplace in Notting Hill\u2019s multicultural community by the 1970s. Alongside annual celebrations of Caribbean culture in events like the Notting Hill Carnival, a sense of black pride was also increasingly evident in clothing styles, such as the African head wrap worn by the woman in the centre of this photograph.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Charlie Phillips as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
