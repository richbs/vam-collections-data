Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>46 A Woman, with the initials <i>M B</i></b> \n<b>c.1630</b> \nEvans 27  \n \n<b>Ova1 38 x 30 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in small, soft hatches of brown and blue-grey, blue for the eyes and red for the lips, on a pale carnation ground; hair in a brown wash, lined with darker colour, the lights in pale grey; dress in black wash modelled in grey, with grey and thick white for the lace edging; bow in crimson over thick white; pearls in grey with white and metallic silver highlights; background a crimson curtain floated wet-in-wet; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book.  \n \n<b>Condition:</b> Dirt, abrasions and losses overall; the edge probably trimmed; the silver blackened.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In gold centre left: <i>DDG</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Probably nineteenth-century oval frame, of fruitwood ebonised and partly gilt and with turned composite mouldings; the hanger is a small brass screw-eye and open ring. Into the back is pinned a small silver-gilt locket, enamelled all over in opaque pale blue and decorated in black with a reversed cypher of MB beneath a coronet and surrounded with ornament in the same black enamel.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an unrecorded source by the Hon. F H A Wallop before July 1927; lent to the V&A until 1949; the ownership transferred to Alan Evans, June 1933, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 192 9, p. 124; Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 15 (as 'perhaps studio of Des Granges'); Murdoch 1981, pp. I 36-7, fig. 149 (the initials read as EM). \n\nIt is not necessary to doubt the authenticity of this miniature - its apparently poor quality has more to do with fading and other severe damages than with poor workmanship. In its enamelled silver-gilt frame it must once have been a more sumptuous object than it now appears.  \n \nWallop dated it c.1630; (1) the costume evidence is hard to interpret (it could be as late as the l640s), but the crimson curtain argues for an earlier date, and on balance c.1630 seems right; apart from the use of metallic paint in the jewellery, it is consistent with other miniatures of that date. See also Cat. Nos 44 and 45.  \n \nWallop also seems to have suggested that the sitter was 'possibly one of the French ladies of Henrietta Maria'. 2 This is over-specific, but miniaturists and certainly Des Granges at this period still worked for a narrow Court clientele, and the presentation of this miniature in a fine enamelled and monogrammed case gives some support to Wallop's theory. \n \n1  Wallop Loan Book. \n2  Ibid.\"",
