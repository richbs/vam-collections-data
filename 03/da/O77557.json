This was a photographic format, originating from the visiting card, which was introduced in France in 1854. Cartes were mass produced, and those like Mayall's pictures of the royal couple were ordered by the hundreds of thousands.\n\nPeople\nIn March 1861 John J.E. Mayall was entrusted with the important royal commission of photographing Queen Victoria and Albert, the Prince Consort. Albert's death, only nine months after this photograph was taken, created an unprecedented public demand for 'carte de visite' portraits of the royal family. By purchasing such images the public demonstrated its sympathy and shared in a form of public mourning.\n\nCollecting\nIt was fashionable to collect 'cartes de visite' and compile them in albums. Queen Victoria shared her husband's enthusiasm for photography and had over 100 albums in which she collected portraits from every foreign court.",
