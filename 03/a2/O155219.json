Two smaller, curved pieces have been sewn side by side along the top of the main piece.  When folded, the whole encases the lower arm and the two curved sections fall back and front of the hand.  There is a copper strip down either side and these interlock when the gauntlet is folded and a long copper pin is inserted to secure the gauntlet in place. Because of the damage it is possible to see that there are many layers of undyed cotton cloth; the curved panels also have a layer of leather.  The backing is green wool and this was secured in place before the front decorative layer and the bindings were added.\nThe front is badly worn but a little pile along the edges indicates it was black silk velvet embroidered with a scale-like pattern in red silk and with a decorative border in couched metal thread.  The border separates the scale pattern into two sections.  The smaller curved is dark blue velvet and contains a rosettes in metal thread with a red velvet centre; the larger curved flap is black velvet and contains a more elaborate flower and stem in metal thread also with a red velvet centre and a border of metal thread circles worked over card shapes.  A horizontal band of thick cotton cord covered with black velvet runs below the two curved flaps. Rows of red stitching delineate some of the borders.\n\nMetal Thread: silver strip open Z-wound on yellow silk thread\n[Arm guard] Right-hand gauntlet, of the type probably used for hawing, leather with silk velvet embroidered with silk in running stitch, couched metal thread and applied velvet, with plain weave cotton interlinings, backed with plain weave wool, fastened with two interlocking copper plates and a copper pin and trimmed with silk tablet-woven braid.\nAppears to be made from three separate pieces: the main piece is straight across the top, the left hand side flares out and then has a straight lower edge and returns half way down the main piece to continue down to form a point at the bottom; the right hand side is straight.
