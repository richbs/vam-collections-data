The third leg is made of turned sycamore and together the legs make a contemporary version of a traditional tripod. The designer was Matthew Hilton, who produced many such zoomorphic designs in the late 1980s. He originally designed this table for a private client who had seen some of his cast aluminium candlesticks and wanted a piece of furniture with the same character. \n\nSCP Ltd, a London-based manufacturer of progressive furniture design, made this example. The lustrous dark-stained top is in fact made of MDF, a cheap and readily available material. However, combined with the sparkling metal legs and the polished stainless steel insert, the inexpensive top makes the table look very luxurious.",
