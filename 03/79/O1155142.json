As the century progressed, linen damask weaving developed into an important branch of the textile industry, with its main centres in Flanders in the Southern Netherlands and Haarlem in Holland, and the use of table linen by merchants, trades people and others belonging to the middle and upper classes grew. By 1600, most of these households had at least one complete set of table linen, known as napery, including one or more table cloths, and a number of napkins. Later in the century, evidence from inventories emphasises the importance of table linen in households. Often there were more napkins and tablecloths than there were sheets and pillowcases. Stocks of napery could be built up over many years, and were bequeathed in wills.\n\nNapkins were subject to official regulations that specified certain widths, and were either woven with borders all around or made from lengths of fabric and cut to the required size, as this one has been. Although its subject is taken from the Old Testament Book of Daniel this does not indicate it was intended for Church use. Many household textiles in the 17th century were decorated with scenes from the Bible.",
