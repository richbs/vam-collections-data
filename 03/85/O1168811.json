Malvern Link Common . 15.10.1973-17.10.1973. Performance category: circus. The programme took place twice daily.  The adult 'popular prices' were 20p and 25p unbookable and 40p and 55p, bookable. The note mentions that October 15th was a Monday. Since the prices are low but quoted in new pence, and the programme is very similar to that on S.3762-1995 which has prices in shillings and pence, this points to a date of 1973.",
