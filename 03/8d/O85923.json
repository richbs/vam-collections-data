It was strategically located at the gateway to the eastern trade routes from Turkey, with a flow of silk and other luxury goods. Although there is no documentary evidence of pottery production in Tabriz, the petrofabric of this dish and a group of other examples is comparable with analysis of the body of Tabriz tiles. The design on the back of the dish, a repeated leaf-like motif identified as the \"weedback\" pattern, appears to have been a specific workshop 'signature' or house-style linking a group of dishes loosely inspired by contemporary rather than 'antique' Chinese originals, aimed at less discriminating clientele.",
