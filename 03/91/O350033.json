These figures seem to have been inspired by Rubens's work, although no specific source has been identified. It is also analogous to an earlier ivory tankard dated 1676 by Matthias Rauchmiller (1645-1686) depicting the same subject in the Liechtenstein Collection.\n\nThe Rape of the Sabines is a legend in the early history of Rome. According to that Romulus, the founder of the city, used a trick to secure the future population of Rome. He organised a festival where the neighbouring inhabitants were invited, including the Sabines along with their wives and children. At a certain signal Rome's young men went into the crowd and carried away the unmarried wives. Plutarch has described to this legend the origin of the custom of lifting up a bride and carrying her over the doorstep of her husband's house.",
