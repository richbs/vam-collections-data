The stylised rose design in the centre was a popular motif for domestic plate in this period.\n\nOutside the wealthiest court circles, 17th-century silver was used primarily for eating and drinking. The dining table was the heart of social activity, and novelty items were made for fashionable new drinks flavoured with spices and drinking games.  The range of British silver for the home from this period (the first for which a representative quantity survives) demonstrates increasing foreign influences from France, the Netherlands and Portugal. The rising demand for fashionably decorated European silver from the 1660s onwards reflects Britain's new wealth and political stability. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Purchased from Bulgari, New York, 1986.\n[standing dish] Historical significance: The standing dish is one of the earliest categories of ordinary domestic dining (as opposed to drinking) plate to survive in anything beyond isolated examples. It probably evolved from the sixteenth century spice plate (see cat. no. 10) and its essentially utilitarian nature is indicated by its relative resistance to changes in style.
