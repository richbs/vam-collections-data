            "public_access_description": "This flask is one of the larger and more complex items produced in K\u00fctahya in western Anatolia. The colour scheme is inherited from the palette used on Iznik ceramics and includes the distinctive red made with a liquid clay slip. But here the scheme has been expanded by the addition of yellow.\n\nThe town of K\u00fctahya had a long tradition of making pottery. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was overshadowed by Iznik, also in Anatolia. But in the 18th century, after the industry in Iznik collapsed, K\u00fctahya became the main centre for fritware production in Turkey.\n\nFritware was also known as stone paste and quartz paste. It was developed by Middle Eastern potters as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain. Unlike high-fired Chinese porcelain, low-fired fritware was soft and porous, but like porcelain it was white all the way through and could be used to make convincing substitutes.",
