They were used to light the route to and within the bed chamber, and as such are intimate items for personal use.\n\nPeople\nThe grandeur of this sophisticated example, which was originally gilt,  suggests it was commissioned for a significant aristocratic patron of great wealth. Paul Crespin (1694-1770) had many such patrons.\n\nDesign & Influence\nThe highly successful modelling of the cupid, flower-shaped nozzle and twisted stem are matched in quality by the superb detailing of the chased ornament. The pose of the cupid is similar to the mermaid supports of a set of shell dishes made in 1739 by Paul de Lamerie (1688-1751), which are themselves examples of the Rococo revival of Baroque figural supports. Crespin's work reveals the continued influence of French ornamental designs. His designs are close to current French styles as practised by renowned silversmiths such as Thomas Germain (1673-1748). Nicolas de Largilli\u00e8re's celebrated double-portrait Thomas Germain and his Wife (1736) in the Gulbenkian Museum, Lisbon,shows a terracotta model of a cupid in this same pose.",

Paul Crespin's workshop made royal commissions, and supplied major  aristocratic clients, such as the Duke of Marlborough. At its best, the work rivalled that of Paul de Lamerie's workshop, and this candlestick is a good example of  sophisticated Rococo design for which Crespin was noted from the 1730s.\n\nPaul Crespin worked closely with other French emigre silversmiths including Paul de Lamerie and Nicholas Sprimont. A pair of candlesticks bearing de Lamerie's maker's mark and hallmarked in London in 1742/3 incorporate putti terms as a support for the stems, which rise, like this chamberstick, from a flower calyx. The dynamic weight bearing pose of Crespin's cupid, which leans back on one hand, whilst the other appears to support the body of the piece, is also similar to that of the mermaids who support shell dishes in a set of salts bearing de Lamerie's mark and the date letter for 1739. The device of a weight- bearing human figure was much used in the late 17th century - see engravings by Jean Le Pautre. It was revived and further developed as a Rococo device in the second quarter of the 18th century.\n\nThis model was also found in contemporary porcelain and was copied in the early 19th century and again in the 1860s. An example in ormolu in the collections of the Marquess of Tavistock and the Trustees of the Bedford Estate was included in the exhibition 'Country House Lighting' at Temple Newsam House, Leeds, no.44 p.68. The design may derive from the work of Juste Aurele Meissonier.",
