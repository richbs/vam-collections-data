            "public_access_description": "The pictures made by Indian artists for the British in India are called Company paintings. This one comes from a set of eight.  Six show the Jagannatha temple and bridge at Puri, and two show the Black Pagoda at Konarak, Orissa. \n\nThis painting shows the Jagannatha ratha during the annual festival procession at Puri, Orissa in 1822, being observed by dignitaries from two elephants. On the elephant with howdah and umbrella, is an officer of the East India Company and his wife In all probability this depicts the British Commissioner Andrew Stirling, who was stationed in Orissa at that time. Stirling published in 1822 the first detailed account in English of Orissa, in Asiatick Researches, the journal of the recently founded Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta. This included one of the first detailed descriptions of the great chariot procession festival at Puri.\n\nPuri has long been famous as one of the seven great centres of Hindu pilgrimage (tirthas) in India and for its great festival, the Rath Jatra (Yatra), held each year in June or July. The highlight of this festival is when the portable wooden images of the deities, the god Jagannatha, 'Lord of the World' (a glorification of Krsna), his brother Balabhadra, and his sister Subhadra, are paraded, each in their own temple car. In this painting only Jagannatha\u2019s temple car is shown, with its identifying yellow cloth canopy. The icon of the deity is clearly visible as he parades in his 16-wheeled car, attended by a host of priests and drawn by devotees. It is a wonderfully descriptive painting, providing an accurate depiction of the ratha\u2019s wooden architecture and textile canopy.\n\nGraham Parlett and John Guy",
