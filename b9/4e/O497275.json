            "physical_description": "Vase. This vase is probably dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century A.D. (R.K). It has two handles which emerge from heads at the vase surface. The neck is rectangular, but slightly rounded. There is an inset base, which is soldered-in. The soldering is rather rough, and the solder is very silvery in colour. There are a large number of file marks visible on the underside of the base ring.\nAnalyses of the body and base were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The results showed that the metal of the body was different from that of the base. The base metal was made from almost pure copper, with a lead impurity. The body was composed of copper and lead, with smaller amounts of other elements, including zinc, tin. And arsenic. Impurities included quite a lot of cobalt and some iron. There was no cobalt detected in the base plate copper, so it is reasonable to assume that the metal came from a different source. It is very likely that it is a replacement. The base was most likely to have been made from sheet metal, and the vase by casting. The low level of alloying elements would make the fresh metal look quite reddish. There are a number of vases of similar composition, where tin + zinc =5 % or less, and the major elements are copper and lead. These include 121-1876, 199-1876.",
