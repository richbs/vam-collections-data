The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s Staffordshire pottery firms issued countless other royal figures. Although some appeared after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThis has been identified as the child actor Miss Davenport, and it appears to have been issued as a companion piece to the figurine of the young actor Master Betty (S.333-1984) who was the talk of the town in the 1804-1805 season when he appeared at Covent Garden and Drury Lane in all the major Shakespearean tragic roles.  The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw a craze for child performers, and certainly most actors and actresses felt no qualms about putting their children on the stage if a good profit could result from their prodigious child.",
