The painted design of trapezoids, right-angled lines, and solid planes of colour, emphasises and enhances the cubic form of the box.\n\nThe Omega Workshops were opened by the artist Roger Fry in London in 1913. As a promoter of decorative arts, Fry wanted to remove the perceived divide between fine and decorative arts. While some Omega furniture was specially designed, some of it was pre-existing second-hand furniture purchased at auction, painted and resold. Lewis disagreed with this, arguing that 'painted furniture' should show a harmonious relationship between the piece and its applied decoration. This box illustrates the principle. Lewis considered that Omega furniture was simply furniture that had paint applied.",
