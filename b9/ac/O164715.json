            "public_access_description": "This sword was formerly in the possession of Sir George Barlow and believed to have come from the armoury  of Tipu Sultan at Seringapatam.  Barlow (1762-1846) was appointed to the Bengal Civil Service in 1778 and left India finally in 1812. He was Provisional Governor General of India c.1802-5 and made GCB in 1815. The defeat of Tipu Sultan by the British in 1799 took place while Barlow was the East India Company's Chief Secretary in Bengal. The Mysore ruler's treasury was broken up immediately after the defeat and many British residents in India collected souvenirs of what was seen as a seminal victory.",
