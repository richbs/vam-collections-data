There is a border on all sides with an openwork ground and satin stitch lozenges, each made from 8 triangles. These are offset so that there is one complete and two half lozenges in the pattern.  Every second whole lozenge is worked with pulled threads. On either side of this is a narrow border of needleweaving.  The centre panel has triangular corner units of pulled thread work forming a grid of holes.  There is a diagonal band of openwork and an edging of reciprocal diamonds.  The inner edge of the central panel is decorated with a line of small triangles and there is a hexagonal panel of openwork and needleweaving in the centre edged with triangles and reciprocal diamonds.\nCotton Thread: white, Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; floss [untwisted]",
