It probably represents the Roman military leader and statesman Lucius Junius Brutus, traditionally one of the first Consuls in 509 BC.  It formed part of the collection of theatrical memorabilia of the actor Robert Eddison and may have been collected for its possible theatrical connections since Julius Caesar and Brutus (of whom there is a companion piece bust in the collection) both appeared in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar.\n\nIt is more likely however that these have no theatrical reference and were produced and sold in Italy as souvenirs in the 19th century.",
