It includes a number of designs which should probably be associated with a later Matthias Lock, recorded at Clerkenwell Green in 1788-1797, who is probably his son. These include neo-classical mirror designs, and designs for foliate ornament. In 1769, a Matthias Lock published A New Book of Foliage for the Instruction of Young Artists and A New Book of Pier Frame's, Oval's, Gerandole's, Tables, &c, all in the neo-classical style. This is presumably also the son. The album therefore must have been compiled after the elder Lock's death in 1765. It was bought from a descendant, probably his grandson, George Lock, and had been exhibited by him at the International Exhibition held at South Kensington in 1862.",
