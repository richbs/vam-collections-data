Hoentschel enthusiastically followed Carri\u00e8s to St Amand-en-Puisaye, adopting the potter's life in about 1888-90. He made this large jardini\u00e8re in collaboration wirth a sculptor, Frederic Deschamps and it was donated to the Museum with a group of French furniture to represent the 'new art', otherwise known as art nouveau. As a collector, Hoentschel amassed French art from the middle ages to his own time.  By 1908 he had sold the major proportion of the earlier pieces to J.Pierpoint Morgan, who subsequently presented them to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.  Hoentschel donated his own collection of Carri\u00e8s' ceramics to the French state in 1900 after the much-loved potter's early death. In 1904 Hoentschel was exhibiting his own ceramics in the international exhibition in St Louis and towards the end of his life he returned to Paris to work at a friend's studio until his death in 1915.",
