Part of this set with a card-table are still owned by descendants of the family at Woolbeding, Midhurst, Sussex (1961).  There are, however, slight differences in the decoration and in the feet.  Also the chair is stamped with the initials 'I.P.' or possibly 'F.P.' A pair of similarly stamped chairs are in the Swaythling Collection (1965)",

Presumably, therefore, they are from different commissions, but made around the same time in the same workshop (probably Seddon, Sons and Shackleton).",
