Historically, this was one of the most important computer laboratories in the world, established in 1961 to allow British scientists access to some of the most advanced computing equipment of the time.  This print, along with four others by Shaw in the Computer Arts Society collection at the V&A, is a still from a computer animation entitled \u2018Symmetricks\u2019. Shaw produced this animation with the American artist and film-maker Stan Vanderbeek, whilst they were both working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) earlier in 1972.\n\nThis print was created using a spark pen \u2013 an electrical \u2018pen\u2019 capable of inputting graphical information into a digital computer using shock energy sound waves.  The waves were transferred from analogue to digital information and appeared on the computer screen as a series of dots, lines and characters, all white on black screen.  Using a computer program written by Shaw, the lines were then translated, rotated and re-scaled. The data was transferred onto large magnetic tapes, which were processed to produce 35 mm film, and, using the Atlas in-house photo lab, eventually printed as full size photographs.\n\nThe computer used to create these images was called a PDP-15 and contained only 32 KB (kilobytes) of memory.",

(Bob) Hopgood, in 1972 on a DEC PDP-15 vector drawing display, and output using a Stromberg Datagraphics imaging printer which the Lab acquired to help with UK Science Research Council projects such as star field mapping, economic simulation, and computer-aided design\".",

The New York Times printed a review of the survey on 12 September 1979, of which the V&A holds a copy.",
