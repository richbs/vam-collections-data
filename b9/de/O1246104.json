Founded by Sir William Ingram\u2019s father, Herbert Ingram, in 1842 the first edition was sold on 14th May 1842 at a cost of sixpence per copy. Building from an original circulation of 26,000 to in excess of 300,000 at its peak, <i>The Illustrated London News </i>remained in print until 2003 and commissioned illustrations from many of the leading artists of the late 19th century. Photographs were used alongside illustrations from the late 19th century onwards but illustrations were a major feature of paper until after the end of First World War.",
