It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a  coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThis example is en-tout-cas, a cross between a parasol and an umbrella and equally effective in wet and sunny weather. A small band, fastened with a button and ring, holds the cover closed when not in use, with a cord near the handle worn round the wrist when held cover- down. The decoration is provided at the handle end with prominent ivory rib tips and elaborate carving. Egyptian motifs such as this painted Pharaoh's head were popular at the beginning of the century and appeared often after the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb in 1923.",

Broughton died before he could be elevated to a peerage, their eldest son Urban H.R. Broughton (1896-1966) became 1st Baron Fairhaven of Lode on 20 March 1929, while Cara became 1st Lady Fairhaven. This barony became extinct on Urban H.R.Broughton's death, but a later barony, Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey, co. Cambridge, was granted to him in 1961, with a remainder to his brother, Henry (1900-1973), to enable this title to continue after his death without male heirs.\n\nThis forms part of a large donation of late 19th and early 20th century garments and accessories (with a few historical textiles) donated to the Museum in 1972 by Cara's grandson and Henry's son, Major Ailwyn Broughton and his wife, a year before Ailwyn became Lord Fairhaven following his father's death.",
