Rather loose embroidery.\nThe outer edge is worked with reciprocal diamond heads. There is a band of loose needleweaving either side of a wide border divided into lines of 4 squares loosely worked in pulled thread: a block of 4 lines in silk followed by 2 using metal thread - this arrangement is lost in the corners and is in blocks of 3 lines in silk down one side.  There is a band of diagonal lines around the central rectangle.  There are 2 patterns but the arrangement is irregular: a wider band of diamonds in metal thread, and lines of a closed mesh in either silk or metal thread. The central panel has three borders worked in silk, but each does not necessarily go round all 4 sides.  There are 4 corner squares inside in metal thread edged with reciprocal diamond heads.  The rest of the ground is undecorated.\n\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S, very regular twist\nMetal Thread: silver-gilt strip open S-wound on a white silk core.",
