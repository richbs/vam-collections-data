The puppeteers, members of hereditary groups, were positioned behind the screen and would hold and manipulate the puppets by their integral cane or bamboo sticks. The Ramayana would have been performed in its entirety and would have been accompanied by music as well as singing and narration. There are different styles of shadow puppets in various regions of India, and those of Karnataka are called Togalu Gombe Atta.",
