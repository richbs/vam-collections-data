It is possible that Agostino Busti (known as Bambaia) (1483-1548) designed it.  The attribution of the drawing to Bambaia must remain uncertain until a connection can be established between the drawing and a piece of scuplture known to be by him.  There is a certain resemblance between the figure of the woman clasping a column in this drawing and a marble figure of Fortitude by Bambaia in the Victoria and Albert Museum (museum number 4912-1858).  The resemblance, however, is not close enough to prove a connection between the drawing and the marble.  On the other hand, the figure and the others shown in the drawing are very similar to the small marble figures by Bambaia which have survived.  Other similarities between the drawing and Bambaia's sculpture include the three bas reliefs and the extra foot supporting the sarcophagus in the centre of the drawing.  These features can be compared to the remains of the Biragao monument on Isola Bella, Lake Maggiore, Piedmont, Italy.  It is also possible that the drawing may be by another sculptor of the same school but until a more convincing name is proposed, the drawing may be tentatively ascribed to Bambaia.",

Winner, 'Der Meister von 1515 und das Bambaia-Skizzenbuch in Berlin' in <i>Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen</i>, 6, 1964, fig. 42 and <i>passi</i><i>m</i>. The Woodburn sale catalogue attributes the drawing to Leonardo da Vinci and states that it was formerly in the collection of W. Y. Ottley. As Lawrence bought Ottley's collection of drawings through Woodburn, it is likely that this sheet was among them. It follows that Clausse, Nicodemi, and Dreyer and Winner are probably mistaken in asserting that it was bought by Woodburn in Milan in 1820. Robinson (<i>loc. cit.</i>) first attributed it to Bambaia and claimed that it was a design for the tomb of Gaston de Foix, begun in 1515 or soon afterwards, but never completed and subsequently broken up and dispersed. This hypothesis has never been disproved or proved. The drawing is by the same hand as the so-called Bambaia sketchbook in the Berlin-Dahlem Print room. Indeed the three panels of sculpture in relief above the sarcophagus are derived from three drawings in the sketchbook (see Dreyer and Winner, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 78, no. 10; pp. 79-80, no. 11; p. 81, no. 14 and accompanying illustrations). The two outers panels, representing a Barbarian price before a Roman emperor and an officer addressing his troops, are based on two bas-reliefs on the arch of Constantine at Rome. The middle panel, representing a battle, is probably also derived from an antique model, but it has not yet been recognised. Certain discrepancies between the antique and the two corresponding drawings in the Berlin sketchbook are repeated in the corresponding panels in our drawing; and our drawing follows the sketchbook in changing the shape of the panels, making them wider than they are high, instead of higher than there are wide as in the prototypes. It is established, therefore, that the three panels in our drawings are copied from the sketchbook. As Dreyer and Winner (<i>loc. cit.</i>) have observed, there is an equally close connection between the sketchbook and certain engravings by the so-called master of 1515 (see P. Kristeller,<i> Der Meister von 1515</i>, Berlin, 1916 and A.M. Hind, <i>Early Italian engraving</i>, 1948, 5, part 2, pp. 279-83). Some of the engraved architectural designs are based o drawings in the sketchbook. This fact and certain similarities suggest that the engravings and the drawings are by the same hand. Kristeller and Hind were inclined to believe that the Master of 1515 was a Northerner working in Italy. But dryer and Winner maintain that certain engravings with northern characteristics do not belong to the artist\u2019s oeuvre, and they believe that he was an Italian, possibly Bambaia. The attribution of our drawing to Bambaia, however, must remain uncertain until a connection can be established between a drawing and a piece of sculpture known to be by him. There is a certain resemblance between the statuette of a woman clasping a column in our drawing and a marble figure of Fortitude by Bambaia in the V&amp;A Museum (4912-1858; Pope-Hennessy and Lightbown, 2, p. 540, no 579, and 3, fig. 565). But the resemblance is not close enough to prove a connection between the drawing and the marble. On the other hand, this figure and the other statuettes shown in the drawings are decidedly reminiscent of the small marble figures that have survived from the hand of Bambaia; and the three bas-reliefs in the drawing have a close parallel in the three reliefs that are among the remains of the Birago monument on Isola Bella; what is more, the sarcophagus in the Birago monument is supported in the middle by an extra foot, in the form of a scroll, and this curious and unusual feature is found again in the sarcophagus in the drawing. In short, the design shows the kind of monument which we should expect Bambaia to create, judging by the fragments that have survived from the tombs of Gaston de Foix and Birago. It is possible, of course, that the drawing may be by another sculptor of the same school, but until a more convincing name is proposed, the drawing may tentatively be ascribed to Bambaia. If the drawing is by him, it clearly represents one of his more ambitious works, that is to say either the Birago or the Gaston de Foix monument among the works which are known to us. The most thorough study yet published of this and the other drawings is the article by Dreyer and Winner, on which this summary is based.\nRobinson, J.
