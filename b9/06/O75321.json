This example was probably cast from a wax by the Anglo-Danish sculptor Michael Henry Spang (whose statuette of Hogarth is also in the collection of the Museum; inv. no. 311-1885) after a plaster cast of the flayed body of an executed criminal.\n\nOn acquisition this figure was originally thought to be Italian, but Professor recently identified it as a work cast after Spang, whose wax model of this figure is in the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. Burch was awarded a premium for a bronze \u2018Cast of an anatomy figure, after Spang\u2019 at the Society of Arts, in 1767. Further bronze examples of this figure are known in other museum collections. Burch was a gem-engraver and sculptor, who had great success for more than two decades. His career declined from 1788 and from 1794 to 1812 he served as Librarian at the Royal Academy.",
