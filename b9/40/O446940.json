Under Yoshimitsu the Zen principles of restraint, understatement, economy of movement and frugality of expression became incorporated into the performance. By the early seventeenth century Noh had become an even more austere and formalised drama reserved almost exclusively for the military elite.\n\nThe mask of Zo-Onna is that of a slightly older woman (perhaps in her twenties) as indicated by the thinner face. The mask is used in many plays and is considered suitable for female roles which call for elegant refinement: for example, Rokujo in Nonomiya (The Shrine in the Field) or the Heavenly Maiden in Hagoromo (The Feather Mantle) might wear this mask.\n\nThe small elegantly sculpted mask is carved from a single piece of hinoki, cut across the grain of the wood. A thin layer of gofun has been built up over the carved wood and painted details applied. The fine features are emphasised by the high forehead and the restrained carving of the eyes which lack any pronounced details of the eyebrows. The nose is firm yet delicate and the bridge flows gracefully from the middle of the forehead. The mouth is small yet sensuous, the lips parted slightly to reveal the upper teeth.",

Suzuki has donated a number of masks since 1987 thereby enhancing the V&A\u2019s collections of masks which began in 1876 when we acquired 12 masks from Samuel Bing. \n\nDuring February and March 2002 in the Toshiba Gallery at the V&A, as part of the Japan 2001 Festiva, Suzuki displayed 12 masks in the exhibition \u2018The Spirit of Transformation: the Noh masks of Suzuki Nohjin\u2019 and subsequently donated six masks (FE.127 to 132-2002). \n\nIt was typical of Suzuki\u2019s friendship with the V&A that even on his death-bed that among his last thoughts he instructed a bequest of No masks \u2013 including a mask of Okina, a type that I had mentioned to Suzuki many years ago that we would dearly love to have in our collection.",
