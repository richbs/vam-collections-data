This style of women\u2019s outer garment developed in the twentieth century. It has a low, square neckline designed to reveal the kimono that would be worn underneath.  The coat was created by Kitamura Takeshi who has studied and recreated one of the earliest, and most sophisticated, Japanese gauze weaving techniques known as ra. It has a lattice pattern woven from silk thread dyed before weaving with a vegetable dye derived from pomegranates. The fabric was woven in 1993 and made up into a mickiyuki especially for the V&A in 1995, the same year that Kitamura was awarded the prestigious title of Living National Treasure.",
