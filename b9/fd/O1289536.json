She is watched from the left by the two cubist managers while the background suggests the set with its balustrades each side of a curtained opening and trees and buildings. It is signed W in the lower right corner.\n\nIn the ballet the Little American Girl is the second 'act', performing a solo in which she acts out scenes from silent movies. \n\nParade was created by Jean Cocteau (who had the idea and wrote the libretto), Pablo Picasso (designing his first ballet) and Erik Satie (composer), with choreography by L\u00e9onide Massine. It received its premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, on 18 May 1917. This drawing was probably made by White when the ballet was first performed in London in 1919. \n\nThe drawings by Ethelbert White were commissioned by the bookseller and publisher Cyril Beaumont and appear to have be intended as possible illustrations for a small book in the Impressions of the Russian Ballet series. Beaumont published twelve volumes documenting eleven ballets between 1918 and 1922.",
