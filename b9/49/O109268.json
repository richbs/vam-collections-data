The front seems to be made up of three horizontal planks forming a curve, nailed to the sides and supported by two brakets at the front, fitted in at a slant.

The emblems on this chest include the \u2018flames of love\u2019, the symbol of the Compagna della Calza, an order of knights based in Venice, to which Guidobaldo\u2019s illustrious father Frederico (1422\u20131482) had belonged. Chests with this distinctive shape were often strapped to the backs of mules or used as household furnishings. The married couple\u2019s life involved much travel and a brief spell in exile following the sacking of Urbino in 1502.",

            "history_note": "Elizabetta Gonzaga, brother of Marchesa Francesco Gonzaga, was betrothed to Guidobaldo da Montefeltro in 1486 and married to him in 1488. This object, which bears the coats of arms of both families,  could well have been made for this event. The object was bought by the South Kensington Museum in 1882 for \u00a315 from an unknown source in Florence.\n\n An inventory of Elisabetta\u2019s corredo trousseau, compiled around the 25th February 1488, lists:\n\u2018Venti forzieri, dieci lavorati d\u2019oro, dieci depinti a la divisa\u2019 (20 chests, 10 gilded, 10 painted with heraldic arms/devices). A. Luzio, R. Renier, Mantova e Urbino, Isabella d\u2019Este ed Elisabettaa Gongaza nelle relazioni familiari e nelle vicende politiche, (L roux e C. Editori, Torino-Roma, 1893), p.25\n\nHistorical significance: This chest is one of the few examples that shows - as far as can be seen from the outside of the display case - few signs of having been tampered with or subsequently 'improved' by dealers. Furthermore the coats of arms can be identified with  those of  Elisabetta Gonzaga combined with those of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, and the piece can be dated from the time of their marriage in 1489 until Guidobaldo's death in 1508. These two families were among the most important in Italy during the 15th century, although Guidobaldo's prestige waned somewhat following the sack of Urbino in 1502, and his inability to produce a son and heir. The emblems that can be identified are associated with Guidobaldo and his father Frederico, a highly successful <i>condottiere</i> or mercenary warlord, and may have been used for storage and travel, and at the same time upholding the honour of the da Montefelto family as much as celebrating his marriage to Elisabetta Gonzaga.",

A number of similar  chests, each painted with a single coat of arms, appeared on the art market after being sold off in 1880 by the Convent of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence.  These were known as 'Nuns' chests', and this example has been misidentified with them although in fact it refers to a specific marriage. It is painted with the combined arms of both families but also with emblems more identified with Guidobaldo than Elisabetta. It could well have served as a travelling chest, which would have been much needed during their brief exile, following the sacking of Urbino by Cesare Borgia in 1502.\n\nThornton suggests that this form of chest with a highly domed lid was called a goffano.",
