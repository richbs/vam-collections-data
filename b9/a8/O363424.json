In this instance the influence could be either that of parachute or flying kit. This is revealed by the cut of the jacket and the use of the zips as fastenings for the pocket, cuffs and the front.\n\nThe owner recalls that he bought the outfit at 'Browns' in South Molton Street, London , W1 in ca. 1970.",
