The sample shows three colourways of this pattern of stylised poppies and is typical of the Arts and Crafts designs employing floral motifs popular at the turn of the century. The fabric was manufactured by Warner & Sons for Liberty's, the London department store.\n\nLindsay P. Butterfield was one of the most important and successful designers of the period who produced repeating patterns for wallpaper and textiles and woven and printed fabrics. After training at art school in South Kensington, he established himself as a freelance designer and was a founder member of the Society of Designers. Butterfield sold his patterns to many of the most important manufacturers of the period, including G.P. & J. Baker and Thomas Wardle. The silk weaving firm of Warner & Sons, founded in 1870 by Benjamin Warner, manufactured a large range of traditional patterns as well as buying from the more avant-garde freelance designers like Butterfield.",
