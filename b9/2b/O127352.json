            "history_note": "Purchased by Robinson from the Gigli-Campana collection for \u00a330 before 1861. \nThe back is not carved and the rear sides only partially carved, indicating that the tabernacle was originally attached to a wall or placed in a niche. \nIt was previously believed to have served as the tabernacle for the Altar of the Sacrament in the Cathedral of Lucca, but recent archival research indicates that it stood on the Altar of the Sacrament in the baptistery (SS Giovanni and Reparata) in the same city (Filieri, 408-409).  A reference to a tabernacle commissioned in 1496 for the church of SS Giovanni and Reparata seems to refer to this tabernacle based on its original size, description of location and authorship.\n\nHistorical significance: The hexagonal tabernacle is an autograph work by Matteo Civitali.  Civitali was an important Renaissance sculptor from Lucca, who remained in his native city. The signature indicates that it must have been part of a larger commission, as his signature only appears on his major works, including the chapel which housed Lucca\u2019s most important relic, the Volto Santo (1484). Pope-Hennessy noted the similarities between the domed roof and lunettes of the tabernacle and the Chapel of the Volto Santo. The centralized plan and dome of the Chapel of the Volto Santo was most likely chosen in order to evoke the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (Petrucci, 146).  This is also likely true for the tabernacle.  As it was intended to hold the consecrated host, considered to be the body of Christ, believers would have drawn parallels between the early Christian chapel believed to mark the location of Christ's tomb and the form and function of the tabernacle.\n\nThe signature on the tabernacle led to the belief that the tabernacle was originally created in about 1473 for the Altar of the Sacrament in the Cathedral of Lucca, which was dismantled in 1567.  However, it appears that the tabernacle instead was part of the altar of the same name in the baptistery of Lucca.  \n\nPoeschke suggested that Civitali based his design for the tabernacle on that of Mino da Fiesole in Volterra cathedral, but given the revised dating, it would appear that the reverse is true.\n\nCivitali\u2019s tabernacle may in turn have served as the model for other tabernacles and ciboria; Rapetti noted that a ciborium in Monzone appears to have been based on the Lucca tabernacle, due to a similar cupola and lattice work on the sides (Rapetti, 241). However, the Monzone tabernacle is freestanding. Combined with the evocation of tile work on the dome, the absence of lunettes on the dome, and  the fluted pilasters separating panels of lattice work, the Monzone tabernacle is much closer to Benedetto da Maiano\u2019s tabernacle of 1464-1465 than to Civitali\u2019s work.",

            "historical_context_note": "Tabernacles are used to hold the consecrated host or relics.  The terms \u201cciborium\u201d and \u201ctabernacle\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, though strictly speaking the tabernacle holds the pyx which contains the consecrated host, while the ciborium is shaped liked a cup and directly holds the consecrated host. The pyx is an even smaller vessel designed to hold the wafer, and can be placed inside the tabernacle. During the early Christian period and the Middle Ages, there were no firm regulations on where the consecrated host was to be kept as long as it was secure. Two synods \u2013 at Cologne (1281) and M\u00fcnster (1279) \u2013 determined that the sacrament must be locked in a receptacle above the altar, but did not specify the type of container or a more specific location.  The sacrament was therefore preserved in either cupboards, pyxes, ciboria or tabernacles which could be in the sacristy, on the high altar, on a nearby altar. It could also be housed in small containers in the form of doves or chalices which were suspended over the altar.  This practice was especially popular in England and France from the tenth century until its prohibition in 1863, when the Catholic church determined that the host should be kept in tabernacles either on or near the high altar.  Tabernacles could be either freestanding or incorporated into the wall above the altar.  \n\nFree standing, temple-shaped tabernacles were popular in Renaissance Italy; particularly in Tuscany and nearby Liguria.  Desiderio da Settignano (c.1430-64) is credited with being one of the earliest artists to experiment with the freestanding \u201ctemple\u201d type of tabernacle in a lost work for San Piero Maggiore in Florence. Another significant work is Desiderio\u2019s wall tabernacle in San Lorenzo in Florence of about 1461, an early example of the genre that inspired many followers. Every major city in Tuscany from the 1460s -1480s had a freestanding tabernacle in its major church or hospital. Artists such as Mino da Fiesole (1429-84), Vecchietta (Lorenzo di Pietro, c.1410-80), and Benedetto da Maiano (1442-97), are credited with works in Pisa, Prato and Siena. (Cagliotti, 408).\n\nCivitali unusually combined the \u201ctemple\u201d format with the wall tabernacle.  Though it appears to follow the model of the freestanding temple form, its uncarved back indicates that it was meant to be either attached to the wall or placed in a niche.  The lattice work on the sides is reminiscent of Benedetto da Maiano\u2019s tabernacle in the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and also Vecchietta\u2019s bronze tabernacle now in the Duomo in Siena.  This may have been derived from the fourteenth-and fifteenth- century German practice of housing the Eucharist in \u201csacrament houses\u201d which contained latticed doors in order to allow the faithful to the view the Sacrament.",
