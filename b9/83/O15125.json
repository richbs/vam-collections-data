British artists also painted similar scenes to meet the demand from collectors. Clarkson Stanfield was regarded by many of his contemporaries as the best British marine oil painter of his time. His dramatic and accurate depiction of the sea in rough weather was thought preferable to Turner's misty and poetic paintings.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nHere the artist shows a fishing boat in difficulties in a storm, with the power of the waves manifest against the tiny craft. The Dogger Bank in the North Sea was one of the best areas for fishing, but was prone to sudden squalls, making the life of a poor fisherman even more hard and dangerous.\n\nPeople\nFrederick Clarkson Stanfield (1793-1867) was a painter in oils and watercolours, mainly of landscapes and marine views.  The son of an actor, J. F. Stanfield, he went to sea as a young boy and was press-ganged into the Royal Navy, but he left the service after being injured.  He painted stage scenery for theatres in London, where he was a friend and rival to the Scottish painter, David Roberts (1796-1864) with whom he also collaborated, making dioramas and panoramas.",

Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \n\nA Dutch Dogger Carrying Away Her Sprit (On the Dogger Bank) \n486-1882 Neg R9170 \nCanvas, 76.2 \u00d7 69.9 cm (30 \u00d7 27 \u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'C Stanfield. RA. 1846' diagonally bl \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nPainted for the artist Alfred Edward Chalon, a friend at the Sketching Society, and exhibited at the RA in 1846. Appended to the title (as above) in the RA catalogue were the lines, possibly composed by the artist himself: \n\nOn the Dogger Bank, in the cold North Sea, \nWearily day and night toil we; \nWeary, wet, hungry and cold, \nThree poor fishermen we, weakly and old. \n\nThe artist allowed the painting to be shown at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855, and it has become one of the most famous of Stanfield's works. \nThe Art Journal discussed the subject: \nthere is more matter in the picture than the song. It is a charming production, into which the artist has thrown a strong dash of sentiment. The poor little vessel is pitched into a trough, and the seas rise above her on all sides; the sprit has snapped like a twig, and half is gone overboard; but they cannot afford to lose even this, so one of the poor fellows, in his economical distress, is fishing up the splinter. There is so much movement in this picture that we take leave of the vessel with our very best wishes for her safety, and an irrepressible hope that when we see her again it may be in smoother water. \nRuskin especially admired Stanfield's technique: 'He will carry a mighty wave up against the sky and makes its whole body dark and substantial against the distant light using all the while nothing more than chaste and unexaggerated colour to gain the relief. His surface is at once lustrous, transparent and accurate to a hair's breadth in every curve'. \nVan der Merwe also comments (p171): 'It was not only the eye but the heart that was pleased by the virtuosity of his sea paintings; like several other marine pictures by Stanfield the sentimental element is not far removed'. \nA replica, dated 1847, was sold at Christie's 29 November 1912 (123). A watercolour, also exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1855 and lent by Chalon, may be connected with the present work. \nPROV: \tPainted for A E Chalon (not in his studio sale Christie's 11 March 1861); John Jones \nEXH: \tRA 1846 (22); Exposition Universelle Paris 1855 (939, lent by A E Chalon) \n\nLIT: Art Union 1846, p173; J Ruskin Works (Modem Painters I) III, 1903, p535; van der Merwe exhibition catalogue 1979, pp169-70 (cat no 311) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
