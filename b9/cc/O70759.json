The hollows in the clay were then filled with contrasting white pipe-clay. But the series of tiles found at Tring in Hertfordshire were made in a different way. Here a talented and humorous potter drew the tiles through a coating of white slip. He then scraped the background away to produce a kind of ceramic strip cartoon.",
