The plot was extraordinarily convoluted.  Medea, who has occult powers and a nasty temper, is engaged to King Aeg\u00e9e, who falls in love with his ward, Agel\u00e9, who is loved by a mysterious stranger Thes\u00e9e, who is desired by Medea; to complicate matters, Thes\u00e9e is the long-lost son of Aeg\u00e9e.  The sub-plot is an equally tangled love triangle. Like many operas of the period, it also included allusions to contemporary events, like King Louis XIV's personally leading military campaigns along the French-German border. \nChildish or not, Thes\u00e9e proved to be Jean-Baptists Lully's most popular opera and was regularly revived over the next hundred years.",

            "history_note": "It is impossible to work out which role Magny might have played in this entertainment, which one contemporary critic called 'a little childish'.  The plot of Jean-Baptiste's opera Thes\u00e9e was extraordinarily convoluted.  Medea, who has occult powers and a nasty temper, is engaged to King Aeg\u00e9e, who falls in love with his ward, Agel\u00e9, who is loved by a mysterious stranger Thes\u00e9e, who is desired by Medea; to complicate matters, Thes\u00e9e is the long-lost son of Aeg\u00e9e.  The sub-plot is an equally tangled love triangle. \nChildish or not, Thes\u00e9e proved to be Jean-Baptists Lully's most popular opera and was regularly revived over the next hundred years.\nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest\u2019s A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
