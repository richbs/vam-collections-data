Barcelona, 1945); Llu\u00ecs Morillas (b.Barcelona, 1958) and Josep Puig (b.Terrassa, 1955). The stool was part of the group's Sensual Furniture project ('Mobiliaro Sensual: Metamorfosis') which was intended to bring erotic content into the context of stylish furniture. The Frenes\u00ed, for example has a phallic diagonal support, highlighted comically by a pink rubber tip, the leather seat gathers itself around the sitter's rear. This is an unusually explicit example of the provocative, image-driven design that was typical of 1980s Postmodernism. \nThe chair was not designed for a particular interior but bar use in general. The 'design bar' was a characteristic phenomenon of the Spanish Postmodernism. It was a highly-orchestrated and sometimes thematic space for drinking cocktails, seeing and being seen. Though such bars existed in Madrid, the most famous and fashionable ones were located in Barcelona.",

The project was entitled 'Mobiliaro Sensual: Metamorfosis' (Sensual Furniture: Metamorphosis). It was intended to bring erotic content into the context of stylish furniture. Puig says in an interview (2010) quoting M\u00e0rius Carol: 'This first programme of sensual furniture consist(ed hic) of provocative avant-garde objects that blend irony and provocation, the wink and the smile.' The Frenes\u00ed stool, for example, has a phallic diagonal support, highlighted comically by a pink foam rubber tip; the leather seat gathers itself around the sitter's rear. This is an unusually explicit example of the provocative, image-driven design that was typical of 1980s Postmodernism. Though intended for bar use, the group of furnitures was not designed for a specific interior.\n\nHistorical significance: Spanish design in the 1980s was, to a large extent, an offshoot of the Postmodernism that had been pioneered in Italy. However it also had distinct characteristics. One of these was the phenomenon of the 'design bar'. It was a highly-orchestrated and sometimes thematic space for drinking cocktails, seeing and being seen. Though such bars existed in Madrid, the most fashionable ones were located in Barcelona.",

Puig recalls, they were looking for a name that evoked sophistication, luxury in a way and international connection (union between continents). The name was also intended to express the connection with artistic and cultural movements of the moment. The group had strong connections to the Italian radicals through Benedito and they were also well aware of Sottsass's work. The group broke up in 1989, when the members decided to return to their own studios full time.",
