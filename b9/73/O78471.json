They were then turned on a lathe to remove excess metal and to finish off the surface.  The bases were sometimes fitted with small feet, usually in the form of seated lions.  Since these have nearly always been removed, they may have been thought to make the candlesticks too unstable.  Their substantial height and heavy, solid construction made them very suitable for lighting domestic interiors. The very tall versions were frequently used as altar candlesticks, since they looked very imposing at a distance.\n\nTrading\nCandlesticks of this form were manufactured in one of the great brass-making centres of 15tth-century Europe, such as Nuremberg in Germany and Dinant in France. Some have been found in 15th-century wrecks filled with the cargoes of Flemish brass merchants. Judging from the number that have survived, they were made in large quantities and widely exported.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThese candlesticks would have been expensive items when they were made and would have been almost certainly used with beeswax candles.  In the 15th century candles were made from tallow - animal fat - or beeswax.  Beeswax was much more expensive but burned with a clear, bright flame, did not smell and melted comparatively slowly.",
