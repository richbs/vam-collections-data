It was here that the students and actors publicised their strike action, the start of the Velvet Revolution, on 18 November 1989.\n\nPosters put up secretly at night were initially torn down by the police, but they soon became too numerous to deal with and were left on display.  Many of them were individual expressions of support made by hand by ordinary people.\n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
