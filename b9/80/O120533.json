Steve Howlett.\n\nSteve Howlett made this vessel by lathe-turning a solid piece of unseasoned sycamore until it was only two or three millimetres thick.  He chose sycamore because of the subtle ripples in the grain. Because the timber was unseasoned it continued to dry for several weeks after it was turned. Howlett explained that \"uniform growth rings and straight grain will result in an even distortion, wild grain produces wild distortion.  How the wood is aligned on the lathe initially will determine whether the distortion of form will be symmetrical or asymmetric.\" The final form recalls the shapes of exotic trumpet flowers as well as being a celebration of the possibilities of shaping wood.",
