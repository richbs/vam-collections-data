            "public_access_description": "This is one sheet of eight that come  together to make a map of London.   The map is a copy, engraved by  George Vertue in 1737, of a famous  map of London from the 16th Century  supposedly by Ralph Agas a known  land surveyor.  The dating of the  original map to 1560 and the  attribution to Agas are now both  questioned.  The map shows the  development of London from two  separate cities of London and  Westminster.  It portrays clearly the  division of the power of the court in  Westminster and the institutions of  the City of London itself bordered by  Saint Paul's and the Tower of London.   This map shows how the expanding  city was beginning to breach its old  medieval walls.  The map is also full of  charming incidental detail of everyday  life: the swans bobbing on the river,  women laying linen out to dry, farmers  hunting, ship-building and driving  cattle into the river.  The decision by  Vertue to engrave and publish this old  map of London in the 18th century is  indicative of their awareness of and  interest in history.  However, there are  doubts as to the honesty with which  Vertue re-engraved the older map.  It  has been suggested that Vertue  doctored the map whilst copying it in  order to make it appear older than it  actually was in order to fool his  antiquary contemporaries.",
