The lizard and the mouse were copied from drawings by Georg Hoefnagel (1542-1600), engraved by his eldest son Jacob Hoefnagel (1575-1640).  \n\nGeorg Hoefnagel worked in Prague at the court of the Emperor Rudolf II where he could study the Emperor's gardens and all the plants and animals they contained first hand.  His engravings were first published in a collection in Amsterdam in 1592 and reflect the strong interest in natural history of the period.  More than a century later they provided a rich source of designs for the Vienna porcelain factory.",

'The simplicity of the tall tureen shape, with its ribbed volute handles is derived from early eighteenth century silver or pewter forms.  The inside rim of the tureen is unglazed and the cover originally belonging to is is now missing.'  See also nos. 82 and 84 for the engravings by Hoefnagel illustrating the mouse and lizard copied by the painters of this tureen.\n\nSee correspondence on Object Information File between Hilary Young and Claudia Lehner-Jobst, 26/01/2005: HY '...the print source for the mouse on the deep tureen has been traced to a book in the V&A,  Birds and Flowers by Various Artists pressmark 93.D.120...'  CL-J 'I have found the mouse also on an original print in the archive of the Museum of Applied Arts here in Vienna, by Johann Baumgartner.
