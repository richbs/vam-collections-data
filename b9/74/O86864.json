It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nDouble Harness by Edward Poor Montgomery opened on 8 May 1933 for a week, as part of the post-London tour. Advertised in Brighton as: 'direct from the Haymarket and Apollo Theatres', it was praised as a powerful production 'which speaks quite plainly about the pitfalls of marriage, and although very modern is devoid of cynicism'.  In London the part of Sybil Livingstone was played by Mary Ellis, with Owen Nares as John Rockingham, the part played by Harold Anstruther on tour.",
