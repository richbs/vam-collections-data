London : Futures Publications, 1991. p.100.\nThe relevant excerpt is as follows: \n\n'<i>Bringing the LCO back to life</i>. Working with Carroll Dempsey and Thrikell (established in 1979), Mike Dempsey and Charlotte Richardson (b.1960) have designed sleeves for the revivified London Chamber Orchestra (LCO), which is seeking to break-down ambivalent attitudes to orchestral music amongst younger listeners. Aided by the energetic Nigel Warren-Green and the money and freedoms granted by the Virgin Classics label, set-up by an ex-EMI classical employee, Dempsey and Richardson have gone beyond the fresh but ultimately anodyne effects of many 'wine label' classical sleeve designs, to create a sharp profile for the LCO's vigourous recordings of Mozart (1756-1791), Vaughan Williams (1872-1958), Benjamin Britten (1913-1976), Nick Bic\u00e2t (b.1949), and others. Dempsey's spirited economy for musically-related products first saw the light of day on the dust-jackets of Faber & Faber music books. He believes everyone is now sensitive to good design, so that consumer seduction can only be fully achieved through the use of original, high-quality, graphics. Care for the LCO's record packaging extends to intriguing typographical layouts which recall the four sided 'table-scores' of the late sixteenth century. The bold copy, crystal-clear imagery and multi-directional typography of the sleeves is, as per usual, applied to sundry LCO programmes, posters and press advertisements.'",
