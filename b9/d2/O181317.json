The part of the wall reproduced is painted with two frescos, the originals of which are the work of Benozzo Gozzoli. In the larger is a chois of angels in a landscape with a town on the right. The other represnets a pastoral scene, and fits a long narrow piece of wall over a tarsia door. The blue ceiling is decorated with a large gilt wreath, enclosing the sacred monogram amid rays also in gold. The portion of the dado beneath the large fresco is composed of four large circular slabs of red and green porphyry, and colured marbles, surrounded by a border of rings and floral ornament, alternating. In the corners and middle of the border are the arms of the Medici family. This family's badge, a diamond ring with the words 'Semper', is freely used in the decoration of the chapel. The floor is covered with an eleborate mosaic of slabs of red and green porphyry and coloured marbles.",
