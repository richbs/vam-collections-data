The chair was part of the furnishings of a Gothic Revival castle that was built to his designs at Dromore in Ireland. It formed part of a set of two armchairs and sixteen chairs, for use in the dining room.",

            "history_note": "This armchair is one of a pair of armchairs, designed with sixteen chairs by Godwin for the dining room, at Dromore Castle, Co. Limerick, Ireland. The furniture was part of a very large architectural and interior furnishing commission from the 3rd Earl of Limerick and the specification between the Earl and William Watt, the maker of the furniture, was drawn up by Godwin.  The dining chairs were to be made in 'wainscot oak oiled with cushions & backs of fine horsehair covered with common tanned uncoloured leather with stamped pattern in gold' (RIBA MC GOE/1/7/4). All the chairs were sold at the Dromore auction in 1949.\n\nIn 1966 the Department of Circulation acquired this armchair and six chairs, originally designed for Dromore, from Mrs. R.C. Mackenzie. Originally only the armchair (Circ.719-1966) and two side chairs (Circ.720 & 721-1966) were given Museum numbers. On 16th February 1966 Hugh Wakefield, Keeper of the Department, explained to the Director that the proposal was to give four of the chairs 'C' numbers (C22567, C22568, C22569 & C22570) and keep them for exchange with other museums, or as gifts to other museums. Only one chair, C22568, was given to the Museum fur Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg (inv. no. 1967.62).  The three other chairs with C numbers were lent to Leighton House, London, in 1967, along with Circ.721-1966.  They were subsequently given extension numbers to Circ. 721-1966.",
