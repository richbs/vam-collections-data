            "public_access_description": "The practice of decorating wooden furniture wood with contrasting inlays was used by the craftsmen of Ancient Egypt. It continued to flourish during the Medieval period in Islamic cities such as Cairo and Damascus, where dense patterns were created using tiny inlaid pieces of bone or ivory and various woods. The technique seems to have been adopted in both Spain and Italy, particularly Venice from about 1450, and used particularly on boxes and chests like this one. References in Italian 16th-century inventories to chests alla veneziana (in the Venetian style) may refer to this style of decoration. During the 19th-century it came to be known as alla certosina work, because it was thought that Carthusian monks specialised in the technique, though there is no good evidence of it. \n\nThis chest once belonged to Jules Soulages (d. 1856) who created a notable collection of Renaissance artworks from about 1825, which he kept at his home in Paris, (and later in Toulouse). This chest was restored in Toulouse during his ownership. His collection was considered so important that it was exhibited in London (1857), and then purchased for the South Kensington Museum (which later became the Victoria and Albert Museum).",

Bought (Soulages Coll.), 40l\nThe front is divided into three flat panels. The general decoration is a repetition of stars, circles, etc., formed out of minute squares, triangles, or diamond shapes, having one long point. It is a piece of Certosino work, and the Indian character of this portion of the work will be recognised at once. In this instance there are, combined with the star-like compositions, rolling lines and curves representing scrolls and pots of flowers, adding the Persian and Turkish element, of decoration to the severer work. The inside is surrounded with receptacles for ornaments, cosmetics, etc., on three sides, some being tiny drawers, and some covered compartments; these are of various sizes. Few of the Museum specimens of Certosino inlay surpass this for completeness, or as a specimen of effect obtained from the hand of traditionary workers without the advantages of artistic training or knowledge of design in the higher sense.\nVictoria and Albert Museum, Fifty masterpieces of Woodwork (London 1955), plate 10\nBODE, Wilhelm: Die Italienischen Hausm\u00f6bel der Renaissance .

It seems to have been a version of taracea produced in the lands of the Crown of Aragon, especially in Catalonia, and employs a completely different, much simpler technique, in which small shaped pieces are individually inset into carved hollows in the wood. It is possible that furniture like this chest may have been made specifically for the Italian market. (M. Rosser-Owen, 2010).\n\nBought for \u00a340.

More likely to be Spanish production - the designs are always non-figurative, based on abstract geometric ornament, especially starbursts, and sometimes floral motifs. The sixteenth-century date is indicated by the occasional use of Renaissance motifs, such as the elaborate flower pots on the front of this chest. (M. Rosser-Owen, 2010).",
