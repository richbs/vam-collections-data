He is seizing its tail with his left hand and raising his right hand to strike the dragon with a sword, now missing. The saint is dressed in a cloak with tasselled edges over a long belted robe. He is also wearing a maniple. This is a strip of fabric worn by a priest on his left arm during Holy Communion.\nThe base forms part of the statuette which the sculptor has carved in the round. It has lost all traces of paint. \nStatuettes of St Michael would have been found everywhere in Brussels, both in the home and in private and guild chapels. People would have used them to help them pray and as protection from evil, temptation and sin.",
