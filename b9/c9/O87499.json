Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day. Together with Thomas Wardle,  Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century.\n\nMorris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. Thomas Wardle took over his father's silk dyeing business, and like Morris, became interested in Eastern patterns. He bought work from many leading designers and manufactured textiles for Morris & Co.",
