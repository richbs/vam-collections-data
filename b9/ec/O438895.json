            "physical_description": "This Jain stele shows a carved figure of a <i>tirthankara</i> in padmasana posture, seated upon a lion throne with attendant <i>chauri</i> bearers and celestial beings above either side of a lotus-decorated canopy surmounting an aureole ornamented with lotus petals.  This may be a representation of the first <i>tirthankara</i>, Rsabhanatha, who is distinguished by two locks of hair which fall either side of his long-lobed ears onto his shoulders.  The carving is for the Digambara sect of the Jain religion as the figure is nude.  The usual diamond-shaped <i>srivatsa</i> in the middle of the chest is missing, but the carving is damaged at this point, so it may well have had one formerly.  The jina is shown in contemplation with his hands in <i>dhyana</i> mudra (with the right hand palm facing up over the left one in the middle of his lap).  His eyes are half closed in meditation.  He is shown with his hair in tight coils rising to an <i>ushnisha</i> on top of his head.  He is seated on a circular cloth decorated with a border showing two diamond-shaped flowers and a circular one in the centre. This is draped over the edge of his throne which is supported on two recumbent lions.\n      Two attendant <i>chauri</i> bearers are standing on the edge of the throne facing the jina. The left-hand one, who holds his whisk downwards, has a damaged face, while the other on the right hand side holds his whisk at shoulder height.  Above them on either side are trios of two celestial devotees and a garland bearer.\n      The throne rests on a plain pedestal in the centre of which is carved in low relief the representation of a  <i>yakshi</i> with four arms seated within a trefoil-headed niche.  This is probably Cakresvari, who appears to have four arms, with the upper left hand possibly holding a cakra, which is one of her attributes.",
