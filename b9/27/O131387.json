Munro Cautley, Suffolk churches and their treasures, (5th ed. Woodbridge 1982, first publ. 1937) p.179\n\nLabel suggests that a centre table was later adapted to draw-leaf formula.\n\nSS Jervis (17 May 1979 note on RP) suggests the following: \nRestorations: many mouldings and one loper\nMoresque inlay of high quality on the top, in the centre and four corners now incomplete\nLegs articulated as square columns with inlaid fluting and in contrasting woods, and between the legs are elongated arches\nProvenance: Folke Manor, near Sherborne, Dorset (minor house, no other information available)\nSize (and consequent immobility) strongly suggest an English provenance as do massive proportions of the top.
