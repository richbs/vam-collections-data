He is best known for his invention of the mobile, a term devised by Marcel Duchamp in response to Calder\u2019s innovative kinetic sculptures in the early 1930s. \n\nBy his own account, his first jewellery was made for his sister\u2019s dolls when he was aged 8, out of discarded copper wire. Wire remained an important element in his larger work and his preferred material for jewellery. He worked in both silver and brass, either hammering or twisting the wire to achieve strong, simple forms. \n\nThis bracelet made from an undulating length of flattened silver wire was made for the donor\u2019s mother, American artist Audrey Skaling. Her husband, the architect Stamo Papadaki, had first met Calder in Paris in the 1930s and subsequently the families were close neighbours in Connecticut for many years. Skaling clearly took great pleasure in this tactile and satisfying piece, and her daughter recalls that she \u2018never saw her without it\u2019.",
