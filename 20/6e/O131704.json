On this chair the carved crest rail and pyramidal finials on the back uprights are characteristics of chairs made in southern Lancashire and northern Cheshire from about 1650. The geometrical pattern in the back panel was 'chip-carved' into the surface, using chisel or knife blades. The chair came to the Museum in 1898 from the collection of Charles H. Marshall of East Retford, a notable collector of British furniture.",
