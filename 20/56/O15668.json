The hip-length tailored jacket is tightly fitted and the skirt falls in a full, soft line. The bright strawberry red and black braid trimming gives the outfit a military flavour. \n\nThe original owner bought the outfit for \u00a322 at the Bon March\u00e9 store in Liverpool and wore it at her wedding.",

Both bride and groom were students at the London School of Economics. The bride-to-be went shopping with her aunt for her outfit. They purchased the suit for \u00a322 at the Bon Marche in Liverpool with clothing coupons donated by fellow-students. It was one of the first 'new look' costumes Rachel had seen. Her aunt gave her a small piece of net to wear on her head during the service. She had no attendants. Following the wedding the couple had a few days honeymoon staying at an old inn in Burford before returning to college. (Telephone conversation with Mrs. Foster, April 2010.)\n\nNote from Mrs. Foster and Miss. Blumstein.  It appeared in the '60 Years of Fashion' film, December 1959.",
