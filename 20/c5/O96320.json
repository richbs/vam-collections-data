Therefore the the date of the painting can be narrowed down to 1760 - 1763.\nRobert Skelton pointed out that an invention of the Murshidabad painters, viz the introduction of a slightly bloated expression produced by fine stippling on unnaturally grey or brownish white faces, had appeared faintly in this picture.",
