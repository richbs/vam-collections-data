            "history_note": "The company which made this plate was founded by Sampson Hancock, a prominent Wesleyan, in 1857.  It was renamed S. Hancock & Sons (Potters) Ltd. in 1935 and closed in 1937, having been put into receivership on 23rd March. It was a relatively small enterprise, employing around 150 people. Sampson Hancock died on 9th May 1900 and was succeeded in the business by his sons, Jabez, Harry and Arthur. \n\nThe company produced tablewares and fancies for the popular market - its main income being from semi-porcelain and earthenware tablewares, toilet wares, vases and vitreous hotel wares. Many of the products, including ironstone china, were for export markets. Before WW1 they were represented in London by M.V.V. Adams and had showrooms at 9 Charterhouse Street, Holborn Circus.  In 1904 they produced a range of blue plaques commemorating famous authors and this may belong to that group.\n\nAfter World War 1 the company increased its production of ornamental and decorative wares. These included children's wares and doll's heads. Boxed teasets for children were being produced by 1917 featuring popular nursery rhymes and pictures of children. The company also produced a range of crested wares, these being marked with the trade name The 'Duchess' China or The 'Corona' China and Grosvenor Ware. These may have been produced in quantity to see the company through the war years when skilled labour was unavailable. Pieces included animals, small decorative dishes and Great War commemoratives, or had English or Welsh crests. Crested ware appears to have been made until the 1920s.\n\nOne of the main decorative ranges produced by the company was Morris Ware. This included many tube-lined patterns which resembled the Moorcroft productions and may have been intended to compete with that company. George Cartlidge was the first designer of this type of ware but the range continued with other designers. Morris ware was much praised in the trade press of the time which noted that foreign buyers at the British Industries Fair had shown interest in the range and it is now actively collected. \n\nThe company employed many different designers who each produced new ranges of wares and frequently signed their wares.  Their factories were in the following locations:\n\n1857 - 1870  Victoria Street, Tunstall\n1881 - 1891  Bridge Pottery, Shelton (noted in Jewitt)\n1892 - 1920  Gordon Works, Wolfe Street, Shelton\n1920 - 1930  Gordon Pottery, Old Burton Place Works, off New Street, Hanley\n1923 - 1937  Corona Pottery, Hanley",
