Clothes can often provide clues for dating: the girl is wearing a scoop-necked blue dress with elbow-length sleeves, a full skirt and a stiffened bodice. For most of the 18th century, however, older children\u2019s fashions were slow to change and tended to resemble those worn by adults. For this reason it can be difficult to work out the date of an anonymous portrait by the style of a child\u2019s clothes. It is analysis of the paint used in this portrait that has dated it to about 1730.",
