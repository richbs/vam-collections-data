Although the design and workmanship are based on traditional Arab jewellery of the time, this example was probably made for European tastes.  Traditional urban bracelets in the region were made of solid twisted wire, and nomadic jewellery was much sturdier and heavier, usually consisting of a stiff penannular band.  \n\nIt was described as \u2018Modern Egyptian\u2019 when it was acquired by the Museum, with its pair, in 1869.  Traditional jewellery of all kinds was very popular in Britain in the 19th century, and bracelets like this could be easily acquired there from retailers such as Liberty, which imported large quantities of traditional jewellery from Egypt and Syria in the late 19th century.\n\nThe name of these bracelets was recorded as asawir, which is a generic Arabic word for bracelets.",
