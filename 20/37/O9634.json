The entire composition was designed by the Mughal artist Kanha, and the details on this side were painted by Nanha. The illustration depicts an unidentified episode in 1567 on the bank of the river Ganges in north-east India, preceding the defeat of the rebel general Khan Zaman by the Mughal army.\n\nThe Akbarnama was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605) as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written in Persian by his court historian and biographer, Abu\u2019l Fazl, between 1590 and 1596, and the illustrations to the V&A\u2019s partial copy of the manuscript were painted concurrently by the royal artists.  Many of these are listed by Abu\u2019l Fazl in the third volume of the text, the A\u2019in-i Akbari, and some of these names appear in the V&A illustrations, written in red ink beneath the pictures, showing that this was a royal copy made for Akbar himself. After his death, the manuscript remained in the library of his son Jahangir, from whom it was inherited by Shah Jahan.\n\nThe V&A purchased the manuscript in 1896 from Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.",
