Water jets emerge from the mouths of each of the female figures and from the mouths of the stags.\n\nThe lower part of the central column is fluted, the top has a gadrooned border.

From the collection of the Marquess of Downshire at Easthampstead Park.\n\nThis fountain has been attributed by Dr. Weihrauch of Bayerisches National Museum to an Augsburg workshop influenced by Joachim Forster and Christoph Weiditz.\n\nSee Bange, E. F.,<u> Die Deustchen Bronzestatuetten des 16 Jahrhunderts</u>, Berlin, Deutscher Verein f\u00fcr Kunstwissenschaft, 1949, fig. 178 and pl. 58 for figures of Actaeon attributed to the Georg Labenwolf workshop and the Dutch master Alexander Colin.\n\nHistorical significance: This fountain displays the Classical Greek myth of Actaeon and the Goddess Artemis (Diana). According to the legend, Actaeon stumbled across the naked Artemis bathing in the forest while hunting. To prevent him from telling anyone what he saw, Artemis turned Actaeon into a stag. The hunter then becomes the hunted when Actaeon is torn to pieces by his own hunting dogs. The sculpture emphasises this aspect of the story; Actaeon holds a spear and hunting horn in his hands as his hounds spring up to attack him. The depiction of this story highlights Renaissance interests in classical myth, however it also echoes the use of the object. As Artemis was discovered bathing in a fountain, the table fountain itself is part of the expression of the story.",

Water would have cascaded from the mouths of the hounds, from Actaeon and the hunting horn, probably into a catch bowl underneath the fountain. This decorative centre piece would have been used to delight and entertain dinner guests. Table fountains of different shapes and materials survive from the late middle ages including examples in gold and silver. Elaborate fountains were commissioned by royalty and nobility as important displays of wealth and style. Albrecht D\u00fcrer designed a table fountain for display at a Civic Banquet table in Nuremberg around 1500 (British Museum). Henry VIII commissioned a design for a table fountain from Hans Holbein the Younger, which displayed the badge of Boleyn upon it (Kunst Museum Basel).",
