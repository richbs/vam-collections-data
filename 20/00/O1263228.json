A manufacturers label has been cut away from the back of the bodice.\n\nThere are two labels stitched into the back of the bodice, one of top of the other. The one of the bottom seems to read 'PNITRITE SWIMWEAR' and the one on the top reads 'MAIDS'. They are both embroidered in red thread.\n\nThis bathing costume is part of larger gift given to the Museum by Daphne Pearce who wore the clothes as a young girl growing up in the Northern suburbs of London. The clothes are all in pristine condition and were worn from the 1950s to 1960s and show a range from baby wear to pre-teen years, approximately 12.
