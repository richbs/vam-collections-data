They had bought it from Henry Longden & Co. of Sheffield, a well-established 19th-century company.  As the Carron Company today have been unable to find the design for it in their archives, it has been presumed to have been made by Longden.  However, it has been discovered that the trade-card of a London iron-founder named Henry Jackson of 150 Saffron Hill (near Smithfield market) illustrates two grates very similar in design to the V&A's example.  These have the same vase-shaped finials, seven-ball mouldings and applied oval panels decorated with swags.  It seems likely, therefore, that this dog-grate was one of Jackson's products.  It was originally supplied with a cast-iron fender, decorated to match the grate.",
