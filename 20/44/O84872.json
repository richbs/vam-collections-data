He was billed as \u2018the Original Comedian, Manipulator of Cards\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Carlton was on the bill topped by Hardeen, the Handcuff King, another of Cooke\u2019s subjects.\n\nArthur Carlton Philps (1881\u20131942) specialised in card manipulation and fake hypnotism, with comedy patter. He made his first stage appearance in Newcastle in 1901. Afterwards he became known as \u2018The Human Hairpin\u2019 because of his tall, thin appearance. This was accentuated by his elevated shoes, high bald skullcap and black leotard. Also billed as \u2018The Champion Card Manipulator\u2019 or \u2018The Hanki-Homey Showman\u2019, Philps appeared for a month at the Coliseum Theatre in London in May 1906, at the Palace Theatre and on a Stoll Moss tour. Later in his career, when he was no longer so hairpin-like, he played the Dame in pantomime.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall performer Carlton, Arthur Carlton Philps (1881-1942), known as The Great Carlton, or 'The Human Hairpin', performing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 10 July 1905 when he was billed as 'Carlton, the Original Comedian, Manipulator of Cards.'  He was on the bill topped by Hardeen, the Handcuff King, another of Cooke's subjects (S.393:11-2002). A review in <i>The Staffordshire Sentinel</i> wrote of his performance: \"Carlton, a comedian with a patter most entertaining, goes through a most interesting performance with cards, which he manipulates in an extraordinary way.'\n\nBorn in London, Carlton started work as a doorman at the Royal Aquarium, Westminster, but developed his own conjuring act of card manipulation and fake hypnotism. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke. It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
