Several Staffordshire factories specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This represents Isabella Glyn (1823-1889) as Lady Macbeth.  Isabella Glyn was born Isabella Gearns in Edinburgh but took her mother's name Glyn as her stage name.  She made her debut at Manchester in King John in 1847 and appeared in Shakespearean parts on the York circuit before making her London debut at the Olympic Theatre in 1848 as Lady Macbeth. She played this role again in 1850 at Sadler's Wells, where she was Samuel Phelps's leading lady, from 1848 to 1851, and in 1859.  \n\nThe pose was copied from an engraving published in Tallis's Shakespeare Gallery, 1852-1853, showing Lady Macbeth reading a letter in Macbeth's castle. At least seven earthenware portrait figurines are known to have been copied from this source and are known as Tallis figures.  They were made in many sizes, probably by the Burslem potters Thomas Parr (who was working from 1852 until 1870), John Parr, (working from 1870 to 1879), or the Kent & Parr firm, (working from 1880 until 1894). These manufacturers passed the moulds to each other and the figures were produced throughout the Victorian period.",
