Throughout the south of Italy, the main material used to add a red colour to jewellery was coral, but in the north garnets were more common.  This comb, which comes from Parma, is made of plated metal set with red pastes, in imitation of gold and garnets.  \n\nIn the south of Italy, particularly in those places which had been under Spanish rule, many women wore decorative combs in their hair, as part of their traditional costume.  In Parma, and the rest of the north, large hair pins were more common.  Although it was acquired as a piece of traditional jewellery, this comb is not distinctive, and was probably worn with fashionable dress.  \n\nIt was bought for \u00a32 12s as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
