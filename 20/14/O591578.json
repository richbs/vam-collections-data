Size of volumes 22.8 x 18.4 cm \nGiven by the designer\nE.2062, 2063-1952\n\nThese sketch-books were made by a designer working for the traditional lighting and metalwork firm of Perry &amp; Co of Grafton Street, W.1 from about 1909 to 1935. Their products included straightforward reproductions and pieces based on time-approved designs catering for a public with expensive middle-of-the-road rather than avant-garde tastes. These studies provide an example of the Museum's collections being used as guidance by an employee of a standard manufacturer.\n\nVolume E.2062 is open at a page of drawn copies, including to the left a scale study of a folding lantern frame. E.2063 shows a candlestick from the Museum's collection. An 18th century pattern book of silver and Sheffield plate (cat. no. 1.8.a) was donated to the Museum by the designer at the same time as these volumes of his own drawings.\n\nSL'",
