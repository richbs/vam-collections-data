From 1914-17, he was apprenticed to a sculptor, working in his parent's workshop and from 1917-19, he was a student at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts.  In 1919 he joined the Bauhaus in Weimar where he was a student of Johannes Itten for the next three years and in 1926, he assumed the management of his father's workshop, back in Vienna.\n\nHis early success was as a painter.  From the 1940s onwards he began to gain an increasing reputation as a designer for domestic wares which was internationally acknowledged at the Milan Triennale in 1954 where he won four gold medals for his designs.",
