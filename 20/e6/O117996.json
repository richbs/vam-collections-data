            "public_access_description": "Every bride is a queen on her wedding day.  \n\nThroughout the world brides wear special jewellery, such as tiaras or crowns, to reflect this.  In Scandinavia, bridal crowns are the most spectacular part of the wedding jewellery.  Their design is based on medieval royal originals, and they are made of heavy silver, often gilded.  They were supported by a ring of padded cloth which rested on the bride's head.\n\nIn Norway all brides wore some kind of special headdress.  In the south and east of the country it was usually made of cloth or other material, smothered with ribbons, beads and silver appliqu\u00e9s.  Bridal crowns were mainly used in the west of Norway.  They were always expensive, and were handed down as heirlooms in wealthy farming families. Brides from poorer families borrowed them from their richer neighbours.  Bridal crowns usually had their own special case, made of painted wood, which also contained the ribbons, supports and other accessories.  They were known by the name of the farm or parish where they were kept.\n\nThese crowns are full of symbolic values.  The crown itself recalls the crown of the Virgin, and represents purity or virginity.  The lions facing each other above each panel are symbols of strength.  The birds at the top of each hinge may be cocks, which are an old symbol of fertility.  \n\nThis crown was bought from a London antique dealer in 1879, so there is no information about its origins.  It is one of a group of at least 12 of similar design made in Bergen between the late 17th century and the early 19th.  This one has no maker's marks or silver marks.  There are numbers scratched on the back of each of the panels, indicating how they should be put together, but they are not in order.  It also has its weight scratched on the inside; 74 \u00bd L, which means over one kilo in modern terms.  It is a very good example of Norwegian silversmith's work.  It was illustrated (plate XIII) in 'Silverwork and jewellery', by Henry Wilson, to show 'the possibilities of work in thin sheet metal'.",
