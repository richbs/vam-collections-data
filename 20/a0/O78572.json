Catherine of Braganza, Charles's Portuguese wife, had a particular passion for tea and did much to popularise it. Tea was originally drunk in the Chinese manner, weak and without milk, but by the early 18th century sugar and milk were added, and small spoons became necessary.\n\nTrading\nSpoons were made by specialist goldsmiths, but often supplied as part of a tea equipage, or service. A set made by Paul de Lamerie (1688-1751) in 1735 includes 12 tea spoons, a pair of sugar nippers, a strainer spoon, three canisters for black tea, green tea and sugar, and a cream jug. Full sets of matching spoons from before the 1740s very rarely survive.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSpoons in the 18th century were generally placed on the table with the face downwards. The back of the stem or of the bowl could therefore be used for decoration. The first examples, in the 1730s, were decorated with a shell. After the mid-18th century, motifs such as flowers, farmyard scenes, animals and crowns began to be seen. The back of this spoon is decorated with a sheaf of wheat and the word 'PLENTY'. This may be a symbol of peace and prosperity. Decorated spoons such as this are often called 'picture-back' or 'fancy-back'.",
