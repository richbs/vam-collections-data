The reverse is hand inscribed in ink and postmarked 1929, with a penny stamp attached.  The obverse is colour-printed and gilded, and shows an illustration of two children dressed in picturesque costume and sharing a heart-shaped box of chocolates: the boy has blue trousers and a teal-coloured military-style top with white sleeves and lace-trimmed cuffs and collar; the girl wears a white dress with a sprig-printed skirt, a striped shawl and ribbon-trimmed bonnet.    The wording, in purple and gilt lettering, reads:\n\nI REMEMBER YOU THIS MORNING,\nTHIS IS YOUR BIRTHDAY, PET:\nMAY THIS, DARLING, BE THE SWEETEST\nHAPPIEST BIRTHDAY YET.\n\nBIRTHDAY GREETINGS.",
