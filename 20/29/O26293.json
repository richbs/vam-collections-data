It was devised in Florence, Italy, in the last quarter of the 16th century and first came to England in 1597. This game is apparently a reprint or a re-engraving of a plate used for an edition of the game issued at the end of the 18th century or the beginning of the 19th century. Instead of the more usual sequence of numbered spaces, this design places the playing area within the body of a goose. The numbering starts beneath the goose's eye and continues from right to left, and back from left to right across the body to the last number, 63, which is at the bottom by one of the legs.",

This game is play'd with a pair of dice and any number of persons may play at it.\n2.  Whatever number it is that anyone throws, the person must place his counter in the white shape under the same number.  For example, - Should the cast be 6 and 3, he must place the counter at 9; if the cast be 6 and 5, he must place the counter at 11; and, when he throws again, he must add the number to that where his counter lies and so remove accordingly.\n3.  He that throws a 6 must pay a stake for his passage over the Bridge and go to 12.\n4.  He that throws a Goose, must double his cast forward from his last place.\n5.  He that throws 19, where the Ale House is, must pay a stake and drink till his turn comes to throw again.\n6.  He that throws 31, where the well is, must stay there till everyone has thrown twice, unless, someone else throws the same and then he must return to that person's place.\n7.  He that throws 42, where the maze is, must pay a stake and return back to the number 29.\n8.  He that goeth to 52, where the Prison is, must pay one stake and stay there a prisoner till somebody relieves him by throwing the same number.\n9.

The numbering of the playing sheet starts at 1 beneath the goose's eye and then continues from left to right, back right to left across the body to the last number 63 which is at the bottom by one of the legs. \n\nThis game is apparently a reprint or a re-engraving of a plate probably used by Laurie and Whittle for an edition of the game issued at the end of the 18th century or the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nThe Game of the Goose, the prototype of the race track games, was invented in Florence in the last quarter of the 16th century and first came to England in 1597.\n\nRules placement: in egg shape in the centre of the plate beneath top margin",
