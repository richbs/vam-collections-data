            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 135, 138-140\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nNote on Nos. 210-219 [284-1888, 285-1888, 283-1888, 246-1888, 286-1888, 287-1888, 288-1888, 282-1888, 618-1888, 355-1888] and Nos. 240-242 [218-1888, 616-1888, 594-1888]\n\nLeslie says (L. ed. S., pp. 113, 114) \u201cIn June [1821], Constable accompanied his friend Fisher during his visitation in Berkshire, and made some beautiful pencil and washed drawings of the scenery in the neighbourhood of Reading, Newbury, and Abingdon.  He also visited Oxford with Fisher, and made an exquisite drawing of Blenheim, from the Park\u201d.  Fisher\u2019s Archdeaconry consisted of four rural deaneries, Newbury, Reading, Wallingford and Agindon, and the itinerary established by the dated drawings accounts for all these places except Wallingford.\nNos. 210-219 [284-1888, 285-1888, 283-1888, 246-1888, 286-1888, 287-1888, 288-1888, 282-1888, 618-1888, 355-1888] are evidently, from their subject and date, pages from the sketch-book Constable used on this occasion, and No. 219 [355-1888] may be the drawing of Blenheim described by Leslie.  The sketch-book measures 173 x 261 mm. (6 \u00be x 10 \u00bc ins.) and is made up of paper watermarked \tJ WHATMAN TURKEY MILLS 1819.  No. 240 [218-1888] comes from the same book, but is not connected with the Berkshire visitation.  Two drawings in the British Museum which are seen from their subject, date, and size, to be on leaves from the same sketch-book are:\nL.B. 26<i>b</i> Cottage near Reading, dated 6 June 1821.\nL.B. 17 High Street, Oxford, dated 9 June 1821.\nTwo pages exhibited at Messrs. Wildenstein\u2019s, 1938, appear to come from the same source: No. 136 inscribed <i>Newbury Berks June 4 1821</i> (6 \u00be x 9 3/4 ins.) (lent by G. Lawrence) and No. 137  inscribed <i>A Lock near Newbury June 5, 1821</i> (6 \u00be x 10 ins.) (from the collection of Capt. Charles Constable).\nThere is some uncertainty about the dating of uninscribed drawings not connected with Berkshire but of approximately the same size, since there are in the British Museum four drawings the measurements of which are almost identical with Nos. 210-219 [284-1888, 285-1888, 283-1888, 246-1888, 286-1888, 287-1888, 288-1888, 282-1888, 618-1888, 355-1888], but which bear dates in 1823.\nL.B. 9 Bentley, Suffolk.  168 x 254 mm. Inscribed <i>Bentley 21 April 1823.</i>  (Reproduced, M. S. Henderson, <i>Constable</i>, 1905, facing p. 67)\nL.B. 11a View on the Stour.  169 x 254 mm. Inscribed <i>E.B. June 20 1823.</i>\nL.B. 13a Study of an ash tree. 259 x 170 mm. (For inscription see note on No. 205 above)\nL.B. 20b View at Hampstead.  169 x 253 mm. Inscribed <i>Hampd. 26 June 1823</i>.\nThese pages indicate either that Constable was again using the Berkshire sketch-book in 1823, or, more probably, that in that year he used another of about the same size.  Nos. 241 [616-1888] and 242 [594-1888] come from one or other of the books and may therefore be assigned either to 1821 or 1823.  Among the undated drawings in the British Museum L.B. 26a, a canal scene, may be assigned from its subject matter to the sketch-book of 1821; L.B. 11b, a scene at Hampstead, was probably made in 1823, and L.B. 22b and 28b are not to be dated more closely than to one or other of these years.\nIn his letters of 5 January 1825, 8 April 1825 and 1 February 1826 (Beckett, VI, pp. 189, 198, 214) Constable asks for the return of a sketch-book which he has lent to Fisher with a drawing of the bridge at Oxford on the front page.  Since he describes it as small in comparison with another of \u201cgood size\u201d it seems that he can hardly be referring to the source of Nos. 210-219[284-1888, 285-1888, 283-1888, 246-1888, 286-1888, 287-1888, 288-1888, 282-1888, 618-1888, 355-1888], but to a smaller book used on the same excursion.",

His third child, Charles Golding Constable, was born on 29 March.  He accompanied Archdeacon John Fisher on his visitation of Berkshire in June, took No. 2 Lower Terrace, Hampstead, for his family during the summer and autumn and paid a visit to Fisher at Salisbury in November.\n\n [G Reynolds, 1973, p. 135]",
