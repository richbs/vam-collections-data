There are a number of loose pieces, and these should be stuck with gummed paper\u2026\n\n(9 November 1954) Note from Arthur Lane to Mr. Floud:\n\u2026and I mentioned that you would be interested in them for Circulation. May I hand them over to your for further action? The panels were acquired in Belgium and appear to date from the middle of the 16th century. They are presumably Flemish or Lower Rhenish. The inscriptions in both are modern restorations and there are a few other insertions of modern glass. Some modern unfired paint on the curtains in the corner should be cleaned off. The single figure represents St. James the Great; the figure of a deacon is probably St. Lawrence, who cured the sight of a blind paynim named Lucillius [?] in prison (Golden Legend, 1900, vol.IV, p.212).\n\nPurchase form:\nCirc.578 and 579-1954",
