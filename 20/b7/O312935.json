Figures of the Saint in English Alabaster are recorded at Abergavenny on the side of the tomb of William ap-Thomas (c.1450) and at Tong, Shropshire, on the side of the tomb of Sir Richard Vernon (d.1451) Other figures of the saint include one in the George Collection, Connecticut, one in the Burrell Collection, Glasgow and a fragment in the collection of Oscott College, near Birmingham.",
