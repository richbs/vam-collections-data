            "public_access_description": "This Punch is one of a set of figures used in his Punch and Judy show by Arthur William Ford (1901-1974), known professionally as  'Professor' Gordon Bavister. The figures were bought in 1937 and are mostly made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960).\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nMr Punch has had his cone-shaped hat for a long time.  A 17th-century ballad referred to his conical hat, his amorous character, and to someone who: 'kissed like Punchinello or a sucking pig.' He has also had his characteristically squeaky voice for hundreds of years, and directions for a 17th-century play note that a character should 'speak in Punchinello's voice'.  An account of a performance by Punch and the Devil in 1699 noted that their dialogue was: 'conveyed to the ears of the listening rabble through a tin squeaker, which was thought by some of 'em as a great piece of conjuration as was ever performed by Dr. Faustus'. This is a reference to the Italian 'pivetta' which contemporary Punchmen call a 'swazzle'.",
