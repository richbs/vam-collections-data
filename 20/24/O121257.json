            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides. \nLacquer was most commonly used in the manufacture of inro since it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material.  The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. \nThis inro is decorated with the Treasure Ship (takarabune) which is believed to appear on New Year\u2019s eve laden with auspicious treasures (takaramono). The crane and turtles are also symbolic of long life. Such an inro would undoubtedly have been worn over the New Year festivities. Moreover, by using the simple device of centring the ship on one side of the inro, the viewer\u2019s eye is cleverly drawn from one side of the body to the other.\nFrom the 1700s onwards, many artists signed the inro they made. This example is signed  Kajikawa Bunryusai kanko (official craftsman). The Kajikawa were one of the main lacquer families who specialised in making inro. Although the third Kajikawa master was called Bunryusai, the use of this name on a number of inro refers to the work of one or two lacquer artists who were active from around the mid-eighteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries. They can be differentiated as Bunryusai II and III.",
