He took up designing for glass following a visit to the Viard Fr\u00e8res glassworks in Bar-sur-Seine following a visit there in 1911.  At first he designed the forms to be made by the glassworks' own craftsmen and decorated them in enamel colours.  The first of these was exhibited in 1912 at the Salon d'Automne.  Progressing to making his own glass, by the early 1920s he had abandoned enamelling and was, instead, manipulating the glass in its hot molten state and also using deep cutting, acid-engraving and internal bubbling and colouring in an entirely innovative manner.
