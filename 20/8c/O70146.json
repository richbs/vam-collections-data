            "physical_description": "There are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.The saint, wearing a spade-shaped beard, holds with his right hand his emblem, an oar, which rests on its pointed end on the ground in front of him. A scroll, which presumably bore the words of the Apostles' Creed attributed to him, descends from his left hand, which is raised. He wears a robe and a cloak.\n\nThere are slight traces of red in the folds of his cloak and gilding in his hair. Dark green, with remins of the usual daisy pattern, can be seen at the bottom of the carving. The back of the panel is marked with 11 incisions close together. There are two lead-plugged holes with looped latten wires. Down the length of the carving the middle has been slightly chipped away, presumably to lessen the weight. The bottom has been cut away.",

These told the workmen that Jude was to be placed\neleventh in a row of twelve apostles.\n\nThere are slight traces of red in the folds of his cloak and gilding in his hair. Dark green, with remins of the usual daisy pattern, can be seen at the bottom of the carving. The back of the panel is marked with 11 incisions close together. There are two lead-plugged holes with looped latten wires. Down the length of the carving the middle has been slightly chipped away, presumably to lessen the weight. The bottom has been cut away.\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.The saint, wearing a spade-shaped beard, holds with his right hand his emblem, an oar, which rests on its pointed end on the ground in front of him. A scroll, which presumably bore the words of the Apostles' Creed attributed to him, descends from his left hand, which is raised. He wears a robe and a cloak.",
