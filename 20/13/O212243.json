The image shows a variety of forged\nforms developed by the artist, including twisting,\nwrapping, splitting and riveting.\nSigned and dated in pencil on the mount <u>A Paley</u>\n7. 1994\nColour photographs\nSize of mount 78.8 x 99.2 cm\n                                                                          E.2870-1995'\n\n\nThe sculptor Albert Paley was commissioned by the \nVictoria and Albert Museum to provide designs and \nthen make a bench suitable for the new Ironwork \nGallery in Room 114.  The bench was made and \ninstalled in 1994, and given a museum number: \nM.11-1995.  Paley first achieved prominence with an \nelaborate pair of steel and brass portal gates \nforged in 1974 for the Renwick Gallery in \nWashington DC.  His subsequent work has been \ndescribed as enlarged versions of the sculpted \njewellery of his early career.  His work draws on \nmany traditions: Baroque, Art Nouveau, Modernism \nand even Space Age.  The bench is a lexicon of \nPaley's understanding of decorative, patinated \nironwork and the assymmetrical [sic] design is composed \nof a twisted, coiled hoop with secondary coiled \nelements incorporating  decorative swagging.  \nExtending from the coil and supporting the wood \nseating surface is a superstructure which includes \na coiled and punched structure with tapered \nelements that penetrates a banner-like form on the \nfar right.  The backrest for the bench is a bundle  \nof decorative forged elements.'",
