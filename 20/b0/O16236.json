The marble relief is the first example in Donatello\u2019s work of shallow relief carving and includes linear perspective. The stucco replica perhaps dates from the 16th century. The replica does not represent the full height of the marble relief and is slightly cut above the horse\u2019s head and beneath the hooves. The areas to the right of the princess and to the left of the entrance to the cave are also omitted. The stucco is broken irregularly down the right edge and repaired on the left and was perhaps at one time complete. The frame seems to date from the mid 16th century.\n\nOrsanmichele had a double function in the fifteenth century as a church and grain market. In 1404 the guilds of Florence were invited to decorate the niches on its exterior.  Each commissioned statues of its patron saint, in bronze for the major guilds and marble for the lesser ones.",

            "history_note": "The relief is a cast from the marble relief of St. George and the Dragon beneath the tabernacle of he Arte dei Corrazzai on Or San Michele, Florence. The marble relief was carved by Donatello about 1417, and the stucco replica perhaps dates from the sixteenth century. The replica does not represent the full height of the marble relief, and is slightly cut above the horse's head and beneath the hooves.\n[Relief] This stucco relief is a partial squeeze (cast) from the marble relief of St George by Donatello on the church of Orsanmichele, Florence, probably made in the mid-sixteenth century.  The cast was perhaps at one time complete, but now is smaller in both height (by ca. 2 cm) and width (by ca. 38 cm) than the marble original.  The replica does not represent the full height of the marble relief and is slightly cut above the horse\u2019s head and beneath the hooves. The areas to the right of the princess and to the left of the entrance to the cave are also omitted. \n\nThe squeeze was bought from the Gigli-Campana collection in 1861, and was described as having come from an old Florentine house.\n\n.\n\nHistorical significance: Orsanmichele had a double function in the fifteenth century as a church and grain market. In 1404 the guilds of Florence were invited to decorate the niches on its exterior.  Each commissioned statues of its patron saint, in bronze for the major guilds and marble for the lesser ones.  St George was the patron of the Arte dei Corrazzai (armourers' guild).  Donatello executed the life-size statue of the saint in marble, and the marble relief below it from which this cast was taken.\n\nThe relief is the earliest example of Donatello's innovative <i>rilievo schiacchiato</i> technique, in which great depth and detail is expertly rendered in very shallow relief.  The arcade to the right of the princess (unfortunately mostly missing in the V&A squeeze) is held to be one of the most important early instances of the technique of linear perspective.\n[Frame] The frame seems to date from the sixteenth century, but it is unlikely that it was always associated with this object.  The squeeze is considerably smaller than the marble relief from which the cast was taken and it's unlikely that this was deliberate.  If the stucco was originally complete, the frame would have been too small to house it",
