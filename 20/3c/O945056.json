Boehler's, Munich. The Albertina drawaings (<i>Albertina Catalogue</i>, 1, nos. 361-64 and 367-68) were attributed to Tironi by H. Voss in an article on the artist in <i>Zeitschrift fur bildende Kunst</i>, 61, 1827-28, pp. 266-70. Pignatti, after seeing our drawings again in 1974, expressed doubts about the attribution, saying that the topographical errors and the faulty perspective are not in accord with Tironi's customary accuracy (oral communication). The last work by Pignatti quoted summarises all that is known about Tironi so far. 1185 View from across the Bacino di S. Marco, with the Dogana on the right and S.

            "history_note": "Bought a part of a set of 6 drawings of Venetian views in 1885. When they were acquired, these drawings were attributed to the greate Venetian view painter Antonio Canaletto (1697-1768). In 1929 Baron von Hadeln Detlev attributed these drawings to Francesco Tironi. This was based on stylistic comparisons with six drawings in the Albertina, Vienna (See: <u>The Drawings of Canaletto</u>, p. 6). \n\nReferences: Detlev, Baron von Hadeln, <u>The Drawings of Canaletto</u>, London, Duckworth, 1929, p. 6\n\nHistorical significance: Little is known about the life of the view painter Francesco Tironi. A letter written by Moschini in 1806 states that 'Our poor Francesco Tirnoi is much to be mourned, died too young a few years ago\u2026' (See Beddington, p. 130 and p.151, ft.2). The volume of views <u>Ventiquattro isole della laguna disegnate di Francesco Tironi incise di Antonio Sandi</u> (<u>Twenty-four views of islands in the Venetian Lagoon</u>), published in 1779, were engraved by Antonio Sandi after drawings by Tironi. Many of the original drawings for these engravings have been identified, allowing attribution of further works based on stylistic comparisons to be made. \n\nThis drawing shows the view looking from the Grand Canal across the <i>Bacino di San Marco</i> to the distant church of San Giorgio Maggiore in the right distance. The view incorporates a number of landmarks. At the left of the composition the <i>Campanile</i> or bell tower of St. Mark's basilica dominates the skyline of the east bank of the Grand Canal. To the right of the <i>Campanile</i> is the <i>Zecca</i>, which was realised by the Venetian sculptor and architect Sansovino between 1558-1566. The height of the <i>Campanile</i> is balanced on the right of the composition by the square tower of the </i>Dogona da Mar</i>. This building is named after its function of Custom house of the Sea (</i>Dogona da Mar</i> in Italian). Situated at an angle with two major canals of Venice, the Grand Canal and the Canal of the Giudecca, this building was the first port of call for merchants arriving in to Venice. In this drawing Tironi has included a number of large vessels which are navigated by seamen and presumably owned by merchants. Already present in the fifteenth century, the current building was built in the late seventeenth century to the design of Giuseppe Benoni (1618-1684). This structure is surmounted by a sphere, representing the globe, held up by two figures of Atlas above which stands a statue of Fortune, the work of the sculptor Bernanrdo Falcone (active 1659 \u20131694). These two structures, along with the mast of a centrally placed boat in the middle distance, balance the composition and direct our eyes to the distant buildings, most recognisable of which is the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by Andrea Palladio, (built 1565-1611).\n\nThe drawing, in pen ink and wash with heightening, is highly finished. It was probably designed as a work that could be bought by visitors to Venice on the Grand Tour. \n\nReferences: Beddington, Charles. <u>Venice, Canaletto and his rivals</u>, National Gallery Company, London, 2010, p.130.",
