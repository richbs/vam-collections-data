Their considerable correspondence is in the V&A Library collection. \nJohn Forster (1812-76), historian, biographer, and collector of books, manuscripts, paintings, drawings and engravings, bequeathed his collections to the museum; the collections notably include 48 oil paintings (both continental old masters and modem British works), and almost all of the manuscripts of Charles Dickens's novels. He first studied law, but from 1832 he was contributing articles and reviews to various publications; he was editor of The Examiner 1847-56. His biographies include the Lives of the Statesmen of the Commonwealth (5 vols, 1836-9), Oliver Goldsmith (1848), WaIter Savage Landor (2 vols, 1860) and - most famously - the Life of Dickens (3 vols, 1872-4). For further details of Forster's career and personality, see H Morley's preface to Handbook of the Forster and Dyce Collections (1877), and W Elwin's preface to A Catalogue of the Printed Books Bequeathed by John Forster (1888). \nOther portraits of Forster in the V&A collections include an oil painting by E M Ward and EM Downard of about 1850 (see P74-1935 p295) and another of 1887 by C E Perugini, two pen and ink sketches by Maclise of 1840, a watercolour by Clarkson Stanfield of about 1842, and a photograph by Elliott and Fry. Another portrait of Forster by Maclise, in the role of Kitely in Ben Johnson's play Every Man in his Humour, exhibited at the RA in 1848, is also in the V&A collections (see F20, p180). For a portrait of his wife, see P36-1935, pxx). \nVery little is known of Maclise's collaborator in this portrait, Thomas Warrington; he exhibited seven works at the RA, Bl, and SBA between 1829 and 1831. \nPROV: \t?Painted for Forster 1830; presumably by descent to his niece Miss Fannie Crosbie; given to the museum by Mr D R Crawfurth Smith 1935 \n\nRonald Parkinson.\"\nVictoria and Albert Museum <u>Charles Dickens: An exhibition to celebrate the centenary of his death</u> London: HMSO, 1970. P.28. Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, June-September 1970.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'D1\nThomas Warrington (exhibition 1829-31) and Daniel Maclise, RA (1806-70) \n<b>John Forster, 1830 \n</b>Oil, 30 x 20\nP.35-1935 \n\nForster was born in 1812 in Newcastle and educated at the Grammar School there, envincing an eager interest in literature and the theatre.  With the help of an uncle he was sent in 1828 to London University and studied law at the Inner Temple. By the early 1830s he was writing for newspapers and magazines, and journalism gradually gained ground over his legal studies.'",
