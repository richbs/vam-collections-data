Commedia dell'Arte troupes engaged in very physical acting using music, dance and acrobatics in their performances. While the plot was largely improvised, stock characters were used and were recognisable to the audience by their costumes, accents and poses. The popularity of this theatre form inspired paintings and decorative objects depicting the commedia characters. \n\nThe Commedia dell\u2019Arte figures produced at H\u00f6chst porcelain factory were, like those made at F\u00fcrstenberg, inspired by the engravings of Johann Jacob Wolrab produced in Nuremberg around 1720. Pierrot was a naive character in the Commedia dell\u2019Arte who loses his love interest Columbine to Harlequin. While this figure is attired in colourful clothing, wearing trousers more typical of Harlequin, Pierrot is more often portrayed entirely dressed in white with a white powdered face.",
