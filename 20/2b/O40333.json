The presence of a seated buddha, Amitabha, in the headdress indentifies this figure as the Lord of Compassion, Avalokitesvara, and by the animal skin drawn around his waist. The treatment of the flaming nimbus and cascading loops of hair point to inspiration from eastern Indian models of the period. The style of the figure, together with the use of a dark metal, suggests it was cast in the Thai peninsular.",
