Crawford, in 1921 as a junior trainee layout man. Within two years he was an art director and in 1929 a member of the Board. Instead of working in the Studio, Havinden was allowed to form a team with the young account executive Margaret Sangster and, in 1924, the copywriter G. H. Saxon Mills. They endorsed the ideas of the Bauhaus, such as the use of asymmetry and white space as part of a dynamic composition. In 1927 the team devised a campaign for Eno\u2019s Fruit Salt. The imagery used in both poster and press advertisements depicted three horsemen whose lances carried banners bearing the copy. The asymmetrical layout created a dynamic yet united design. The sense of movement suggested the beneficial effect of the product on health.",
