The boys would have been between the ages of 12 and 14 when it was written. It contains 12 chapters on the history of the area, from prehistoric times to contemporary, written and illustrated by the boys, with pencil and linocut prints. Special thanks is given to several of the contributors: for writing, G. Goulding, J. Burman, L. Manning. S. Hall, W. Willis, G. Joyce and G. White; for illustrations, W. Shepherd and W. Laskey; for printing, J. Bastick, O. Johnson, and A. Buckley; and for bookbinding, A. Buckley, S. Ackhurst and E. Issit. It is a very professionally produced book, considering that it was for a school project, and contains some very interesting information on how the children of Bethnal Green perceived their home area at the time. One child says the following: \"The Bethnal Green of today is terrible so say most people but were they to visit it, it is most certain they would change their views\". Another comment, \"Oh! if Bethnal Green were fields once again. We would have plenty of places to play without being interrupted, and our own borough would be clean and beautiful... Some time after the L.C.C. slum clearance Bethnal Green will be like the Bethnal Green of old.\"",
