His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel's traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nAnatole de Grunwald commissioned Messel to design costumes and sets for a film version of Alexander Pushkin's supernatural short story The Queen of Spades in 1949.  Post war rationing meant that materials were difficult to acquire and Messel had to create 19th century St Peterburg on a shoestring budget in a small studio at Welwyn Garden City.\n\nEdith Evans had begun her film career in 1915 in silent films, but was mainly known for her stage work until she appeared in the 1949 films The Queen of Spades and The Last Days of Dolwyn. In this photograph, the Countess Ranevskaya is preparing for a public appearance. Oliver Messel\u2019s costume design captures 18th century elegance with a twist: the film\u2019s setting is 1806 so the costume and the character deliberately appear out of date with the rest of the film's design.",
