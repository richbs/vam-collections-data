            "history_note": "The maker's initials on the bowl of the spoon are probably those of John Shinner of Plymouth. In 1623/4 a 'John Shinner, goldsmith' provided three new maces for the borough of Plymouth, and he was one of three Plymouth goldsmiths fined for substandard work by the London Wardens when they visited the city in 1633. He is probably the same John Shinner buried at Plymouth on 10th March 1655/6 (see Kent: 1992, p.131).\n\nNothing is known of the object's early provenance, though the date and initials pricked onto the back of the bowl suggests it may have commemorated a marriage. The spoon entered the collection of family plate belonging to Lord Mount Edgcumbe at an unknown date, and the Museum bought it from the family for \u00a360 in 1956.\n\nHistorical significance: The finial on this spoon is a debased example of a type uniquely produced in the south west of England. Kent (1992, p. 17) labels finials with semi-naked female figures as 'Aphrodite'-type, and argues they echo the classically-inspired architectural styles of the sixteenth century. Spoons with the original 'Aphrodite'-style finial can nearly all be traced to Barnstaple, and are dateable to between 1590 and 1630. A spoon with a very similar finial to this example, and also marked with the maker's monogram 'I S', was sold at auction in 1979 (Phillips: 1979, lot 45). Kent (1992, p.19) described it as 'debased \"Aphrodite\"', and cited another comparable spoon with a Plymouth town mark to show such versions of the 'Aphrodite' form circulated beyond Barnstaple.",

They could be purchased as sets, or individually, and were owned by prosperous farmers and merchants as well as by members of the nobility. For example, in 1627 a Dorset yeoman (someone beneath the rank of gentleman who occupied and cultivated between 60 - 100 acres of land) left the not inconsiderable sum of \u00a3659 worth of household goods, including silver spoons (Glanville: 1990, p. 52). Spoons were presented as gifts at christenings and also as souvenirs at funerals. The finial, or terminal, on a spoon could be especially commissioned to represent to a personal device. The Manners family commissioned six spoons with peacock terminals (their device) from Thomas Disney in 1542 (Glanville: 1990, p.71). The finial on this spoon, however, is a standard type particularly associated with the West Country (Barnstaple and Plymouth). The size of the spoon bowl suggests it was primarily used for eating soups and stews rather than for serving.",
