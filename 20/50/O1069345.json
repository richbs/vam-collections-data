Because of her sallow complexion she was called by the Greek name for \u201ctoad.\u201d She was born in Thespiae, Boeotia, but lived at Athens, where she earned so much by her beauty and wit that she offered to rebuild the walls of Thebes, on condition that the words \u201cdestroyed by Alexander, restored by Phryne the courtesan\u201d were inscribed upon them. At a festival of Poseidon and also at the festival at Eleusis she walked into the sea naked with her hair loose, suggesting to the painter Apelles his great picture of \u201cAphrodite Anadyomene\u201d (\u201cAphrodite Rising From the Sea\u201d), for which Phryne sat as model. She was also (according to Athenaeus) the model for the statue of the Cnidian Aphrodite by Praxiteles, whose mistress she was; copies of the statue survive in the Vatican and elsewhere. When accused of blasphemy (a capital charge), she was defended by the orator Hyperides. When it seemed as if the verdict would be unfavourable, he tore her dress and displayed her bosom, which so moved the jury that they acquitted her; another version has Phryne tear her own dress and plead with each individual juror.",
