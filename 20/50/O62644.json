The whole costume, with the drooping bag for the hair, indicates the downtrodden Sister, danced by Elisabeth Schooling. \nTwo additional designs, for the Prince and Cinderella in the ballroom scene are in the Cyril Beaumont Bequest, S.203-2000 and S.204-2000.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of ballet design from the 1930s for the significant company Ballet Rambert.  Andr\u00e9e  Howard was one of the few choreographers who also designed her own works.",
