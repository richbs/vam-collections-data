This was the date when a non-violent student march, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Jan Opletal (a Czech student murdered by the Nazis in 1939) turned into mass street demonstrations against the communist regime. Demonstrators found themselves face to face with the \u2018White Helmets\u2019 (as the special troops of the Ministry of Interior Affairs were known) wielding shields and truncheons, as large groups of them were cut off and surrounded in National Street and Wenceslas Square. Jakub Valentik also depicts the flanking vans of the state police bearing the initials VB (Verejna Bezpecnost \u2013 State Security). The poster is an interesting illustration of the power of the spoken word (the father\u2019s) to evoke images in the imagination of another (the child). \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
