The classical pilasters with gilt decoration give some elegance to the piece; however, there is a possiblity that it could have been made in middle to southern Germany where classical elements on Biedermeier furniture survived long. Especially Mainz in Germany was noted for ebonised columns and other ebonised elements on furniture.\n\nAttribution note: The veneers of the back are taken from one trunk to form a continuous decorative pattern, a principle characteristic of Biedermeier furniture. The sofa's design, especially the very solid back and the side arms which rest on rather too small pilasters with gilt heads at the front, is a little akward; and the veneers are of middling quality. The seat is sprung and the back stuffed, probably the original arrangement.",
