Although the figures are very similar in style, detail and condition the Krishna is a light brass colour and the goddesses coppery so the Krishna could be a replacement for a standing Vishnu image.  The slot for Krishna, however, is not centred, making space for his outstreched left arm, so it may well be original.  The base and arch are typically south Indian, with Vaishnavite conch and chakra on the arch. Little wear.\n[Shrine] The central figure is the bronze Krishna Tandava.  On his right is his Shakti Rukhmini with the kuchabandha, and on his left is second Shakti Satyavama.  Both hold lotus buds on the side near the god, whilst the outer hands hang in the \"cow-tail\" position.   The copper is an onlong padmapitha with three raised slots into which the figures slide.   The Torana is detachable: it has above the god's head a five-headed naga issuing from the kadamba-tree.\nOn either side of it is a makara from whose mouth rises a flamearch topped by the \"Face-of Fame\" (Kirti-mukuta).  On the back of each makara is one of Vishnu's symbols, the Disc and the Shell.   The sides of the Torana are in the form of two Dravidian temple pillars.",
