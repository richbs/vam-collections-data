The period from 1765 to 1776 is associated the use of blue grounds at Worcester and the stripes of royal blue colour on this teapot are in keeping with late eighteenth-century taste. However, Worcester wares do not usually bear both an underglaze blue factory mark, as is evident on the base of this teapot, and overglaze blue painting, as is evident in the decoration (usually an underglaze blue mark was only used for patterns which included underglaze blue in their decoration). This suggests that the teapot was probably painted outside the factory and the thickly applied gilding suggests a much later date than the manufacture of the teapot. \n\nThe bright enamel blue colour on this teapot is often termed 'bleu de roi' or 'king's blue' and is characetristic of wares produced by the French factory S\u00e8vres, which launched this shade in1763.",
