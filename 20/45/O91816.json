Their coat of arms can be seen on the foot. Figures of the four Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) are depicted on the bowl using the niello technique, pressing and melting a black enamel-like compound of silver, copper or lead sulphides into engraved lines on the metal's surface to produce a dramatic contrast with the shiny silver.   The design of the foot and knop (the bulbous part of the stem designed to help the priest hold the chalice) is typical of Spanish goldsmiths' work. The engraving, however, is very similar to work being produced in the centres of Nuremberg and Augsburg.",
