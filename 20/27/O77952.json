Smaller brackets were made in porcelain for displaying ceramic figures or vases.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSimilar brackets made in plaster were sold by the London plaster-shops. The closest parallels for this piece are plaster brackets sold by John Cheere (1709-1787), whose premises at London's Hyde Park Corner were illustrated in William Hogarth's satirical print The Analysis of Beauty of 1753. Such commercially-produced plasters were occasionally used at British porcelain factories as prototypes for production, especially for figures and busts. Both the bracket and the bust it supports were probably copied from plasters in this way. If so, the original plaster bracket would have been cut into smaller parts from which hollow plaster-production moulds could be made. Some plaster-makers knew that their production lines were being reproduced by the ceramics factories (and charged them accordingly), but others remained on their guard against plagiarism.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe bust has been analysed and found to contain soaprock. We know from documents that Richard Chaffers (1731-1765) of Liverpool was licensed to mine soaprock, and he currently seems the most likely manufacturer of these pieces.",
