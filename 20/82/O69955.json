In the background are wooded hills and a castle, and in front musical instruments on a rocky ground. Above are two shields of arms (possibly those of the Gascon families of Tersac de Montberault, and Fontaines): (1) Bendy of 6 azure and or, on a chief argent, 3 ermine spots (2) Per fesse Argent (or or ) and gules, on a chief azure 3 fleurs-de-lys. Beneath the central figure is the word 'ORPHEVS', and entwined in the tree-branches above is a ribbon bearing the legend 'LES IX MUSES'. There is a drab linen lining.",

Van de Put:\nThe arms, despite certain inaccuracies, are seen to exemplify the Gascon houses: (a) Tersac de Montberault and (b) Fontaines, respectively:\n(a) In the dexter top corner: Tierced in fesse azure, or and gules, in chief three fleurs de lys or; for Tersac de Montberault (Note 1).\n(b) In the sinister corner: Bendy of six or and azure, on a chief argent three ermine-tails sable; for Fontaines. (Note 2)\n\nThe house of Tersac de Montberault derived to name from seignories in the marches of Western Languedoc and Cominges (Haute Garonne Dept.), and appears as lord of Montberault, near Caz\u00e8res, in the county of N\u00e9bouzan, in 1215.\n\nGaspard de Tersac (d. 1509) left, by his wife, Marie Beatrix de Benque, a son Jean, lord of Montberault, who is recorded to have obtained from Pope Julius III, in the year 1550, a bull dispensing him, his family and also Jean Jacques de Fontaines, of the diocese of Rieux, from the Jubiliary pilgrimage to Rome. Fran\u00e7ois de Tersac, his son (b. about 1550) by Jeanne de Lubias (or Loubias) of the house of Misclas, was a principle partisan of the League in the south, and captain de Rieux. After the accession of Henry IV, he was assigned a pension and the court appointment of \"gentilhomme ordinaire\"; he married Catherine de Lamb\u00e8s de Savinhiac, and was buried in the church of the Dominican order at Rieux, where an imposing monument was erected to his memory.\n\nFran\u00e7ois de Tersac is styled lord and baron of \"Montberault, Fontaines, et autres Rieux\"; he is also designated \"Fran\u00e7ois de Tersac de Fontenes, seigneur de Montberault.\"\n\nA work by P. Palliot printed in 1660, assigns to Tersac de Montberault, the arms quarterly of Tersac and Fontaines. In the absence of any but the scantiest data relating to the heads of the house of Tersac, believed now to be extinct, other particulars of the alliance or connection between it and Fontaines denoted by the insignia in the tapestry have not been forthcoming. (Note 3).\n\nNote 1: The coat of Tersac with its three horizontal compartments, is variously blazoned: a chief with lilies, supported by a device (Rietstap); a fesse and a chief (contiguous) charged with lilies (Carsalade du Pont); and a fess with lilies in chief (Palliot).\nNote 2: That of Fontaines is usually blazoned: Or three bends azure and a chief ermine.\nNote 3: \"Fran\u00e7ois de Tersac\", by the Abb\u00e9 J. Carsalade du Pont, in the \"Revue de Gaascogne\", XII, 141; Auch, 1871; appears to be the only printed account of a family, the known intermarriages of which testify to its eminence in Gascony in the XVI century. The recent monograph by E. Espagnat, \"Notes historiques et arch\u00e9ologiques sur Caz\u00e8res (Hte. Gne.); Toulouse, 1911; Gires, besides a view of the ch\u00e3teau de Tersac, in its present condition, illustrations of the ch\u00e3teau and church of Caz\u00e8res, establishing a general resemblance between the architecture of the region and that figured in the tapestry.",
