The doll has two interchangeable faces, one serene with a gently smiling closed mouth, the other with frowning eyes and brows and the  area around the mouth painted red in a circle to represent it as open in the act of crying or yelling.  Only one face is intended to be visible at a time, with the other hidden beneath a metal cap which is covered with a white bonnet; the shoulders are of composition moulded to show the upper part of a white garment with a collar.  The lower arms are of wax over composition, and the lower legs are of composition; the upper arms and legs are of cloth stuffed with sawdust.  The body is formed from a cloth-covered cylinder of card which contains the mechanisms for the sound and the turning of the head, both of which are operated by strings at the side of the waist.\nThe doll also has a woollen cloak trimmed with woollen fringe.",
