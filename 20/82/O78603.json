The very fine sapphire intaglio (the design engraved into the stone)  is Graeco-Roman, dating from the 1st century AD.\n\nPeople\n\nThe intaglio was probably mounted into the ring in about 1590-1600. It then appears to have entered the collection of the Gonzaga dukes of Mantua. The ducal art collections became the target of dealers, including Daniel Nys, who in 1627 sold to Charles I paintings by, among others, Titian, Raphael, Correggio and Giulio Romano. In 1637, when Charles declined to buy from Nys the Gonzaga gems, Thomas, 14th Earl of Arundel agreed to purchase them through his agent William Petty. Arundel was the most dedicated English collector of his generation, who built a library of 3000 books, exchanged engraved gems with Rubens, and played a role in bringing Van Dyck to London, as  well as making collections of antiquities, Renaissance drawings and paintings on the most extensive scale.\n\nThe range, antiquity and splendour of the objects Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel (1585-1646) acquired put him on a par with great European collectors.  As well as paintings and drawings of the greatest importance, he collected works of the classical period. These included cameos and intaglios.  His principal agent was the tireless William Petty (possibly born in 1585, died 1639), who in 1638 purchased for Arundel  the gem collection of the Flemish dealer Daniel Nys  in Italy.\n\n\nThe Arundel Collection gems passed by descent to Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough (1706-1758, himself a great collector of engraved gems.The Marlborough Collection was later sold at Christie's auction house on 28 June 1875.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe sapphire is engraved with the head of Medusa. In Greek mythology she was one of three sisters, the Gorgons, whose terrifying appearance turned those who saw them into stone.  She was beheaded by the legendary hero Perseus.",
