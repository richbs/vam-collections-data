Children were given one or more apostle spoons, often with the finial in the shape of the saint after whom they were named.\n\nA gift of silver for a child was a store of wealth for the future and gave rise to the expression \u2018to be born with a silver spoon in one\u2019s mouth\u2019. Silver also has antiseptic properties and was a hygienic material for nursery items such as porringers, rattles and saucepans.",
