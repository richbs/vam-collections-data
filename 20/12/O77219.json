Important as it was to dress magnificently, it was also essential to be portrayed in one's finery. The portraits nearly always show the sitters splendidly dressed in the height of expensive fashion, in order to emphasise their status.\n\nPeople\nDudley North (1581-1666) was one of the principal courtiers of James I. His family was linked by marriage with the Dudley family that had been so powerful at the Tudor court. Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was a favourite of Elizabeth I and Dudley North's grandfather married the widow of his brother, Sir Henry Dudley.\n\nDudley North became one of the most conspicuous figures of the Jacobean court. He was a musician and poet, and an enthusiastic participant in court entertainments, especially the tilts and masques.  In 1606, while recovering from ill health in Kent, he discovered the medicinal value of the springs at Tunbridge Wells. He also publicised the virtues of the waters of Epsom in Surrey. He passed his later years quietly in the country at Kirtling Hall, the family home in Kirtling, Cambridgeshire. In 1645 collected his essays, letters and poems in a volume titled A Forest of Varieties.",
