Until the 1460s, Florence was an oligarchic republic, where various merchant families vied with each other for supremacy. The theme of this shield is heraldic and serves to emphasise the importance of this particular family.",

The shield originally belonged to the Villani, a family of prominent wool merchants, who from the 1470s  were known for their hostility towards the Medici, the leading family of Florence of the day. By about 1600, Lorenzo di Pietro Villani (died 1617) dealt in silk in partnership with the Guadagni family, and this may explain how this shield ended up in their residence.\n\nHistorical significance: Parade shields like this example were ephemeral: they were made of cheaper materials and once they were no longer needed, they were usually dispersed or discarded. This example is therefore a very rare survival of an important part of civic life in the Italian city, that would have provided the leading families with prestige, the masses with entertainment and prominent artists with an important source of earnings.",

Although the Medici and their supportes were the leading faction for much of this century, Florence remained an oligarchic republic, where families vied with each other for honour and prestige. Large, prominetly displayed heraldic shields played an important part in this process.",
