Although the popularity of the Jagannatha cult spread to Bengal and even Nepal, it is centred on Puri. Throughout the year the cult image of Jagannatha, accompanied by his half-brother Balabhadra and his sister Subhadra, reside in the temple sanctuary. To mark the annual ratha yatra temple festival, held in the month of Asadha (June/July) they are taken from the temple sanctuary and installed in the three great wooden temple cars (rathas) in preparation for the annual temple festival procession.\n\nThis great event attracts vast numbers of pilgrims who fill the broad streets of Puri (see Kulke herein). Puri does a brisk business in pilgrim souvenirs during these festivals, especially in cloth paintings (pata) and small wooden replicas of the cult images. This temple car model is a more substantial \u2018souvenir\u2019, in all probability having been made for a British patron as an ethnographic object. According to museum records, it was constructed from specimens of wood used in the construction of an actual temple car by the head carpenter of Puri temple. Each year timbers are purchased and the temple cars, or at least their superstructures, are re-built. At the completion of the festival, the rathas are demolished and their timber sold.",
