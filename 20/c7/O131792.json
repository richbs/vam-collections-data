His paintings are in the manner of 17th century Netherlandish works, especially those of Teniers. The chamber of mirrors in the Palace at Fulda is decorated with 44 of his paintings (1757). \n\n173 \nLANDSCAPE WITH HUNTSMEN AND BEGGARS \nPanel \n10 5/8 x 14 3/8 (27 x 36.5) \n568-1870 \n \nCompanion piece to 567-1870 (no. 172). The huntsmen on horseback have been identified by Ernst Kramer (written communication, 1967) as Heinrich von Bibra (1711-88), Prince-bishop of Fulda, founder of the Fulda porcelain factory, and his steward Graner. The scene is near Fulda, the ruins of the Ebersburg appear in the left background.",

The composition depicts two huntsmen on horseback, accompanied by a game keeper with a dog, giving alms to a group of beggars whom they have encountered in a forest clearing.  At the left a boy tends a goat which is nibbling at foliage. At the right a woman with children and two heavily laden figures look on. One of the beggars is dressed as an old soldier, and is missing his right arm. The huntsmen have been identified by Ernst Kramer (written communication, 14 June 1967) as Heinrich von Bibra (1711-88), Prince-bishop of Fulda, founder of the Fulda porcelain factory, and his steward Graner. The scene is near Fulda, and the ruins of the Ebersburg appear in the distant left background.",

The chamber of mirrors in the Palace at Fulda is decorated with 44 of his paintings (1757). Following the death of the Prince Bishop of Fulda Adalbert von Walderdorff in 1759 and the French siege of the city, he broadened his circle of patrons, and from 1782 he painted numerous works for the art market in Frankfurt, especially genre scenes in the manner of 17th century Netherlandish painters such as David Teniers the younger and Adriaen Brouwer.",
