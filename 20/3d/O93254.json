Wealthy households enlivened their sideboards of silver plate with mounted nautilus shells and coconut cups. Functional luxury items, such as caskets, travelling sets or firearms, combined woods, ivory, amber or horn with silver mounts. In the 17th century, highly fashionable imported Oriental porcelain was adapted for European use by adding silver handles or spouts. By around 1700, silver or ormolu (gilt bronze) mounts on furniture and ceramics were popular throughout Europe. \n\nAbove all, it was the widespread passion for collecting and mounting marvels of nature and craftsmanship that provided goldsmiths with a steady source of patronage from the 15th century onwards.\n\nThe \u2018cabinet of curiosities\u2019 grew out of a growing interest in the diversity of the natural world. Collectors displayed fossils, minerals, shells and other wonders of nature in specially fitted rooms and mounts were made for precious or \u2018exotic\u2019 items. By 1600, every prince aspired to such a collection. This concentration of wealth and artistry was intended to express the ancient lineage, power and connoisseurship of the patron\u2019s family.  \n\nMany early collections still exist, such as the treasury of the Electors of Saxony in the \u2018Green Vaults\u2019 at Dresden, which, in the 1720s, was one of the earliest to be opened to the public.",
