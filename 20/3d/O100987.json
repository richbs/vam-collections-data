The bodies of both vases show chisel marks.\n\nThe flaring bases are carved with egg and dart, with, above, a band of leaves and grotesque masks.  The waist of each vase is carved with a wreath of foliage, with a central flower. The body of each is carved at the bottom with upright acanthus.  Each plain, rounded body is carved with a winged cherub's head, flanked by heavy swags of flowers and foliage. At the back, both vases are completely plain on the main body. Above is a narrow band of hanging leaf ornament and one of egg and dart, imitating in reverse the carving on the foot. Above this, each vase shows a roughly carved, shallow step, which may have been used to located some sort of cover.  On top, each is roughly hollowed out in a shallow V-shape. Both still show traces of gesso.\n\nBoth show vertical cracks where the timber has dried. Each shows a hole at each side at the level of the shoulders of the vase, possibly screw holes. Underneath, both show a hole to fit a dowel, with 3 or 4 nail or screw holes around each of these.  W.17a shows large losses to the lower front left rim, with some areas of replacement.",
