He is watched by two of Kostchei\u2019s attendants and a member of his suite.\n\nThe Firebird was created for the second ballet season Diaghilev presented in Paris and first performed at the Paris Op\u00e8ra on 25 June 1910. Its narrative combined elements from a number of Russian folk tales and it was the first ballet for which Igor Stravinsky had composed the score. The choreography was by Mikhail Fokine and the original sets and costumes were designed by Alexandre Golovin. This illustration show the last version of the revised costumes for the Firebird and Ivan Tsarevitch designed by L\u00e9on Bakst. It depicts the ballet as it was performed in London in 1919 at the Alhambra Theatre London when Leonide Massine played Ivan Tsarevitch and Enrico Cecchetti Kostchei.\n\n\nThe illustration is reproduced on page 10 of Cyril W. Beaumont's book Impressions of the Russian Ballet: The Firebird.",
