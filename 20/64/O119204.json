Although carved in a somewhat vernacular style, the door of this cabinet is decorated with the highly fashionable tulip. Before the improving of winter feed for livestock in the 1750s, spices formed a vitally important part of the kitchen both as a preservative and so as to counteract the taste of meat of cattle that had been killed and salted at the onset of winter. Spices were stored in cupboards with insides arranged like writing cabinets, with smaller compartments for finer powders and more expensive items. Just as the writing cabinet was the most prestigeous piece of furniture in a drawing room or closet, the spice cabinet, although much smaller, occupied that role in the kitchen, as container of the most important items for the cook.\n\nOn loan to Woolsthorpe Manor (National Trust).",

A letter from Stirling to the Museum 12.1.1928 explains that he purchased the cupboard from 'Shenker of Red Lion Street, Holborn'. It was dated on acquisition to c1670, and described as having original drawers with original knob handles (ie no mention of missing drawers), and the door carving was described as 'unusually good quality'.\n\nBenno Forman (1972) drew attention to the method used to chamfer the rails and stiles containing the panel, also used by craftsmen in Hadley and Hatfield, Massachusetts, c1650-75.\n\nFor discussion of spice cupboards see Chinnery, p.332ff, and note that none of those illustrated bears carrying handles. Most were made to hang on the wall, either by means of as small hanger, or simply by being nailed through the back-boards. The construction of mural cupboards is therefore necessarily light of weight, in order to avoid undue strain, and they are usually flimsily constructed using thin, nailed boards. The methods used ares similar to those found on boxes, and many may have been made by box-makers, though some incorporate joined framework.\n\nNotes from R.P. 28/706\n\n23/1/28 Objects submitted on Approval for Purchase form\nlists: \"1. Spice cupboard.  English; mid-17th century\".  \u00a315\n\n12/1/28 letter from Stirling to Clifford Smith\nexplains that he purchased \"a rare little piece of oak of exceptional merit\" from \"Shenker of Red Lion St. Holborn\".\n\n\"It is a small English spice cupboard, or rather cabinet: the door covered with fine carving of acorns, tulips & foliage.  Inside the drawers are all original with original knob handles.  The iron work is original & interesting\u2026.the colour is exceedingly rich.  The Museum does not, as for as I can see, possess any piece of this kind\u2026        I should date the cupboard unhesitantingly circa 1670.  I have an armchair with similar carving dated 1677:  It is a very rare little piece in fine condition\".\n\n25/1/28 Minute paper notes by Clifford Smith\nstate it is \"a very good example of English 17th Century work - the carving on the front of the doors being of unusually high quality\".",
