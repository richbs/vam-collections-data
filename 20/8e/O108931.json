After her death in 1719, the set was transferred to the church of St Mary-le-Strand.\n\nThe dish is hallmarked for 1681\u20132 and engraved \u2018ITE\u2019. These initials, along with the fashionable chinoiserie decoration, suggest that it was present for Thomas and Elinor James in 1681 and meant for domestic use. \n\nFurther inscriptions record its later use in church: \u2018E.I. to E.B.1711\u2019 and \u2018This is Dedicated to ye God of Charity by which man is in hopes to attain Eternal salvation. O blessed is the man that is Endowed with that Heavenly gift. I rest Elinor James\u2019. \n\nThe long inscription reflects the obsessive piety of the donor. Elinor James was a champion of the Church of England. Described by a contemporary as a \u2018mixture of benevolence and madness\u2019, she was intolerant of Roman Catholics and dissenters alike. In 1689 she was committed to Newgate Prison for libel on account of her book The Vindication of the Church of England. \n\nOther items in the set consisted of two flagons, a cup, a paten and a crimson velvet altar cloth. Presumably, the dish would have been used to serve the communion bread.",

The donor was usually a prominent member of the community, which in country parishes often meant the local landowner. But gifts came from other sources too. Many were given by women, showing their active involvement with the church. Churchwardens also took pride in commissioning new silver and often contributed to the cost. Occasionally, gifts like Lord Hertford\u2019s chalice and flagon were made to win support for a political cause. \n\nNot all of these gifts were new. Old-fashioned domestic plate, often richly decorated with secular ornament, was welcomed and used for the service of communion or the collection of alms.\n\nGiven by Elinor James at the same time as a set of silver-gilt altar plate consisting of two flagons, and a cup and paten with a crimson velvet altar cloth embroidered in silver with the sacred monogram 'IHS'.",
