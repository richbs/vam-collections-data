He works mainly in stone, and since the mid 1980s he has worked in Italy, Egypt and India. The materials with which he works often have profound spiritual significance. In India, having studied traditional Hindu carving, Cox worked with granite from the ancient quarries of Kanchipuram. When in 1988 he was commissioned to make sculptures for the Cairo Opera House he was permitted to use porphyry from the old Imperial quarry, the first artist to do in 500 years. More recently Cox has worked in marble from the Carrara quarries in Italy.",
