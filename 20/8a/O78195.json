It is one of a series of engravings of the Queen commissioned by Hans Woutneel, a book and printseller from The Netherlands who settled in London in 1592. The model for the image of the Queen in this print was taken from a portrait 'pattern' in miniature produced by the miniaturist Isaac Oliver which is now in the V&A. Woutneel possibly commissioned the design from Oliver which was then forwarded to de Passe in the Netherlands to engrave.\n\nPeople\nIn 1592 Elizabeth I was nearly sixty when she sat for the portrait on which this print is based. However the portrait was not favoured by the Queen or her government who preferred images that focussed on her iconic status as Queen rather than her mortality as an ageing woman. The succession had not been decided at this time and the government was anxious about the threat of instability after Elizabeth's death.\n\nOwnership & Use\nPrints were a more affordable form of image to own than oil paintings or miniatures. Due to the changing political and religious climate in Europe in the 1580s threats to the Queen's safety increased, especially from Spain. People acquired portraits of the Queen to demonstrate their devotion and loyalty.",
