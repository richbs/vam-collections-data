Pyxes were among the objects most frequently made by these craftsmen. Limoges enamels were particularly valued in the Middle Ages due to their rich colours, highly polished surfaces and inventive designs. An example of champlev\u00e9 enamel (meaning 'raised field'), the metal field of the pyx had a recess for the enamel gauged into it with a graver. This recess was then filled with powdered glass and repeatedly fired to set the enamel. The enamel was then polished so that it appeared to be at the same level as its metallic field. Champlev\u00e9 produced the strongest enamel and metal composite surface, as well as being one of the earliest enamelling techniques. Becoming prominent in the twelfth century, Limoges remained the centre for the production of champlev\u00e9 enamels until the fourteenth century.",

            "historical_context_note": "Taken from the Latin word 'pyxis' meaning 'box-wood receptacle', pyxes were vessels used to house the Eucharist which was given to the congregation during the celebration of Mass. The pyx would be hung above the altar in a Church, or used to transport the Eucharist to those who were too sick to travel to Church to receive it. Many surviving pyxes are decorated using enamel, possibly because it was more affordable that gold or silver, and have a conical dome as in this example. However, the majority of surviving pyxes take a circular rather than square shape, perhaps to reflect the round shape of the wafer that they were designed to house.",
