Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a wild boar sleeping by a stone.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masatsugu. Kaigyokusai Masatsugu (1813-1892) is an Osaka based carver renowned for his flawless technique. During the Meiji period (1868-1912) netsuke began to loose their practical function as traditional Japanese dress was replaced by Western clothing. Artists such as Masatsugu continued to produce netsuke, keeping the traditional craftsmanship alive. \n\nNetsuke have a hole or himotoshi through which the cord would have been strung. On this netsuke the cord would have passed between the boar's front legs causing the netsuke to hang at an angle. It is therefore likely that this netsuke was produced purely to be admired rather than to be worn. The subject matter is from a set of twelve carvings of zodiac animals and the boar would have been worn during its associated year.",
