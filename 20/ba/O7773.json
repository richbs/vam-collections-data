The design is based on late Gothic brass wares produced in such centres as Nuremberg, Germany and Dinant, Belgium, which Pugin had seen on his frequent trips to the Continent.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPugin chose John Hardman & Co. as a suitable manufacturer of his designs because their craftsmanship and finish were of a very high standard. They used the most modern methods of  manufacture then available including die-stamping and electro-forming and their gilding and cast work was of the highest quality.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDesign features of this candelabrum such as the lobed foot and strongly worked foliage are very typical of Pugin's attempt to interpret Medieval form. Pugin had been fascinated by candlesticks and sconces from his youth and some of his earliest drawings are for different forms of lights. In his own words he thought a candlestick should 'take the light well and sparkle'. This candelabrum formed part of Hardman's base-metalwork display at the Great Exhibition of 1851. It was intended to be used in one of the Gothic architectural interiors for which Pugin was so famous. It was bought by the Museum from the Great Exhibition.",
