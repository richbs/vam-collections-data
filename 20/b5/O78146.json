This gives the illusion of a single three-dimensional image when viewed through a stereoscope designed to hold it.\n\nOwnership & Use\nStereographs were mass-produced. Viewing them was a popular amusement carried out in the home from the 1850s until the early 20th century.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nA printed caption on the reverse of this stereograph reads:\n\n'We notice in this view the present and the remote past, the baby and the giant of the desert. In the foreground, a little camel baby is getting her early breakfast. Camel milk is even used by the people of the desert. At certain seasons of the year, it is the only thing they drink. ... In the background stands the second pyramid of the Gizeh (Giza) field. This pyramid is easily distinguished from all the rest, because it still posses the top of its casing, while in the others the casing has entirely fallen away. Below it we see the Sphinx which for centuries has been the riddle of mankind...  This view shows how the sand of the desert is drifting around the ancient ruins and tends to cover up these remnants of a past civilization.'",
