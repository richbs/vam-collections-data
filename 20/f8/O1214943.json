The donor said that as the puzzle required a huge amount of patience & sitting still, her parents hoped the puzzle would keep her quiet and occupied. The puzzle requires the manoeuvring of the pieces to form a picture with the 8 wooden pieces. \n\nRobert Journet started with a toy shop in 1878 near Paddington. Robert died in the 1930s and his son Frederick continued to expand the Company until taken over by Abbey Corinthian Games in 1965.  R. Journet and Co designed more than one hundred innovative dexterity puzzles beginning in 1891 and continuing through the 1960s. According to Robert William Journet, \"a good puzzle should be simple in idea. It should explain itself without any long instructions and it should look attractive.\" (1927).",
