Although the cave is made of ice, because of the difficulty of photographing snow, the ice looks like rock. There are snow peaked mountains in the background. The sides of the cave and the banks of the river are covered with stones, rocks and boulders. There are two Indian men in the foreground and they give a sense of scale to the surrounding landscape.",

Bourne was fascinated by the mountains and captured images of them on glass negatives. \n\nHe wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes he photographed. Of this glacier he wrote: 'The stupendous glacier\u2026fills up completely the head of the valley \u2013 an enormous block of ice hundreds of feet in thickness and several miles long (as far as I could judge, probably ten or fifteen), but I did not explore it. The stream issues at its foot (a full-blown river at once) out of an immense ice cave, called by the natives the \u201ccow\u2019s mouth\u201d\u2026. I was fortunate enough in having a fine, clear morning following the day of my arrival at this spot, and was thus enabled to obtain three excellent negatives of the cave, the glacier, and the peaks by which it was surrounded.\u2019",

Below is the relevant section for this photograph: \n\n'The stupendous glacier in which the Buspa fills up completely the head of the valley \u2013 an enormous block of ice hundreds of feet in thickness and several miles long (as far as I could judge, probably ten or fifteen), but I did not explore it. The stream issues at its foot (a full-blown river at once) out of an immense ice cave, called by the natives the \u2018cow\u2019s mouth,\u2019\u2026.I was fortunate enough in having a fine, clear morning following the day of my arrival at this spot, and was thus enabled to obtain three excellent negatives of the cave, the glacier, and the peaks by which it was surrounded'.\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, March 4 1870, pg 99.",
