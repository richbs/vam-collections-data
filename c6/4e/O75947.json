The phrase L'Ami du Peuple was both the title of the anti-royalist newspaper that Marat published and, in effect, an epitaph awarded to him by his fellow leaders of the Revolution.\n\nIn 1789 Marat turned to journalism and began the journal that was to become \u2018L\u2019Ami de Peuple\u2019. It was an extreme publication that he used to call for the death of Louis XVI and to attack anyone he saw as an enemy of the revolution or of Republicanism. He justified insurrection and violence if the progress of the revolution required it. Within its pages, he prophesied fifty years of anarchy and the rise of a dictator. It was very popular with the public. \n\nIn the 1790s the revolution became more anti-clerical, and sought to replace religious images and festivals with secular ones based on the new revolutionary heroes and virtues. A festival of Federation was celebrated on the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille in 1790, and the church of St Genevieve was re-established as a secular pantheon in 1791. This poster follows in this tradition, celebrating Marat as a martyr of the Revolution.",

ISBN: 1 85177 2405.\nModern Propaganda and Mass Politics\nHowever, the history of the propaganda poster has deep roots. The tradition of the impertinent political cartoon propped in a bookseller's window or the typographic call to arms posted in town and village on the eve of war are often described as antecedents of the modern propaganda poster. One early image in the V&A's collection is a graphic commemoration of the murdered hero of the French Revolution, the left-wing journalist Jean-Paul Marat. The phrase 'L'ami du Peuple' was both the title of the anti-royalist newspaper which Marat published and, in effect, an epitaph awarded by his fellow leaders of the Revolution. Marat was made into a martyr after his death at the hand of Charlotte Corday in July 1793. The National Convention requested that a number of engravings be made of his image in death for circulation throughout France to record his noble sacrifice. his reputation as an uncompromising <i>r\u00e9volutionnaire</i>, who was responsible for the execution of hundreds during the Prison Massacres of 1792, was replaced by Marat the martyr: plays, poems and hymns were written in his memory and 37 towns in France adopted his name. Marat was reinvented as a kind of secular saint: children were taught in school to make the sign of the cross at his name. In the same way, in this poster, Marat is crowned with a halo of stars. The relatively large size of this hand-coloured etching suggests that this image was produced for public display rather than as a private <i>memento mori</i>.",
