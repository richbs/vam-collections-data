Wedgwood, however, was the first person to manufacture them in stoneware on a commercial scale.  \n\nUse\n  Wedgwood's medallions of 'Modern Subjects' were probably hung on the wall, in wood or brass frames, to display the political and cultural allegiances of the household. Sets of portrait medallions were also kept in cabinets. Wedgwood's letters indicate that his 'Modern Subjects' sold best  when their subjects were most topical.\n\nPeople\nThe modeller John Charles Loch\u00e9e supplied Wedgwood with reliefs in wax from 1774. He was portrait modeller to several members of the royal family before his bankruptcy in 1791. His portrait reliefs were also reproduced in glass paste by James Tassie (1735-1799).\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe medallion is made of Jasper, a fine-grained stoneware that Wedgwood developed as a material for manufacturing medallions and gems. It was one of a range of new materials that he introduced to meet changes in taste. The portrait relief was made in a mould taken from a  wax model made by John Charles Loch\u00e9e. The details on the relief were probably sharpened up before firing with wooden or metal tools.\n\n",
