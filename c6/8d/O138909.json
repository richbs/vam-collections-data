It is artist Marf's take on the current news story. As she describes it: 'Sunday\u2019s annual London Marathon is a triumph \u2013 but on Monday morning, images of the gruelling event resonate in commuters\u2019 minds. In a year of job insecurity, and government calls for retirement to be delayed until 70 years of age as pension funds collapse, the future looks like one long slog.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
