(1745-1806)</b> \n\nPortrait of John Bacon, R.A. (1740-1799), sculptor. \n<i>Pastel.</i>                             P.5-1957 \n\nGiven by Mr. Eustace V. Bacon, M.B.E., the great-great-grandson of the sitter \n\n<i>Note:</i> P.5-1957 (with its companion-portrait, P.6-1957, q.v.) had been previously on loan to the Museum at intervals from 1864; it was also lent to the Russell exhibition at Graves' Galleries, November to December 1909 (No.8).  Another portrait of Bacon by Russell, similar in pose to P.5-157, but with the difference that the sitter is wearing a wig, was in April 1925 in the possession of Mr. John M. Bacon (reproduced in <i>The Connoisseur</i> of that date).  One or other of those portraits was exhibited by Russell as No.133 in the Royal Academy Exhibition, 1792.  P.5-1957 was engraved by A. Rosse, I. Collyer, A.R.A., H. Meyer and W. C. Edwards: the last of these gives the date 1792 for the original.\"",
