            "public_access_description": "This theatre programme with its decorative panels and lithographic images of the theatre, the Chairman, and the Managing Director Oswald Stoll, was made to be folded in three like a paper programme, but was printed on silk to commemorate the opening night of The Empire Palace Theatre of Varieties, Stratford East, on 4th December 1897. This one of the music halls built by Horace Edward Moss (1852-1912) in the late 19th century, and was part of the group known then as 'The London District Empire Palaces, Limited'.  Later the group became known as the Moss Empires Variety Theatres, and at its peak was a huge concern comprising thirty-three theatres, the largest chain known in the world.\n\nThe earliest silk playbills which dated from the late18th century, were never illustrated.  During the 19th century simple line illustrations were added, by woodcuts or engravings, but as  lithographic techniques progressed, photographs could be reproduced. The profusion of illustrations on some of the programmes produced to mark the opening of the Stoll Moss Palaces of Variety was nevertheless remarkable, and unique to this lucrative Variety empire.",
