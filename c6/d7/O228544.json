They are an example of the superb throwing skills of their maker, Tao Akiko, who has a well-established following among her Mashiko-based peers. They are made from iron-bearing Mashiko clay mixed in equal quantities with stoneware clay from Toki in Gifu Prefecture. The artist obtained these clays from Mr Yoshizawa, one of three purveyors in the Mashiko area from whom she is able to purchase hand-prepared clay. The bowls were fired in the same firing to 1280-1300 degrees centrigrade in a gas kiln. The firing lasted approximately 23 hours. Reducing conditions were maintained up to 1150 degrees centrigrade, followed by neutral conditions (essential for the copper green glaze, which would have turned red if the firing had been oxidising). The artist threw the 'female' brown bowl first. Taken by the gentleness of the shape she had made, she decided to make a second bowl - the 'male' green bowl - in an intentionally more robust and emphatic style. She added lugs to the first bowl to 'feminise' it and give it added character.",
