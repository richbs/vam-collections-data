He wears the traditional Spanish long net cap, a brown jacket with green and red striped epaulettes fringed in yellow and with yellow decorations at the wrists, blue knee-breeches, white  socks and black shoes; red spotted handkerchiefs are tucked into his red cummerbund. His partner faces the viewer, stepping from her right onto her left leg, with her head turned to her left and arms held out from the shoulders.  Her hair is pulled back and held with a pink ribbon; a white shawl is crossed over her bust, held with roses at centre front; the long brown sleeves have blue cuffs.  The calf-length yellow skirt has a brown hemband trimmed with blue.",

Later in the century, as Spanish dance became more popular, the costumes became 'theatricalised', but this print shows Spanish peasants dancing in a natural landscape.  \nThe bolero is a Spanish dance with a traceable history, having been 'invented' in 1780 by Sebastian Cerezo for the Spanish court, although he probably based his version on a folk dance.  It is a much more languid and restrained than many Spanish dances and its rhythms have inspired many composers, most famously Maurice Ravel.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

Later in the century, as Spanish dance became more popular, the costumes became 'theatricalised', but this print shows Spanish peasants dancing in a natural landscape.",
