            "history_note": "Registered description: Plaster casts. Two panels from the Wek\u00e1leh of the K\u00e1\u00eft-Bey at Cairo. The original, Saracenic. 15th century.\n\nBought from the collection of Gaston de St Maurice (1831-1905). Acquired as 1021 & 1021A-1884. Plaster casts numbered 1020-1884 to 1046-1884 were bought for a total of \u00a360.\n\nThe V&amp;A holds approximately 200 objects from the collection of the Comte Gaston de St Maurice (1831-1905). St Maurice was a French aristocrat working in Cairo for some 20 years as equerry to the Khedive (Ottoman governor) of Egypt. During that period, St Maurice accumulated a large collection of historic objects from Islamic Egypt, dating especially from the 14th-16th centuries but also including some 19th-century objects. His tastes ranged widely and his collection included works of art from Syria, Iran, India, East Asia, as well as Europe. These objects were installed, some of them as furnishings, in the maison arabe built for him between 1872 and 1879 by the French architect Ambroise Baudry (1838-1906), who designed several houses for prominent French ex-patriates in Egypt. Part of the decoration of St Maurice\u2019s house included plaster casts taken from a variety of historic buildings across Cairo, especially those built during the reign of Sultan Qa\u2019itbay (r.1468-96). \n\nSt Maurice exhibited his collection at the 1878 Paris Exposition, where it was seen and its quality commented on by curators from the South Kensington Museum (now the V&amp;A). After the exhibition, St Maurice\u2019s collection remained in Paris, on deposit in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Due to the increasing political instability in Egypt, culminating with the British occupation (in 1882), St Maurice tried to sell his collection to the South Kensington Museum. The price was considered too high, but part of the collection was received on loan in 1883, the remainder staying in Paris at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Eventually in 1884, the loaned objects from St Maurice were bought by South Kensington. Stanley Lane-Poole (1854-1931), Arabist and external advisor to South Kensington on \u2018Saracenic art\u2019, considered this collection to be \u201cof the greatest value and rarity\u201d.",
