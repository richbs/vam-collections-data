            "public_access_description": "This lacquered and gilded panel was formerly the front portion of a Buddhist 'sadaik' (manuscript chest). The design, in fine thayo work (relief moulded lacquer) on Burmese teak, depicts scenes of 'poongyi' (monks) offering their 'tha-beik' (food-bowls) to the Buddha, who is also surrounded by different types of worshippers in conventional depictions of meditation, kneeling in adoration or holding food bowls. \n\nIn the 19th century, chests in various sizes were important items of Burmese furniture. Some were quite small, and were used for storing personal and important domestic items. Others were larger and used to store bedding and, in monasteries,  books and manuscripts. They were usually placed on stands, supported by four legs and could be decorated, like this one, with lacquer, or glass mosaic. \n\nThis panel was obtained in the late 19th century  from a Buddhist temple in Taungdwingyi (100 miles south of Mandalay) but it is likely that it was made near or in Mandalay where the craftsmen in lacquer specialized in making relief patterns of this sort.",
