The use of techniques such as 'maki-e' (sprinkled picture) to create objects of ornate beauty and utility, as upon this incense burner, was pivotal to lacquer wares endorsement as a luxury commodity rather the poor quality, plain wares of the underprivileged. Incense was also appreciated only by the wealthy members of society as incense had to be imported from the mainland of Asia. The collection of various scents by enthusiasts began during the Muromachi period (1336-1573) and grew in popularity by the Edo period (1615-1868). The lively decoration on this incense burner depicts numerous dragonflies which symbolise agility and power.\nThe earliest examples of this six lob form of incense burner (akoda) are attributed to the Kamakura period (1192-1333). Later designs from the Muromatchi period (1392-1573) are much rounder in shape and imitate a gourd. The bronze basket weave top is well-rounded and its geometric patternation emphasises the rounded lobes of the base.",
