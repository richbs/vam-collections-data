Although the original provenance of the object is unknown, it was made by a Sienese goldsmith, probably for use in a Tuscan church.\n\nHistorical significance: This object is one of the largest translucent enamels in the V&A's collection. This important technique was especially exploited in Siena from the late thirteenth century, and was employed to produce some of the most important works of ecclesiastical metalwork from the period. The metalworkers of Siena in the early fourteenth century were highly sophisticated artists, aware of the latest developments in painting and sculpture. The scene shown here recalls painted versions of the same subject by Simone Martini and 'Barna' da Siena (an artist probably identical with Lippo Memmi). Enamels of this sort were small but highly detailed, and would only have been visible close-up.",

            "production_note": "The attribution of this piece to the Sienese goldsmith Ugolino di Vieri (first mentioned 1329, died 1380-85) or a close associate is longstanding. It was first placed in this ambit by Rossi in 1956, an opinion followed by Gaulthier in 1972 and Campbell in 1983. More recent opinions have expressed some caution: Taburet-Delahaye (1988) has suggested that the work emanates from an artist close to, but not identical with, the 'Maestro di Frosini', and Cioni (1998) has in a footnote also disputed an attribution to Ugolino or his circle.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The exact function of this object is not clear. When acquired, it was believed to be a morse (a fastening for a cope), but this is unlikely, given the fact that there are no traces of a clasp arrangement. In fact, the back of the object is smooth. The holes in the triangular pieces of copper around the outside of the frame originally held cabochon pieces of glass, rather than acting as fixings, as is shown by the surviving glass cabochon on the piece. Nevertheless, it seems most likely that this object was intended to be affixed to something, either a larger piece of metalwork, or an ecclesiastical textile - perhaps even an altar frontal. A similar, although somewhat smaller, plaque is affixed to the 'Sacra Cintola' (Holy Girdle) in Pisa.\n\nA very similar object survives in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, Paris (inv. no. Cl. 21557), identical in terms of its form and the decoration of its frame, although the enamel panel is probably by a different artist than that of the V&A's plaque. It is possible that this was intended to be fixed to the same object as the V&A plaque.",
