It may have been designed for use in a temple, but more probably, because of its size, for home use. Although the figure appears to be dancing, this more probably represents a priest or even a deity.\n\nTaoism was the religion of most Chinese, including the Emperor, prior to the 17th century.  It evolved from a simple philosophy into a highly-structured religion with temples, priests, monks, holy sites, a pantheon of deities and more than 1500 sacred texts.",
