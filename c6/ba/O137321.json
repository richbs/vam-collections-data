These I erected in the Little Theatre when I constructed  it in 1910 but subsequently when I did some additions a few years later they had to be removed\u2026  They have been in my store room here ever since\".  He offers them to the Museum noting \"although not in 'mint' condition they are not in bad condition\".\n\nSmith sends to Long\nfor report as they are oil paintings on paper on plaster or canvas\n\n6/6/36 CW reports\nthat they can not \"ever have been very interesting paintings and they are now in extremely bad condition\u2026the paper is very frail\u2026more trouble\u2026than they are probably worth\".\n\n17/6/36 (BSC?) reports to the Director\nthat they are in bad condition and as paintings do not reach a high standard but \"they are of interest as specimens of English decorative painting of the latter part of the 18th century, of which we have not many examples in the Museum\u2026.\"  On the understanding that they are incorporated in the Dept of Woodwork he recommends acceptance.  And adds \"frames would have to be made for them\".\n\n23/6/36 Clifford Smith to the Director\nthat Mr Long felt that \"when they are cleaned they would make an interesting addition to the decorative work which we exhibit (purely as decoration) in the Woodwork Galleries\".  He proposes that the lunettes \"can be shown (surrounded by a suitable moulded frame) at the height of a doorway, for which they were painted\".",
