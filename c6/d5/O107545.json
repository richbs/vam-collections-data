The Louvre bracelets are made of  individual panels, some of which are authentic Etruscan a baule earrings of about 600\u2013450 BC that have been hammered flat. These were then mixed with modern plaques in the Etruscan style, and made into bracelets in the second half of the 19th century; perhaps made up for the Marchese Campana, before the Castellani family saw his collection.\n\nThe Castellain copies do not reproduce the originals exactly but are inspired by the so called \"ancient\" models. From these and other adaptions of the bracelet type by Giacinto Melillo of Naples a new form of archaeological style jewellery was invented and popularised.",
