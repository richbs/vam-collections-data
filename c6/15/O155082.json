Queen Victoria by Maharaja Dalpat Singh of the princely state of Partabgarh or Pratapgarh in Rajasthan, India, in 1864. The exquisitely detailed scenes on the box are composed of plaques of theva work. This unusual technique, which probably originated in Pratapgarh in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century, has sometimes been confused with enamelling but instead uses plaques of coloured glass on to which the jewellery overlays an openwork design in gold. The outline of an image or scene is first incised on a thin sheet of gold and the background is cut away to form the design, with details lightly chased on to it. The glass cells are backed with foil to reflect light and are usually contained in a silver-gilt surround. This technique was popular with British in the nineteenth century.",
