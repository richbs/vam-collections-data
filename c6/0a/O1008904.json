The original Girdlers Hall had been destroyed in the Blitz. Heal's supplied the furniture for the new building which was completed in January 1960, and with Heal's encouragement, the Girdlers' committee agreed that Donegal Carpets would create a set of traditional carpet designs to furnish the new building\n\nThe design is one of six given to the V&A by the Worshipful Company of Girdlers and form part of a larger collection of nineteen designs. The other thirteen have been given to the Guildhall Library (MS35955), because the Library also holds archives relating to the commission.",
