The illustration is of a large scale as it was made to be shown on television. This illustration depicts some of the principal adult characters in the book. The geometry teacher, Mr Wilkins, is shown at the centre /left of the group, turning to the headmaster and Mr Carter on the right; while another teacher with a briefcase, who also appears in E. 500-2007, stands at the left. Quentin Blake has effectively conveyed Wilkin's short temper in the way that he turns abruptly from the man with the briefcase to the two figures behind him.\n\n\"Thanks to Jennings\" comes from a series of 25 Jennings books which Anthony Buckeridge (1912-2004) wrote between 1950 and 1994. These humorous children's books were set in a boy's boarding school during the years after World War Two. The humour of the books draws on the combination of this setting with the misunderstandings resulting in the actions of by the impulsive Jennings his more cautious best friend, Darbyshire. While illustrating a moment from \"Thanks to Jennings\" this work effectively creates a sense of the different personalities of the characters, such as the eruptive temper of Wilkins or the mild mannered Carter at the right hand of the group.",
