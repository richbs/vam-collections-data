Some pieces might interlock, but most of the puzzle was just pushed into place. This meant that it would not stay in one piece very easily. To solve this, the outer edges of some puzzles, like this example, had long interlocking pieces that would hold the whole puzzle together. Many puzzles were produced for educational purposes. This one highlights one of Britain's national industries. It shows scenes connected with the building of a ship from the oak-tree to the ship sailing.",
