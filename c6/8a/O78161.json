            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nIn Britain paper printed or painted with patterns has been used for decorating walls since the 16th century. By the late 19th century wallpapers were widely used by all classes, in homes and also in public buildings. Originally, most wallpapers were printed in water-soluble distemper pigments. In 1853 a new method of printing using oil-based colours was invented, which was developed for commercial production in the 1870s. Wallpapers printed in this way were washable and were described at the time as 'sanitary' wallpapers because they were more hygienic.\n\nDesign & Designing\nManufacturers protected the copyright on new designs by registering the pattern with the Patent Office Design Registry. When a wallpaper had been registered in this way it had a code or a serial number printed in the margin, which identified the pattern and indicated the year it was registered. The number on this paper indicates that it was registered in 1895.\n\nMaterials & Making\nDavid Walker's business was founded in Middleton, Lancashire, in the 1880s. The firm specialised in the production of sanitary wallpapers which were machine-printed, using engraved rollers. Walker's wallpapers were considered to be among the best of their kind because he printed on good-quality paper and used as many as 12 colours for each design.",
