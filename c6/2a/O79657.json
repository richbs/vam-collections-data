Written inscriptions or pieces of material with magical or religious associations were often enclosed in containers, and the shape of these containers, a triangle, rectangle or cylinder, was so associated with its amuletic purpose that it was often assumed to have the same value as its original contents, regardless of whether or not it contained anything, or could even open.\n\nCylindrical amulet cases, called khiyar, meaning cucumber, from their shape, are common in the Syrian region.  The name of this example was recorded as \u2018kladi\u2019 when it was acquired, which is a generic Arabic name for a necklace.  It was described as being \u2018worn under the left arm\u2019.\n\nIt was bought for four shillings and six pence at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.",
