Men and women throughout Norway wore collar buttons, called halsknapper, as part of their traditional costume, to fasten the neck of their shirt.  Some had a stud fitting at the back, but others, like this, consisted of two buttons linked by a silver ring.  Halsknapper like this, with filigree rosettes on the buttons, and long pendants of filigree beads and Maltese crosses, are typical of the west coast, particularly the region around Bergen.\n\nIt was bought for seven shillings at the International Exhibition, London, in1872, but the acquirers were not sure what it was.  It was described as Swedish, and possibly a watch chain, in the acquisitions register.",
