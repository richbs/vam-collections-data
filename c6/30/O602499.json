They were engraved by George-Jacques Gatine after drawings by Horace Vernet and Louis-Marie Lant\u00e9. Whilst most fashion plates were on a small scale, designed to fit in women's magazines such as the Journal des Dames (which Gatine contributed to), the Incroyable et Merveilleuse plates were on a grander scale, designed for print collectors. Gatine's fashion engravings, particularly the Incroyable et Merveilleuse series, are now considered some of the finest records of French fashion of this period.\n\nThis engraving shows a Merveilleuse, or marvellous woman, in a white muslin dress and extravagant bonnet. The Merveilleuses often wore the most outrageous fashions of the day. The white dress trimmed with puffed muslin and pink embroidery and tassels, worn with elbow length gloves and sandal shoes tied with matching pink bows, is a very fashionable ensemble. However, all attention is focused on the high-crowned bonnet trimmed with a bunch of enormous morning-glory flowers. Although the low neckline and short puffed sleeves usually indicate evening dress, the outdoor context and bonnet suggest this was designed for day wear.",
