            "public_access_description": "The large dish with bird and lattice design in Kutani-style overglaze enamels is by Hasegawa Sojin (b.1935), a Kanazawa-based artist who has been a member of the Japan Crafts Association since 1974. The palette of rich yellow, green, blue and aubergine is characteristic of a distinctive type of seventeenth-century Japanese porcelain which was the model for one of the numerous varieties of ware produced at the Kutani kilns in southern Ishikawa Prefecture during the nineteenth century. While it is now believed that the earlier wares were actually made in Arita, the traditional view - hence the term Old Kutani wares - was that they were made in Kutani. The strength of feeling behind regionalistic claims to the Old Kutani tradition is reflected in the enormous amounts spent by the local government in building up the impressive collection of seventeenth century wares in the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art.\nIf the Old Kutani style has been the basis for extensive commercial exploitation by local ceramic manufactures, it has also been the starting point for new work by individual artists in the Kanazawa and Kutani areas. In this respect Hasegawa is heir to interests pursued during the prewar years by leading figures such as Kitade Tojiro (1898-1968) and Tokuda Yasokichi I (1873-1957). His contribution to this legacy lies in his powerful sense of design and, more particularly, in his boldly calligraphic approach to enamel painting. This is especially apparent in the execution of the lattice pattern within the more solidly depicted birds are disposed.",
