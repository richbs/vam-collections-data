The <u>Catalogue. Paintings, Miniatures, &c.</u> by Samuel Redgrave notes of the 'Oil Paintings', 'The strength of Mr. Dyce's valuable bequest to Department of Science and Art does not lie in [this] portion ... which is in its nature of a very miscellaneous character.  The collection was made apparently as objects offered themselves, and without any special design.'  Dyce's main interest was in literary subjects, and this is reflected in many of the paintings he bequeathed to the V&A.\n\nHistorical significance: Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and diplomat. He was the most versatile and influential Baroque artist of northern Europe in the 17th century. An educated and urbane member of the Antwerp patriciate, he was employed by the rulers of the southern Netherlands as their ambassador and became painter to the courts of Europe.  Apart from his paintings\u2014which included altarpieces, history and mythological scenes, portraits and landscapes\u2014he designed tapestries, book illustrations and pageant decorations, as well as his own house and small items of sculpture and metalwork.  His numerous pupils and assistants included Anthony van Dyck. Rubens\u2019s style was overwhelming and few contemporary artists withstood its influence; later generations of often very diverse artists derived much from his art.  Dyce.60 is one of at least three copies after of a male portrait attributed to Peter Paul Rubens ca. 1620-30 (sitter and current location unknown). There was a version of almost exact dimensions sold at auction in Amsterdam (21-11-1933) and documented in the Wagner Collection, Geneva, 1954.  The highest quality version, possibly a seventeenth century work by Rubens himself, was sold in 1938 at Asscher & Welker in London as a Anthony van Dyck. Dr. Rudy Ekkart [verbal communication, February 2010] suggested that all subsequent versions are copied after this work. The two other versions are substantially larger and were both sold at auction in London in the 1930s. While Dyce. 60 clearly represents the same sitter as the above mentioned portraits and the technique imitates the master's style, the thick brushwork and impasto is unlike Rubens' softer and more refined painterly style of the 1620s. Dyce. 60 appears rather to be a 19th copy after the original.",

Individual portraits moved from being primarily intimate works preserved within private settings into more public objects which were positioned more visibly within the domestic interior. A great majority of these were commissioned by well-to-do citizens, whether prosperous merchants and professionals, or members of the city patriciates.
