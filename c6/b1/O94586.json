It was made in the workshops of the silversmith Paul Storr (1771-1844), who was one of the most famous English silversmiths from about 1800 until he retired in 1838.\n\nBread baskets were particularly popular items of tableware from about 1700 to 1800. These baskets were usually circular, oval or boat-shaped with an everted (turned-out) rim and a high, arched bail handle. The handle was sometimes fixed but more often hinged, as in this example. The sides were often decorated by piercing or die stamping or a combination of both techniques. The basket usually rested on a supporting rim with similar decoration. The decoration you can see on the foot of this example is called gadrooning.",
