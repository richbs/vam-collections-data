The idea is illustrated by a colour photograph of a dustbin filled with communist propaganda paraphernalia.  \n\nThe poster is the work of B\u00e9la Aba, who designed the corporate identity for the Hungarian Democratic Forum during the campaign for the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism.  All three elements of the graphic identity appear on this poster: the full name of the party (Magyar Demokrata F\u00f3rum), its abbreviation (MDF), both in an elegant 'Antiqua' font, and the party emblem based on a stylized palmette plant motif. Aba kept this motif as a flat form in pure green, but later versions added red and white colours and developed the emblem into a tulip. Both the palmette motive and the tulip appealed to the conservative voters because they are associated with old Hungarian cultural traditions. Stylized plant motives decorated the robes and arms of the Hungarian tribes that conquered the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century. The tulip is a characteristic motive of Hungarian folk art. The popularity of the logo was enhanced by rumour that it was invented by Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, a popular pop singer and composer. Aba did indeed use a sketch by Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi with whom he was friendly. However, the original drawing was profoundly modified by the designer.",
