He was born in Hereford and came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but made his London debut as an actor in 1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre as Richard III. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted during his lifetime in many of his most famous roles, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810). \n\nThe fashion for representing actors and actresses in ceramics was at its height in the late 18th century and for most of the 19th century. The top performers could command high salaries wherever they appeared, and since they achieved levels of fame equivalent to that of stars of the music industry in the 20th century, they were frequently represented in paintings, drawings, and prints which the ceramic industry used for their images on tiles, jugs, busts and statuettes.",
