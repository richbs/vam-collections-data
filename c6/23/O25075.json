This is one half of the bracket which has a similar figure on the reverse ( IM.73-1927).  It was formerly sliced in two before the museum acquired it, but is now rejoined.  The figure  is damaged having been cut off at the knees and she has also lost both hands and a portion of her left breast. Her hair is smoothed over her head with a shallow, oval bun at the front.  She wears courtly jewellery, including ear-lobe ornaments, two bead necklaces and arm bangles from her wrists almost to her elbows. She also wears a belt  round her hips made of over-lapping fish-scale-like segments with an elaborate central clasp. This belt secures a diaphanous skirt (<i>antariya</i>) which has a narrow girdle in front below her waist, which leaves the rest of her lower body nude.  There is a looped sash shown behind her on her right and folds of the skirt are visible between her legs.  This bracket belonged to a ceremonial gateway (<i>torana</i>) marking an entrance to a shrine, most probably a Buddhist or possibly a Jain <i>stupa</i>.",

The pillar was at some time split into two halves, the other face being I.M. 72-1927, but they are now reunited.  The subject represents a guardian Yakshi (Vrikshaka) down to the knees.  She stands with body conforming to the curve of the bracket, with her arm raised over her head to hold the branch of a flowering Ashoka-tree, whilst her right hand  (broken away) rested on the rich girdle which encircles her hips.  Each forearm is almost completely covered by thirteen bracelets, the ears have large jewelled earplugs and round the neck are two bead-necklaces.  The figure is apparently nude, but the ridge across the stomach and the sash falling down her left side, indicate the skirt of transparent diaphonous muslin.",
