He compliments her by saying \"you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the world\", and she replies \"Feel it...\" Sterne continues:\n\n\"I had counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the fortieth, when the husband, coming unexpected from a back-parlour into the shop, put me a little out in my reckoning. - 'Twas nobody but her husband, she said - so I began a fresh score. - Monsieur is so good, quoth she, as he pass'd by us, to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulse. - The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said, I did him too much honour... \"\n\nThe novelist refers to her as a \"grisette\", a working woman sometimes employed as a shop assistant or garment maker. Yorick eventually buys some gloves, pays the woman and departs.\n\nFrith produced a number of works that interpret scenes from Sterne's novels. The Laurence Sterne Trust holds a painting entitled The Beautiful Grisette (1853), which shows the shop counter separating the parson and the woman.",

Studied at Sass's Academy from 1835; entered RA Schools. In a long, prolific, and highly successful career, exhibited 107 works at the RA between 1840 and 1906, 13 at the BI 1838-1857, and 12 at the Society of British Artists 1838-1883. Subjects predominantly literary, historical, and - most notably - scenes of contemporary life, with which he achieved his greatest popular fame, amplified by many engraved reproductions, beginning with <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> (exh RA 1854 and bought by Queen Victoria). In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>Scene from 'A Sentimental Journey'</b> \n556-1882 Negs 52979, CT135564 \nCanvas, 90.2 x 69.9 cm (35\u00bd x 27\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'W P Frith 1841' bl \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1842 as 'Scene from Sterne's Sentimental Journey', the measurements given as '48 by 41 inches', and the following quotation in the catalogue: \n\nI had counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the fortieth, when the husband, coming unexpectedly from a back-parlour into the shop, put me a little out in my reckoning. - 'Twas nobody but her husband, she said - so I began a fresh score. - Monsieur is so good, quoth she, as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulse. - The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said, I did him too much honour... \n\nFrith wrote to Charles Hawker, presumably a dealer, in Birmingham: 'Did you see my picture at the British Institution of \"Sterne\"? It was infamously hung, indeed it looked wretched tho it is thought quite equal and in some respect superior to the one in the RA. It is the only picture I have by me unsold ... ' (15 May 1842). The <i>Autobiography</i> records that he sent it to Birmingham where it was sold for \u00a330. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> critic remarked that it was \n\nPlaced where it will inevitably escape the notice of all who do not already know sufficient of his abilities ... Fair play would have made him a candidate for one of the prizes instead of the dark nook to which he has been condemned ... beautifully conceived; the countenances of the group are perfect in character and expression; it is elaborately finished, and yet in a free style: as a whole it may vie with any production of our younger school of art. \n\nThe likeness of Laurence Sterne seems to be a more animated version of the famous portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1760, NPG). Sterne is the hero, Mr Yorick, of his novel, first published in 1768. In the chapters 'The Pulse' and 'The Husband', he enters a Paris shop to ask the way, and flirts with the owner's wife - 'the handsomest Grisset [that is, grisette], I think, I ever saw'by sitting beside her and taking her pulse; her husband enters, as related in the passage quoted above. The passage continues ' ... and having said that, he put on his hat and walked out'. \n\nFrith painted the same subject in a different composition titled 'The Pulse, the Husband, Paris', exhibited at the RA in 1870 (267, 107 x 128 cm (42 x 50\u00bd ins), signed and dated 1869), now Johannesburg Art Gallery). The artist presumably refers to this in his <i>Autobiography</i>: 'My second treatment of the Sterne was changed, and so was the price I received for it, for, instead of thirty pounds, I received nine hundred from Mr. Coope, in whose collection it still remains'. Frith also depicted the immediately subsequent incident of trying on the gloves, in 'A Scene from the Sentimental Journey' exhibited at the BI in 1845 (442). \n\nThere is an evident pentimento behind the lady's head, the top of the chair having been altered. \n\nPROV: According to the <i>Autobiography</i>, sold in Birmingham perhaps via Charles Hawker (see above), and 'In due time the picture appeared at Christie's, where it was sold for six hundred guineas', presumably 6 May 1871, lot 124, the property of a gentleman in Ireland (Rev E Seymour, according to Redford <i>Sales</i>), 'bought from the artist, and never engraved', sold to King for \u00a3525; bequeathed by John Jones 1882 \n\nEXH: BI 1842 (416) \n\nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1842, p77; <i>Autobiography</i> II, pp13\"",
