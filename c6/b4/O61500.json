[The cast was destroyed in the mid-1950s, when the Indian Museum was pulled down to make way for Imperial College.]\n \tThis cast was made in the winter of 1869-70, under my direction\u2026Our party left Calcutta 10th December, 1869, and Jubbulpore on the 13th, where the materials, tools, plaster of Paris, &c., weighing in all 28 tons, were transferred to country carts drawn by bullocks. Sixty carts were procured at Jubbulpore, and on 20th December the march was commenced to Sanchi about 180 miles distant. On 7th January 1870 Sanchi was reached and the work of casting commenced\u2026The painted illustrations, which are exhibited near the gateway, show the  positions of the gateways round the tope [09200 (IS)]-of the encampment near the tope [IPN 903]-and of the difficulties besetting the transport of materials, &c., from Jabbalp\u00far [sic] to Sanchi [IPN 904].",
