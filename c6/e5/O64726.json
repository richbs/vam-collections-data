It is of additional interest as the Museum already possesses two examples of Sylphides costumes, one dating from ca 1920 worn by Lydia Lopokova, and one from the 1940s/1950s worn by Alicia Markova.  While most people would have an immediate image of a Sylphides dress, these examples show how the silhouette and style changed over 50 years, from the relatively heavy and 'coarse' dress of 1920 to the more delicate fabrics of the 1960s.",
