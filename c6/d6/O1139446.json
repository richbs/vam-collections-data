            "public_access_description": "This miniature tea service, parcel gilt, each vessel composed of four panels engraved with Chinese figures and birds in landscapes, was made by Elkington and Co. in 1876 when the Aesthetic Movement was at the peak of fashionable taste.  This tea service is an excellent example of the exotic influences that underpinned the movement. The Aesthetic Movement, as it came to be known, sought nothing less than the creation of a new kind of art, an art freed from outworn establishment ideas and untrammelled by Victorian notions of morality. This was to be 'Art for Art's sake' - art that did not tell stories or make moral points, art that dared simply to offer visual delight and hint at sensuous pleasure. \n\nElkingtons by the third quarter of the 19th century were at the peak of their success.  George Richards Elkington and his cousin Henry Elkington had registered patents for electroplating and electrogilding on March 25th, 1840 which became the foundation of their commercial success.  They were probably the most frequently represented of all British manufacturing silversmiths at the many local, national and international exhibitions held between  1840 and 1914.",
