Characteristics of his work are precise modelling and elegant lines. He combined Mannerist with high Baroque.\n\nHe worked primarily for Grand Duke Cosimo III in Florence as medallist, goldsmith and bronze sculptor. In 1678 he was sent to the Grand-Ducal Academy in Rome to perfect his knowledge of medallic design and it was there that he was first commissioned in 1681 by Christina of Sweden, living in exile, to produce portraits of herself and her friend Cardinal Azzolino. Soldani went on to make several models of the Queen, with what appears to be a total of six reverses and varying obverses.",

The medals were struck in the Papal Mint under  the control of Giovanni Hamerani, Master of the Mint who retained the dies and also had moulds for casting medals. All the surviving dies were bought by the King of Sweden in 1783 and are now in the Stockholm Mint.",
