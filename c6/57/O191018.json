The first attempt at official registration was unsuccessful and the Interior Ministry denied its statues as being illegal. After demonstrations and public pressure increased the Ministry had to acknowledge it as a political organisation. In February 1990 it formed the Alliance 90 for the Public Chamber elections together with other two oppositional movements, the 'Initiative f\u00fcr Frieden und Menschenrechte' (Initiative for Peace and Human Rights) and 'Demokratie Jetzt' (Democracy Now).\n\nThe Alliance did not do well at the elections of the People's Chamber, although it had been representatives from these groups who managed to provide the moral and intellectual basis for the 'Wende' ('turnaround), often by overcoming of state repressions. They were the negotiators at the so-called 'round tables' and provided the basis, which led to overcome the GDR-system and ultimately the GDR itself.",
