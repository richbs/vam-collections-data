The centre of the dish has an applied circular relief depicting the scene of the Last Supper, the figures taken from the representation by Leonardo da Vinci, and a background of Renaissance architecture including a Venetian window, with the inscription 'Amen Dico Vobis Quia Unus Vestrum / Me Traditurus Est'. The scene is surrounded by two bands of cresting, which are similar to those on the standing paten, and then a gothic arcade with crocketed ogee-headed arches which contain a piece of tracery in the head. On the wide rim are eight medallions enclosing shaped quatrefoils which contain the heads and shoulders of four Evangelists with their symbols, kneeling angels and, at the top, the royal monogram 'GR/IV', and at the bottom, the royal coat of arms set within the garter from which hangs a small representation of a mounted St George and the Dragon with a rose to either side. Between the medallions are panels of tracery which contain in a small central quatrefoil two of each of the national emblems of England, Scotland, Ireland and Hanover. There is a band cresting on the edge of the rim which repeats one of those at the centre of the dish.",
