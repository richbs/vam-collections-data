            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of a demon hiding in a lotus leaf.\n\nIn Japanese folklore oni or demons are devious creatures with an ugly appearance capable of causing mischief and misfortune. This finely carved netsuke exaggerates the oni's grotesque appearance through its detailed features, such as its jowls, bulging eyes, sharp teeth and two protruding horns that are visible under the curved lotus leaf. Despite the seeming simplicity of this netsuke the lotus leaf is carved in minute detail with its elegant features contrasting to the stocky and rotund form of the oni, whose bulbous body shape is neatly framed by the lotus leaf.",
