Phillips lived in Notting Hill, an area of London with a large British Caribbean community following the mass migration from the Caribbean in the immediate post-war period. His photographs form a visual record of this part of London during the 1960s, especially the growing black population and its impact on local culture. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Charlie Phillips as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
