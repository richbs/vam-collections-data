He was the son of Thomas Robinson, a wood engraver. Robinson was educated at Islington High School and Highbury School of Art and subsequently apprenticed to the lithography firm Waterlow and Son. He first came to notice in 1895 when his drawings were published in the influential magazine <u>The Studio</u> and he was asked to illustrate R.L. Stevenson's <u>A Child's Garden of Verses</u>. Charles Robinson and his brothers William Heath Robinson (1872-1944) and Thomas Heath Robinson (1869-1950), were among the most popular illustrators of the Edwardian period. Charles Robinson was elected President of the London Sketch Club, and in 1932 was elected to the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours (the RI). \n\nAccording to Simon Houfe, Robinson's illustrations had eclectic sources, and were 'partly inspired by the prints of Durer, partly by the Pre-Raphaelites, their space often suggestive of Japanese prints.' (1) \n\nThis painting was included in a bequest of 27 works by Charles Robinson made to the V&A in 1982 by the artist's daughter, Miss Edith Mary Robinson. \n\n<u>Note</u> (1) Simon Houfe, <u>The Dictionary of British Book Illustrators and Caricaturists 1800-1914</u>, London 1978, pp.435-6 (p.453).

Members would sit around the table and produce subject sketches from memory or the fixed title for the evening.  The sketches were for sale immediately, some being exchanged and others presented to special guests or the professional performers from the theatre and music hall who arrived as the session finished.",
