The biting of the hair alludes to her troubled sensuality. The drawing was exhibited at the Royal Academy without the later title, which refers to Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Pride of Youth' from The Heart of the Midlothian (1818). Sandys was a better draughtsman than painter. This example demonstrates his outstanding skill in the medium.",
