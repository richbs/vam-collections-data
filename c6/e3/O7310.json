This series has been disrupted, and the seated figure to which this head originally belonged is now in the west window. \n\nMuch of the surviving medieval glass was removed from the cathedral about in the mid 1800s and replaced with copies. The original panels were stored in various glaziers\u2019 workshops, and eventually sold off to private collectors. This panel was found in a dealer\u2019s shop in Rochester by the Reverend S. Wheatley, who gave it to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1920.\n\nThe patriarchs, or ancestors of Christ, are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Jacob\u2019s 12 sons and their descendents.",
