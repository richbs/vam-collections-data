Hartwig's early success as a fine art photographer followed his images of 'mists' and other Impressionistic or Pictorialist approaches. 'Vienna by Night', dates from 1933 and is one such image. In the photograph the artist has framed the twin spires of the city's Votivkirche (Votive Church) through an archway with light from a series of street lamps reflecting off of a wet pavement. It is a beautifully composed, balanced image and of a visual language and printing process reflecting what was produced by his contemporaries elsewhere in Europe and in America in the early 20th century, for example Alfred Stieglitz and Alvin Langdon Coburn. The soft focus, reminiscent of a painting or etching, was a device employed by the Pictorialists along with more hands-on printing methods, such as the gum bichromate process used here, which allowed manipulation of the emulsion with brushes. 'Vienna by Night' was found in Hartwig's suitcase after his death, and was apparently one of his favourite prints.",
