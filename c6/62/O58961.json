In 1810 he invented the harp-lute, which soon became a fashionable instrument for ladies. Light's main patron was Princess Charlotte (1796-1817), the daughter of the Prince Regent. The instrument had 12 strings, seven of which could be played on the fingerboard, and five bass strings, four of which could be raised a semi-tone, by turning a blade or tangent called a 'ring stop'.",
