The clay body of the pot has been dipped in a glaze containing tin and lead oxides which, after firing at a high temperature (about 900\u00b0C), has given it a completely opaque white appearance.  Subsequently the vase was painted in green and black enamels.  It was then fired again at a much lower temperature.  While this second firing was expensive, it had the advantage that the low temperature (petit feu) colours did not sink into the glaze, allowing for greater detail and precision.  The design of a fanciful asymmetrical cartouche, composed of leafy pierced scrolls and flower sprays, is typical of the rococo style which spread from France throughout Europe from about 1740 and on through the third quarter of the eighteenth century.\n\nIt was probably made in southern France (Marseilles) or in northern Italy.",
