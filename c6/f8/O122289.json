Field  light blue ground with long 5-sided panel in dark blue with stepped triangular niche at lower end.  From a small light blue vase within the niche grows a sprig with 5 star-like flowers.  The central blossom bears a further vase and sprig (9 vases in all).  These produce the effect of 3 floral rows.  At the very top of the panel are 5 similar but independent floral stars and on either side of the floral sprigs are 9 pairs of yellow ovals.  Outside the panel, the field is heavily decorated with bands of 10 or 9 and two halves of yellow bowls of three flowerheads outlined in red, purple or light brown.  These form a single column on either side of the panel and 2 bands along the upper edge.  There is a band beyond the field's lower edge, it contains 5 yellow and light blue stylised motifs, which could resemble sunburst or double-headed eagles; these are outlined in red on a purple ground.\n\nBORDERS: There are ten, described from the inside:\n(1) which also isolates and surrounds the lower panel: yellow ground with angular S-motifs, sometimes in pairs or triples, separated by a short diagonal bar.  In the upper part of the border there are 8 flowers and leaves, but some of the motifs are light brown and hard to see.\n\n(2) yellow and light brown ground.  The lower part has a band of smaller and larger red triangles with light blue decoration.  They appear at the bottom of the side borders but then become a single row of light blue triangles outliend in dark brown and (along the top part) in dark blue.\n\n(3), (5), (7), and (9): dark brown ground (small part in dark blue by accident) with a simple floral sprig.\n\n(4), (6) and (8): same sprig on cream ground.\n(10): incomplete; yellow ground with part of a multi-coloured pattern.",
