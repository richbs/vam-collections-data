The deep border along the top has been stitched in place.\nThe main panel has a gold ground [silver strip open S-wound on a pale yellow silk core] divided into an ogival lattice formed by a fine green line with pairs of pink or green spots, enclosing a floral arrangement. There are two designs: [1] a row of upright stems with a pair of pink blossoms with a central pink flower with a blue centre alternating with a blue flower with a pink centre; [2] a right curving spray alternating with a left curving spray, both with 2 blue and pink flowers and one central pink flower with blue details.\nThe left hand border has a vertical line of ogival compartments each containing an upright flower with an inner and outer border of a meander with white flowerheads.\nAdded border: gold ground [silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk core] with 4 upright cypress shapes resting on a shallow dish on a red flower. On the dish is a white vase decorated with a flower and leaves.  There is a semi-circle of white flowers above the vase and the cypress shape is filled with blue and pink flowers and topped by a large pink flower. There is a border top and bottom and down the left hand side.  Similar in idea to that in the main picture but on a larger scale. \nThought: the best quality sashes were woven in one piece; lesser quality sashes were woven in two parts, with the central section woven in one workshop and the deep end borders woven in another. \nInner and outer borders: almost circular meander enclosing a blue flowerhead and a pink flowerhead. Main border: line of ogival compartments enclosing a pink flower and a pair of green leaves. The flowers alternate in direction\nBacking: white ground cotton striped: white with a dark meander and red flowers; red speckled ground with a line of dark flowers; dark speckled ground with a line of red flowers.\nFacing: bias cut' striped white with blue leaf meander and light red motif and blue with isolated light red motif.\nThere is a cord loop in the top left hand corner.",
