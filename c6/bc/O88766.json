As dresses became increasingly curvaceous at the back, they required more artificial aids for support. By the 1870s the bustle became a separate undergarment in its own right. The new form of bustle was known as the 'tournure' or 'dress-improver', as Victorian ladies considered the word 'bustle' rather vulgar.\n\nBustles came in a variety of fabrics, including silk, cashmere, flannel, brightly printed cottons and horsehair. Some resembled colourful cushions, others were constructed almost entirely of steel. Bustles were often padded with horsehair or down to retain their shape and give form to the dress. Tapes secured the bustle to the body. The wearer tied them over her petticoat around her waist, hips and often under her bottom.",
