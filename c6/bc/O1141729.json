The frame is composed of four arcs, two at the front and two at the back, spaced to accommodate contemporary hairstyles which incorporated 'bows' and curls of hair. The net is trimmed with hand-made bobbin lace embroidered in silk floss with spots. Two streamers of hand-made bobbin lace have been roughly stitched to the lower back frame. The lower front frame is decorated with a border of opalescent shells mounted on a net covered support. Each shell is partially framed by tiny cut steel beads. An artificial flower with trailing green leaves, which was probably also added at a later date, was pinned to the cap. The flower has lancelote shaped fabric petals which are stiffened with wire along the midrib and a long stamen made from wire wrapped in yellow wool. Most of the petals are painted green with darker green veins but some are painted in shades of pink, yellow and green.",

It was worn by Eliza Larken for her marriage to William, later 6th Lord Monson, on 8 May 1828. She may have worn it on its own or with a veil attached to the back of the cap.",
