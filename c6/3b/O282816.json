It was to include dishes with covers and stands, a spoon tray, coffee pot, twelve coffee cups, six candlesticks and six fruit baskets.  it was a considerable vote of confidence in the Wedgwood manufactory which at that time was only six years old.  \nThe service arrived in 1765 and it is obvious that the Queen was pleased with it, allowing Wedgwood to call himself 'Potter to Her majesty' and rename his new type of ream ware, which was cream-coloured earthenware with a lead glaze, 'Queen's Ware'.  Although frustratingly no pieces from this service survive in the Royal Collection, pieces of Queen's Ware can still be found in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.'",
