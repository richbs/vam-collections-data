There were 15 counters to each side, and 12th century boards inlaid with bone sections have been excavated at Gloucester and Saint-Denis. About 250 Romanesque tablemen with figurative designs survive. The game was popular throughout Northern Europe and the pieces were made in a number of different centres, with the most productive workshops based in Northern France and Cologne\nThey are to be found in most museums with archeological collections and difficult to date because of their simple ornament and the unchanging nature of their design.",

They are to be found in most museums with archeological collections and difficult to date because of their simple ornament and the unchanging nature of their design.",
