The exact function is not known but the shape corresponds to a type of pottery vessel known in large numbers, usually of sturdy but rough manufacture.

The very high quality of this glass example suggests that it was a diplomatic gift from the ruler of Egypt, rather than an item of general use.

This shows that it was made for al-Malik al-Ashraf Abu'l-Fath 'Umar, the sultan who ruled Yemen from 1295 to 1296. The object is of high quality, and in its style it relates to the glass made in Egypt and Syria under the Mamluk sultans in the 13th and 14th centuries. It is possible that it was ordered by al-Malik al-Ashraf from Egypt, or it may have been made as a diplomatic gift from the ruler of Egypt to the ruler of Yemen. \n\nThe function of the object is not known for certain. It shares its shape with a large group of pottery vessels from the medieval Middle East. It has been suggested that these vessels might have been used as hand grenades or fire-blowers or containers for mercury or perfume. Since this luxury object was clearly not made to be hurled at an enemy or into a fire, it seems likely that it was used as a sprinkler for some precious liquid.",

The exact function is not known but the shape corresponds to a type of pottery vessel known in large numbers, usually of sturdy but rough manufacture. Many uses have been suggested, ranging from hand-grenades or fire-blowers to containers for mercury. Their strength suggests that they were containers for expensive liquids. The very high quality of this glass example suggests that it was a diplomatic gift from the ruler of Egypt, rather than an item of general use.\n\nThe Mamluks had close diplomatic ties to the Rasulid dynasty of Yemen, principally because of trade interests. Mamluk artists are known to have created a number of inlaid metal and glass objects either as gifts or as specially commissioned items. Although this object does not bear the customary emblem of the Rasulid dynasty, it does bear a circular medallion divided into small red, white and black triangles which may be the personal emblem of al-Malik al-Ashraf.",
