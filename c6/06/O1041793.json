            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 135, 149\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nPage from a sketch-book.\nDespite the inscription on the back, the other leaf of the sketch-book, finishing the head and identifying the clergyman wearing the chasuble, was revealed when No. 238 [609-1888] was removed from the card on which it had been mounted.  The Rev. Edmund Benson was priest-vicar of Salisbury Cathedral (Beckett, VI, p. 15, footnote).  There are some references to him in Fisher\u2019s correspondence with Constable, but none mentions the occasion of this drawing.  As the chasuble, which is of late fifteenth century design, is reversed to display the back orphrey, it is presumably not being worn for liturgical purposes.  \nIt is difficult to establish the authorship of the inscription on the back of the drawing.  It was probably there when the drawing came to the Museum, since it is partially transcribed in the <i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i> (p. 71), but is unlikely to have been written by Maria Louisa Constable.  Her initials, over which the inscription on No. 239 [799-1888] is written, also appear on the back of No. 238 [609-1888], and it may be presumed that with both sheets in her possession she would have remembered that the page completing the head was not lost.  The most likely explanation is that the inscription was written by Isabel Constable, after the drawing No. 238 [609-1888] had been laid down on card.  The inscription implies some familiarity with the circumstances, such as might be expected in the family circle.\nThe size and watermark indicate that the sheet, with No. 238 [609-1888], comes from the sketch-book discussed in the note following No. 200 [622-1888], which was first in use in 1820.\nTimothy Wilcox, <u>Constable and Salisbury.
