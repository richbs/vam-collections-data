Sanders, on the front of the coat and underneath and the stamp seems similar to that used on furniture from the late 18th century by firms such as Gillows. Neither the monogram nor the stamped name can be traced to any recorded artist of the period.\n\nThe precise identity of this sculptor is not known, though he may belong to a family of woodcarvers called Saunders who were active in the eighteenth century.",
