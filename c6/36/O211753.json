Lez is especially linked with Matthew Bourne's dance company New Adventures (formerly Adventures in Motion Pictures) for which he designed Highland Fling, Swan Lake, Edward Scissorhands, The Car Man and Cinderella. Lez's costume designs for The Reluctant King display his characteristic figures; often looking to the left, they strike a strong and distinct pose.",
