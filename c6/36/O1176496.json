Kay was inspired by the award-winning \"Rocking Sculpture\" designed by Walter Papst (b.1924 - d.2008) in the 1960s. Like Papst's design, the Billy Rocker has no head or tail to define it as an animal. This leaves children free to imagine the rocker as anything they want it to be unlike more traditional rocking toys that were usually designed to look like horses. The cardboard is also left plain to encourage children to be creative and decorate the rocker to their own design. \n\nThe Billy Rocker is a good example of a contemporary toy with eco-credentials and highlights a trend for products aimed at children and their parents which have a minimal impact on the environment. In this case, the cardboard comes from a sustainable source and can be completely recycled when the toy becomes redundant.",
