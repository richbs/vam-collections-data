There are three main borders forming a right angle around a corner motif which has a white ground and two inward pointing, confronting botehs: one has a red centre with four floral motifs and a light blue border and the other has a light blue centre, four floral motifs and a red border.  In between these two is a stylised cypress tree containing a red flower from which two stems branch; there are two red and light blue rose buds. The field of the central part of the shawl has a red ground with an offset small floral sprig in light blue.\nThe main border has a white ground with light blue serrated leaves forming a line of lozenges, each containing a red and purple flower head.  There is a small four-petalled flower head at the junction of the lozenges.  To either side of this border is a white ground border with a series of arches with red spandrels and a blue cypress tree forming the sides of the niches; there is a red flower within each niche.  The outer border is a mirror image of the inner.  A patch [19 cm long; 8 cm wide] has been sewn to the back at the lower left hand corner; it is the same pattern as the central field of the shawl plus part of a white border with a meandering stem and red flower heads.",
