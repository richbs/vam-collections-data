This dish was made to commemorate the opening of the play The Pleasure of his Company at London's Theatre Royal, Haymarket on 23 April 1959, starring Barry Jones as Mackenzie Savage. The play ran for a year and was taken to New York, but this was the last major stage appearance of Barry Jones in London. \n\nBarry Jones (1893-1981) was a prolific stage and film actor, who announced that he would make the stage his career at the age of seven when Sir Frank Benson's Shakespearean company visited his native Guernsey. He eventually joined the company in 1921 after doing National Service and made his first appearance on stage at the Grand Theatre Leeds, 29 March 1921, as the Clerk of the Court in The Merchant of Venice.",
