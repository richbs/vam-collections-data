It has been inlaid with un-carved bone plaques which create a chequerboard effect. This object was later owned by the French Count Gaston de Saint Maurice (1831-1905) who was a major collector of Islamic Art. This panel was probably used to furnish Saint Maurice\u2019s home in Cairo which was designed by French architects Charles Guimbard and Marcel Gouron- Boisvert in the Neo-Mamluk style (1872).",

            "history_note": "This door leaf was once part of a minbar (Islamic pulpit). It was probably made in Cairo, Egypt, between 1450 and 1500A.D. under Mamluk rule (the Mamluks were a military elite who ruled Egypt between 1217 and 1520 A.D.). The Mamluks were highly skilled at certain crafts including woodwork. Wooden inlay was a key mode of decoration within a mosque and this door leaf is a prime example of its application. The door leaf inlay is an example of later Mamluk inlay \u2013 by the late fifteenth century un-carved plaques were used to great effect in Mamluk inlay, the chequerboard effect of this panel being a key example of this type of inlay. \n\nThis object was owned by Count Charles Gaston Esmangard de Bournonville de Saint Maurice (1831-1905). The Count lived in Cairo between 1868 and 1883 where he worked as the Grand Equerry for the Khedive. He was a major collector of Islamic Art in Cairo where he would have purchased this panel. The Count collected many Islamic objects from the city of Cairo which he used to furnish his home in Cairo. His home was designed in the neo-Mamluk style by the french architect Ambroise Baudry. Minbar door leafs were a key interior feature in the neo- Mamluk home; photographs in the Centre de documentation du Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay show the Count used minbar panels in place of doors. \n\nIn 1878 the Count ran into financial difficulties and put both his Cairo home and his collection of Middle Eastern objects up for sale. This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. The collection was then placed on display at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs. From here the South Kensington Museum (late the V&amp;A) purchased a number of objects which became an integral part of the \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art  collection\u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517) \u2013 in this museum.",
