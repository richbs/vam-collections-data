It has close similarities to the Franz Xavier Winterhalter portrait of The Royal Family in 1846, which shows Victoria, Prince Albert and five of their children ( Royal Collections).  However, a number of details are different, including  the reversal of her sash. This suggests that the ribbon was inspired by the painting or a published engraving, but not copied directly from it.\n\nWhen acquired by the Museum, the ribbon was said to have been made in Coventry, the centre of silk-ribbon weaving in Britain in the 19th century. However, there is no documented evidence for this. Other continental examples in the Museum collections show that this ribbon could have been produced in one of many of the silk weaving centres of Europe, specifically for consumption in Britain and the Empire. \n\nThe jacquard loom facilitated the weaving of complicated figurative designs for the first time.  From the 1830s, when the technique was widely adopted, woven silk commemorative ribbons, bookmarks and pictures became a specialised and lucrative trade.",
