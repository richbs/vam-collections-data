The size of the box for performers\u2019 names depended on the magnitude of their fame. This advertises a twice-nightly show from the Shepherd's Bush Empire which was to be broadcast live on the radio on the Tuesday night. Lee Lawrence, billed as 'Britain's outstanding singing star', gets the biggest box, with a 26-year old comic: 'Radio's Peter Sellers', a close second. By October 1951 Peter Sellers had made his name in several BBC radio shows including Show Time, It's Fine to be Young, and Ray's a Laugh. In May 1951 he first appeared in another radio show called Crazy People with Michael Bentine, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe. By the second series in 1952 the title was changed to The Goon Show.\n\nThe performers who get one of the two smallest boxes on the bottom of the bill are Morecambe & Wise, later to become the hugely successful comedy double act made famous throughought the country by their own television show broadcast from 1961 until 1968.",
