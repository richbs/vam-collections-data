They were originally made of twisted metal, as the name implies, and were used as indications of rank in Celtic times.  They survived as part of the traditional jewellery in a number of places. \n\nThis torque, described as a \u2018Tok\u2019, was acquired in Cairo before 1869, and carries Egyptian silver marks from the mid-19th century.  It was described as \u2018modern Egyptian\u2019, when acquired but was probably made for women of the Siwa oasis, in the desert between Egypt and Libya.  The jewellery of Siwa is different from that worn elsewhere in Egypt, and huge torques, like this, are one of the most characteristic items.  The word \u2018Tok\u2019 simply means torque in Arabic, but the word \u2018Aghraw\u2019 is Berber in origin and specific to the torques of Siwa.",
