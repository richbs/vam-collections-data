Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nPhevos is one of two mascots of the Athens Olympic Games in 2004, the other being Athena. They are brother and sister. Their design is based on 7th century dolls found at archaeological sites in Greece. \n\nTheir names are derived from two Olympian gods: Phevos the god of light and music known as Apollo and Athena the goddess of wisdom and patron of the city of Athens. Phevos and Athena represent the link between Greek history and the modern Olympic Games and the values of participation, brotherhood, equality, cooperation and fair play.",
