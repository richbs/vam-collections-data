In between this row of red flower heads is an 8-petalled blue rosette with a red centre framed with a green leafy stem forming a heart-shaped vase with a neck from which emerges [2] a similar red flame multi-petalled flower surmounted by two small green leaves.  In between each flower head a thin green leafy stem with two small tulip buds in red and blue edged in white curves over a small 8-petalled blue rosette with red centre.\nSized on the back.  There are noticeable weaving faults. The edges have been folded under as if to form one side of a purse or bag. The textile has been pieced and one piece is patterned with a slightly smaller version of the main one: with  the motifs being 5.7 cm rather than 6.3 cm.",
