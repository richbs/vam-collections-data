The costume was worn by Christine Woodward.  The Russian dance for the Three Ivans, choreographed to the coda of the Act III pas de deux, was first introduced into Diaghilev's The Sleeping Princess in 1921, choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska.  In 1946, Ninette de Valois choreographed her own version for the new Sadler's Wells Ballet production.  In subsequent productions the item was dropped and the coda music used for Princess Aurora and Prince Florimund, but in 1977 the music was again used for a Russian dance, this time incorporating several girls; within a few seasons the number was again revised and the girls disappeared.",
