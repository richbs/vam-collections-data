However, sales to department stores and wholesalers became increasingly important after the war. Buyers purchased fabric toiles such as this, paper patterns, or even original models which they copied. \n\nChristian Dior (1905-57) was a shrewd businessman and one of the first couturiers to  establish international licensing and reproduction contracts with other companies.",
