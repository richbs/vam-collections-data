The play, subsequently made as the 1994 film The Madness of King George, concerned the period from 1788 until the end of the King's reign and dealt with the increasing mental instability of the British monarch George III (1738-1820) which is now considered to have been a result of the genetic blood disease porphyria. The disease was also suffered by Mary Queen of Scots, and her son King James I of England.  \n\nAlan Bennett's play took a wryly humorous look at the way the King was treated by his heir, the Prince of Wales, who wanted to have him declared insane so that he could take the throne, and the mostly incompetent physicians who attended him. One insists that blistering the skin is the only way to extract the bad humours that cause the madness; another constantly takes the King's pulse; a third advocates examining the royal chamberpots, the stool being 'more eloquent than the pulse,' hence the chamber pot prop.",
