The right panel bears a colour line block print of a Nativity scene. In the foreground, the newborn baby Jesus Christ lays on a white cloth on the straw-strewn ground. Joseph, Mary and a male attendant lean in to gaze upon the child adoringly. Behind the adult figures, the horns of a cow are silhouetted against an open arch window. Three prominent stars light the night sky.\n\nThe cover of the card is free of decoration and reads 'Christmas 1920' in black type. The back cover states, 'This is Number Three of a series of six Christmas cards by modern artists and is designed by Randolph Schwabe...'\n\nThe carol printed within the card is 'In the Holy Nativity of our Lord God' by Christian poet Richard Crashaw.",

            "public_access_description": "Singing carols during the Christmas season originated with the pagan tradition of singing and dancing at the Winter Solstice. Musical traditions were eventually incorporated into Christian festivals and special kinds of hymns, known as canticles, were performed in Nativity plays at the time of St Francis of Assisi in the 13th century. \n\nThe festival of Christmas was abolished by Parliament in 1645. However carols continued to be sung, printed and bought and new books of carols were registered and printed in the 1650s during the Commonwealth and the Protectorate.  In 1660, of course, all laws passed since 1641 were repealed and Christmas fully restored along with the monarchy.\n\nIn the early 19th century William Sandys and Davies Gilbert, set about collecting and publishing traditional Christmas music of various English regions, awakening a popular interest.\n\nThe carol printed within the card is 'In the Holy Nativity of our Lord God' by the devout Christian poet Richard Crashaw.",
