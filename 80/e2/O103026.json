The awards are judged by leaders from the international textile industry and split into catergories: 'Colour', 'Weave', 'Print', 'Knit' and 'Breaking new Ground'.  The judging takes place in London, with the prize presentations in Paris.  Texprint also aims to create better contact with the textile industry, actively seeking sponsorship from organisations such as the Arts Council, the Clothworkers Foundation and the Cotton Industry War Memorial Trust.",

She is interested in bringing both craft and commercial/industrial techniques to a different audience, an example of this is her participation in the knitting circle 'Cast Off' which aims to incorporate an element of youth culture into traditional craft.  McDougall takes her influence from areas as diverse as traditionally woven tweeds and dogtooths to flock wallpaper found in England pubs, recontextualising and redefining elements of each in a witty and subversive way.  This is very evident in her experimentation with rag-rug techniques, weaivng rather than hooking and combining rich sensual fabrics with lurid market stall finds - a fushion of country casuals and Pat Butcher.  McDougall uses words such as 'jumbled' and 'vandalised' to describe her experimentations - she delights in charity shop bargains and 'found' objects.  Her interest in recycling moves beyond the objects themselves, exploring the recycling of patterns and ideas, pop art and disposable imagery.",
