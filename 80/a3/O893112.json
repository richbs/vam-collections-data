It is not known how Preziosi managed to take this likeness, but the friends he made amongst the Turks may have helped. There is also the possibility that \u00c2dile Hanim might have been an Alevi, an unorthodox Muslim, who on occasion did not wear a veil.  \u00c2dile\u2019s face is the reality that visiting western Europeans tried to glimpse behind the veils women wore in the street. Her broad firm face and steady gaze belie the image of the simpering beauty that existed in the untutored imaginations of painters who never visited the East.",
