The leaves and pomegranates have a diaper filling. The waistcoat is long, slightly convex to the waist where the buttons cease and then slightly cut away. It has triple scalloped pocket flats with false vertical button holes, and three buttons stitched beneath. The buttons are of brown silk twisted over a wooden cone and the button holes are worked in brown silk. The waistcoat back is of the same material as the fronts and the pattern matches at the centre back seam. There is a slit at either hip and at the centre back. The neck line is plain except for a narrow facing of the same material. The sleeves are of darker brown glazed twill woven wool, curved with slit cuffs. The back of the coat and foreparts to the waist are lined with fawn holland and from the waist with brown silk. The front skirts are interlined with a canvas. The lining of the insertions is of a lighter linen and silk. Satin of 5 having an interruption of 2. The pattern wefts are bound in Gros de Tours to give a strong ribbed effect.",
