He was knighted by George III and became acting Chief Justice of Bombay in August 1828, two months before his death. In his spare time, Chambers was an accomplished amateur watercolour painter of landscapes and riverscapes and journeyed regularly across the harbour to Panvel on the mainland. He also explored the nearby region of the Konkan and Western Ghats, and his pictures were clearly executed on the spot as he travelled. He repeatedly painted the forts, hills and pinnacles, often including trees and vegetation to enhance his compositions. He had considerable skill in capturing atmospheric effects, and his scenes have a distinct sense of reality. It was Chambers himself who probably inserted the pictures into three albums (IS.21 to 23-1994) by slitting the leaves and placing them mostly on separate pages. They are mostly in pencil and watercolour, with a few drawings in pen and ink or pencil.  Besides views of Western India, the albums contain a few paintings of  London and scenery in England, Scotland and Wales. This picture shows a view of the Bhor Ghat with the noted landmark 'The Duke\u2019s Nose' at Khandala (Poona District, Bombay).",
