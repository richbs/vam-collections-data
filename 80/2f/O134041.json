Cat. no.3\n\"West painted his version of <i>Saul and the Witch of Endor</i> in 1777.  the subject was treated by John Hamilton Mortimer and Henry Fuseli around the same time, and by William Blake in 1783.  West's composition was engraved three times and this copy appears to be after the engraving by William Sharp.  The subject comes from the Old Testament, the First book of Samuel, chapter 28, and describes a visit by King Saul to the Witch of Endor and the apparition of the ghost of Samuel who informs him of his impending defeat and death.  Such subjects rejected the quiet dignity of classical history painting in favour of protagonists ruled by their emotions and fearful of death.  The emphasis was on human frailty in the face of forces beyond the rational. (KC)\". [Katherine Coombs]",

A 'Note' on page v comments, 'This catalogue refers to the Art portion of the Collection bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum by the Reverend Alexander Dyce, the well-known Shakespearian scholar, who died May 15, 1869'.  The <u>Catalogue. Paintings, Miniatures, &c.</u> by Samuel Redgrave notes of the 'Oil Paintings', 'The strength of Mr. Dyce's valuable bequest to Department of Science and Art does not lie in [this] portion ... which is in its nature of a very miscellaneous character.  The collection was made apparently as objects offered themselves, and without any special design.'  Dyce's main interest was in literary subjects, and this is reflected in many of the paintings he bequeathed to the V&A.\n\nHistorical significance: See Departmental Artist's File for B. West.  This contains a letter dated July 11, 1960 from Helmut von Erffa (Prof. of Art, Rutgers, the State University, USA ) to Jonathan Mayne (Deputy Keeper of the Department of Paintings) concerning a number of paintings in the V&A attributed to West.  Mayne had asked in a previous letter for Erffa to comment on whether \"our <u>Saul and the Witch of Endor</u> as autograph?\".  Mayne noted that \"I find that it was engraved in 1788 by William Sharp in almost exactly the same dimensions, which proves nothing, of course, but suggests that it might have been copied from the engraving.  Sharp's engraving was dedicated to Daniel Dulby, a collector who may have owned the original painting.\"   Erffa replied, \"I am afraid you are correct in assuming that your B. West 'Witch of Endor' is indeed a copy after the engraving.  At first I thought it might be West's copy for the engraving but after comparing the signed version in Hartfield, Conn., I cannot bring myself to accept the V&A version as an original.  It is not clear enough in bringing out the roundness of Saul's figure or the light and dark relationships of the figures on the right.  Of course, much could be due to the condition of the picture.  The expression in the eyes of the figures on the right and left also seems to point to a copyist.  Of course, without having seen it I do not want to be too dogmatic, but when west copied himself for the engraver, he was always extremely careful in his details.\"",
