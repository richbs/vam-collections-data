The white ground is divided into wide and narrow stripes; all the colour is carried in the warp. From the left:\n[1] narrow stripe with an upright floral motif of an iris, 2 buds and 2 pale green leaves rising from a small dark green mound with a pair of small dark green leaves.  The petals of the flowers and buds are worked in cream silk. The floral motif alternates with a small dark green flowerhead in the centre of 2 dark green brackets with half flowerheads at each end.\n[2] wide stripe: a cartouche shaped lattice formed by fine dark green S and Z shaped lines with a rounded pale green flowerhead where the lines meet and also half way along each line.  In each compartment is a stylized cypress tree in pale green with dark green details.\n[3] as [1]\n[4] Central stripe: this is a narrower version of [2] and is 13 cm wide rather than 29.5 cm. The design in the upper 13.5 cm changes to form a mihrab/niche.  The change is abrupt with 3 dark green and 2 pale green lines forming an elongated lobed arch.  The ground is yellow and the niche contains curling dark green stems bearing pink carnations. There is a spray of 4 pink flowerheads at the base of the arch and at the top of it is a motif in dark and pale green which looks like the 'eye' in a peacock feather.\nBacking: pieced; white ground printed with small black dots and fine black stems and leaves which come from a curved dull red feathery leaf outlined in white.\nFacing: bias cut, white and dark grey striped cotton.",
