The eye is tricked into believing that the objects are three-dimensional. Verde' d'Arno marble is used to imitate the patina of the bronze lamp. \n\nThe table is mounted on a stand of Renaissance revival style; the top section is on a hinge so that it could be inclined, thereby becoming a work of art to be appreciated like a painting on an easel.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
