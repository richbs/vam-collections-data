            "public_access_description": "This roundel, until fairly recently, had been considered to be the work of a stained glass artist working in the Swabian region of Germany. This attribution was made because of the black, etched foliate design of the background which is characteristic of that region. More recent opinion identified the artist of the roundel with the circle of the 'Master of the Housebook' (who has also been associated with the 'Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet'). Both the Swabian artists and those associated with the 'Master of the Housebook' were influenced by the same original source material.\n\nThere is a roundel depicting St. John the Baptist in the Schnutgen Museum in Cologne which is from the same series as the V&A's roundel. The background of the Schnutgen roundel is also composed of etched foliage and the figure of the Baptist stands on a grassy plain surrounded by rocks and studied botanical arrangements. The execution of his clothing is the same as that in the St. Peter roundel.\n\nThe figures of the Schuntgen St. John the Baptist and the V&A's St. Peter are both derived from engravings by Martin Schongauer, a painter and engraver working in Germany at the end of the 15th century.\n\nThese two roundels were undoubtedly from a series depicting the Apostles and other important personages associated with Jesus Christ. They may have been made for a church but it is also possible that they were commissioned for a civic building or a private house. Clear roumdels with just silver (yellow) staine and black/brown pigment were made in large numbers and were quite affordable.",

ISBN 1851774041\nSt Peter stands in a rocky landscape, in the foreground of which are finely executed flowers and leafy plants. The background is painted in black enamel etched with foliate designs, and details are coloured with yellow stain. He holds his customary attribute - a large key - in his right hand and a book in his left.\nThe roundel has long been closely associated with another of St John the Baptist, of the same size and by the same hand, now in the Schniitgen-Museum in Cologne. The roundels have been attributed to the so-called Master of the Housebook or Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet, a Middle-Rhenish painter and engraver working around 1470-80, but the output of this master (or masters, as more than one artist was involved in the illustration of the books after which he is named) in glass-painting remains a matter of debate. Both saints are derived from designs by Martin Schongauer (the St Peter reversed) and share the remarkable attention to detail of his engravings of both figures and plant forms. The present roundel had been badly broken before acquisition and was disfigured with a spider\u2019s web of leaded repairs, shown in all previous illustrations These were removed in 1989 and the roundel carefully restored.\nLymant, Brigitte, Die Glasmalereien des Schnutgen-Museums Koln, Koln, 1982\ncat.80\nSchnitz, H., Deutsche Glasmalereien der Gotik und Renaissance (Rund und Kabinettscheiben), Munich, 1923\nfig.13\nSchnitz, H., Die Glasgemalde des Kgl.
