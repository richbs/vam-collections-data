Covered in white sparkly residue. Vamp highly decorated. Large medallion over toe of floral (spade-shaped leaves and five petalled leaves) openwork on gilded background (now mostly gone). Between medallion and instep is an incised, interlaced waves and cutout dots/circles pattern. Once of a different colour as layer beneath was exposed; also a V shaped strip of applied leather; then incised lines in a V shape, criss-crossing between two bordered lines and having cutout dots/circles inbetween; then another line of applied leather. Then instep (high throat and pointed) finishes with an oval shaped knop that has broken off. Knop has incised lines and a central openwork of a figure 8 in the centre. Heel: Strip of leather between quarters. Two incised lines follow quarters' edge from vamp to heel and end in more incised decoration. Either side of backseam are four vertical lines (2 close together). Between the lines are incised criss-crossing diagonal lines. One line, incised from left, angles up to right while two lines, incised from left, angle down to right. Openwork dots between these lines. Heel has a separate piece of semi-circular leather coming up from the rand and is 15mm wide over the backseam.",
