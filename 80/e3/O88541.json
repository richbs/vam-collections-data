Tempest began her illustrating career in the 1920s and is best known as the creator of the children's book characters Little Grey Rabbit and Fuzzypeg the hedgehog. This long-running series of children's books, written by Alison Uttley and published beginning in 1929, are still being re-issued today. Margaret Tempest illustrated the first 30 of these, until 1970. The individual characterisation in her images made them household names. In fact artist and author often disagreed as to who could take the most credit for creating the characters. Tempest also wrote and illustrated 20 books of her own in the 1940s and 1950s, including the Pinky Mouse and Curley Cobbler series.",
