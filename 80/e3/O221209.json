By the 1940s, the dress had become tailored to be much more form-fitting, and this dress retains this feature. The short sleeves may reflect on the relatively more humid climate of Hong Kong, where the dress was made. \n\nThe ensemble, along with the waistcoat feature, has been tailored in the fashion of a Western dress suit. The design of the waistcoat however, is reminiscent of the Chinese vest worn over women's robes during the Qing dynasty,  while the front of the jacket is shaped in the style of a Malay traditional blouse known as the kebaya. The Malay reference is not so surprising if we consider that by the 1920s, the Hong Kong entertainment industry had many links with the Southeast Asian region, particularly with Singapore as a distribution base for production companies such as Shaw Brothers Studios.",
