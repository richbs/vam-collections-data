Ivan Mestrovic was one of the leading Croatian artists of the twentieth century.  The subject of the portrait, Sir Eric Maclagan, was Keeper of Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum, rising to become Director in 1924. Mestrovic had two long stays in England, and the portrait was probably made on his second visit in 1919 when he made a number of busts and figures of friends and celebrated contemporaries. Mestrovic and Maclagan had become close friends in 1915 when the latter organised an exhibition of Mestrovic's sculpture at the Museum. The lead version of the Head was owned personally by Maclagan (until its gift to the Museum in 2005), and the plaster cast of it seems to have been made to be kept at the Museum.",
