            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis Chinese porcelain vase was made in about 1700, during the Kangxi period (1662-1722). It is mounted in gilt-bronze mounts of about 1815-1830. Oriental porcelain mounted in Europe with gold or silver-gilt mounts had been part of princely collections in the West since the 14th century. By the 18th century, porcelain was usually mounted in less costly gilt bronze. This vase and another similar piece were mounted as a 'pair'.\n\nTime\nPopular in France until the 1790s, the taste for such objects remained strong in Britain from 1800 to 1830, particularly in the high-society circles dominated by the Prince Regent.  The mounts of this piece bear all the characteristic motifs of British taste in the Neo-classical style, such as the scrolls with curled leaves, paterae (flower heads), and acanthus leaves. Mounts provided an opportunity for the goldsmith to display great inventiveness and virtuosity.\n\nOwnership & Use\nBy 1750 porcelain was no longer a precious and rare material. It thus became overwhelmed by elaborate mounts in the contemporary taste in order to form an essential, though decorative, part of a fashionable interior. Such pieces of mounted porcelain - formed into cups and covers, salts, tankards or, as here, mounted with the lids raised as pot pourri pots - were destined for display on buffets, mantelpieces or sideboards.",
