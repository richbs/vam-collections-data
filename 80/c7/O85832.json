St Dorothy is crowned with flowers and holds a wicker basket filled with flowers and fruit, attributes connected with her legend.  At the corners of the frame are the four Evangelist symbols, and in the middle of each side a personification of the sun.

            "public_access_description": "The central image of the Virgin and Child and Sts John the Baptist and Dorothy is set within a double frame of green and blue glass. The outer frame of blue glass includes, in the four corners, symbols of the Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, who wrote the four Gospels of the New Testament. In between them at the tops and sides are four personifications of the sun. The whole composition strongly resembles the richly decorated covers of church books.\n\nIn the biblical books of the prophet Ezekiel and Revelation there are descriptions of 'four winged creatures'. Since the 4th century, the church has equated these creatures with the writers of the Gospels, and they are often portrayed as such. Matthew's symbol is the winged man, because his book begins with the human ancestry of Christ. Mark is the winged lion, because he starts with an account of John the Baptist - the 'one crying in the wilderness' - the lion is a creature of the wilderness. Luke is the ox, a sacrificial animal, since he begins his Gospel with the sacrifice by the priest Zachariah. Finally, John's symbol is the eagle, which flies high towards heaven - his Gospel begins with the Word of God. \n\nHere St John the Baptist is accompanied by a scroll that bears the text 'ecce ang', an abbreviation for 'Ecce agnus dei' ('Behold the Lamb of God'). The Gospel of St John the Evangelist recounts that he spoke these words when he saw Jesus Christ. \n\nThe cult of St Dorothy did not develop until late in the Middle Ages. She was popular in Germany. Legends say that she was a young noble woman living in Cappadocia (in eastern Turkey), which was a rich province of the Roman empire. During the persecution of Christians under Emperor Diocletian (reigned 284-313), she was brought before the Roman officials and refused to recant her faith. While she was imprisoned, her pagan persecutors taunted her to bring them fruit and flowers from the garden of her god. Miraculously, she did so, and her attribute (identifying symbol) is a basket of fruit and/or flowers. St Dorothy was often included as one of the 'Fourteen Holy Helpers', a late medieval devotion.",

ISBN 1851774041\nThe enthroned Virgin holds the Christ Child on her knee and is flanked by St John the Baptist and the seated virgin martyr St Dorothy.  The Baptist strides forward, book in hand, and points towards the Christ Child, his gesture reinforced by the words written on the scroll representing his speech: 'ecce ang (for agn[us]) dci' ('Behold the Lamb of God'). St Dorothy is crowned with flowers and holds a wicker basket filled with flowers and fruit, attributes connected with her legend see Becksmann, 1988, p1.51 and p.168, for a figure of St Dorothy in Airshausen of about the same date and origin). At the corners of the frame are the four Evangelist symbols, and in the middle of each side a personification of the sun.  The extremely fine needle-point diapers of the background, consisting of yellow-stained flowers on exquisite lacy stems, the figure style and the designs of the Evangelist symbols  close to those of the Master ES. and Martin Schongauer \u2014 indicate that the panel was made in a workshop in Strasbourg or near by in the years around 1470-80.",
