This was probably the first range of commercially produced toys designed for the disabled. \nAll pieces are the same shape but (1) is longer. They are solid blocks of light wood; polished but not varnished; which are shaped with a pointed roof along the top edge and a cut away inverted V along the bottom edge. The overall appearance is an arrow shape and it allows the blocks to fit together. \n1. W. 5 1/2in \n2-4. W. 1 3/4in \nThe Abbatt catalogue describes the bricks as follows: It is almost impossible for the handicapped child to build with normal bricks. These bricks have been shaped to enable him to build with greater chance of success. The 'ridged' shapes hold the bricks together and there is less frustration in building play.",
