The bodice front has a wedge-shaped panel of embroidered cutwork insertion with laid-and-couched braid in guilloche patterns; and the robings, which continue to the hem, are of foliage-patterned cutwork to match that on the sleeves.  The gathered skirt has a central panel finished with rows of horizontal tucks and bands of cutwork insertion, and the garment fastens at the bodice back with a pearlized button and stitched loop, and a neck drawstring.  The waist has been trimmed at a later date with braid of gauze ribbon flowers and foliage in pink and green.",
