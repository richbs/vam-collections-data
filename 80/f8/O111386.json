Greek goldsmiths were known for their intricaly woven loop-in-loop chains made of fine wires. By the Hellenistic period (323-27 BC) colours slowly became an important aspect of Greek jewellery. To achieve colour, gold was often combined with gemstones, or glass imitations. Garnets were most popular, but emeralds, carnelian, rock crystal, agates, onyxes or lapis-lazuli were also used.\nGemstones were pierced, cut, abraded and polished like in this case, or left as a natural crystal. The Greek were renowned for their art of gem carving. \nThe clasp on this necklace is in the shape two gold goat's heads. Animal heads were also commonly used on earrings and on bracelet terminals.\nNecklaces were generally worn tight around the neck, or in a looser fashion at the base of the neck. They were often worn in multiples, especially a necklace with simple beads like this one with one of more complex form.",
