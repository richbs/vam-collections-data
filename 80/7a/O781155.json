Horizontal-format print depicting St Anthony seated in the foreground overlooking a river, intently focused on a bible or prayer book, with a town rising on the hill behind him. Also known as St. Anthony the Abbot or St. Anthony of Egypt (c.251-356), this Christian saint was an Egyptian hermit and one of the founders of monasticism. During the Middle Ages, he was venerated in the German Rhineland as one of the Four Holy Marshals, invoked against infectious diseases including the plague, and ergotism or \u2018Saint Anthony\u2019s fire\u2019. He is shown wearing a hooded monastic robe with a mendicant\u2019s rod planted in the ground beside him, bearing his emblem, a bell, rung by monks of his Order asking for alms. The northern European setting is clearly indicated by the architectural style  of the town, its tall narrow buildings, towers and fortifications evoking 16th-century Nuremberg. The composition encloses the saint within the landscape, the outline of the town echoing his hunched shape.",

ISBN 089835000X. B.58, pp.132-135.\n'This is one of D\u00fcrer's very few prints in horizontal format. The ascending diagonal line of the background is similar to that of the \"Holy Family with St. John, the Magdalen, and Nicodemus\" (.043). For this cityscape, which parallels the contours of and overpowers the diminutive saint, the artist reverted to an older drawing in his file, the \"Pupila Augusta\" (SD.1496/17). Wearing an Antonite habit, the saint is identified by his mendicant's rod with a bell to call for alms. The cubistic approach coincides with D\u00fcrer's preoccupation during this year with stereometrically constructed figures (SD.1519/18).'\n\np.132\nDodgson, C. <u>The Masters of Engraving and Etching: Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>, London and Boston, 1926. 91.\nHollstein, F.W.H. <u>German Engravings, Etchings and Woodcuts, c.1400-1700</u>.
