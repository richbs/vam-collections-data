This is a comparatively inexpensive plate in earthenware,  decorated by transfer-printing only, with no hand-colouring.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis plate recalls the characteristic design used for char-pots, containers used for serving potted char (a Lake District trout), which were made of English delftware, pearlware or creamware and had the image of a fish modelled on the lid.   Although this plate is from a comparatively little-known factory, the quality of print is sharp and accurate and the fish is clearly identifiable as a herring. The print was presumably taken from one of the many anthologies of natural history published during the mid- and late 19th century.\n\nTime\nClose & Co. of Church Street, Stoke-on-Trent, was apparently in operation for only a short period , from around 1855 to  around 1864 or 1869.  The owner was John Theophilus Close, who is also recorded as at Brook Street and High Street.  Many 19th-century factories were short-lived as markets and fortunes fluctuated, and the names of many makers have been lost.",
