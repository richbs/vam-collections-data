He was billed as \u2018A Patter Comedian \"The Woman Who Knows\"\u2018. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nScott made a great hit at Hanley with his Katherine Parr costume and patter. He is shown here in one of the various female roles for which he was famous, including The Gibson Girl and Boadicea, as well as Katherine Parr, last queen of Henry VIII.\n\nMalcolm Scott (1872-1929) spent his early career as a straight actor at the Theatre Royal in Margate. This was followed by a time as a Pierrot with Adler and Sutton at Llandudno, when he first appeared as a more refined Dame than others of the period, with witty patter. After acting as a \u2018deputy\u2019 turn for Dan Leno at the London Pavilion in 1903, Scott proved so popular that he secured a ten-year contract for appearances at the Pavilion and the Palace music halls. A popular pantomime star, Scott toured in Great Britain, continental Europe, South Africa, Australia and the USA.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall comedian Malcolm Scott (1872-1929), a Dame comedian well-known for his witty patter, often billed as 'The Woman Who Knows'.  Born in 1872 he made his first appearance as a straight actor at the Theatre Royal Margate in 1886. As a Pierrot with Adler and Sutton at Llandudno, he appeared as a female impersonator of a somewhat higher tone than the usual dames of the period.  When Dan Leno suffered his first breakdown in 1903 Scott was engaged as a 'deputy' turn at the London Pavilion with such success that he was given a ten-year contract top appear for six months at the Palace and Pavilion. He was popular in variety and pantomime for 25 years, touring the UK, Australia, South Africa, Europe and the USA.  His most famous role was Katherine Parr but other impersonations included The Gibson Girl, Nell Gwynn and Bodicea. The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
