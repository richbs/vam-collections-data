Jean Forbes-Robertson first played the part at the Gaiety Theatre, Christmas 1927, and subsequently became one of the best known actresses associated with the role, playing it at the Garrick Theatre, 1928/1929; at the St James's, 1929/1930; and at the Palladium for five consecutive Christmases, from 1930 until the end of the 1934/35 season. Other actresses took the part subsequently at the Palladium but Jean Forbes-Robertson returned to play it for the last time there for the 1938/39 season. \n\nThis is one of several wax figurines modelled by Agatha Walker in the 1920s and 1930s, mostly of actors and actresses in costume for roles in successful productions on the London stage. There had been a craze for ceramic figurines of performers in the 19th century, and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures. They were modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine wax layer which was then coloured.  In 1931 there was an exhibition of her wax figures at the Fine Art Society.",
