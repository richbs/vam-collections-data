The vivid colours and intricate patterns accentuate the femininity of the silhouette and create a playful contrast to the fluid black body of the dress.\n\nLie Sang-Bong is one of the most innovative contemporary Korean fashion designers. His eccentric, poetic designs draw inspiration from traditional textiles, as well as Korean folk painting, calligraphy, architecture, embroidery and shamanism. His collections also reflect an interest in western art, in particular Cubism, Bauhaus and film noir. \n\nThrough cutting-edge technology and an experimental approach, Lie creates exquisite pleats, bold shades and prints. His edgy yet feminine silhouettes combine tradition and modernity. A multi-skilled maker, Lie also works in ceramics, product design and interior design. More of his work can be seen in Room 140, Ceramics.",
