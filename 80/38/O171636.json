Its plain design was part of the movement in fashion away from what were considered by some to be the extravagant excesses of the late eighteenth century.  The move was towards a simpler, purer style of dress and footwear that was influenced by designs from classical antiquity. \n\nSlippers, or 'sandal shoes', continued to be worn well into the mid-century although by the 1850s they were used mainly for formal wear in black or white.  This pair of shoes is a typical example of that style although they were more commonly made of less robust materials such as silk or satin rather than leather.  The thin leather sole and delicately hand-stitched uppers were relatively simple and cheap to produce.  Sometimes, the shoes would then be customised either by the retailer or the owner with a rosette or bow and ribbon ankle ties.",
