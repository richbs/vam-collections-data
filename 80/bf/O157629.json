The domed section is embossed with three lion masks amid strapwork and sprays of fruit on a punched matted ground. The body (or drum) is similarly chased between bands of ovolo ornament, stamped 'X's and circles. At the top of the body is a reversed domed section and this is chased in a manner similar to the foot and contains a plain receptacle for salt. The cover is domed in two stages, and its chasing echoes that of the body. It has a wide flange stamped with egg-and-dart ornament and a broad border, crimped and engraved with radiating wrigglework. The finial section is of spool form, chased above and below with fruit, with three applied S-scroll brackets; it is surmounted by a warrior figure holding a shield and a spear.",

            "public_access_description": "In England the relative value of salt and the necessity for its use from the Middle Ages gave this commodity a place of honour at the table. The container used to hold it, the standing salt, thus gained social importance as well as providing a practical function. The standing salt was placed upon the table as a decorative centre piece. The surface of this particular example is decorated with stamped, chased and embossed decoration. It is surmounted by a warrior figure that holds a spear and a shield.\n\nFor those who could afford such a luxury, salt cellars (often referred to as salts) were the most common household item after spoons and cups. These salts also carried symbolic meaning and royal goldsmiths' accounts show that they were purchased as christening gifts for the children of courtiers. The inclusion of salts in lists of heirloom plate also demonstrates that these were considered to be of relative personal significance.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
