In the centre is a scene of Saint Francis of Assisi lying on his couch in his cell, and at his feet is a lamb, one of his symbols. A friar kneels beside him and another brings food through an open doorway. An angel playing a violin hovers in clouds above. An inscription at the bottom left begins with 'FLOS DIANA', but the rest is illegible. There was originally another inscription over the shelf above the saint's head, but this is only apparent from traces on the back of the embroidery. The picture is bordered by compartments outlined by scrolls. The central compartment at the top contains the arms of the Farnese and Aldobrandini families, and the central compartment at the bottom has a fleur-de-lys (badge of the Farnese family) with the initials 'R F' for Ranuccio Farnese within a glory, with a scroll and motto above which is illegible. The other compartments contain flowers and fruit sprigs with animals.",
