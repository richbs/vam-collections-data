A quarter of this design appears in each corner.  In the middle of the upper and lower edge of this central panel are two light blue leafy stems with exotic blossoms and stylised fruit and buds in red, light blue, grey and black; some of the larger flowers form a circular frame around the central medallion.  The central panel is framed by a composite border: a narrow edge of a thin meander on yellow either side of a white border containing a black stem meander holding red and blue flowers with blue details. A wider band with a white ground contains a larger scale leafy meander in black and blue bearing exotic blossoms and buds in similar colours and in four variations.\nIn each of the outer corners is an inward pointing floral stem in light blue with red details; there are two variations, in diagonally opposing corners.\nThe narrow edge and wide border are repeated and the outer most border is undecorated red.  Down the  left hand side part of one of the narrow borders has only partly been printed: only red and light blue has been used - the dark lines are missing.  There are so many minor differences in the design that it suggests much of the pattern has been drawn and painted rather than printed.\nBacking: pieced; cream ground with small red botehs edged with black and filled with red floral motifs; offset rows, each row facing in the opposite direction.  A red leafy line links the motifs.  One piece of the backing has only been printed in one colour; it ought to have been over-printed with a second red to produce the dark lines and complete the design.\nThere is a layer of padding and diagonal lines of stitches have been used to quilt through these three layers.\nFacing: bias cut dark blue woollen twill with offset rows of botehs; each facing in the opposite direction. Light yellow and light blue.",
