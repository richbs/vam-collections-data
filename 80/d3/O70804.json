Above them is a background decorated with leaf-shaped patterns. The crowned and bearded figure of the Risen Christ, wearing a gown and a cloak fastened with a brooch, is enthroned in glory; his right hand is raised and he holds an orb surmounted with a cross in his left hand. He is surrounded by the souls of the blessed, ten of whose heads and shoulders are to be seen. They do not appear to be angels since no wings are shown. They are within a mandorla, the border of which is carved with triangles and rays around the lower edge. The mandorla is placed asymmetrically and comes right to the top edge of the panel, perhaps to give a sense of movement upwards. On the left of the panel stands the bearded figure of St. Matthew, wearing a gown and a cloak, with a halberd in his left hand and a money box in his right. \n\nThe top corner of the panel is damaged and the bottom of the panel is missing. The alabaster at the bottom is heavily iron-stained. Only slight traces of paint remain on the panel. This is mainly black in the triangles of the mandorla and beneath the feet of Christ.\n\nA ridge down the middle of the back of the panel marks the place where saw cuts from each side met. There are three lead-plugged holes. There are two sets of marks: three parallel lines and three parallel lines intersected by a single line. The bottom has been cut away.",
