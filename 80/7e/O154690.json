Its floor-show was written by the club's owner, Helen O'Brien, taking ideas from a wide range of sources, from popular song to Shakespeare; while based on the traditional showgirls, all leg and, at that time, topless, the references and wit of the designs of Ronald Cobb combined into a sophisticated entertainment.  \n\tThis design was part of a sequence based on Shakespeare's plays, incidentally posing the question 'How much information do you need to recognise one of the plays?' In the case of 'Antony and Cleopatra' Cobb has settled on a fantastical Roman military uniform, the helmet surmounted with a galleon representing the Battle of Actium, while Egypt is represented by the g-string in the form of an Egyptian motif and Cleopatra's asp is entwined around the upper arm.  \n\tAs with many of Cobb's designs, he combines symmetry with asymmetry, here in the contrasting colours and styles of the leg 'guards'.",
