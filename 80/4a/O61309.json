Idzikowsky was probably the most famous interpreter of Harlequin after the role's creator, the legendary Nijinsky, and he performed the role not only with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes, but in later years with the Vic-Wells (now Royal) Ballet.  As the inscription gives no date, it is impossible to say when the shoe was worn.  Although not specific, the shoe was given by Idzikowski to Cyril Beaumont, who he knew well.  \nThe soles of ballet shoes were often scored, either by the manufacturer or the dancers, to give improved grip on stage.\nThe shoe came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: The ballet shoe is the most personal of dance artefacts, as each dancer is responsible for darning and stitching on the ribbons to suit her own personal preferences and each dancer 'wears' out the shoe in a different way, according to her physique and the role.  The dancer darning shoes is a potent image in 20th century dance iconography, a symbol of at once her drudgery and humility.  \nA shoe worn by a great dancer in a particular role on a certain night (such as a premiere) and signed, dated, and dedicated to the recipient, implying that the recipient was with the dancer at the time, attains almost iconic significance for balletomanes.",
