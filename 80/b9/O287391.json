Spotted birds with fantastic plumage perch on branches on a column of wavy outlines defined by dots. One branch grows from the space between columns and bears a large leaf in green, red and yellow, much of which is also defined by dots. This leaf supports an island of ground across which walks a monkey dressed in a blue coat and red and yellow breeches. He has a large basket on his back containing a dead bird, vegetables and flowers. A broom projects above his head. On his arm is a basket of eggs and beneath his arm a large fish. He walks with a stick.\n\nThe cotton is printed with madder mordants from an engraved roller giving reds, pinks, purples and black. Bright yellow, vivid single green and a bright blue have been added by surface roller. The ground is buff with areas of white reserved for the figures.\n\nThere is just under one repeat in the height of the piece.",
