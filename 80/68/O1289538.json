He leans forfard with hid arms behind him and pigtail flying behind. The background evokes the set of the ballet\n\nParade was created by Jean Cocteau (who had the idea and wrote the libretto), Pablo Picasso (designing his first ballet), Erik Satie (composer), with choreography by L\u00e9onide Massine. It received its premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris on 18 May 1917. This drawing was probably made by White when the ballet was first performed in London in 1919. \n\nThe role of the Chinese Conjuror was created by the choreographer of the work, L\u00e9onide Massine who also danced the early performances in London where this illustration was drawn. \n\nThe drawings by Ethelbert White were commissioned by the bookseller and publisher Cyril Beaumont and appear to have be intended as possible illustrations for a small book in the Impressions of the Russian Ballet series. Beaumont published twelve volumes documenting eleven ballets between 1918 and 1922.\n\nThe Theatre &amp; Performance Collections at the V&amp;A also hold the costume for the Chinese Conjuror, glass plate photographs by Lachmann of Massine in the role in 1917 and designs by Picasso for the costume.",
