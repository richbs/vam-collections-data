As a child he was fascinated by the exotic, unattainable world suggested in the tiny images found on the foreign stamps which he secretly acquired through the black market. His patriotic father destroyed his collection but not his obsession. As a grown man and artist he combined his knowledge of the kind of images found on official Soviet stamps, (produced by the government to counter the black market collectors) with the desire inspired by the foreign ones,  usually with a good dose of  humour and or satire. In the fruit jelly series, decadence and delight are suggested in equal part, with the unlikely celebration of something so mundane, yet, for an artist struggling to survive in Russia, all too likely a rare treat.",
