The GLC was the elected body responsible for administering the British capital, and over several years its Left-wing stance angered and embarrassed the Conservative Party that was then governing Britain. The 'Say No To No Say' campaign to resist the closure initiated by the Conservatives' leader, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, produced some inventive images. This one shows the poster hoarding south of Vauxhall Bridge over the River Thames, one of 12 sites chosen by the advertising agency Boase Massimi Pollitt for their stunt of wrapping up selected posters in red tape.",
