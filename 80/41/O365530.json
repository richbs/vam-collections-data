These fabrics appear to have been chosen for both bed hangings and window curtains; in this period it was particularly fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other. \n\nThis document is likely to have been an estimate for the furnishings of a house; it bears the client's name, Mr Robinson of Winchmore Hill, but not that of the upholsterer who drew it up. Winchmore Hill is to the north of London, still a village in the late 18th century, but experiencing much new building from the 1770s. Woodblock printed cottons had widespread popularity in the period, and would have been considered particularly suitable for furnishing villas and genteel cottages, where more elaborate or heavier materials could have been obtrusive .",

These fabrics appear to have been chosen for both bed hangings and window curtains; in this period it was particularly fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other. \nThe leading printworks for woodblock furniture chintzes were in Lancashire and Cumbria, where printing was carried out for London linen-drapers, such as Richard Ovey of Covent Garden, who from 1790 to 1831 was the leading London merchant for 'furniture prints'. Although these cottons cannot be identified with a particular manufacturer, they are known to be English as they include blue threads woven into the selvedges, corresponding to legislation passed in 1774 to distinguish between home manufactured and imported cotton, for excise purposes.\n\nThis document is likely to have been an estimate rather than an invoice; it bears the client's name, Mr Robinson of Winchmore Hill, but not that of the upholsterer who drew it up. Winchmore Hill is to the north of London, still a village in the late 18th century, but experiencing much new building from the 1770s. Woodblock printed cottons had widespread popularity in the period in any case, but would have been considered particularly suitable for furnishing villas and cottages, where more elaborate or heavier materials could have been obtrusive (Collard, p.274).",
