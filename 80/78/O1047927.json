Close examination in raking light reveals embossed numbers and letters--including 'BFK'--on the surface near the right edge of each print. Therefore it is possible that these photographs are printed on two pieces cut from the same sheet of BRK Rives paper, which could be bought already albumenized, or prepared by the photographer.
