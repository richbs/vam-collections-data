The company has collected an archive containing many historical textiles and pattern books to provide its designers with inspiration. This textile design was inspired by objects in the V&A collections. Its design is 18th-century in inspiration, and probably comes from a Chinese wallpaper.\n\nBy the 1920s, however, avant-garde textile designers in Britain were particularly interested in severe, sparsely coloured, abstract and geometric designs. Although Bakers did not embrace the extremes of this style, the company did bring out an experimental range of purely geometric patterns.",
