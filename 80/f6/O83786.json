This sketch was engraved in mezzotint by David Lucas with the title 'A Mill near Brighton' (S.4). Shirley (S.: L., p. 161) says that progress proofs are dated 1829. The work on the plate was well advanced in March 1830, but it was not included in the editions of English Landscape Scenery published during Constable's lifetime. It first appeared in Moon's edition, 1838. Holmes, p. 248, dates c.1828, and Shirley (L. ed. S., p. 230) states categorically that it was painted in that year. The dated progress proofs show that it had been painted by 1829.\"",
