The squared yoke is made up of vertical bands of lace insertion with a fruit motif, alternating with bands of self fabric worked with feather stitch, and edged throughout with a matching lace frill.  The lower part of the long gathered skirt is made up of horizontal insertions of feather stitched silk bands and lace insertion to match that on the yoke; the skirt hem is finished with two scalloped flounces of matching lace.

The early years of the twentieth century saw a move to creating baby clothes in lighter weight fabrics and more delicate trimmings, particularly those garments intended for formal wear and special occasions.  This Christening robe is made from a soft fine Japanese silk which was imported into the UK, and trimmed with an unusual machine-made lace with a fruit motif, possibly a European import.",
