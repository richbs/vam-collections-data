            "public_access_description": "Some of the animal panels at the oliphant reveal a knowledge of Byzantine silks, while the crude quality of the carving and the elementary treatment of the human bodies and faces indicate a date earlier than the Farfa casket of ca. 1060 and show a clear adherence to earlier Longobardic figurative traditions, as manifested in the co-called Ratchis altar and the paliotto of Sigualdus in Cividale. The tenacity of the Longobardic heritage in Southern Lazio, Molise and Campania, which continued in some areas until the 12th century, is illustrated in the area around Campobasso, Benevento and Capua, where stone reliefs in a style comparable to that on the present horn are to be found at Capua, Petrella Tifernina and Matrice.\n\nProbably made for ceremonial purposes, the horn does not have any indications that chains or straps were attached to it to aid handling and travel or even allow suspension for display.\nThe two raised bands with panels were perhaps intended to give the impression of gilt metal containing coloured enamel, an effect which would have been obtained by the application of the red mastic surrounding the figures in the panels.",

The tenacity of the Longobardic heritage in Southern Lazio, Molise and Campania, which continued in some areas until the 12th century, is illustrated in the area around Campobasso, Benevento and Capua, where stone reliefs in a style comparable to that on the present horn are to be found at Capua, Petrella Tifernina and Matrice.",

The decoration of the inner curve of the horn, unusually showing the cross, the mounted horn-blower and the 'giant', reinforces its difference from the latter group. If it is not possible to identify the large figure - rather different from the others and with a frontal, staring attitude - with confidence, it might tentatively be proposed that it represents the legendary Roland, who from an early date was associated with such horns in the Christian West and was especially popular with the Normans. In the 12th century Chason de Roland it is recounted that 'Just as a stag flies before hounds, so the pagans [in this context the Muslims] take flight before Roland', and it is therefore perhaps of relevance that just such a creature is shown alongside the Cross on the horn. The two raised bands with panels were perhaps intended to give the impression of gilt metal containing coloured enamel, an effect which would have been obtained by the application of the red mastic surrounding the figures in the panels.",
