The finished piece is then fired and the result is an exquisite translucent glass-like form on the vessel with very fine detail.\nThe p\u00e2te-sur-p\u00e2te technique was a decorative style fashionable during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Figurative decoration in a delicately rendered neo-classical style was particularly popular, and was applied to a variety of useful shapes, such as vases, but also to decorative plaques. In France p\u00e2te-sur-p\u00e2te was developed by the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory whilst, in England, Minton employed the technique to great success. \nLawrence Arthur Birks (1857 - 1935) worked 22 years for Minton, apprenticed to the great p\u00e2te-sur-p\u00e2te artist Louis Marc Emmanuel Solon. He left Minton in 1894 establishing L. A. Birks &amp; Co.; 1900 Birks Rawlins &amp; Co., The Vine Pottery, off London Road, Stoke-on-Trent. The pottery mainly produced fine bone china tablewares, but Birks continued to produce p\u00e2te-sur-p\u00e2te when production allowed.  This work required a high level of skill and Birks's pieces were described by the Pottery Gazette in 1902 as examples of the most difficult class of fine art ceramics comparable to the wares produced by Solon.",
