Following the establishment of Christianity in the countries surrounding the eastern Mediterranean, small crosses were produced in large numbers to be worn as jewellery. Their production was not confined to precious metals. Indeed the majority of surviving pendant crosses are of less precious materials bronze, wood, bone etc. \n\nCrosses such the present example, continued a tradition of worn amulets, well established in the Roman and Egyptian worlds. Crosses also served as personal jewellery with amuletic properties. In the case of the present example, the pendant was probably worn and buried with a Christian. Where recorded, the origin of most surviving examples is a burial context. The cross offered the carrier protection and was considered to guarantee an eternal life.\nThis particular cross is decorated with incised lines and drilled rings into the surface. The concentric ring adornment is one of the most common motifs to be found on this type of object.",

            "historical_context_note": "Following the establishment of Christianity in the countries surrounding the eastern Mediteranean, small crosses were produced in large numbers to be worn as jewelery. Their production was not confined to precious metals. Indeed the majority of surviving pendant crosses are of less precious materials bronze, wood, bone etc. \n\nCrosses such the present example, continued a tradition of worn amulets, well established in the Roman and Egyptian worlds. Crosses also served as personal jewellery with apotropaic properties. In the case of the present example, the pendant was probably worn and buried with a Christian. Where recorded, the origin of most surviving examples is a burial context. The cross offered the carrier protection and was considered to guarantee an eternal life.\n\nThis particular cross is decorated with incised lines and drilled rings into the surface. The concentric ring adornment is one of the most common motifs to be found on these objects, there are many examples of crosses and cross-shaped buckle plates from Asia minor/Palestine which also bear such rings. Unusually for a pendant cross, this object is pierced through front to back; the majority of crosses are pierced through the sides so that a necklace can be threaded through and the cross can lay flat on the chest. Cross shaped buckle-plates are pierced front to back, but the material of this object would not be suitable for such an item. The incised lines are used (as on 604-1890) to emphasise the shape of the cross and to enliven an otherwise plain surface.\n\nChristianity arrived in Egypt from Judea. It probably first came into Alexandria, which was both an intellectual centre and the home of a large Jewish community. Christianity was heavily persecuted in the third century AD, but was widely accepted by the end of the fourth century. The Christian church within Egypt was known as the Coptic church, from a corruption of the Greek word for Egyptians, Aiguptioi. The term 'Coptic period' is a very approximate one; it may be thought of as running from the third century AD until around the time of the visible decline of Christianity in the ninth century AD. It is roughly equivalent to the Byzantine period elsewhere in the Mediterranean world.",
