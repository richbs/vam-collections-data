The stamped mark of Miguel Ybarzabal of Eibar on the lock is covered with gold foil. The steel is filed with five grooves. The barrel is lued and of Spanish form, octagonal at the breech and round at the muzzle, the interface chiselled with a wreath of acanthus leaves against a gold ground. The breech is stamped with the maker's mark with a fleur de lys on each side. The upper facets over the chamber are inlaid with silver foliate scrolls. The barrel is secured by pins instead of the capucines more usual on Spanish weapons.",
