Following the recommendations of the 1835 Parliamentary Select Committee on the need for good design in industry, Cole aimed to produce affordable objects decorated with \"appropriate details relating to \u2026use\". Although scarcely an original idea, the statuettes of wine-harvesting cherubs are clearly highly appropriate for wine vessels. Summerley's was wound up in 1849 after production difficulties, but Smith and Nicholson continued to make these popular patterns, which the Museum bought from them in 1864 for \u00a36.6 shillings.",
