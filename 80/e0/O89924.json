Born in Russia, of German parentage, Hohenstein moved to Italy in 1889, and began working as artistic director for the printers G. Ricordi & Co in Milan. He was influenced by French Art Nouveau, and his designs are characterised by bold composition and rich colouring. He attracted other major design talents in Italy, such as Giovanni Mataloni and Leopoldo Metlicovitz, to work for Ricordi & Co.",
