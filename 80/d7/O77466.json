            "public_access_description": "The obverse (front) of this medal shows the Queen in profile facing left; on the reverse is an allegorical figure group with the helmeted figure of Britannia seated in the centre. Such commemorative medals were made in great numbers for sale to the public. This example was produced by Spink & Sons, although the name of the artist is unrecorded. It still retains its original presentation box. This medal was struck in bronze. Struck medals were produced from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. A flat disc was placed between the dies, which were then compressed, so that the design was reproduced on the metal. This technique meant that a high number of medals could be made using the same dies over and over, whereas the technique of casting medals could be more complex, and generally smaller numbers were made.",
