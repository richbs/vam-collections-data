            "public_access_description": "Alix Stone was unusual among designers in producing drawings of groups of related costumes.  Theatre designs are usually seen singly, and it is difficult to get any idea of the complexity of creating designs for a large number of individual characters that, for instance, make up the chorus in an opera, or extras in a play. The designer has to create a total picture, in which the principal characters stand out against the moving background of a big chorus while not destroying the whole stage picture.  Photocopying the 'scroll' allowed the designer and the costume makers to see the overall shape and pattern of individuals within the group, or how the principals related to each other or the chorus.  \nDesigning variations on a single theme, like 18th century prostitutes, gentlemen or street vendors is a greater test of a designer than creating grand individual costumes.  \n\nAlthough theatre designs are often considered works of art and are sought after by museums and private collectors, their artistic worth or decorative qualities are secondary to whether they 'work' on stage.  The success of a costume design cannot be judged until it is translated into fabric, texture and decoration by the costume makers and seen as part of the whole stage picture.  Some designers are very knowledgeable about costume making and produce very detailed designs, with notes on fabrics and making techniques, others create an 'atmospheric' drawing, which gives the feeling of the costume, and they then either work closely with the costume maker to realise their concept or have trusted makers who know their work and can create the effects they have in mind.",

The design was executed for a production of Massenet's opera \"Manon\" performed by the English National Opera at the London Coliseum, January 24th 1974.  The opera was translated by Edmund Tracey, and the production was directed by John Copley.  The scenery was designed by Henry Bardon; the lighting was designed by Robert Bryan; and the choreographer was Pauline Grant. The production was subsequently revived at the Coliseum in September 1974, and extensively toured various English provincial theatres during the springs of 1974 and 1975.  \n\nThe production was later revised with some new costume designs by Alix Stone at the London Coliseum on April 12th 1979.  This revised version was subsequently revived at the Coliseum in February 1980, February 1982, and October 1984.",
