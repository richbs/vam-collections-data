This is one of  a set of six cushion covers that tell the story of the Prodigal Son from the New Testament. The sophistication of the design and the evenness of the weaving, along with the clear colours, distinguish this piece from an English cushion cover (see museum no. T.1-1933 in the British Galleries).  The figures are also larger and better drawn than those in English cushion covers, and the borders are typically Flemish.\n\nUse\nTapestry cushions were used in most Northern European countries. Houses  were very sparsely furnished by modern standards and chairs were usually reserved for the master and mistress of the house. Cushions were vital in making benches and stools less uncomfortable.",
