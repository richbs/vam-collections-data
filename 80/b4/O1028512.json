Cotman had the \nexample of Turner\u2019s visit to Normandy in \n1815 to inspire him to make the first of his \nthree visits there in 1817, a trip which he \nplanned to satisfy his own curiosity about the\npossible Norman antecedents of Norfolk archi- \ntecture. Many of the drawings made on  \nCotman\u2019s Normandy tours were executed  \nwith the help of a Camera Lucida (see no. 48), \na mechanical aid to drawing in perspective \nmuch used by topographical draughtsmen at \nthe time, and admirable for the literal \ntranscripts demanded by antiquarian studies. \nCotman contributed many illustrations to \nDawson Turner\u2019s <i>Account of a Tour in \nNormandy</i>, published in 2 volumes, London, \n1820, and also all those for <i>Architectural \nAntiquities of Normandy</i>, published two years \nlater.\u2019",
