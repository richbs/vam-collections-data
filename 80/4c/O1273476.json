            "public_access_description": "Armet Francis emigrated to Britain from Jamaica at the age of ten and went on to have a varied photographic career. In a series of fashion photographs taken in Brixton market for 19 magazine, Francis showcased black British style against an urban backdrop. Brixton was one of the areas in London which had developed a large black British community following migration, mainly from the Caribbean, in the post-war period. Francis\u2019 photographs depict this multicultural urban community in contrast to the bold glamour of 1970s fashion.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired nine photographs by Armet Francis as part of the Staying Power project. Photographs by his contemporaries Neil Kenlock and Charlie Phillips were also acquired as part of the project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
