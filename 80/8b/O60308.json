Marie Turnoswky's brother was a friend of Loos'.\n\nThe chest of drawers was designed en suite with a room divider, a cupboard, a dressing table and a wardrobe. Its cubic shape, simple outline and the unusual brass handles root this piece firmly in the ideas of the Vienna Secession movement. However, the panelled construction of the wardrobe derives from traditional cabinet-making techniques. \n\nAdolf Loos used the same handles on a sideboard designed in 1900 for the Vienna apartment of the essayist, Dr Otto Stoessl.",

Exactly the same handles were used by Loos on a great sideboard of dark-stained oak, designed in 1900 for the Vienna apartment of the essayist, Dr Otto Stoessl (1875-1936). \n\nThe bedroom in the Turnosky apartment also contained a room divider, a cupboard, a dressing table and wardrobe <i>en suite</i> with this chest of drawers.\nIn 1931, Heinrich Kulka (1900-1974), pupil, friend and colleague of Loos, drew attention to Loos's revival of traditional panelled construction in these pieces, in contrast not only to the specious designs of Hoffmann and Van de Velde, but also to the furniture shown in the Werkbund's <i>Die Form ohne Ornament</i> (1924).",
