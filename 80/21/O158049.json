The tapering stem becomes squared above a compressed spherical knop and is chased with panels of scalework on a punched matted ground, with shells at the shoulders. The vase-shaped socket is chased with swirling leaves and scrolls on a similar ground. Four branches radiate from a central octagonal baluster section chased with panels of trellis work, foliage and ovolo ornament; each branch is of double scroll form, chased with foliage and terminating in a plain vase-shaped socket and shaped circular wax pan with a scroll, foliage and matted border.

            "public_access_description": "This candelabrum and its pair are among the earliest known silver candelabra made in Britain. They were made for Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford (1676-1745) and are engraved with his crest and the motto of the Order of the Garter. Later acquired by a celebrated collector of Huguenot silver, Lord Swaythling, they were recognised by his grandson in Sir Arthur Gilbert's Californian home.\n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the religiously tolerant Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauceboat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
