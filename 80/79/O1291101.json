He had to flee for his life to France for a time but, on his return to Algiers he was captured, imprisoned and tortured; and offered life only on condition of recanting and becoming again a Mohammedan. This he refused to do. The Bey of Algiers ordered him to be laid at the bottom of a mould concrete to pour over him. This done he built him into the castle wall. An eyewitness described the exact position of the Block..\"in the hope\" he said \"that one day God would bring to light the remains of his faithful martyr Geronimo\" Cast of figure in Museum Algiers. 1853 300 years afterwards the French pulled down the old fortifications. They looked for the block of concrete + found it. It sounded hollow. They drilled a hole in it and poured in plaster of Paris. On breaking the block they got a perfect cast of Geronimo, as he was on the day that he was buried alive in concrete. You see his hands tied behind his back, his short Arab drawers. his head dress; + the very expression of his face.\" Reverse side: \"Presented by Col.
