The project was conceived by Noonan while studying for his Masters in  Architecture at the Bartlett School of Architecture in 2010. \n\nThe concept behind these designs is that the reforestation of the Thames Estuary takes place in a future where timber is to become London's main building resource and the river Thames once again becomes a working river, transporting timber throughout the city. Noonan also  proposes the John Evelyn Institute of Arboreal Science as a centre for the  development and promotion of  the use of timber in the construction of London's future architecture. It is named after John Evelyn (1620- 1706) who wrote treatises confronting Britain's lack of natural resources.",
