            "public_access_description": "This marble group representing the Rape of the Sabines, is a modern copy of Giambologna's original (including the bronze relief on the pedestal), executed in 1583 for the Loggia dei Lanzi at Florence.\n\nThe Rape of the Sabines is a legend in the early history of Rome. According to that Romulus, the founder of the city, used a trick to secure the future population of Rome. He organised a festival where the neighbouring inhabitants were invited, including the Sabines along with their wives and children. At a certain signal Rome's young men went into the crowd and carried away the unmarried wives. Plutarch has described to this legend the origin of the custom of lifting up a bride and carrying her over the doorstep of her husband's house.\n\nGiambolgna's (1579\u20131583) 'Rape of the Sabines' is considered his masterpiece, and was interpreted to be related to the legend. His sculpture depicts three figures - a man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches - and was carved from a single block of marble.\n\nBorn in Flanders Giovanni Bologna (1524-1608), or short Giambologna went to Rome to study antique sculpture from about 1550 to 1553. He then travelled through Florence where he was persuaded to stay. He became sculptor to the Medici family and thus became one of the most influential sculptors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He drew attention to many artists  from Northern Europe and disseminated his style mainly through small bronzes. He established an efficient and large workshop.",
