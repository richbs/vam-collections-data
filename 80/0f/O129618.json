He also worked with James Pryde under the pseudonym \"The Beggarstaff Brothers\" to produce some of the finest posters  of the late 19th and early 20th century. \n\nThe children's story,' The Velveteen Rabbit' by Margery Williams, first published in 1922, is a story about 'becoming real' through the power of love. It has become a classic of childrens literature. A measure of its popularity can be taken from  references, for example, in the popular 1990s TV series 'Friends', and its appropriation as a teaching tool in business management and by life-style gurus. In the following quotation from the story, the Velveteen Rabbit, who joins the toys belonging to a small boy as a Christmas present, is being advised by one of the oldest toys in the toy cupboard about 'becoming real': \n'....\"It doesn't happen all at once,\" said the Skin Horse. \"You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in your joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand\"...'",
