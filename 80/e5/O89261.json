The medal shows the DNA double helix against a background of concentric lines reminiscent of a fingerprint, another method of establishing identity. It was the winning design in the Royal Mint competition of 2002 for the Royal College of Art. Musson used computer software to create the design. A Cad Cam milling machine was used to cut the model, but traditional methods were used to cast the silver medal. With this acquisition, the Museum is able to represent the whole design process from original idea to finished medal.",
