In Malta, 1815, he met an agent of Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt who suggested that he could use his knowledge of hydraulics there. Subsequently worked for Henry Salt in Egypt as engineer and excavator. His achievements included clearing the Temple of Ramesses II (Abu Simbel), discovering six tombs in the Valley of the Kings, and opening the Pyramid of Chephren (Giza). He left Egypt in 1819; held an exhibition at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, 1821-22, and published various accounts of his discoveries. He died during an expedition to find the source of the river Niger the following year.",
