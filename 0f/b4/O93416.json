If it is Lady Hawarden, as seems likely, this is her only self-portrait. She is holding a photograph of bare trees, like the ones she made on the family estate at Dundrum in County Tipperary, Ireland. The print is on thin paper, as can be seen from the way she holds it. It had not been trimmed - the white margins are from the printing frame in which it would have been printed out by sunlight. The Hawarden family album indicates that the man is Donald Cameron of Lochiel, whose connection with them is not otherwise known. Lady Hawarden must often have shown newly printed photographs to members of her family, friends and acquaintances.",
