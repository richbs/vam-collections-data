Presentation swords are often elaborately decorated with precious metals and engraved with an inscription that commemorates the battle at which the soldier  demonstrated his bravery and courage. This is an English military presentation sword which was commissioned especially to commemorate the courage and bravery of Major Thomas Charlton Smith who maintained his post at Port Natal (later Durban) against an overwhelming force from the 24th May to 26th June 1842\". It is engraved with a figure of Victory, the British Lion, the Royal monogram and on the hilt with a representation of Saint George and the dragon on one side and a lion fighting a leopard on the other.",
