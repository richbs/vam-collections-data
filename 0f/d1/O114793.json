Gustavus III died in 1792 of an infected wound following an assassination attempt at a masked ball.\n\nThe box was a gift made in return for Miller's double-hulled ship with a paddle wheel, which is depicted on the base.  Miller gave the ship, the paddle turned by manpower, to Gustavus III and it became known in Sweden as 'the British sea monster'.  \n\nMiller moved on from his man-powered vessels to experiment with the application of steam power to boats.  He is also remembered as a patron of the poet Robert Burns.",
