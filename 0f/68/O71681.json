In the catalogue for his exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1987 he stated: \u2018the less precious a material, the more difficult it is to work, to make it speak, to find its soul.\u2019 He uses both traditional metals and materials, but equally explores a number of unconventional materials transformed through labour-intensive processes.\n\nThis brooch belongs to a series he made based on a traditional Japanese technique of inlaying eggshell into wet lacquer. The surface has a graphic yet ethereal quality. \n\nGentille studied painting and sculpture before becoming a goldsmith. In spite of his training he considers himself as self-taught and proud of his interdisciplinary approach. For him the concept of a piece is as important as skilled craftsmanship.",
