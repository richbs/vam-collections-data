Even when girls' schools began to be founded some experts advised that domestic skills were preferable for adolescent girls (enabling them to care for their homes and families) but that academic work would be harmful to them.  \n\nThe broader-based curriculum in use for much of the twentieth century was only introduced gradually, although what was perhaps rather adventurous was the introduction of swimming lessons in school time by the London School Board toward the end of the 19th century.",
