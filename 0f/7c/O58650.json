The English version originally had six finger-holes but no thumb-holes, which made it harder to play sharps and flats. William Bainbridge (d. 1831), a wood-turner and professional musician, introduced a thumb-hole and two keys in 1803 and added an extra pipe with more keys and fingerholes in 1806. Bainbridge also fitted his instruments with ivory studs to guide players to the correct holes. In spite of various subsequent modifications, Bainbridge never succeded in making the flageolet as popular with musicians as the flute, and it fell into disuse by the 1850s.",
