(The fawn was probably originally red). Edged with green silk. Worn blue and fawn fringes at the ends. Backed with orange silk.\n[Maniple] Backed with orange silk and yellow linen.\n\nThe arms are:\n\nUp from centre:\n1. Or, on a fess gules three water bougets argent. JOHN ROOS DE BINGHAM.\n2.

Checky or and gules, a chief vair. FLEMING.\n[note - this is the identification given in the catalogue of the exhibition of English Embroidery help at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1905. The same description was also included in the major exhibition of Opus Anglicanum, held  at the V&A in 1963. However, it has been questioned, for example in the publication  English Heraldic Embroidery and Textiles at the Victoria and Albert Museum : A select list with introduction, by Clara Lamb, Robert M Collins and Cedric J Holyoake (1976). This describes the coat of arms in question thus : \"Chequy or and gules, a chief vair. (?) FLEMING. In the Powell Roll (ca.1350), precisely the opposite (Vair, a chief chequy or and gules) occurs for Sir Baldwin Fleming, Baron Slans (Ireland).\" It has more recently been pointed out that the arms \"checky or and gules, a chief vair\" are the coat of the various branches of the Chichester family.\n\n\n\n6.

It is a long narrow band which usually has a device at each end and a cross at the neck, and is worn round the neck under the upper vestment and over a long white robe called an alb. \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the way in which the stole was worn identified different ranks of clergy, from lowliest to most powerful. Deacons wore it over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; priests wore it round the neck with the ends crossed on the breast and held in place by the girdle of the alb, or hanging straight down if it was worn with the ungirdled surplice. Bishops wore the stole hanging straight down the front (because their albs were ungirdled).",

            "historical_context_note": "The stole and maniple are two of the Eucharistic vestments, or special garments worn by the clergy and their assistants during the liturgical ceremony of the Mass. They may be made of the same textiles as the chasuble or dalmatic, or they may be embroidered to complement them, the patterns often being geometric. They are worn under the chasuble or dalmatic (with some exceptions). During the Middle Ages the way in which the stole was worn identified different ranks of clergy: deacons wore it over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; priests wore it round the neck with the ends crossed on the breast and held in place by the girdle of the alb, or hanging straight down if it was worn with the ungirdled surplice; bishops wore the stole hanging straight down the front (because their albs were ungirdled).(Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p. 17-18).\n\n<i>The stole</i> is a long narrow band (about 12 cm wide, and long enough to go round the neck of the wearer and reach his feet). It usually has a device at each end and a cross at the neck. According to Herbert Norris, the stole developed from the Roman sudarium (a linen cloth carried around the neck and used for wiping the face), the word <i>stola</i> being adapted from the ninth century onwards for this item. By the twelfth century it had achieved its current form and often had fringes at the ends, rectangular or triangular pieces of embroidery. During the Middle Ages stoles were worn at almost all liturgical functions, and crosses were nearly always  incorporated into the pattern. (Herbert Norris. <i>Church Vestments. Their Origin and Development</i>. London: J.M.Dent & Sons Ltd, 1949, pp. 88-91.) \n\n<i>The maniple</i> was originally a towel which was carried over the arm (the <i>mappa</i>, a plain linen napkin used by the Greeks and Romans at meals for wiping the mouth and hands). From the earliest times in the Church it was used by the priest to wipe the communion vessels and hands at celebrations and was attached to the left wrist. Its form changed over the centuries, and it lost its functional value. By the tenth century it was embellished with embroidery, and often had a fringe at the edges, and by the twelfth century it had widened at its extremities, forming two slightly pronounced flaps, like the stole ends. It is worn over the left arm. (Norris, pp. 92-94)",
