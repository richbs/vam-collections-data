            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton, probably hand-woven, block printed and glazed on both sides. The two lengths of cotton were printed and then stitched together with a simple over-stitch.  There are numerous blue and red dots, which are registration pin marks, in the upper and lowers bands. There are also many instances of inaccurate registration where colours are printed beyond their outlines. It looks like the mordant was printed, rather than the pigment.\nColours: red, blue, yellow, black.\n\nThere is a central decorative panel.  The field is off-white with a background design of small over-lapping fan-like motifs in red.  In this pattern are bands of almost oval botehs with an off-white ground and blue and red floral patterns.  There are about three different versions repeated regularly; each band of botehs face alternate directions.  There is a rosette with eight tri-lobed segments in yellow around eight blue, heart-shaped segments with a central star. This central star was printed before the boteh pattern which in places has been stamped over it.\nThere is a series of decorative borders around the central panel, the widest has undulating  stripes of yellow, blue and off-white framing small medallions in yellow. There are small floral motifs. There is an outermost series of borders mainly on a cream ground with small floral motifs.  In between these sets of borders, across both top and bottom is a 39 cm wide band with the same fan-like pattern as the central panel, barely containing five large botehs alternating with a narrow feather-like motif rising from a cypress tree growing from a small vase. [see 489/14-1883 for a similar but separated motif]. Everything is decorated with floral elements on a cream ground.  The motifs in these end bands point in towards the centre.  There are two side panels 15 cm wide between the top and bottom bands.  Each has a meander on an off-white ground bearing elaborate flowers and the occasional birds. The pattern goes up one side and down the other.",
