In some versions the female figure holds a silver goblet or sprig of hawthorn; in this case she holds a sprig of hawthorn together with a statuette depicting Anteros, which she presents to the god of marriage, Hymen.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also a medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman and was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used various materials in the same work. Upon his many commissions for monuments and memorials is the celebrated Eros figure as part of the Shaftsbury memorial (1885-1893) on Piccadilly Circus.",
