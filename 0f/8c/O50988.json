            "public_access_description": "Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928), was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and became a leading architect and designer of the Glasgow School.   This cabinet was designed as part of the furnishings for No. 78 Derngate, Northampton.  It was commissioned by Mr W. J. Bassett-Lowke, a scale model manufacturer who was one of the founders of the Design and Industries Association and a pioneering patron of the modern movement. He employed Mackintosh to renovate his house for him and his prospective bride in 1916.  \n\nConstructed in wood painted to resemble ebony, the table is inlaid with a bright yellow plastic called erinoid.  Plastic was still being developed during the early years of the twentieth century and Mackintosh was one of the first designers to use it as inlay in furniture instead of more traditional materials such as ivory or mother-of-pearl used elsewhere by him.",
