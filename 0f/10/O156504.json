            "public_access_description": "This box is a remarkable example of the art of stonecutting, a speciality of Dresden. Johann Georg Klett (1720-93) cut both hardstones and glass on the wheel and is known to have worked as Hofsteinschneider (court stonecutter) for the court of Saxony in 1755. Otherwise, little is known of his career. The bloodstone panels were mounted in gold set with diamonds and rubies by an unknown craftsman. \n\nThe portrait carved on the lid shows Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg (1683-1756). He acted as regent for his brother from 1728 to 1747 and then ruled in his own right until his death. He was a political reformer who gave Mecklenburg-Schwerin its own constitution but also an avid art collector. He commissioned a number of paintings by the French artist Jean-Baptiste Oudry, for which he had a purpose-built gallery constructed. He is shown wearing the Russian Order of St Andrew which he was awarded in 1750.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
