            "public_access_description": "Isaac Oliver learned miniature painting techniques from Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619), probably around 1587, but had undoubtedly already had some training in art on the Continent. This miniature of Sir Arundel Talbot dating from 1596 is inscribed with a note by Oliver explaining that it was painted when he was in Venice. This visit to Italy was unusual for an English artist, but it is notable that Oliver signed the work \"Francese IO\", emphasising his French birth. Oliver's knowledge of Continental art is apparent in a number of his miniatures. \n\nThis work shows what might have been achieved after two of the three customary sittings, working directly onto the vellum. The features have begun to be modelled over the carnation colour, using hatches of red and brown, but more detail is needed. The card support for the miniature has not been trimmed, and details of Talbot\u2019s outfit are incomplete.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cISAAC OLIVER\n\n<b>152 Called Sir Arundell Talbot</b>, 1596\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.4-1917)</i>\nVellum stuck to a playing card with an inverted heart verso, rectangular, (with clipped corners), 69 x 54 mm, 2 23/32 x 2 5/32 in.\n\nThe importance of this miniature lies in the inscription on the reverse presumably by Oliver himself which, in translation reads: \u201cThe 13th day of May 1596 at Venice done by Mr Isaac Oliver French man I.O. May 14th for \u00a38\u201d.  This is undoubtedly contemporary and is vital evidence for establishing Oliver\u2019s visit to Italy during the 1590s.  The miniature itself is unfinished, although bordered by a gold line, it has not been clipped down to size.  It appears to be the fruit of probably two sittings, with only the beginnings of the hatching in of the features; the ear, for example, has been begun and the dress is also incomplete.\n\nThe reverse contains a much later seventeenth century inscription giving the identity of the sitter as a certain Sit Arundell Talbot.  No evidence has yet appeared to support the existence of such a person and the sitter could, equally well, be an Italian.\n\nINSCRIBED: [The following text is a typographical error in the original 'Artists of the Tudor Court' catalogue: 'On either side of the head: <i>Anno Domini 1595 / AEtatis'] \n\n<i><i>[The text should in fact read: On the back of the miniature: In a first hand</i></i>: \u2018adi. 13.
