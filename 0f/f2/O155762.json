Main border: white ground with undulating green stem linking gently curving thin light blue leaves.  Green leaves and red spiky flowers grow from the meander.  The ground of this border has been quilted to form narrow 4-pointed stars which create diamonds with slightly concave sides.  There is an inner border as the outer border. There are minor borders containing a tiny red tulip on a green stem.\nThe large central panel contains a lobed arch delineated by a band of green outlined in dark green; there are inward pointing trefoil flowers along the upper part of the arch.  The arch contains 2 isolated motifs which repeat to give 3 or 4 motifs per band: red cypress tree-like motif and a spray of 3 white and pink carnations.  There is a decorative roundel in the top part of the arch: it contains a red blossom within a green lobed circle.  The ground is quilted around the embroidered motifs in the 4-pointed star pattern of the main border.  The spandrels contain a scrolling arabesque with dark green stems bearing blossoms and leaves, predominantly red, light blue and pink.  The embroidery is worked through a layer of cotton.\nEmbroidery Thread: green, red, white, dark green, pink and light blue silk; S2Z\nBacking: plain weave brown cotton.\nFacing: bias-cut silk and cotton, red and light green stripes.",
