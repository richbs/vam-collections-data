His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRossini\u2019s opera The Barber of Seville (1816) is based on a comedy (1775) by Beaumarchais (1732-1799).   Count Almaviva is in love with Rosina, Dr. Bartolo\u2019s beautiful ward.  With the aid of Figaro, a mischievous and clever barber, he seeks to release Rosina from Dr. Bartolo\u2019s clutches.   Messel designed costumes and sets for a Glyndebourne production in 1954, which despite its popularity, was only revived twice.  \n\nAct I opens onto a square in Seville overlooked by Dr. Bartolo\u2019s house.  Messel\u2019s set model includes a paper figure of Count Almaviva serenading Rosina, who leans over her balcony window to listen.   Derek Granger, in an interview with Messel for the Glyndebourne Festival Programme of 1956,  highlighted the conscious artificiality of Messel\u2019s set, in keeping with the opera\u2019s light spirit and parody of social manners.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed by the Glyndebourne Festival Opera at Glyndebourne on 10 June, 1954; directed by Carl Ebert, featuring Bruscantini as Figaro and Graziella Sciutti as Rosina.  It was revived at the Edinburgh Festival in 1955 and at Glyndebourne in 1961.   Roger Pinkham has said of this production that \u201cMessel chose a palette which echoed the contrasted and thus dramatic coloration of Goya\u2019s paintings.\u201d (Pinkham, ed., 1983).\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His work for Glyndebourne in this period is regarded as some of his best designs.",
