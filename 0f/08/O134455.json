In this image by Lorna Simpson, however, the viewer is denied access to the face of the anonymous model, who turns away from us. It is significant that the model is a black woman for women and black people have often been subject to objectification by the (white, male) photographic lens. \n\nThe \u2018refusal of recognition\u2019 (Stuart Hall, 2001) shown by Simpson\u2019s model contrasts with the text running down the left of the image, which refers to quota systems and US federal policies regarding minorities. The presence of this text highlights continuing forms of depersonalisation and categorisation on the basis of \u2018race\u2019.",
