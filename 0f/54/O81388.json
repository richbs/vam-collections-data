Here is depicted the Dent du Midi, a mountain chain situated in the Swiss Alps. The figures in the foreground and ruined tower are fantasist and have the mere function to enliven the scenery. Bryner produced a few versions of this view with a different foreground in each of them. The warm golden glow enlivened by pink and blue hues is characteristic of Bryner's palette.",

By Bryner. In Frame'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is one of Bryner's several versions of the view of the Dent du Midi, a mountain chain situated in the Chablais Alps in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland. A <i>View of La Dent du Midi</i> is in the Mus\u00e9e Arlaud in Lausanne while another dated 1847 was sold at Phillips London, 12 Mar. 1996, lot 13. \nThey all follow the same compositional formula with the 'Dent' placed on the right background and a large area in the foreground where the artist painted different elements with or without figures. \nBryner was essentially a painter of mountainous landscape in the region of the Alps between France and Switzerland. The British Museum owns five hand-coloured aquatint which provide a good example of his oeuvre.",
