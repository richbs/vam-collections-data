            "public_access_description": "The embroidered bed covers of Satgaon in Bengal were prized in Portugal and in England from the mid-16th century to the mid-17th. They are embroidered with naturally yellow-coloured tussore silk, one of several types of the wild (i.e., uncultivated) silk that was abundant in eastern India. Their designs often make direct reference to a Portuguese patron (for example by incorporating a coat of arms). This one is more generically suitable for the European market, as it illustrates scenes from the Old Testament. The Judgement of Solomon in the centre is accompanied by scenes from the story of Judith and Holofernes in sections of the central panel, as well as by hunting scenes with Portuguese riders and bands of scrolling vegetal decoration.\n\nThe Portuguese set up their trading post in Satgaon in 1536, but were expelled in 1632, and these dates give a broad indication of the period in which these quilts were produced.",

ISBN 1 85177 310X\nCoverlet\nSatgaon - Hooghly region/ c.1600\nWhite cotton, quilted and embroidered in yellow 'tasar' or 'muga' silk, in back stich and chain stich/ 330 x 279cm\nThe embroidery is divided into a series of borders and compartments. In a central shield is the Judgement of Solomon, with four more Old Testament scenes - from the story of Judith and Holofernes - in quarter-circles above and below it. Classical mythology is represented by Jupiter and Juno, Mars and Venus, Saturn, Mercury and Titan, Diana and Actaeon, Hero and Leander, and the Judgement of Paris. Hindu imagery includes 'kinnaras' (horse-headed, bird-bodied celestial musicians), 'kirtimukhas' (grotesque masks representing a Saivite demon) and 'makara' heads (an auspicious marine monster). Portuguese 'conquistadors' are seen mounted and on foot, hunting with spears and cross-bows. Some of the scenes are capable of dual interpretation: for instance the marine borders showing Portuguese sailors in a sea or river filled with fish and marine creatures of more dubious antecedents, are probably an amalgam of Biblical (Noah's Ark/ Jonah and the Whale) and Vaishnavite (Matsya and Manu's Ark) symbolism. These pictorial embroideries, deriving their subject-matter from a mixture of European engravings and local traditions, were made only in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when Portuguese influence was at its height.\nIllustrated in colour.",
