Cassiano\u2019s intention was to form a visual encyclopaedia of the ancient and natural worlds but his project was never published. A group of drawings were however reproduced in a number of books on natural history, and artists and scholars drew on its fund of images of the Classical world. (See other examples in the collection: E.2776-1962, E.426-2009 and E.1026-2011.)\n\nThe present drawing represents a carline thistle, a medicinal plant which grows in central and southern Europe. The name derives from Charlemagne, whose army was reputedly cured of plague by its use. The drawing was executed by an unknown artist, probably a minor artist, as it shows an evident lack of volume. It is a good example of a certain type of drawings included in the Paper Museum, which aim only at recording the shape and appearance of a plant rather than reaching a high degree of refinement.",
