Decorative papier mache was a speciality of Kashmir and was made for both the local and European markets.  Painted and varnished wood was often used in place of true papier mache from the later 19th century onwards, but the finest work was produced by building up layers of moistened paper in a mould to the required shape, which was then smoothed, painted and varnished.\nThe box was given by Queen Victoria in 1852, the year in which the Museum's collections began to be acquired.",
