Fry was a promoter of decorative arts, and wanted to remove the division in perception between the fine and decorative arts. In the workshop, artists produced pieces that were anonymous, signed only with the Greek letter Omega.  \n\nThe wardrobe itself is an ordinary cupboard purchased and decorated by the Omega Workshops. Stylistically, Omega rejected formal decorative schemes in favour of abstracted figurative designs, often inspired by folk art as well as by continental movements such as Fauvism and Cubism. Fry wanted works to be appreciated for their aesthetic quality and not purchased because they were produced by a popular artist.  The workshops were short-lived and a closing sale was held in June 1919.",
