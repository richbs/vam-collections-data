Francis Cotes was a founder member of the Royal Academy, and is today principally known as a portrait artist in oils and crayons.  But he also produced topographical watercolours, of which the one in the V&A is a fine example.  The watercolour is highly finished, with the figures - presumably the owners of the house, proudly gazing at their extensive property - perhaps adding an extra, human, dimension to the meaning of the image.  \n\nThe unusually low horizon with its distant sloping hills is broken by the towering trees in the foreground.  Most of the trees are evidently newly planted, their slender trunks making a pattern of vertical lines on both left and right.  The older tree, with its trifurcated trunk, dominates the composition, and frames the subject of the watercolour, the great house.  The reaction to nature, here in 1756, connects the desire in the eighteenth century to tame the garden landscape by introducing man-made elements such as the urns on plinths, and at the same time enjoy contact with nature, in the company of the family - the husband and wife, their children - and their dogs."

The figures, presumably the owners of the house, gaze at their extensive property. Francis Cotes (1726-1770) is perhaps best known for his portraits in crayon. He was a founder-member of the Royal Academy in London.",
