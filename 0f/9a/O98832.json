In the days before radio and television, comedians were often famous within a fairly restricted area and humour, too, showed many local variations - there were many comedians famous in the north of England who never performed in the south, and vice versa.  \nMost comedians included song and dance in their acts and these shoes, with their elongated feet, were known as 'flaps'.  The technique of dancing in flaps was developed by the great music hall performer, Little Titch, and many other performers tried to develop their own routines wearing flaps of varying lengths.  It would have taken hours of practice to develop the skill to learn to control the exaggerated length until the shoes became an integral part of the foot.",

Although he performed all over the British Isles, occasionally in London, he was best known in East Anglia and the North of England; at this period, before the spread of radio and the invention of television, comedians were often 'local' and humour in the North could be very different from that in the South (for example, Max Miller was never as popular in the North of England, while Jimmy Learmouth was most popular in his native Lancashire).  He played Dame in pantomime and married Gertrude Orchard, who played Principal Boy.  His Dame characters, while obviously exaggerated, inclined towards the 'elegant' or homely rather than the grotesque.  \nThe technique of dancing in flaps, shoes with elongated feet, was developed especially by Little Titch, but taken up by many other comedians.  The Museum has several examples of flaps in its collection, but these are the longest and most exaggerated.",
