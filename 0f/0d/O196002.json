One further drawing from this group of 23 is in a private collection in Paris. The majority of the drawings are rendered in red chalk, with the left half usually obtained by counterproof. Other drawings are in pen and brown ink. The annotations in German indicate the weight of the object after it was made, which betrays a craft knowledge and suggests that the drawings come from the workshop of a silversmith.  The decorative elements are typical of the early 18th century, deriving from the work of Jean B\u00e9rain and German silversmiths.",
