Peter and Paul; and the Stoning of St. Stephen.  Between the quatrefoils, stiff scroll work is reminiscent of the wrought iron hinge straps of medieval doors.  The main ground of the vestment is decorated with vigorously drawn but delicate foliate scroll work enclosing lions and griffins.",

This example has been drastically cut down from its original voluminous shape to suit changing fashions in church ritual. It is made of luxurious materials, with a silk satin ground and rich embroidery, and is known to have belonged to an illustrious family. The embroidery is carried worked in underside couching, split stitch and laid and couched work.\n\nIt was made at some time during the marriage of Margaret de Clare and Edmund Plantaganet, Duke of Cornwall. Before being cut down, it is said to have included the coats of arms of Clare, Cornwall, Lacy and England. These stand for Margaret de Clare who married Edmund Plantaganet in 1272. They were divorced in 1294. \n\nStylistically the embroidered motifs can be seen as a mixture of  Romanesque and Gothic. The scroll work and figures of griffins look back to the earlier style, while the quatrefoils enclosing Christian scenes belong to a decorative scheme with repeating geometric motifs which were standard in English medieval embroidery (known as opus anglicanum, the Latin for English work) from the mid 13th to the early 14th century.",

Here, elegant coiling stems enclose lions and griffins, while a band of quatrefoils contains sacred subjects, drawn in the sharp and angular manner practised by English painters of the period.  By this time, English gold embroidery, most of which was produced in workshops in the city of London, had acquired an extensive international reputation.  In 1263, a certain Gregory of London was working in Rome as gold-embroiderer to the household of Pope Alexander IV.  The great Vatican inventory of 1295 recorded well over a hundred examples of English embroidery, far more than any other type.\"\nThe British Arts Council, <i>Opus Anglicanum</i> (London: The Curwen Press, 1963), p.19.\nDonald King and Santina Levey, <i>The Victoria & Albert Museum's Textile Collection: Embroidery in Britain from 1200 to 1750</i> (London: Victoria & Albert Museum, 1993), p. 34\nJonathan Alexander and Paul Binski, <i>The Age of Chivalry: Art in Plantagenet England 1200-1400</i> (London: Royal Academy of Arts, 1987), pp.44 & 347.\np.44.

It is worked on a light blue satin, with silk warp and cotton weft, which was probably imported from Asia. This, I think, is the earliest use of satin cloth in Europe, nearly a century before the introduction of the word satin. I would like to put forward the suggestion that the cloth of the Clare chasuble may be known in the 13th century, in Arabic as kanzi, which is recorded as a Persian fabric of silk and cotton, and in Latin ascanzeum, which was described as a Tartar cloth...and was available in Europe in various colours including sky blue'\nLisa Monnas, <i>Merchants, Princes and Painters</i>, Yale, 2008, p. 14; note 167, p. 338.\nThe note makes the observation that without reference to Donald King, David Jacoby had concluded that the Iranian fabric <i>kanzi</i> was a satin with silk warps and cotton wefts. He did not know of the chasuble's existence. D. Jacoby, 'Silk economics and cross-cultural artistic interraction: Byzantium and the Muslim world and the Christian West', <i>Dumbarton Oaks Papers </i>, 58 (2004), p. 231.\n\nLisa's own technical analysis shows the ground textile to be 'a five-shaft satin, with paired warps of blue silk, very fine threads without visible twist, 67-70 per cm, and wefts of cotton, also dyedd blue but duller in colour than the warps, thicker threads, S-twisted, variable count, 40-50 per cm.'",

The join down the centre front is covered by a band of sixteenth-century bobbin lace. It is not clear at what time this modification was made, but it is clear that garment was originally a chasuble because of the layout of the surviving orphreys on back and front.\n\nEvidence from written sources suggests that part of the ground fabric which was cut from the sides of the chasuble, appears to have been used to make a stole and maniple which were additionally decorated with four shields of arms.  Although the stole and maniple are now lost, the fact that armorial shields were once part of the chasuble is supported by the remains of a tiny section of one shield (probably that of Lacy) at the upper, right hand edge of the back, and the presence of a strap (from which a shield once hung) draped over a scrolling stem by the neck edge of the left front. These were described in 1786 by the then owner of the chasuble, David Wells, FSA, of Burbach (Burbage), Leicestershire, in a letter to <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>: 'The four coats are embroidered on a piece of very rich silk, in which are interwoven flowers and griffins in gold, at the bottom and corners whereof the shields are finely wrought in needle-work, the gold and silver yet fresh, the other colours much faded, as is the stuff itself'.  The arms were those of Clare, Cornwall, Lacy and England and they enable the chasuble to be dated very precisely.  They stand for Margaret de Clare, who married Edmund Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall, in 1272.  The arms of Lacy relate to her mother and those of England are a reference to her husband's royal descent as nephew of Henry III.  The marriage remained childless and ended in divorce in 1294.\n\nThe early history of the chasuble is not known.  David Wells acquired it from 'a gentleman in Wales' and it subsequently passed through the hands of his nephew, Ambrose Salisbury, John G. Nichols, FSA, and John Bowyer Nichols.  It was bought by the Museum at the latter's sale, 28th June, 1864 (lot 160).\n\nHistorical significance: The Clare chasuble is the earliest recorded example in which the silk embroidery of the faces follows the contours of the features, with the cheeks being worked in indented spirals.  Although here distorted by wear, other examples show the depth of feeling that could be conveyed by this technique. It is also, according to Lisa Monnas, the only known dated example in existence of this type of fabric, which was identified by Donald King as a <i>kanzi</i> (Arabic), woven in Iran.",

            "historical_context_note": "<i>Garment</i>\nThe chasuble is the main ecclesiastical vestment worn by priests for the celebration of Mass. It is usually made of luxurious materials (silk in a variety of weaves) which draped fluidly over the body. Before 1600, it was bell-shaped, similar to a cope, but different in being a completely closed garment (i.e. sewn into a near circle with only a hole for the head left). The cope in contrast was open down centre front and therefore was an obvious semi-circle when laid out flat. The ophrey bands - when it had them - were centre front and back (as opposed to a single band down the opening as in the cope). Both derived from the Roman <i>paenula</i> (cloak). \n\n<i>Decoration</i>\nIn its decoration the chasuble is a transitional piece.  The scroll work looks back to an earlier style, while the quatrefoils enclosing pictorial motifs belong to a decorative scheme based on repeating geometric shapes which was standard in Opus Anglicanum from the mid-thirteenth to the early fourteenth century (see the Syon Cope).\n\nAn apparently similar vestment was recorded at Exeter cathedral in 1506: \u2018A chasuble of blue satin, worked with large knots, griffins and lions in gold, and on the back figures of Christ crucified, the Blessed Virgin and John, and other figures in gold\u2019.  Slightly earlier embroideries with lions and griffins in foliate scrolls have been found in the tombs of Archbishop Pierre de Charny (1268-74) and Gilon II Cornut (1274-92) at Sens Cathedral.",
