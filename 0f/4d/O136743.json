The foreground is grassy with a line of trees in the middle distance following through to a large mountain range and sunny sky in the background. The treatment of paint is quite loose and painterly throughtout and the palette is predominantly yellows and greens with some greys , blues and purples. There are some painted initials in the bottom right corner, but these are blurred and difficult to make out. It does not appear to be by as professional artist. The painting is in a dark wooden frame. It is part of the furnishings for the Devonshire Villas dolls' house, which was made in about 1900-1905. This painting would have been a later addition to the house as acrylic paints were not used until later in the century from around 1950.",
