Sheridan's version of Kotzebue's play about the Spanish conqueror of Peru first appeared on the London stage in 1799.  \nThe claim in the publication line, that Random and Stainbank were patentees of what amounts to the technique of transparent prints, needs to be treated with some skepticism. \nThe method of producing transparent prints as described in Edward Orme <i>An Essay on Transparent Prints and Transparencies in General</i>, London 1807, would hardly seem to warrant a patent and a number of publishers were producing them in the years immediately prior to 1800.  Orme's instructions which on the whole correspond to the treatment this print has received, consist of colouring the front of the print in stronger colouring than ordinary print colouring at this period, then on the reverse tracing the outlines of the design and colouring the most important areas, and finally varnishing the principle highlights front and back.  \nTransparent prints were intended as a cheap substitute for stained glass and as an activity was a variation on other polite amusements such as drawing or the ordinary colouring of prints.  They were intended to be seen with a light source behind the, as light from there would carry any other colour through from the back and intensify it.  They were pinned across windows, incorporated into candle shades or set on a chimney board where a transparency of a fire blazing in a grate placed in front of a lamp, was thought to give the cheering effect of a coal fire without the trouble, expense or mess of actually laying one.\nBecause they relied heavily on the contrast between dark and light, transparencies were best suited to dramatic subjects featuring bright light sources, e.g. lighthouses, cave scenes, moonlit ruins etc.  Orme also gives a list of transparencies he himself has published.  The cheapest is 3s 6d and the most expensive <i>Large Mount Vesuvius and Companio</i>n, 3 3s.\"\n",
