While the cat on the left is playing with the Virgin's hem, a snake can be seen slithering out from under her skirt. The Virgin is treading on the snake, symbolising her role as the new Eve, who will triumph over Original Sin. Joseph looks in from outside the window, symbolising his closeness to, but also his separation from, the Virgin and Child. The pattern of the window's glazing creates the impression of a halo around the Virgin's head.\n\nThis print is thought to be part of a set of prints of the early life of the Christ and was the first time he produced a print series, despite the popularity of such series with other artists succh as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Lucas van Leyden and Lucas Cranach..",
