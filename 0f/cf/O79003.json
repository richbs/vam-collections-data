The shaped legs and back show the influence of French 18th-century styles, which were very popular in the 1850s.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe construction of the seat upholstery is unusual. Although it looks as though there are layers of stuffing materials tacked to the frame of the chair under the modern cover, the original upholstered seat was in fact made separately and dropped inside the frame. The top cover was then tacked lightly onto the frame. This method prevented the vulnerable surface of the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 being damaged by the upholsterer hammering in tacks to hold the various layers of stuffing materials.\n\nPlaces\nWarwick Castle, built in 1068, was one of the most popular Victorian tourist attractions. The romantic setting of the castle, on the River Avon, and its association with William Shakespeare attracted not only British visitors but also Americans. Enterprising local publishers produced souvenirs of the castle, including guidebooks, prints, photographs and album views. Manufacturers used illustrations of this and other historic buildings to decorate papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 products, such as the back of this chair.",
