The front shows two boys wearing shorts and pullovers and having a picnic beneath a tree, with the words\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY \nThe enlarged figure seven in gold foil embossed with a swallow is visible to the right, inside the card, as is a girl in a white blouse and red skirt who is joining in the picnic.  Inside is a pop-out group of boys and girls in a vintage car driven by a man in a cowboy outfit, a dog chasing behind; the verse reads:\nThe car is speeding merrily\nAnd Doggie's rushing too\nAll bringing BIRTHDAY GREETINGS\nAnd lots of fun for you.",
