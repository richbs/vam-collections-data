Outer circle diameter of 23mm and inner circles diameter of 12mm. Circles contain smalled raised dots and a line of small raised dots runs around the insole perimeter. Circles appear to be incised while dots may be embossed. Deep crack at waist and seat blackened. Straps: Two loops (leather of nails?) on either side of seat. The foot strap would have attached here. Simple straps from forepart (between toes) to either side of seat. 7mm wide and 1mm thick. Stained black at forepart where it threads under insole and pokes out 20mm further towards the tip.
