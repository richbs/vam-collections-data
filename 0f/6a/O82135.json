Full citation:\n\n\u201c<b>A man, called Richard Maitland, 4th Earl of Lauderdale</b>\u201d\n (b.1653 d.1695) \n<b>1688</b>\nP93-1937 \n\n<b>Oval 74 x 62mm \n</b>\nFeatures worked in delicate blended brown and sanguine, with blue and black for the eyes; hair in brown wash, lined with darker colour and with the lights in pale gouache; all on a warm carnation ground; cravat in white over pale brown wash, coat in red, shadowed in darker colour and with the lights in white; robe in blue wash, shadowed in darker colour and with the lights in grey; background a pale brown wash, hatched and worked in darker brown and grey; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Flesh slightly faded; otherwise sound. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Lower right, in pale grey: <i>CB. 1688</i> (see C in Appendix 2). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth- or early twentieth-century silver locket, the convex back soldered to sides with a deep outer channel, stepping inward with a narrow channel to the bezel, which holds the shallowly convex glass by its rounded and polished edges; the hanger of square section wire with a central groove, bifurcating at the back into twin diminishing spirals of seven-and-a-halfturns. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> According to Walsh and Jeffree, in the collection of the Earls of Lincoln, and from 1768, the Dukes of Newcastle-under-Lyme at Clumber in Hampshire. A label formerly stuck to the backing board bore the Newcastle cypher and a stamped number 2372; sold at Christie's 8 June 1937, lot 4; bt James Lifetree, from whom purchased by the Museum with funds from the R H Stephenson Bequest, November 1937. \n\n<b>Exhibited</b> Geffrye Museum 1975-6, no. 54. \n\n<b>Literature</b> <i>V&A Review of Principal Acquisitions 1937</i>, p. 34, repro. pl. 15c; Reynolds 1952, pp. 83-4; Foskett 1972 vol. I, p. 157; Foskett 1979, p. 115; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 , p.3; Reynolds 1988, p. 73. \n\nThe identification of the sitters of this and the accompanying portrait (Cat. No. 151 [P.94-1937]) seems to rest on the label, now lost through reframing, recorded as formerly attached to 'the back' of this miniature. It read 'Richard, 4th Earl of Lauderdale'. According to the note in the Museum files, it was 'a modern inscription in an assumed style, written in brownish ink by the dealer Lifetree', but it may nonetheless have derived from an older and more genuine inscription and should not be rejected out of hand. \n\nThe sitters are the same as those in a small double portrait in oils discovered by Richard Jeffree at Messrs Howard and Co., in 1972, and which he identified as the Lauderdales by analogy with the miniatures. The small double portrait, he felt, was also probably a copy, presumably from two separate portraits painted at the time of the sitters' marriage in 1678, which might have been by either Mary Beale herself or some other artist. Jeffree was not aware that the identifying label on this miniature was believed to be by Lifetree.\n\nRichard Maitland was born on 20 June 1653. He was the nephew of the 2nd Earl and 1st Duke of Lauderdale (1616-1682), who had married in March 1671/2, as her second husband, Elizabeth Murray <i>suo jure</i> Countess of Dysart, leaving no male heirs. Styled Viscount Maitland until he succeeded his father in 1691, he was, unlike most of his relations, a Catholic, and he prospered as Lord Justice General for Scotland (1681-4), General of the Mint (1685-9) and Commissioner of the Treasury (1687-9), until, after the Revolution, he joined James II at St Germain, where he died in some poverty in 1695.\" \n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1937</u>, London: Board of Education, 1938.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'BEALE, Charles (1660-after 1693).</B>\n\nMiniature portrait of a Man, said to be Richard, 4th Earl of Lauderdale (1653-1695).\n<i>Signed</i> CB <i>(monogr.) and dated</i> 1688.\n<i>On card.
