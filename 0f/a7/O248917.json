Streamers with small floral designs hang between these and the skirt, and similarly beaded streamers hang under each armhole. These armhole streamers attach to the georgette slip with press studs, which is attached inside the dress at the top but is otherwise separate, and is also lined in matching chiffon. Slip of turquoise cr\u00eape has been stitched into place at the top. It has shoulder straps, a loose straight top and gathered skirt.",

She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nAt the time of acquisition Emilie Grigsby's friend, Miss Chisholm, stated that this dress and a few others were by Callot Soeurs, but this requires further research to confirm.",
