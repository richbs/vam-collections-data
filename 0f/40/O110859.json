            "public_access_description": "Clays come from decomposed rocks ground down by weathering. Skill is needed in preparing wet clay to give it strength and ease of modelling, also to remove excess water and air before it is fired in a kiln. Firing fuses the clay particles and causes other structural changes that affect the colour and lead to shrinkage of about 10%. Comparatively few works in unfired clay survive because they are fragile and easily damaged. This figure is unfired and you can see the natural colour of the clay. \nThis is a sketch model for a large-scale marble monument in St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Calcutta, made by Sir Francis Legatt Chantrey in ca. 1827. It is a good example of Chantrey\u2019s broad handling of clay, and probably his preliminary design for the figure. Reginald Heber (1783\u20131826) was the author of many famous Victorian hymns.\n\nSir Francis Legatt Chantrey (1781-1842) was an English sculptor, painter, and patron. He was probably the most successful portrait sculptor of his day. Together with Flaxman Chantrey can be ranked as England's greatest sculptor engaging in portrait busts and statues. He was particularly skilled in carving drapery. On his death he left a fortune of \u00a3150,000 which was later bequeathed to the Royal Academy to be used for the 'Encouragement of British Fine Art in Painting and Sculpture'.",
