The stand supports a cloth-wrapped manuscript (\u2018pustaka\u2019) that symbolises the Buddha\u2019s teachings. \n\nTo the right of the manuscript is a large bulbous jar with lotus flowers, intended to evoke the purity of the Buddha. A burning incense brazier has been placed before it. Taken together this ensemble of auspicious emblems and Buddhist deities represent the seven jewels (\u2018sapta-ratnas\u2019) of Buddhism. \n\nThe two kneeling figures are the donors. The man is gesturing in veneration (\u2018anjali\u2019), and his wife is holding an offering in her lap. The entire scene is presided over by an assembly of 26 meditating Buddhas.\n\nAlthough this is a small-scale work, the quality of the carving is remarkably high. The sculptor has given life and character to each of the figures by varying their postures and gestures and so created an animated and engaging scene.",
