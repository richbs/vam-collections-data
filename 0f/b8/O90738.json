            "public_access_description": "Although this fabric might have been used as furnishing fabric for a nursery, it is more likely to have been a summer-weight dress fabric used for frocks, beach wear and children's wear. 'Novelty fabrics', with what were thought to be light-hearted subjects, were an important group of British textiles at that time.  Few examples survive.  It is possible that the Joe Louis v Max Schmeling fight for the world heavyweight title in 1936 inspired this design. \n\nThere are several textiles in the Museum's collection that depict black people; the figures are always depicted with dignity.  In contrast, this 'novelty' fabric presents us with two cartoon characters who appear to be children, one black and one white and it implies white supremacy and black inferiority. The  importance of this textile will increase as scholars continue to assess western attitudes to non-western cultures, not least because it was a cheap and cheerful fabric, produced in quantity for ordinary people. It reflects ignorance and insensitivity and the degree of racial prejudice that was prevalent in the 1930s. The fact that racial differences were treated as a light-hearted subject makes it an important social document.",

Louis was undefeated and it was a great shock when Schmeling knocked him out in the 12th round.  \nThere was a rematch in June 1938 which Louis won.\nTo a certain extent, each boxer was manipulated by his own government.  Certainly by 1938 Schmeling was seen to represent Nazi Germany [although he had little sympathy for the Nazi regime] and Louis was put forward as the symbol of American democracy [despite currents of racial prejudice].\nThe two boxers eventually became friends and Schmeling was a pallbearer at Louis' funeral in 1981.",
