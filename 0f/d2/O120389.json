The type is sometimes described as fruttiere or 'da frutti' [for fruit] in contemporary sources. Some 'trompe-l'oeil' [trick the eye] versions are known, where the fruit and vegetables are made of tin-glazed earthenware and form an integral part of the dish. Moulded as lifelike as possible these were intended to trick the eye of the beholder into thinking the dish contained real edible treats. \nThe distinctive decoration of this dish, composed of small loosely connected motifs including human figures, animals and fantasy figures is called 'Grotesque'. It was first introduced by the painter Raphael in his decoration of the Vatican Palace in Rome (1518-19). It was derived from ancient Roman decorations from the Golden House of the emperor Nero (ruled 54-68 AD) on the Esquiline hill in Rome, which came to light during this period.\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, the potters of Urbino specialised in a refined style of decoration incorporating elaborate grotesques on a white ground.\nThe central male figure is probably derived from a print illustrating Orpheus or Apollo holding a lyre, but in this version his instrument is replaced by a jug.",

The type is sometimes described as fruttiere or 'da frutti' [for fruit] in contemporary sources. Some 'trompe-l'oeil' [trick the eye] versions are known, where the fruit and vegetables are made of tin-glazed earthenware and form an integral part of the dish. Moulded as lifelike as possible these were intended to trick the eye of the beholder into thinking the dish contained real edible treats. \nThe typical decoration of this dish, composed of small loosely connected motifs including human figures, animals and fantasy figures is called 'Grotesque'. It was first introduced by the painter Raphael in his decoration of the Vatican Palace in Rome (1518-19). It was derived from ancient Roman decorations from the Golden House of the emperor Nero (ruled 54-68 AD) on the Esquiline hill in Rome, which came to light during this period.\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, the potters of Urbino specialised in a refined style of decoration incorporating elaborate grotesques on a white ground. Their main pictorial source of inspiration were the etchings by Jacques Androuet I Ducerceau, which were published in 1550, and again in 1562 under the name 'Petites Grotesques'.",
