By the 1760s undecorated terracotta had become fashionable, especially in France. It was used to produce a variety of sculptural work, including decorative domestic pieces. There is no evidence that this decorative group was ever given a surface treatment to disguise the terracotta. This clock may have been owned by a member of a European royal house. The almost naked female figure representing Fame holds a laurel wreath and a Central European (perhaps Polish) crown and sceptre. The putto on the other side supports a helmet, while at his feet are the club and lionskin of Hercules.",
