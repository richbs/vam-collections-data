The defining experience for Dix was the First World War, which he experienced at first hand as a soldier in the trenches.  He was moved to anger and revulsion by the pointless suffering of ordinary soldiers and the moral vacancy of the generals and governments.  He subsequently addressed - in print and in paint - the corruption of modern society, its facades and pretences.  With Grosz, Dix became a leading exponent of the 'Neue Sachlichkeit' (New Objectivity) movement.  They turned an unflinching gaze on the world around them, refusing to flatter or finesse their sitters and subjects. \nThis etching is from the period when Dix was living in D\u00fcsseldorf, studying intaglio techniques with the master printer William Eberholz, as he prepared to produce his graphic series <i>Der Krieg</i> (War), published in 1924.  In 1922 and 1923 he made several etchings of less overtly political subjects, including a portfolio, <i>Circus</i>.  This was a series of portraits of circus performers - acrobats, bareback riders and trapeze artists as well as the lion-tamer.  Dix was drawn to the circus and the fairground because the people who worked there lived on the fringes of society, and were thus free from many of the moral constraints that governed the everyday life of the majority.  The lives of these artistes and performers were inherently dangerous; he hinted at this with the small details such as the skull-and-crossbones tattoos on the shoulders of the high-wire walkers, the 'death despisers' as he called them.  The lion-tamer is a voluptuous monster, her features metamorphosing into those of a lion, indicating that she shares the animal nature of her charges.  Rather than taming these dangerous wild animals, she is in fact becoming a feral creature herself, sensual, predatory, amoral.  In the circus prints Dix seems to suggest that danger liberates men and women from established social structures and conventional moral codes.  He saw these performers, risking their lives daily, as a model for the way everyone should live.  In this he was drawing on the ideas of Nietzsche, who had used the allegory of the circus and fairground in his philosophical writings.\"",
