In Leslie Durbin's interpretation of the design brief he has created a server that almost dissolves into the watery habitat which inspired it.  The irregular and sinuous line of the asymmetrical blade, with its fretted ripples and the shimmering shoal of cast fish that form the handle are united by the serpentine lines that visually hold handle and blade together.  The piercing of the blade and the linked fish, with space between, combine to make the server an airy object.  But it is also very functional, easy to grasp and effective in use.",
