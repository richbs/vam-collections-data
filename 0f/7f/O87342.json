He became well-known in the profession and his ability as a caricaturist became common knowledge.  The volume that includes this drawing contains sketches mostly of musical directors and conductors working at the Oxford New Theatre with Gilbert Sommerlad.\n\nThis touring production of <i>No No Nanette</i> opened at the New Theatre for a week on 29th August 1906, starring Tommy Fields and Billy Milton.",
