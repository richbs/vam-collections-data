This fabric might have been used for curtains or upholstery. In this period it was particularly fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other.\n\nPlace\nMost of the leading printworks in the London area had closed down by the beginning of the 19th century, and the centre of the textiles printing industry had shifted to Lancashire and to Carlisle in Cumbria. This example is extremely close to original designs printed at the Bannister Hall works for Bateman & Todd, a leading firm of Manchester merchants, and it may have been commissioned by them from another printer.",
