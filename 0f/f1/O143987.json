We know from contemporary illustrations that jars of this size and shape were used by pharmacists to store drugs on shelves in their premises.\n\nThe heavily carved decoration on this drug pot was executed using tools with straight and curved edges, revealing a great deal of the red clay body underneath. The decoration has been enhanced with painted oxides in blue, green and amber.\n\nPotters in northern Italy combined fine incising with heavy carving to produce a distinctive foreground and background. In this they were inspired by Middle Eastern designs. Sgraffito is an Italian word meaning 'scratched'. It refers to the technique of scratching through an upper layer of one material to reveal a ground of different colour beneath.",
