Stealth fighter jets and destroyer ships have a multi-faceted covering that is invisible to radar. As such they can appear hidden, allowing them to approach or attack the enemy unseen.\n\nThis die-cast SB-36 Lockheed F-117A Stealth jet was produced in the late 1980s by Matchbox, allowing children to play with their very own secret weapon.",
