            "public_access_description": "The first free elections in Hungary after the collapse of communism took place in 1990. The election of members of parliament in the summer was followed by local authority elections in the autumn. This poster was issued by the Alliance of Young Democrats during the local authority elections.  \n\nThe typographical design by Gy\u00f6rgy Kem\u00e9ny is based on a linguistic and cultural pun. The first two syllables of the Hungarian word \u2018helyhat\u00f3s\u00e1g\u2019 (\u2018local authority\u2019) sound like the interjection \u2018hejha\u2019 (\u2018oh\u2019, \u2018it would be\u2019).  It relates to another poster designed by Kem\u00e9ny which comprised a number of sentences encouraging the public to participate in the elections, each beginning with \u2018Hejha\u2019. Although the interjection \u2018Hejha\u2019 has no direct meaning on its own, it recalls a line from the  19th century epic poem  Mikl\u00f3s Toldi by J\u00e1nos Arany expressing the longing of the hero Toldi to be among the warriors of the Black Army of King Matthias (\u2018Hej! ha \u00e9n is \u00e9n is k\u00f6ztetek mehetn\u00e9k,/ Sz\u00e9p magyar vit\u00e9zek, aranyos levent\u00e9k!\u2019).   \n\nThe colour orange and the form of an orange fruit were fundamental elements of the party\u2019s graphic identity.  Orange recalls the expression \u2018Hungarian orange\u2019 from Peter Bacso\u2019s film \u2018A tan\u00fa\u2019 (The Witness, 1969) that criticised the anomalies of the communist regime in the nineteen fifties.  One of the lines from this extremely popular tragi-comedy rapidly became a catchphrase in Hungary: \u2019it is little bit yellow and a little bit sour, but it\u2019s ours\u2019. In this phrase, people saw the essence of life under communism aptly formulated. Magyar Narancs (Hungarian Orange) was the title of a newspaper, founded 1989 by young publishers, several of whom became active members of the Alliance of Young Democrats.  Another point of reference was the Polish opposition movement \u2018Orange Alternative\u2019.",
