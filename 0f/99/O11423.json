At first teapots were modelled on Chinese ceramic wine pots, but by the early 18th century globular or pear-shaped vessels became more common. English teapots were generally made of silver, reflecting the status of the new beverage. Due to the cost of tea and its limited availability, early teapots were generally small.\n\nTime\nThe practice of drinking tea was brought to Britain from China at the beginning of the 17th century, and was made especially fashionable by the court of Catherine of Braganza, the wife of Charles II.  First used for medicinal purposes, tea-drinking quickly became fashionable among the wealthy and sophisticated by the mid-century.",
