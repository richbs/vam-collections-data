The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nDesigned by Matthies Holger the poster (and others issued by the Green Party) constitute the first attempt to carry the message of environmentalism into official GDR politics, although the appeals are quite general. The Green Party in East Germany had access to the resources of a wide network of European green parties and organisations. This resulted in one of the most technically polished of the posters produced for this election. \n\nThe text on the poster states: 'Umweltschutz - wir k\u00e4mpfen um jeden Millimeter', referring to 'protecting the environment - we fight for every millimeter'.\n\nThe Green Party was founded in November 1989 from GDR green movement. Politically the party was close to the alliances of the citizen's movement. In 1993 the Green Party merged with B\u00fcndnis 90 to form B\u00fcndnis 90 /Die Gr\u00fcnen ('Alliance 90/The Greens'). At the Volkskammerwahl (Public Chamber election) the Green Party ran for office in an alliance with the Independent Women's Union.",
