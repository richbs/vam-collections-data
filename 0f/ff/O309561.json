Other comparable works by sculptors such as  Johann Paul Egell (1691-1752) and Johann Joachim Dietrich (1690-1753) indicate the approximate date and place of origin, as well as the likely function of the present piece.\nThe piece was almost certainly a sketch model for a saint for one side of an altarpiece.
