Of joined and pegged construction.\n\nThe four panels of the front are decorated with similar designs, each consisting of a cinquefoil (five petalled) rosette in the middle within a framework of scrolling bands, with which are interlaced scrolling leafy bands.  The end stiles, which are prolonged to form plain rectangular feet, have on their front face a sunk compartment carved with wavy leafy stems above the level of the bottom rail. The three muntins are each decorated with rosettes within scrolling and interlacing bands forming alternately square and round compartments.  The top rail is ornamented with a row of 8 semicircular lunettes with floral scrolls. The carved design took account of the lock (now missing) and is interrupted at this point. The four front panels, and stiles and rails all have a plain integral border (without any chamfering). On the sides the top and bottom rails and central muntin have moulded edges. The bottom front rail is plain and appears to have lost brackets where it meets the front legs. The cleated lid (modern) consists of two full-length, butted boards with moulded front and sides.\n\nModifications\nThe lid with cleats replaced, hung on new hinges.\nThe bottom replaced.\nMissing brackets between the front feet and the front bottom rail.\nThe front top rail missing a lock plate, with a hole.\nLeft side with conspicuous worm damage.\n\n(Description made November 2011, the interior inaccessible)",

However, other closely comparable Cornish chests have not been found, and the quality of the carving is more accomplished than that found on fixed woodwork Cornwall. For these reasons a south-west origin in one of the larger ports such as Plymouth or Exeter, both in Devon, could also be possible.",

Nor does any other Cornish chest quite match this in exuberance although the chest dated 1662 (on a new top) noted by Pevsner at St Austell runs if fairly close, as does a chest at Trerice which has asymmetrical ornament on the muntins - a Cornish feature paralleled, for instance, on alternate tapering panels on the font cover at Lanreath.'",
