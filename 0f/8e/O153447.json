Throughout the play we see into Billy\u2019s mind through his fantasies, helping us to understand why Billy makes the decisions he does and his constant lies to everyone he comes across. The Cambridge Theatre production starred Albert Finney, who went on to great success in film and on stage, and the play has been performed all over the world.\n\nThe poster was illustrated by Denis Wrigley, whose simplistic painted design style has also been used in many illustrated informational children's books.",
