It features two fish and a Persian quatrain (a four-line verse). \n\nThe body of the dish is fritware, also known as stone paste or quartz paste. Middle Eastern potters developed the material as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain. The main ingredient was fine quartz powder made by grinding sand or pebbles. Small quantities of white clay and a glassy substance known as frit were added. The clay gave plasticity. The frit helped to bind the body after firing.\n\nThis piece was made in the 16th century, when ceramic production in Iran was on a modest scale. When the capital moved to Isfahan around 1600, the production of luxury dishes and wall tiles in a wide variety of styles and techniques rapidly increased.",
