The obverse (front) shows the King wearing a cuirass and the Order of the Garter. Its Latin inscription translates as: 'Charles I by the Grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland'. The reverse shows a ship in full sail.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe medal was issued at a time of political crisis in the English Channel, to assert Charles's sovereign authority over this strategically important zone. A disabled Spanish fleet transporting troops to the southern Netherlands took shelter in English waters from a Dutch fleet. Charles ordered his ships to protect the Spanish fleet, while attempting to extort political concessions from Spain through opportunistic negotiations. \n\nPeople\nNicolas Briot was appointed Engraver-General of French coinage in 1606. Mismanagement and incompetence forced him to flee to England in 1625. He became engraver to the Royal Mint and in 1635 was made Master of the Scottish Mint. A staunch Royalist, he was imprisoned in the Tower during the Civil War.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis medal was cast in silver after a wax model. A cast (probably in plaster) would have been taken from the original wax model, and this in turn would be used to make a mould that could then be used for further reproductions. Molten silver would be poured into the mould.",
