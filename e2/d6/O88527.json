He is known for his vivid watercolour illustrations, inspired by Indian and Persian miniature paintings. This illustration was for one of his very successful Christmas books, published in London by Hodder & Stoughton from 1907 until 1939. Favourite themes of these books were traditional fairy tales or Eastern stories such as this one, a scene from Sinbad the Sailor and other Stories from the Arabian Nights (1914). The drama in this picture also reflects Dulac's interest in designing stage sets for the theatre.  \n\nDulac's debut as a book illustrator came at a time when a new method of printing in colour was introduced into the book industry. Four-colour process blocks allowed colour to be printed more accurately from the originals than before, which showed Dulac's work to advantage.",
