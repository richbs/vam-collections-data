It had formerly been with the 'organ builders Nicolson' (<i>sic</i>, but he may have meant Nicholson & Co.) who thought it may have originally come from the Hereford Cathedral organ. Prof. King's successor at Letheringsett, Richard Bower, was also given similar organ pipes, and he thought that this example may have come from the organ at Norwich Cathedral.\n\nHistorical significance: This pipe is a rare survival from the early 17th century, as many church organs were destroyed during the Commonwealth (1649-1660). Only three organs with embossed pipes are known to survive from before the Commonwealth: those at Tewkesbury Abbey, Stanford-on-Avon and Nettlecombe Court.",

In 1996 Dominic Gwynn, organ builder, noted the similarity between this pipe and those at Tewkesbury Abbey, made by Thomas Dallam. Tony North (former curator, Metalwork Department) saw this in 2009 and thought the metalwork decoration early 17th century, which would make Thomas Dallam the more likely of the two.",
