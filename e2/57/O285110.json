It belongs to an archive of similar designs commissioned by a silk manufacturing partnership active in Lyon \u2014 the most prestigious centre of the silk industry in Europe from the 1660s onwards \u2014 and corresponds in style to the 1760s when patterns were curvaceous. The partnership was called L. Galy, Gallien et cie from 1761 until the beginning of 1771 and it was one of Lyon\u2019s 400 manufacturing concerns mid century. It kept good records, noting on the back of the designs the number of the design and minimal instructions on how it should be woven.\n\nThis design was for a patterned silk with a plain background, approximately 54 centimetres wide. It would have had this motif repeated across the width at least twice. In Lyon, manufacturing regulations dictated the widths in which such silks might be woven.",
