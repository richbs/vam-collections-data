This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread.  According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass. The bowls of silver chalices are usually gilded inside, to emphasize the precious nature of their contents and to protect the metal.\n\nFrom the mid 16th century, secular motifs and ornament were increasingly used by Spanish goldsmiths to decorate church silver. This chalice is a prime example of this development. It is shaped like a candlestick and bears decoration inspired by the architecural forms and ornament of classical Rome: swags of fruit and drapery, acanthus foliage and the three medallions depicting bearded heads. The strapwork ornament resembling cut strips of leather was also highly fashionable in Spain at the time this chalice was made. The only truly religious symbol remaining is the cross in a medallion on the foot. \n\nThe goldsmith, Fernando Ruiz de Santo Domingo, worked in the city of Cuenca between 1556 and 1599. Many of his works still survive. His style is very much in the tradition of Francisco Becceril, a sculptor-goldsmith whose family dominated the craft in Cuenca in the first half of the century.",
