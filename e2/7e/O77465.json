Small, easily transportable objects such as letter racks were in demand from Europeans in India itself, and from those outside India  who saw such a wealth of craftsmanship for the first time in the exhibitions.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe sandalwood letter rack was made in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) and incorporates an inlay technique that was a speciality of the city. It is set with roundels made by arranging together rods of metal, ivory (natural and stained green), bone and ebony, and then  slicing them thinly. The technique was known as 'sadeli'.\n\nPeople\nThe sadeli technique was described in detail by Sir George Birdwood in his landmark book, The Industrial Arts of India (London, 1880). He traced its origin to Shiraz, in Iran, from where he concluded it had travelled to Sindh in the mid-18th century, and thence to Bombay before 1880.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis letter rack was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 as an example of 'modern' work from Bombay. It was bought by the Museum of Ornamental Design for \u00a33.10s.",
