            "public_access_description": "This pearlware pedestal dish was originally part of a dessert service with dishes of various shapes, all finely painted with different birds.  It is decorated with a golden eagle, and the bird's name has been carefully inscribed in English and Latin on its base by the ceramics painter, William Weston Young.  He was employed to decorate pottery by the Cambrian Pottery in Swansea between 1803 and 1806.  The base of the dish also bears the impressed pottery mark 'SWANSEA'.\nIn 1806 the Swansea pottery started a bold new venture to retail high-end pottery in London.  They opened a warehouse in Fleet Street, the heart of London's shopping district at the time, and sent their best wares there for sale.  Unfortunately the investment did not pay off and only two years later the auctioneers Christie's sold off all the unsold stock from the warehouse on behalf of the pottery owners.  The sale catalogues from these sales provide a valuable record of the types of wares being made by the Welsh factory at this time.  Lot 50 in the sale of 24th February 1808 lists 'a desert service, gold edge, painted with birds, 37 pieces' and probably included pieces like this pedestal dish.\n\nThe above information is taken from the published works of the Welsh ceramics specialist and ceramics researcher Jonathan Gray.",

In the sale of the Cambrian Company's London Warehouse at Christie's in 1808, there were four lots with bird decoration. The text of the lots is listed on p. 216. Lot 50 in the sale on 24th February, 1808 reads: 'A desert service, gold edge, painted with birds, 37 pieces'. It sold to a Mr. Donaldson for \u00a33.00. In the caption to fig. 6.99 he notes that that dish was given to the Museum of Practical Geology by Mrs Dillwyn after 1835, suggesting that more than one service was made with this decoration. Further items in the National Museum of Wales are illustrated figs. 6.97 and 6.98. There are more items from this service in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum including three trefoil dishes, one with a hen-harrier illustrated as fig. 6.99 on p. 217 and two 3474-1901 and 3475-1901. Information about the ceramics painter, William Weston Young is given pp140-142. He worked for the Cambrian Pottery at Swansea between 1803-1806 and was paid \u00a375 per annum. 'Young's ceramic painting included animals, birds, butterflies, landscapes, bards and botanicals, very much aligned to the interests of his patron Lewis Weston Dillwyn.'",

In early 1806 they opened a retailing outlet their 'London Warehouse' at 64 Fleet Street.  Fleet Street was a well-established centre for ceramic retailing by this date, however the experiment was short-lived as Christies sold the unsold contents of the Warehouse in April 1808. 'From the surviving Christies records, it is clear that much of the fine pearlware and whiteware production made at the Pottery in the first decade of the nineteenth century was made for sale in London.\nFor example, the Nelson and Welsh Bard mugs, butterfly services and other examples of richly decorated and gilded pearlwares decorated by Thomas Pardoe and William Weston Young (figs 32, 33) appear for sale in the Christies' catalogues, which makes sense given the need for premium products to appeal to the fashionable London gentry...'",
