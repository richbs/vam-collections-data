There is very little of the wear and tear that one expects to find on a chair 350 years old, with the wood surfaces even and straight, except for the large back panel which does probably date from the 17th century. The solid seat is held only in a shallow groove that seems barely adequate to support the weight of a sitter. The rake of the back and bobbin turning on the legs is more usually associated with the period after 1660. Adding an early date (here, 1641) to a later piece of furniture is a common way to make it seem convincing.",

The deep seat rails don't look like a 17c approach, with a shallow groove to receive a seat board (and again no sign of real wear) which would not have served effectively (even with a cushion). Note the parrelogram form of seat, with side rails needing to employ an angled tenon where they are jointed to the squared front leg. \n\nthe rear angle of the back is surely post-17c, while the bobbin turning is possibly later in style than expected for 1641.\n\nthe undated back panel does not fit evenly in the back, making one suspect that this element could be old, while everything else including dated top rail is probably later.\n\nNotes from R.P. 47/489\n\nPurchase Form\nDescribes as \"One Chair, carved English dated 1641, oak, design on back, \u00a325\"\n\n12/3/47 Invoice\nlists as: \"One tall-back chair, bobbin-turned legs, back carved with carved date - 1641",
