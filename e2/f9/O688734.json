            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter, <u>Italian Drawings Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p.138-139. The following is the full text of the entry: FONTANA, CARLO (1634-1714) 1003 Design (perspective view with figures) of the catafalque erected for the funeral service of the Emperor Leopold I in the nave of S. Maria dell\u2019Anima, Rome, in 1705 Pen and ink and wash 17 x 12 \u00bd (432 x 308) E.216-1969 PROVENANCE Dr. W. M\u00fcseler (whose name is stamped in ink on some of the pages in the album; bought 1969 LITERATURE Allan Braham, <i>Funeral decorations in early eighteenth century Rome</i> (Victoria and Albert Museum Brochure no. 7), London, 1975, <i>passim</i>. This and the other designs by Carlo Fontana (or an assistant) in this catalogue are mounted in an album which is described under no. 1093. Most of the drawings in the album are connected with the funeral (in 1712) of Joseph I. Leopold\u2019s son and heir and they are catalogued under the name Poletti (nos. 1093-1171). A larger collection of designs for Leopold\u2019s funeral is preserved in Volume 177 in the Royal Library in Windsor Castle and will be catalogued by Braham. There are two contemporary accounts of the ceremony and its setting; one was written by Fontana himself as a preface to the Windsor volume; while the other was written and published by Francesco Posterla Romano under the title: <i>Istorica e veridical relazione della mola funebre fatta inalzare in occasione delle solenni essequie fatte all\u2019 Augustissimo Imperadore Leopoldo I</i>\u2026Rome, 1705. Posterla\u2019s account of the catafalque corresponds closely with the drawings. Is is needless to repeat passages that merely describe what we can see, but the following points from his book may help to elucidate the drawings. (a) The cannons resting on the base of the catafalque numbered eight in all (a pair flanking each of the four pillars) and they discharged incense. A design in the Windsor volume (9855) shows how the smoke was produced and ejected. (b) The three crowns beneath the baldacchino were stucco replicas of the imperial crown (in the middle), the royal crown (on the right), and the iron crown (on the left). They rested on a big embroidered velvet cushion, beneath a black veil. The supporting pedestal was decorated with four monochrome paintings simulating gilt bas-reliefs, showing four battle are shown again in greater detail on nos. 1007 and 1008 [Museum numbers: E.219 and 220-1969]. There appears to have been no sarcophagus, doubtless because the ceremony was a commemoration, not a burial. (c) The medallion portrait of the emperor above the three crowns was cared in relief. The spiral friezes on the four <i>mete</i> (as Posterla calls the four candle-shaped columns at the corners of the catafalque) were painted in simulation of gilt bronze reliefs and illustrated four different aspects of the emperor\u2019s spiritual life. The right-hand one dealt with the theme of Devotion, the one on the left with Charity, while Justice and <i>Ingrandimento dell\u2019Imperio</i> were the subjects of the two <i>mete</i> at the back of the catafalque. The spiral reliefs were clearly inspired by Trajan\u2019s column, as Posterla states. This is the only design in the Windsor and Victoria and Albert volumes that gives a complete view of the catafalque. There is a brown stain across the lower part of the catafalque, which makes the drawing rather difficult to read in this area. There is no drawing showing the complete catafalque of Joseph I in either album.",
