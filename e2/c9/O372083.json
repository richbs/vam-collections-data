            "history_note": "Cesca chair. German 1928. Designed by Marcel Breuer. Furniture designer and architect, born Pecs, Hungary 1902. Trained at the Bauhaus Weimar 1920-24, head of the cabinet-making workshops Dessau 1924-28. Worked in England 1935-37 with F.R.S. Yorke. Partnership with Gropius at Harvard, Graduate School of Design 1937-41. Chair designed in Berlin, immediately after leaving Bauhaus 1928. Reproduced by Cassina, Milan since 1965. Originally called the B64. Both it and the B32 (armless version) were named the \u2018Cesca\u2019 after Breuers daughter, from 1960 onwards.\n\nDescription of V&A object from Hollis, R. 1970. Modern Chairs:1918-1970. The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London:\n\"\u2018A piece of furniture is not an arbitrary composition: it is a necessary component of our environment. In itself impersonal, it takes on meaning only from the way it is used or as part of a complex scheme. A complete scheme is no arbitrary composition either, but rather the outward expression of our everyday needs; it must be able to serve both these needs which remain constant and those which vary. This variation is possible only if the very simplest and most straightforward pieces are used; otherwise changing will mean buying new pieces. Let our dwelling have no particular \u2018style\u2019 but only the imprint of the owner\u2019s character. The architect, as producer, creates only half a dwelling; the man who lives in it, the other half.\u2019 Marcel Breuer \n\u2018the new interior should not be a self-portrait of the architect, nor should it attempt to fix in advance the personal environment of the occupant. And so we have furnishings, rooms and buildings allowing as much change and as many transpositions and different combinations as possible. The pieces of furniture and even the very walls of a room have ceased to be massive and monumental, apparently immoveable and built for eternity. Instead they are more opened out, or, so to speak, drawn in space. They hinder neither the movement of the body nor of the eye. The room is no longer a self-bounded composition, a closed box, for its dimensions and different elements can be varied in many ways. One may conclude that any object properly and practically designed should \u2018fit\u2019 in any room in which it is used as would any living object, like a flower or a human being.\u2019 Marcel Breuer in das neue Frankfurt 1927\"\n\nDescription of Craftsman from Hollis, R. 1970.
