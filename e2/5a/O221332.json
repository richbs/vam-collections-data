He was also one of the first people to exhibit his computer graphics, at the studio gallery of the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart in February 1965.\n\nNees studied mathematics and physics at the universities of Erlangen-Nuremberg and Stuttgart.   He subsequently worked for Siemens as a software engineer, and was instrumental in their purchasing a 'Zuse Graphomat', a drawing machine operated by computer-generated punched tape.  The machine was capable of creating geometric patterns and, although the programming language that Nees used (ALGOL) was designed specifically for scientific computers, Nees used it to create aesthetic images such as this one. \n\nIn 1969 he received his doctorate on the subject of Generative Computer Graphics under Max Bense, the German philosopher and writer.\n\nThis photographic reproduction of Nees's original plotter drawing was donated to the V&amp;A by the Computer Arts Society, which organised a number of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
