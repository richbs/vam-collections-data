            "historical_context_note": "This is almost certainly an Italian silk from the mid-late 14th century. The Italian weavers started out by producing silks that used elements directly lifted from imported Eastern silks, combined with European motifs. From the mid 1320s through to the late 1300s, Italian silks began to feature witty animal designs, as here. The fragment of the full design shows leaping hinds and a mythical beast, possibly a griffin, amongst stylised large flowers and leaves.\n\nThe fabric is a lampas weave. This is a weave in which a supplementary weft provides the figured pattern. The threads in the supplementary weft float over the surface of the woven base fabric, and are held down by binding warp threads. The example here has a twill ground, with the design picked out in gold threads. It was probably originally red, but is now faded to a very pale salmon pink, almost cream.\n\nThe subject matter of the fabric and its original red and gold colourway would have made it particularly appropriate for ecclesiastical use. These luxurious lampas silks were also used for fashionable courtly dress. In visual sources such as the early 15th century Devonshire Tapestries (T.202 to 205-1957), courtly figures are depicted lifesize, wearing sumptuous garments with large-scale patterns and motifs. These probably post-date the sample, and are predominantly patterns with floral motifs rather than depictive vignettes. However, the scales of the patterns in relation to their wearers are similar. I have looked through several books of 14th and 15th century dress as portrayed in visual sources, and where richly dressed figures are portrayed, the patterms tend to be almost exclusively foliate/floral. The implication is that figurative designs such as this, with creatures in the design, were not necessarily to be found in secular dress, which is almost always shown as either plain, or bearing patterns based upon leaves, flowers, and the \"pomegranate\" design.\n\n<i><b>References:</b></i><br>\nJ.
