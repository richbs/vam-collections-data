Their practical form and tough material were perfectly adapted to their use. Stoneware mugs of this shape made in England were known as 'gorges'.\n\nTime\nBy 1680, brown stoneware mugs were already being made at Fulham and the market for such imports from Frechen in Germany sharply declined. Potters in the Westerwald area of Germany, however, continued to make their plain grey or grey and blue stonewares for the English market until well into the 18th century.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAll-over trailing plant decoration has a long history in European ceramics, from the painted Italian maiolica oak-leaf jars of the 15th century to Staffordshire teapots of the mid-18th century. It can be expanded to fit any size of globular pot. On this mug, the use of metal sprig-moulds to apply the flowers and simple incised lines to represent the stalks has reduced the decoration to a semi-skilled process.",
