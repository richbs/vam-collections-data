Since guests usually stood and mingled the gowns could include complex bustles and skirt details, which would be crushed if sat on. \n\nIn his book the Little Dictionary of Fashion (1954) Christian Dior (1905-57) described cocktail dresses as 'elaborate and dressy afternoon frocks', preferably in black taffeta, satin, chiffon and wool. These confections became the personification of the 'little black dress' and were often accessorised with gloves and small, elaborate hats.",

In 1974, hwen Denis Healey was Chancellor of the Exchequer and introducing Draconian taxes, the d'Erlangers retreated from their house in Upper Grosvenor Street to live in Switzerland.  It was at this point that Bweaton took away a great cache of Paris dresses to add to the Museum's collection, including a little black dress of spotted net by Gr\u00e8s.\nVickers, H., 'Cecil Beaton' in Wilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, London), pl.7.14\nImage of Mrs Leo d'Erlanger wearing a hat by Vernier.  <i>Vogue</i> (British), June 1949.
