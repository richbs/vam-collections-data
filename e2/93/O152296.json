            "physical_description": "Plain weave silk embroidered with couched metal thread and silk in straight stitches with a border of silk with applied spangles and corner units of cut voided silk velvet and metal thread, a facing of bias-cut woven silk and a backing of roller-printed plain weave cotton. There is an interlining of dark blue silk.\nThe central panel has a blue ground [blue weft and cream? warp] divided by an ogival lattice formed by 'gold' sinuous leaves with a circle of spiralling metal thread at each junction.  Each compartment contains a large sycamore shaped leaf in metal thread with a round pink flower head in the centre and 4 small green flower heads emerging from between the points of the leaf. The bottom line of the panel has incomplete motifs of a different design: a pair of small leaves drop from the lattice and are either side of a flower head with a semi-circle of 5 round petals around a small semi-circular centre of spiralling metal thread.  Below this are two small pink leaves.\nThe border of pink silk has been cut and re-used from something else: all the pieces except for 2 show details from a pattern of opposed undulating lines with small diamonds and with a long leafy sprig in the spaces.  One section on the right hand side has no discernable pattern, just arcs and a wiggly line and one section on the left hand side has a flower on a long stem; this flower head has long drooping petals.\nThe square corners sections have been cut from a purple velvet on a ribbed ground with a metal strip in the weft.  Small serrated leaves form a diamond lattice with a tiny 4-petalled flower head at the junctions and a 6-petalled round flower head in each diamond.\nFacing: striped silk: narrow white and dark blue stripes.  The white stripes contain a tiny pink flower and a sinuous line of blue leaves with pink and yellow details and the dark blue stripes contain an isolated motif of a red flower with yellow details.\nBacking: white cotton ground with parallel undulating red and blue stems with many small branches, leaves and flower heads.  There are some slightly larger exotic blossoms but the motifs are on a small-scale.  The predominant colours are red, purple, blue with dark green and yellow.\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk; pink, light pink, green, light green.\nMetal thread: silver-gilt strip close S-wound on a cream/dull yellow. The spangles are mainly silver-gilt with odd ones in green, pink and blue.  Most are stitched in place but the coloured ones are held in place with a small piece of silver purl with a round profile.",
