He looks rather sharply to his right with a fixed gaz, his lips slightly parted and his right eyebrow raised. The lower edge of the cassock where the bust is truncated has a lively movement, and this impression is reinforced by the play of folds and creases on the cassock, which suggests the fall of light on shot silk. The biretta is set on Panciatichi's head at a tilt, forward and to his right, which gives a faintly jaunty look to the sitter. The sculptor makes much play with the intricate folds of flesh beneath the chin which add to the effect of a turning movement suddenly arrested. Occasional buttons down the front of the cassock are only partly done up, while those near the bottom are completely undone, a trick meant to give an effect of sponaneity that was frequently employed by sculptors of the baroque period. Inscribed on the back.",
