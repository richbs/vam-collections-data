However, their purpose is well known because they appear, holding flowers, on contemporary trade cards which illustrate glass pyramids of jelly glasses. No less than six are shown amongst the jelly glasses on the trade card of the London glass retailers Maydwell & Windle, dating from about 1750-1775.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSuch vases must have been exceptionally cheap to produce, since they are simply made from a mould-blown baluster stem (as used on salvers and the heavier types of drinking glasses), having one end open and the other adapted to become a foot with an applied disk of glass.\n\nCollectors & Owners\nAs is the case with other cheap objects for which the fashion soon passed, these little vases are very rare. This example, the only one in the V&A collections, was presented in 1911 by Francis Buckley, a London lawyer and author of several books on the early London glass industry.",
