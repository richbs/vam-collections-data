Clusters of yellow tulip-like flower heads are dispersed amongst the leaves with an occasional single orange flower.  All the floral motifs are edged in white.\nThe main border design shows scrolling yellow and olive green leaves on a dark blue ground, echoing the main motif on the carpet field. The border design does not match at the corners where it has been joined and is divided from the field with plain white and dark blue stripes. There is a plain dark blue border around the edge of the carpet. The cross corner seams are bound on the back carpet with red tape.",

            "public_access_description": "Charles Voysey was one of the most original and influential architects and designers of all forms of decorative art working at the end of the 19th century. In 1882 he set up his own architecture practice and from the late 1880s started to design repeating patterns for wallpaper and woven and printed textiles and carpets. Voysey\u2019s most interesting designs date from this time and are dominated by flowing patterns incorporating pastel-coloured birds, animals, hearts, flowers and trees in silhouette. He sold his work to manufacturers such as G.P. & J. Baker, Thomas Wardle and Alexander Morton. Voysey\u2019s designs were well known in mainland Europe, and though popular with French Art Nouveau designers, his influence was felt more dramatically by the founders of the Modern Movement.",
