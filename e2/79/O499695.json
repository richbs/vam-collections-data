Each colour pen and ink line in this drawing is a smaller version of the large brush line that dominates the image. The computer program varies the size, angle and location of each line.\n\nIn 1995, Verostko, alongside artists such as Jean-Pierre H\u00e9bert, Hans Dehlinger and others, began to describe themselves as 'Algorists' - artists who employ original algorithms in the process of creating their art.",
