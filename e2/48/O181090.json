Mr Bergen also gave Asian ceramics to the Museum.  The following notes, in a memo to Ralph Edwards, Keeper of Furniture and Woodwork, from someone sighning themselves CMW, came with the donation:\n\n\u2018His grandfather, Teunis G. Bergen wrote a genealogy of the Bergen family, published by Joel Munsell, Albany, N.Y., in 1876. The family\u2019s ancestor, Hans Hansen Bergen, who arrived in New Amsterdam from Bergen, Norway, in 1633, married the first girl to be born in the colony. \n\nMr Bergen\u2019s old family home (which I was shown by a friend of his in July 1939) was a weather-boarded house , Shaw Road and 77th Street, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.\n\nHis father acquired most of the furniture.  The chairs were inherited through Mr Bergen\u2019s mother. They were used in the British camp at New Brunswick, New Jersey, during the War of Independence.'",
