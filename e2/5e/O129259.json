Spoons of any metal are relatively uncommon before this date. Spoons were generally made from cheap and plentiful materials like wood or horn in the Middle Ages. Pewter and silver were used by the relatively wealthy and gold by royalty and the nobility. Medieval English pewter is rare, and this piece is one of the earliest English pewter spoons to survive, its design being close to known silver examples. The distinctive leaf-shaped bowl and two part handles bear similarities to several 12th and 13th century silver spoons found at the site of Taunton Castle, Somerset and on the site of the Nunnery Church of Iona.",

Wills and inventories show that from 1300 onwards pewter was commonly used in the kitchen, however very few of these documented objects survive.\n\nThis object is a rare example of a pewter spoon made before the 14th century. Spoons of metal were very uncommon before this date. Spoons were often made from other materials such as wood or horn in the Middle Ages. Medieval English Pewter is also rare. This piece is one of the earliest English pewter spoons to survive. The distinctive leaf-shaped bowl and two part handles bear similarities to several 12th and 13th century silver spoons found at the site of Taunton Castle, Somerset and on the site of the Nunnery Church of Iona.",

They were commonly presented as christening gifts.\n\nA knife and a spoon, and fingers were the principal implements used for eating in this period. Soups and pottages were served in bowls and eaten with a spoon. Whilst spoons of wood or horn were widely used in the Middle Ages, records show that spoons of all metals were favoured by wealthier sections of society, gold and silver being used by the nobility, and pewter by the merchant classes.",
