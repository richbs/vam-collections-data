            "public_access_description": "A writing box such as this would have been fitted with various implements utilised for writing from an ink stick, water dropper, ink stone and brushes. To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took time and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. \nThis writing box is Rinpa in style, a style developed by the artists Honami Koetsu (1558-1637) and Ogata Korin (1658-1716), with its bright golden hues and stylistic abstract form. The domed shape lid illustrates the large curved form of Mount Fuji and evokes a sense of movement as the birds appear to fly around the box. The pine trees and birds wings in mother-of-pearl enlivens the design and draws attention to the snowy summit. The contrasting colours and textures of the mother of pearl on the gold lacquer background gives the box a sense of lively animation. By the early Edo period it was common practice for lacquer artists to depict animals in motion in an effort to display their skill. It is a dramatic composition despite its simplicity and lack of details.",
