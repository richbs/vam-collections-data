The portfolio includes two works by the Computer Technique Group, plus single works by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer, William Fetter, Maughan S. Mason, Donald K. Robbins, and Kerry Strand. The complete set was acquired by the Museum in 1969, at a cost of \u00a35.\n\nFetter worked for the Boeing aircraft company, where he produced some of the first computer-aided drawings of the human figure. His ergonomic studies, such as this one, contributed to the design of the Boeing 737's cockpit.",
