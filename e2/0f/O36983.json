The underneath of the body and inner front legs  are yellow plastic.  The head is decorated with bright pink fur fabric to represent the head hair and ears and there are coloured plastic knobs on the forehead.  It is possible that when operating these knobs light up.  Under the chin are three bells and on the top of the head a green fur fabric decoration and metal and blue thread tassels.  Between the front paws, on an upright metal post, is a large ball, tinplate in red with green and gold markings.\n4.  tail, fan shaped bright pink fur fabric with a gold and green metallic decoration.  This sits on a post protruding from the lions upper body.\n5.  battery cover plate which sits over the hole in the base of the body.\n\nThe battery is housed inside the body and the on/off switch is on the left side.  When operating, the lion moves along on two large yellow plastic wheels; there is a balance knob at the rear end.  At the same time the post supporting the ball turns so the ball spins.  Also activated is the head which allows the mouth to open and close, jingling the bells underneath the chin, and the tail moves from side to side on the post which is connected to the mechanism.\n\n*One of the major mythological symbols is the dragon and the pearl with the dragon always trying to catch the pearl.
