More women in Norway still own and wear traditional jewellery than in any other country in Europe.  You can see jewellery like this being worn at weddings or on other social occasions to this day.\n\nWomen throughout the Nordic region usually used ring brooches or clasps to fasten their traditional clothing.  These clasps vary considerably by place.  Telemark had the widest range of clasps of any region in Norway.  The most typical, found only in Telemark, are these large heart-shaped clasps, richly decorated with filigree.  They first appear at the beginning of the 19th century, and are still being made today.",
