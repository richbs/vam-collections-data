Whitley (<i>Art  in England,1821-1837</i>, p. 188) assigns the incident, apparently on the authority of Anderdon, to the year 1830. Constable was taking an active part on the Council in that year, as a newly elected Academician, and was one of the three members of the Hanging Committee for the exhibition. The date of 1830 for the incident is consistent with the supposition, which is justified on stylistic grounds, that the painting was made on Constable's last visit to Salisbury in 1829. Holmes, p. 245, dates the picture 1820, but does not notice that Constable could not have been on the committee for selecting the exhibition before his appointment as an Academician in 1829. Whitley quotes Anderdon's version of the incident of the picture's rejection, which he had from Leslie. Richard Redgrave noted a version of the story in his diary entry for 30 April 1866 (printed in <i>Richard Redgrave, A Memoir by F. M. Redgrave</i>, 1891, pp. 284-5). Redgrave's informant was F. R. Lee, but he cannot have been present when the episode occurred, as he was not elected an Academician until 1838. Frith's account is the liveliest and, though it is probably embellished, the fact that its source was Abraham Cooper, who served with Constable on the Hanging Committee in 1830, gives it some authority: \"When Constable was a member of the selecting Council, a small landscape was brought to judgment; it was not received with favour. The first judge said, 'That's a poor thing'; the next muttered, 'It's very green'; in short, the picture had to stand the fire of animadversion from everybody but Constable, the last remark being, 'It's devilish bad-cross it'. Constable rose, took a couple of steps in front, turned round, and faced the Council. 'That picture,' said he, 'was painted by me. I have a notion that some of you didn't like my work, and this is a pretty convincing proof.  I am very much obliged to you', making a low bow. 'Dear, dear!' said the President [Shee] to the head-carpenter, 'how came that picture amongst the outsiders? Bring it back; it must be admitted, of course.' 'No! it must not!' said Constable; 'out it goes!' and, in spite of apology and entreaty, out it went. This story was told me by Cooper, who witnessed the scene\". (W. P. Frith, <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i>, Vol. I, 1887, pp. 237-8.) \n\nNo. 321 [FA 38] was sold as Lot 50, 'Salisbury Meadows; painted from nature' at the Executors' sale, 16 May 1838, bought on behalf of John Sheepshanks for \u00a335 14s. by Smith of Gower Street. Anderdon wished to buy it and told Leslie \"I had been bidding on from ten pounds, hoping to walk off with such a prize, when I heard some one whisper- 'Why Sheepshanks is bidding'. I was then the last bidder, but I gave way at once to a competitor with such a long purse\". \"You would never have got it in any case\", replied Leslie. \"I have tried in vain to obtain it, and have offered in exchange to paint for Sheepshanks anything he liked. But I can't shake him. He clings to it all the more, because he knows it was thrown out by the Academy Council as 'a nasty green thing' \" (Whitley, loc. cit., p. 189). Redgrave confirms Leslie's admiration for the picture: \"Of this picture Leslie, who had an intense admiration of Constable's art, once said to me that he would give any work he (Leslie) had painted for it, so warmly did he admire it\" (Redgrave, loc. cit., p. 285).\"\nEvans, M., with N.
