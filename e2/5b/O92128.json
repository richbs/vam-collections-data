This piece is of solid ivory, and was originally richly decorated with gilding that has now largely rubbed off. Its shape follows contemporary European tub chairs and the design of the splat growing out of a lotus roundel is loosely drawn from designs in Thomas Hepplewhite's The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide of 1788 (plate IX). William Pitt, 1st Earl Amherst of Arracan, acquired these pieces in India, where he was Governor-General from 1823 to 1828. According to tradition he purchased them from his predecessor, Frances, 1st Marquess Hastings.",
