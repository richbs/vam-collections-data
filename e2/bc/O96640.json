The Dolls' Festival is traditionally celebrated by girls on 3rd March. Ewers of this type were traditionally used to serve liquids. \n\nThe focal point of the Dolls' Festival is the display of dolls, miniature furniture and household accessories on tiered shelves in the home. The furniture and accessories are modelled on wedding sets which formed part of the dowry of elite women. Such sets, which usually included more than 50 objects, were intended as ceremonial showpieces to show off the family's wealth and status. They included bathing and toilet articles, items connected with clothes, writing implements and those for eating and drinking. This Dolls' Festival group consists of several incomplete sets of miniature lacquer furniture and daily utensils. If they could afford it, a family would possess a high-quality set of lacquered items, which were passsed down from generation to generation. This accounts for the incomplete nature of this particular set. It also suggests that they not only had sentimental value, but were also of artistic merit.",
