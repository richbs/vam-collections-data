Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe- and boot-shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. This carved wooden snuff box is inlaid with fine mother of pearl in diamond-, crescent- and heart-shapes, suggesting that it may have been a love token. Detailing in the form of stitching and buttons is made of metal inlay and piqu\u00e9 work (short lengths of metal wire fixed in small holes drilled into the wood). Metal inlays also decorate the sole. The top of the shoe is hollowed out to hold the snuff, and a single piece of mother-of-pearl makes a sliding lid. The size and weight of this box suggests it was probably placed on the table at social gatherings rather than carried around for personal use.",
