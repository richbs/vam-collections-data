The textile has vertical stripes that are decorated with rows of daisy-like flowers created by bands of supplementary pattern wefts. The alternate crimson and white stripes are separated by narrow bright green stripes outlined in black. The white stripes have alternate blue and salmon pink flowers with leaves and stalks in two tones of sage and bright green, while the crimson stripes are ornamented with white-petalled flowers outlined in alternate crimson and sage green with the leaves and stalks in bright green and gold.\n\nThe binding has a 'French' head band with a treble core bound in silk threads in shades of brown, ivory and beige separated by narrow bands of pale and darker turquoise threads. The insides of the covers are laid with cream-coloured paper. The album consists of two cream-coloured fly leaves in paper and card, 56 folios of Indian miniature paintings on both sides, with portraits or scenes with figures on facing pages, alternating with flower paintings. There is a further blank page in cream-coloured card and an end paper in cream-coloured paper at the back of the album.  The pages have gutters in either a woven cloth tape or paper which are bound together and attached to the cover. The edges of the gutters, like the edges of all the pages, are gilded.",

It has been assumed that the album was acquired by Robert Clive, first Baron Clive of Plassey as a gift from Shuja ud-Daula, the Nawab of Avadh, after his last visit to India in 1765-67.  The album has clearly been rebound in a European manner at a later date and covered with an Indian textile, probably made in the Madras Presidency, which may have been cut from one of the lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, later Ist Earl of Powis, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799-1803.  The album was sold, along with two others, from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, London, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
