He worked with the architect, Sir Charles Barry. Although some ceremonial pieces, such as the throne in the House of Lords, were made by John Webb, an antique dealer and cabinet-maker of Bond Street, most furniture intended for everyday use was provided by either Gillow & Co. or Holland & Sons, both regular suppliers of furniture for government commissions.\n\nThis table shows Pugin's genius in combining his favourite Gothic carving and structural details with a practical function. The table, on castors, was designed for the House of Lords, where the hinged top could be easily raised for use by peers sitting on the front benches. Although Pugin preferred to use oak for his Westminster furniture, this restriction was relaxed after his death.",
