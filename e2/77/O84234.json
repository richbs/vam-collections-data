Westwood\u2019s career in fashion was galvanised by McLaren and together they launched memorable fashion moments, including Punk in the early 1970s and later their Pirates collection. McLaren and Westwood conducted a design relationship between 1971 and 1983. In 1990 and again in 1991 Vivienne Westwood was named British Designer of the Year; she has also received an OBE. \n\nFor this bag design Vivienne Westwood borrowed a detail from J.H. Fragonard's Swarm of Cherubs painting to create an ornate clutch. She reproduced the same detail on a raincoat in the classic style, making an eye-catching and spirit-lifting ensemble for wet weather.",
