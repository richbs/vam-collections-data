The legs are crossed in virasana.  The figure wears a crown and other Bodhisattva ornaments and is seated on a low dais which rests on a double lotus throne which, in turn, rests on a low platform.\n\nThe style is similar to that of the art of Plaosan which correspnds to the late Central Javanese period of about 1000 AD (see B Kempers `Ancient Indonesian Art' pl 135) or, possibly, to the earlier style of the Dieng Plateau of about the late 9th or early 10th century (see ibid, pl 28)\n\nThe iconography is uncertain.  The figure is similar to an illustration of Sarvanivaranarishkambhin in B Bhattacharrya, <i>The</i> <i>Indian Buddhist Iconography,</i> pl 64 which is, however, only two armed.  Dr P H Pott (in a letter in the R/pp) says that the iconography is unusual in Javanese art and tentatively suggests an identification of Visvapani.",
