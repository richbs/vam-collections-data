This plan survives as two separate pieces of paper (E.4988-1910 and E.5046-1910) with the intervening area missing. This design is a detached fragment from the lower right corner of E.4988-1910. The drawing has been picked for transfer. The drawing shows only the left half of the table top, and excludes the repetitive pattern of the outer border. This drawing, by John Yenn, is related to a group of gilt side tables with painted tops, consisting of a pair divided between the V&A and the MMA, and a third smaller table of the same design in a private collection. The present drawing is that used by the decorative painter of the table top. In the executed tables, the frames are filled with figure compositions after Guido Reni, presumably painted on to the top by a specialist artist.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
