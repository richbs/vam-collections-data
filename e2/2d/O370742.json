The flask is decorated with scrolling bands carved in shallow relief against a cross-hatched background.  The edges of the scrolls are incised with cross-banded lines. The neck of the flask is incised with alternating crosses and shield shapes, and is supported by an iron collar.  The bottom of the flask is sealed with a wooden disk, probably of oak with a red stain, held in place with pegs visible on the outside of the flask. The disk is carved with a cross within a circle, and lettering in a runic alphabet.",

In Norway, horns had traditionally been used as drinking vessels, but as guns gradually became more common in rural districts in the 1600s, the powder horn became a new product for country craftsmen.  The dense nature of horn is suitable for fine linear carving, in this case with running scrollwork, a traditional Norwegian motif, against a background of cross-hatching. Pigment was sometimes rubbed into the incisions to make the design stand out. Powder horns were often highly decorative, with incised patterns and metal mounts, clearly made for display as well as for use.  They were worn on the body hanging from a strap.",

The design of interlacing strapwork was a traditional Norwegian motif seen for example on 6th century gold swords and scabbards and on wood carvings in stave churches of the 13-14th centuries. (Roar Hauglid, <u>Norway; </u><u>A Thousand Years of Native Arts and Crafts</u>, Mittet &amp; Co, Oslo 1956. ills. 10,11,30)\n\nThe horn was given to the Museum by Mrs Alec Tweedie, with four other Norwegian objects from her ethnographic collection, which she described as 'odds &amp; ends from a traveller' (Acquisition File). A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, her book '<u>An Adventurous Journey, Russia-Siberia-China</u>' was published in 1929 (London, Thornton Butterworth 1929). Other items from her collection were passed on to Warrington Museum and Art Gallery, the Horniman Museum and he British Museum. She gave, and also bequeathed on her death in 1940, a wide variety of other objects to the V&amp;A.",
