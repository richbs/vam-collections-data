Translating the horrors of war into balletic terms (and strict classical ballet at that) could have produced a tasteless or embarassingly comic work, but MacMillan's intention was not a realistic depiction of war, but a meditation on death and its emotional resonance.  The design problem was to suggest dead fighting men without individualising them.  MacMillan and designer Andy Klunder avoided extreme realism to suggest a deeper and more universal experience.  In the austere, bleak setting of no-man's-land, all the male figures are visually linked not by army uniforms, but by uniform lacerated body tights in colours that suggested earth, mud and blood, the muted lines like drained blood vessels or exposed nerves.  The inserted panels, revealed by the cut-away top layer, were painted to match, and from the audience gave the impression was of wounds or rotting flesh. \nAgainst these costumes, the girls wore silvery body tights with floating chiffon skirts, their heads and faces also silvery, suggesting that they were insubstantial memories.  The choreography and design were set in almost ironic contrast to the uplifting, joyous music -  Fran\u00e7ois Poulenc's Gloria.",
