The Shi\u2019ite sect began in the 650s,  when Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and Husayn\u2019s father became Caliph  (leader of the Muslim people). In the years following Mohammad's death there were contesting claims to power; the supporters  of Ali and his family became known as the Shiites, which means \"the followers of Ali\u201d. In 680 the Umayyad Caliph weakened Shi\u2019ite rule by killing Husayn, along with most of his male family and followers at Karbala in Iraq.  Shi'ites remember the death of Husayn every year during the month of  Muharram. Posters such as this one are a visual reminder of Husayn's martydom.",
