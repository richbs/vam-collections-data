It published cartoons, which satirised, amongst other things, the boorishness of the Prussian Military caste. From the late 1920s until the mid 1930s it attacked the members of the Nazi party, but after that it had to confine itself to less dangerous topics until it ceased publication in 1944. One of the German grievances in the 1920s was the French presence on what was considered to be German soil.  After the defeat of the Germans in 1918, the French army occupied the Rhineland until a withdrawal was negotiated in 1930. With Reparations it was the major target of German diplomacy during the Weimar Republic.",
