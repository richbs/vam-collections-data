Scratched on the back with the inscription <i>James 2nd </i> and other illegible inscriptions. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Henry J Pfungst; by him given to the Museum, April 1915. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Accessions</i> 1915, p. 41; Long 1929, p. 60, fig. 30; Long 1930, p. 10, fig. 52; Reynolds 1952, p. 91 ; Murdoch 1978, p. 287n.; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 13; Murdoch 1981 , p. 158. \n\nUntil 1935 this miniature was attributed to Carandini or Cleyn in accordance with the current theory of the identity of the monogrammist 'PC\u2019. Long, although he had already done much to destroy this theory in <i>British Miniaturists</i>, (1) still catalogued the miniature as by Carandini or Cleyn in the <i>Handlist</i> of 1930. (2) In 1935, when the signed <i>William Gore</i> (Cat. No. 166) had been acquired, the two miniatures were formally compared, but still Long was sceptical: 'Practically no similarity of technique was found, nor did the writing at the backs of the miniatures appear to have anything appreciable in common.' (3)\n\nFew would now agree with such a categorically negative judgement. With such different sitters and at least six years separating them, some lack of similarity is understandable: Gore's complexion is florid and the unknown man's is sallow, and the hatching stroke on <i>William Gore</i> is exceptionally long and wiry. But the basic technique of modelling the features in polychrome stipple is common to both. Note also the drawing of the bridge of the nose, backed by a little brown shadow to produce the silhouette against the cheek, and the use of blue or blue-green shadow used liberally around the eyes and in the modelling of the chin. These characteristics are present in all the early Cross works catalogued here, and would, even in the absence of signatures, lead to attribution on stylistic grounds to Cross. \n\nThe traditional reading of the date is 1661, and Cross seems to have been born <i>c.</i>1645. Reynolds (4) accordingly made the point that the style of the miniature was immature. There is certainly a difference in sophistication of design and in the precision of the stipple modelling between this and, especially, the Robert Kerr (Cat. No. 164), but this may not be a matter of immaturity. Since the card is trimmed so hard up against the date, it is possible to suppose that other numerals have been lost, and an amended reading of anything between MDCLXII and MDCLXIV would still be plausible.
