            "public_access_description": "Dummy boards are life-size, flat, wooden figures painted and shaped in outline to resemble figures of servants, soldiers, children, and animals. The taste for using illusionistic painted figures as a form of house decoration probably originated in the trompe l\u2019oeil, or life-like interior scenes painted by Dutch artists in the early 17th century. Dummy boards continued to be produced into the 19th century. They were placed in corners and on stairways to surprise visitors, or in front of empty fireplaces in the summer. Most were made by professional sign-painters, who also produced the hanging street signs prevalent until the late 18th century.\n\nThis life-size figure of a woman looking into a mirror is well-dressed, the style of clothes suggesting a date of about 1640.  It came from East Sutton Park in Kent, and has carved wooden feet, the right foot projecting outwards. As she is looking into a mirror, she probably represents 'vanity'. The V&A collection has a companion dummy board showing the same figure holding a broom, representing 'industry'.",

Clifford Smith, Catalogue of English Furniture & Woodwork (London 1930), 663\nTwo Picture-Dummies or Screens painted in oil colours on wood; one represents a lady with small oval mirror in her left hand, right hand holding her hair which is brown and falls below the waist; she wears a pearl necklace and pendant pearl earrings, hair chain and bracelet; in olive green dress of floral pattern trimmed with gold braid, low-cut bodice, neck-trimmings, and cuffs of white linen edged with scalloped needle-point lace; large white apron similarly edged falling straight to the feet.  Feet modelled in wood, right foot projecting, left foot straight to skirt.\nThe other represents a lady as a housemaid with a broom.  She wears a plain green gown, probably intended for satin, the sleeves slashed showing white inner sleeves, the bodice close-fitting, with braided shoulder-pieces, and slightly open in front.  Her short, wavy, auburn hair is covered by a close-fitting cap embroidered in black; she has a falling collar and cuffs edged with scalloped needle-point lace and a hair bracelet on the wrist; the large white apron, tucked up, is similarly edged with lace.  Feet modelled in wood, left foot projecting.\n\nFrom East Sutton Park, Kent.
