            "public_access_description": "Designs for Lady Craven's Dairy depicted on this sheet of paper are by Sir John Soane and date to 1781. It appears that Charles James Richardson, Soane's assistant between 1824 and 1837, used the blank verso of a Soane sheet to paste on a pair of rustic garden seats of his own design at a much later date. In Richardson's printed works there are several similar rustic structures and the accompanying text makes it clear that Richardson was indebted to Soane for his theories of primitivism.\n\nOne of the earliest instances of this primitivism is the Soane dairy depicted in this drawing. Lady Elizabeth Craven by whom it was commissioned in 1781, had a long-standing interest in dairies. Possibly with practical advice from her, Soane produced a pair of dairy structures. In each case the dairy proper occupies the central position of the rear. Stone counter and table tops are indicated in grey wash together with the darker areas indicating the milk jugs that would stand upon them for cooling. \n\nSoane was very well familiar with Abb\u00e9 Marc-Antoine Laugier's Essai sur l'architecture and knew the supposed origins of antique temple architecture in the trees of the forest. Soane combined his essay in architectural pre-history with the romantic back-to-the-soil connotations of a thatched cottage. All this was in keeping with the theme of milk as a healthy food, and with a broader search among his contemporaries for a return to natural goodness.",
