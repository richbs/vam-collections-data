This caricature of a peasant woman with a wide grin and a fleshy face decorates a jack-in-the-box toy. A wide range of jack-in-the-box figures like this were available in the Victorian era. Despite their frightening qualities such toys were not only cheap and popular, but also helped to provide children with their first awareness of basic scientific principles. More recently jack-in-the boxes have taken on a more welcoming look.",
