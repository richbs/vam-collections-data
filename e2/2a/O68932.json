The gilding of the medallion, of the Virgin's robes and of the ornament above the base is original, as is the paint surface in the flesh parts.  The blue paint on the frame and the base is more modern, as is the inscription.  The Child's right arm has been broken off above the elbow, and seems originally to have been shown in benediction.",
