            "public_access_description": "By the early 16th century, northern European brass dishes had become greater in diameter, the depressions shallower and the flanges of the rims wider than they had been in the 15th century. Pictorial themes continued to be used in decoration but the wider bases afforded scope for an increasing use of abstract decoration. A central motif might be bounded by one or two concentric bands of decoration - either interlaced scroll-like waves or lettering. This decoration was not necessarily embossed with punches in the traditional manner but was often cast in the mould at an earlier stage in the manufacture. The inscriptions themselves were usually meaningless and were incorporated into the overall design merely for their decorative value. On this example the central image is surrounded by a band of simulated inscription, made with a repeating stamp, between leaf borders, and there are stamped ornaments around the rim.\n\nProduction of such bowls was centred in Nuremberg but not exclusively. Other centres of brass production were Dinant in Flanders and its immediate neighbourhood, from Bouvignes to Aachen. Techniques and styles were copied with equal facility everywhere so it is difficult to assign a place of manufacture within northern Europe to any dish produced during the 16th and 17th centuries. For example, not only did the export of dishes from the Dinant area provide prototypes for others to follow, but the downfall of the town in 1466 to Charles the Bold of Burgundy saw the dispersal of refugee metalworkers.\n\nThose dishes exported to Britain were sometimes used as alms dishes. Elsewhere their function was primarily secular. European paintings of domestic interiors show that they were frequently used in conjunction with lavabos (basins) or ewers, also in brass, for washing hands after a meal. Before the 17th century, when forks became customary, such equipment was essential to any dining table.\n\nThe subject depicted on this dish is the legend of St George and the dragon. St George is a legendary warrior, saint and martyr and is the patron saint of several European cities, including Genoa and Venice. To early Christians a dragon symbolised evil and, in particular, paganism. St George was said to have fought a dragon by the seashore, outside the walls of a city, in order to rescue the king\u2019s daughter who was being offered as a sacrifice. Here, St George, dressed in armour and mounted on a horse, brandishes his sword. His lance lies already broken on the ground and one piece may be piercing the monster\u2019s neck.",
