In 1888 she joined the company of Herbert Beerbohm Tree and performed with them for five years. It was whilst working for Tree that she met her future husband Fred Terry (1863-1933) and the pair went on to act together in London and on tour for the nearly three decades. One of the most famous plays in their repetoire was The Scarlet Pimpernel in which Neilson played the role of Lady Blakeney and Terry the role of Sir Percy. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
