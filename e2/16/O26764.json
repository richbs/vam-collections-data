There are three series altogether and the 1st Series covers the Midlands area of England which includes London within Middlesex. The game was designed to educate as well as entertain. Each of the place-name cards have a picture and some interesting facts about that particular place. The game proved very popular and Jaques produced it over several decades. The pictures on the cards sometimes changed and the information certainly did. By the time this set was published the picture for London had been altered to reflect the change in shipping while the population had increased from an exact figure of 3,814,471 to a more rough estimate of 4,800,000.",
