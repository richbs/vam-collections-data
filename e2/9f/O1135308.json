The group spoofed the work of The Bee Gees, gaining a number 2 hit in Australia in 1980 with the song Meaningless Songs (in Very High Voices). They went on to produce two albums of parodies of other bands including Supertramp, Michael Jackson, David Bowie and Gary Numan. The first album, 439 Golden Greats included the subtitle Never Mind the Originals Here's The Hee Bee Gee Bees, and included artwork mimicking Jamie Reid's for the Sex Pistols album. Their photograph is included in the Jamie Reid archive as they were the first of many since to satirise his design.",
