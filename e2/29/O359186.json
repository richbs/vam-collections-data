            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThe Carrickmacross lace on this folding carriage parasol takes its name from the small town in Ireland where the technique originated. Sheer muslin is applied to a net ground, the design is drawn on to the muslin then carefully cut out avoiding the net beneath. This incredibly intricate and skilled method was taught to young girls in convents, its rarity and complexity made Carrickmacross lace extremely desirable during this period often reserved for high status use such as in wedding veils. Lace parasol covers were at their most popular in the 1860s and women's' magazines were full of patterns and thrifty recycling ideas for those who struggled to afford the material.",
