Each player must be provided with a square piece of card, with the initial of their name, to mark his or her position on the road.\nRULE II.  Each player will place their mark on the Introduction.\nRULE III.  To commence the play, let one of the company spin the tee-to-tum, and  should be Spin No. 1,  he moves from Introduction to No. 1 Heat, but on the other hand, should his number exceed that, he cannot move.  Now let the next player spin, and if it be No. 1, he arrives at Heat. It will be now necessary that in his next turn  he should spin two; that added to the one brings him to No. 3.  If he turn three the next time, he arrives at No. 6; but should he at any time spin either above or below the number required to gain the next place, he cannot move, as, in this game, he must get a sufficient number so as to visit each place on the road as, i f he arrived at the bottom of the sea by spinning one he immediately arrives at the Temple of Knowledge and wins the Game.\nNB.  Should the Game be found too long, it may be shortened by observing the following:  SUPPLEMENTARY RULE\nWhen a player spins, and the number is above that required to reach the next place on the road he may remove to the next number, but if below, he must remain in his present position, as directed in Rule III.\n\nThe booklet would have details of each stage on the road  which the players would need to read out.  Also each stage would give the directions for the next play, rewards or forfeits.  It is probable that the game was played with similar rules to those of The Overland Route to India.\n\nThe following stages are numbered and named in a plain oval with black lettering on white:-\n1,2  HEAT\n4,5 LIGHTNING\n7,8 & 10 THUNDER\n12,13 FIRE\n15 CARBON\n16 HYDROGEN\n17.
