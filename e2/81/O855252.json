Rosa was a prolific etcher but he also produced drawings and paintings. He particularly favoured subjects taken from little known and enigmatic sources, such as in the present case. Albert was the companion and the disciple of Saint William of Maleval, a Tuscan penitent of the 12th century, who withdrew in an especially horrid valley of Siena where he died in 1557.",
