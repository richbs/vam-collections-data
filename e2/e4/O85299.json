Small boxes to contain the powder were made in their thousands, with decoration varying from the most expensive ones in jewelled gold and silver, to much more modest boxes of carved or painted wood. This one is decorated in a form of painting with layers of translucent coloured varnish, known in France as vernis Martin or 'Martin's varnish'.  The Martin family was granted a monopoly on their invention of a special varnish in 1730, and this type of painting is known by their name, even when it was made long after their monopoly had expired.  The striped decoration is typical of boxes made between 1790 and 1810.  \n\nThe miniature relief was probably added no more than ten years after it was made and, although skillfully done, it was probably the work of an amateur.",
