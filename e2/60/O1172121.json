It would have been designed to display on record shop counters or walls to bring attention to the new release. \n\nLeo Sayer was a folk singer, songwriter and typographic designer from Sussex, who was discovered by the singer Adam Faith in 1971. Faith became Sayer's manager, and brought his songs to the attention of Roger Daltrey of The Who; Daltrey  recorded several of Sayer's songs himself, one of which, Giving It All Away, became his biggest hit. Sayer reached the top of the UK charts in 1973, and, although many dismissed him at the time as a one-hit wonder, he went on to have a long running chart career and a US million-seller with the song You Make Me Feel Like Dancing. Despite his career fading in the 1990s, he had a UK chart hit  with a remix of Thunder In My Heart in 2006.",
