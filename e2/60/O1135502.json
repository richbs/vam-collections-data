Originally based in Edinburgh, the firm merged with Morton Sundour Fabrics' weaving factory in Carlisle in 1931. They achieved success in the UK and US under the enlightened directorship of Alastair Morton (1910-63), who commissioned freelance designers and artists to produce work for interpretation as printed and woven fabrics. Following Alastair Morton's death, Edinburgh Weavers was taken over by Courtaulds in 1963.",

The library was used by designers within Courtaulds and was also available for the use of Courtaulds\u2019 customers. Following the acquisition of Courtaulds by the international corporation Sara Lee and the subsequent change in the business it was decided that the V&A would be the most appropriate location for the collection to enable it to be appreciated and used more fully. The Library was donated to the V&A by Sara Lee Courtaulds in 2001.\n[Furnishing fabric] From Courtaulds Design Library, group C3\n[Furnishing fabric] From Courtaulds Design Library, group D2\n[Furnishing fabric] From Courtaulds Design Library, group D2\n[Furnishing fabric] From Courtaulds Design Library, group D2\n[Furnishing fabric] From Courtaulds Design Library, group D2\n[Furnishing fabric] From Courtaulds Design Library, group D2\n[Furnishing fabric] From Courtaulds Design Library, group D2",
