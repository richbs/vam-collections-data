The antiquity of the now lost stupa is unknown but the railing appears,  on the basis of surviving donor inscriptions, to date to the second half of the 2nd century B.C.  The railings and gateways are extensively carved with reliefs depicting stories from the Buddhas previous incarnations (Jatakas) and events in the Buddhas life.  They are remarkable for the richness of genre detail which they contain.  The upper register of the coping stones are decorated with stepped merlons alternating with lotuses, the lower with a chain of hanging bells as seen in this example...................",
