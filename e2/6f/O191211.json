Visually there are discussions with management, the record company and the band as to what the sleeve is going to be and a decision is taken. With New Order, I have to decide what it's going to be, and the band leave us to get on with it. I express something that I'm interested in. This year, designing Technique, I was interested in shopping for antiques.'</i> Peter Saville (b.1955) interviewed in the PSA Tenth Anniversary supplement. <i>Music Week</i> (1990) p. 6.'",
