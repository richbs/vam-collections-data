Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a cicada.\n\nIn the early development of katabori netsuke during the 17th century, the influence of China was paramount. The next phase, from around the mid 18th century onwards, reflected a resurgence of native Japanese interests. This manifested itself not only in a preference for Japanese subjects, especially nature, but also in the increasingly naturalistic portrayal of such subjects. This netsuke features an anatomically realistic portrayal of a cicada, complete with details of its underside. The 18th century also saw netsuke carvers increasingly signing their work. This example is signed Harumitsu.",
