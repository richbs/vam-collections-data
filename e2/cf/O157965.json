He was appointed Lord of the Treasury in 1762 and was Prime Minister from 1761 to 1763, when he resigned and dedicated himself to the patronage of literature, art and science.  His generosity benefited important artistic figures such as Samuel Johnson, Tobias Smollett and the painter Allan Ramsay.  He was also a keen botanist who was instrumental in the remodelling of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. \n\nContinental artists first introduced enamel painting to England in the 17th century. But it was in the early 18th century that it became fashionable. The young German Christian Friedrich Zincke dominated the market in London. It was Zincke who trained a number of English artists, including William Prewett. Most artists working in enamel were taught by an experienced enameller. It is not known who trained Gervase Spencer this difficult art, but he later taught Henry Spicer, who in turn taught William Birch. In 1794 Birch successfully established himself in America as an enamel painter.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
