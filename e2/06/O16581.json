The pictures are unusual, both in terms of traditional miniatures and Hilliard\u2019s own work, as they are rectangular in shape and were formerly set into a diptych-style frame. This unusual format was probably the innovation of Hilliard, who was still experimenting with the miniature format at this early stage in his career. He has, however, retained the traditional way of inscribing miniatures, citing the date as \u2018Ano Dni 1576\u2019 (an abbreviation for Anno Domini, \u2018in the year of our Lord\u2019) and the age of the sitter as \u2018Aetatis Sue XXIIII\u2019 (aged 24). The face here has been retouched; the original skin tone would have been more pale.",

This one of the husband has been extensively restored, especially on the face and ruff.  Nonetheless it and its companion are rare instances in Hilliard\u2019s work or rectangular miniatures.  Reynolds\u2019 (<i>Miniatures</i>, 1952, p. 18) points out  the influence of Mor, and Pope-Hennessy that of Clouet and French court portraiture (<i>Lecture</i>, 1949, pp. 17-18) but the portrait formula could equally have been derived from Hans Eworth who was still working in the 1570s (Strong, <i>The English Icon</i>, pp. 92 (31\u2019, 94 (34) and no. 54).  The format must have been dictated by the client, presumably to create some form of diptych, oval and circular miniatures lending themselves more readily to setting in lockets of ivory boxes.  The liveliness of characterization suggests familiarity already with French portrait drawings by Clouet.  The form of \u201cs\u201d in the inscription of this and no. 59 is not repeated.\n\nIn 1864 the miniature was unattributed but identified as James Stuart, 1st Earl of Moray, and identification that cannot be sustained because of the age of the sitter.\n\nINSCRIBED: On either side of the head: AEtatis sue.
