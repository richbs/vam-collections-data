Barrie's Peter Pan (which opened at the Duke of York's Theatre, 27 December 1904) Ben's drawing was used by David Allen and Sons on the poster because of the Red Indians in Never-Never Land.  Nicholson was ten when the poster was printed but he noted in the margin the Red Indian's name Great Big Little Panther.  He was always rather cross that J.M. Barrie never paid him for his design.\n\nThis is one sheet of a multiple sheet poster and would therefore have been very large.  The other part or parts would have had the name of the production and the theatre.  This was not the only poster used to advertise the production though since another was designed by Charles Buchel showing Peter and Wendy flying to Never-Never Land.",

            "history_note": "This poster is probably the earliest printed work from a design by the painter Ben Nicholson since he did the original watercolour when he was seven years old.  The painting was of a Red Indan called Great Big Little Panther, and when William Nicholson, Ben's father, was designing the sets and costumes for the original production of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, which opened at the Duke of York's Theatre, 27 December 1904, Ben's drawing that he had done a few years before, was used by David Allen and Sons on the poster because of the Red Indians that feature in Never-Never Land.  Ben was ten when the poster was printed and he noted in the margin the Red Indian's name, and when he did the painting.\n\nThe original watercolour from which this was printed is still in the family, and the poster was presented by Ben Nicholson's daughter-in-law, Sylvie Nicholson.   She recalls her late husband saying that his father was always cross with J.M. Barrie because he never received any payment for the design.\n\nThis is one sheet of a multiple sheet poster (2 or possibly more).  The other part or parts would have had the name of the production and the theatre. In Ben Nicholson's  confusing note he writes 'The other piece of paper is the heading and the botom (sic) part of this\" which may mean there was a heading piece and a lower piece, or that the lower piece had the information which he said was 'the heading'.\n\nFrom Ben Nicholson's note 'With love from Ben to Muriel A Happy New Year 1905' it is evident that he gave this poster as a New Year present, but the donor could not identify the identity of 'Muriel'.",
