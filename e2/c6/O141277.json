The Expressionists rejected the restraints of a \u2018civilised\u2019 bourgeois modernity and its pretentious and artificial forms of art-making for a lifestyle and art which was direct, \u2018natural\u2019 and instinctual. Print-making was their preferred medium, particularly the woodcut which was celebrated for its rawness and immediacy. The subject matter and style of the Expressionists was much influenced by objects from Africa and Oceania, which the artists saw at ethnographical museums in Dresden and Berlin. These objects were admired as the products of \u2018primitive\u2019 cultures, a view considered problematic today. This woodcut by Pechstein presents the head and shoulders of a woman seen from below. The bold stylisation of the woman\u2019s face, neck and breasts reflects the influence of African sculpture. The foliage seen behind the woman adds to the exoticism of the image.",
