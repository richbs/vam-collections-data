The Acciaioli family was a very wealthy and powerful Florentine family. Angelo Acciaioli was Bishop of Aquila from 1328 to 1342 and Bishop of Florence from 1342 to 1355. In Florence he led a conspiracy against the tyrant Duca d'Atene. Acciaioli had close political connections with Naples and was appointed chancellor there in 1348. In 1355 he became Bishop of Monte Cassino.\n\nHistorical significance: Although heraldry was primarily used in a secular context, it was soon adopted by the clergy and used on ecclesiastical seals, tombs and ornament. Clergymen often combined their personal arms with symbols of their office. This particular heraldic piece promotes the bearer's lineage and ecclesiastical status. The personal arms of Bishop Angelo Acciaioli are shown with symbols of his episcopal position, the mitre and the cross. As a member of a wealthy and powerful Florentine family, Bishop Acciaioli would have wanted to promote his family connnections as well as his position in the church.",
