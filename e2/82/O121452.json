Since it is designed to make us look at Harlequin sitting on the wall from the front, it may well have been one of a pair made for mantelpiece decoration, to flank a clock.\n\nHarlequin was a character from the Italian knockabout comedy known as the Commedia dell'Arte which flourished in Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Traditionally the young lover of Columbine, his original shabby patched suit of various fabrics developed into the familiar outfit of multi-coloured diamond shapes. In Italy Arlecchino was a quick-witted but unscrupulous servant; in France he was a pretty simpleton, a languishing lover and a romantic magician; in Germany he was more of a fool but in England he became the quick-witted star of 18th century pantomime. Harlequin's lineage may have been forgotten by the time that this candlestick was created, but he was still known and appreciated for his romantic appearance.",
