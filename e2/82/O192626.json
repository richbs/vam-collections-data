The general strike had wide support from citizens all over the country.\n\nThis typographic poster created by Ivan Kr\u00e1l is based on the famous general strike slogan - \nalso one of the most important political demands of the opposition movement Civic Forum. The letters are printed in the colour red (associated with communism) with blue emerging through the centre, symbolizing the abolition of paragraph 4 from the Czechoslovak State constitution (ratified in 1960) which declared the leading role of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in the state and society:\n\n\u2018The leading power in society and in the state is the vanguard of the working class, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the voluntary fighting union of the most active and the most conscious citizens from the ranks of workers, farmers and intelligentsia\u2019.    \n\nThe Federal Assembly, reformed during an extraordinary session on the 29th of November 1989, abolished paragraph 4 of the constitution. It also abolished education in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Communist Party rule ended after 41 years. Free Elections organized in June 1990 returned Czechoslovakia to a democratic parliamentary system. \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
