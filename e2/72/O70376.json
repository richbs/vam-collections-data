In Europe in the 17th century samplers provided instruction and practice for girls learning needlework. From the 1750s, makers developed a type of sampler in which they demonstrated their darning skills. Eliza Broadhead, who worked this example, was once a pupil at the Quaker School in Ackworth, Yorkshire. Here she has used brown wool and a coarsely woven ground. This suggests that her needlework skills would be used for practical rather than decorative items.",
