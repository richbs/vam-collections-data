            "public_access_description": "This figure sits in a posture of relaxation, often called 'Royal Ease', deemed fitting for Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and royalty. The large mark between his eyebrows, the long earlobes and the headdress are all signs of his high standing and spiritual advancement. Like other depictions of Guanyin, he wears a diadem featuring the Buddha Amitabha. He looks down, with a detached air, expressing a state of meditation.",
