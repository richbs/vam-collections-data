An octagonal wooden amphitheatre, called the Rotunda, was built on the banks of the River Avon to house three days of festivities.  On the second day, 7th September, Garrick presented his 'Ode upon Dedicating a Building and Erecting a Statue to Shakespeare at Stratford upon Avon', a recitation interspersed by airs and choruses sung by female singers to music by Thomas Arne. \n\nUnfortunately for Garrick, Stratford was drenched by torrential rain. The rising River Avon threatened to flood the Rotunda and some of the celebrations had to be cancelled. Garrick lost money but was able to recoup it by re-staging his Ode in London at Drury Lane at the end of September.",
