This bust represents Huntington apparently posthumous. Benjamin Cheverton was the son of a farmer and a small landowner. During the 1820s he perfected a machine capable of producing reduced miniature versions, usually in ivory, of full-size sculptures. This had been invented by his mentor, John Isaac Hawkins, and was similar to machines devised by the engineer and inventor James Watt (1736-1819). Cheverton\u2019s machine was up and running by early 1828. He first showed products at exhibitions, and issued items which might have popular appeal, such as busts of Shakespeare or Milton. Later he took commission from owners of busts or other sculptures who desired small copies. His ivories were produced to a high standard, and he maintained that the machine itself was capable of making objects of such quality. This machine is now in the Science Museum in London. The busts were apparently finished by hand by Cheverton, as they show little trace of mechanical aid; his work shows considerable refinement and delicacy of execution.",
