This futon cover was probably part of a bride's trousseau, and would have been used on the wedding night. Its auspicious motif, that of a h\u00f4\u00f4 bird, was designed to bring good fortune to the couple in their new life together. The h\u00f4\u00f4, translated as a phoenix in English although it bears little relation to its western equivalent, represents peace and prosperity. This mythical bird is the female counterpart of the dragon, and its many feathers represent the virtues of truthfulness, propriety, righteousness, benevolence and sincerity. It is generally depicted, as here, with a paulownia tree, which, according to legend, is the only plant on which the bird will sit.",
