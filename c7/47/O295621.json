Most had a loop on the back for attachment, but in Norway and Sweden stud buttons were also used.  These were mainly worn by men, at the throat, to keep their shirts closed.  They were often decorated with filigree.  \n\nThe pattern on this stud button, of rings of coil rings and bands of wrapped wire surrounding a central knop, is very common on buttons from the late 18th century onwards.  It was used in Norway and northern Germany as well as Sweden.  This shirt stud is typical of the kind worn in the middle of the 19th century.  The marks on the back show that it was made by Johan Petter Hasselgren of Lund, in Sk\u00e5ne, in 1853.  Sk\u00e5ne province has the richest tradition of jewellery, and more was worn there than in any other district.  Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.",
