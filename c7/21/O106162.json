His father, Sir John Musters (d.1689), who almost certainly commissioned the monument, may well have known the renowned sculptor Cibber at Charles II\u2019s court, since the sculptor was \u2018carver to the kings closet\u2019, and Sir John himself had a number of court connections. \n\nCibber was one ofthe leading sculptors active in Britain in the late 17th century. A native of Denmark, he studied in Italy before arriving in England in about 1660. Details of this sculpture, such as the finely carved lace cravat and the buoyant putti, are signs of the sculptor\u2019s Continental training. The memorial was formerly in the parish church of St Mary, Hornsey, Middlesex, which was demolished and replaced by a modern church in 1969. The sculpted figurative relief is set within an elaborate framework.",
