This area of London developed after the success of the Great Exhibition of 1851. On the skyline you can see the new buildings that were being constructed for the International Exhibition of 1862. Opposite that site was the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A), which opened its doors to the public in 1857. It was already collecting and exhibiting the art of photography in 1859, when the Hawarden family moved into their new house at 5 Princes Gardens.",

Exhibition building under construction in distance. 95 x 159 mm (stereoscopic) PH 457-1968:455 Literature:  Microfilm: 3.19.370 Also:ed. F. H. W. Sheppard, Survey of London, XXXVII , The Museums Area of South Kensington and Westminster, 1975, pI. 32a. When the Hawardens moved to 5 Princes Gardens in 1859, they may have been drawn to the area by the proximity of the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) and the planned 1862 International Exhibition, which was held in the Horticultural Gardens (now the site of the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum). The angle of this photograph invites the viewer to look into the distance with Isabella Grace, towards the rising international exhibition building. The photograph was probably taken during the summer of 1861, as construction began in March 1861 and the exhibition was opened to the public in early 1862. [See Sheppard, op. cit., 141]'",
