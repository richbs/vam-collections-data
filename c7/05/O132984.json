It might have been designed for a revue, but the painted brim makes it extremely heavy and very unwieldly; heavy headdresses are usually easy to wear, being precisely balanced to stay on and make the performer move well and elegantly.  The low crown makes it extremely uncomfortable to wear and difficult to keep on.  It may have been made for a fancy dress party, when it could be happily abandoned once it had made its impact and been admired.   \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic lry villas.",
