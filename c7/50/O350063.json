This relief shows a frieze of nine putti and one infant satyr playing with two goats; two of the putti are winged. Their windswept hair and plump bodies are typical of the work of G\u00e9rard van Opstal, and although this piece is unsigned, it is so close to the documented reliefs by him in the Louvre, two of which are signed, that it must be ascribed to him, and its quality suggests it is likely to be an autograph work.\n\nG\u00e9rard van Opstal (ca. 1604 \u2013 1668) was registered as apprentice to the Brussels artist Niklaas Diodone in 1621. He later collaborated with his father-in-law, the sculptor Hans van Mildert (ca. 1588-1638) in Antwerp. At the invitation of Cardinal Richelieu, in about 1642, van Opstal moved to Paris, where he produced archietectural carvings and where he worked under Sarazin on the decorations of the Louvre and the Tuileries, and later on the H\u00f4tel Carnavalet. He specialised in low-relief friezes of mythological subjects, depicting tritons, nereids, and centaurs, for numerous palaces and hotels particuliers in and around Paris. In 1648 he helped found the Academie Royale. He was influenced by Peter Paul Rubens and Francois du Quesnoy.",
