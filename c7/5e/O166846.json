Note: there are some warp threads towards the right where the weft does not go under and over alternate threads.  This suggests there was a mistake in the tie-up.  There are also knots in the warp threads.\n\nPILE: wool; 7 colours: red, light red, yellow, light yellow, blue/green, blue, dark brown; asymmetrical knot open to the right and tied around 2 threads (although there are some jufti knots mainly in one vertical row in which the warp thread is knotted); 83 per sq. inch (1144 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: Left: one cord oversewn with red wool.  Right: cut.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: plain weave with blue/green woollen weft and decorated with a band of weft-twining in red and blue/green.  Upper: plain weave with red and then cream weft.  Immediately after the pile is a red and blue fringed knotted over 6 threads.\n\nDESIGN: Described as in use.  Field: shows evidence of red ground with blue lozenge with flowerhead decoration and small botehs.\nBorder on two sides: multi-coloured chevrons with a light red stem.\n\nLower border: red/blue chevron on red stem.\n\nOuter border: light red ground with blue and green floral sprigs.\n\nDate catalogued: 3.8.94",
