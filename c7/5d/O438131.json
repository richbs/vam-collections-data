The interior is covered with an inscription of over five hundred characters recording the speeches in which the Emperor Xiang Wang (651-619 B.C.) acknowledged the services of the Prince of Chin, Ch'ung Erh (lived 696-628 B.C.), bestowed rewards upon him, and appointed him Chief of the Feudal Princes outside the Royal Domain. This took place in the year 632 B.C.; the inscription records that the bowl was finished and inscribed on a certain day in the second month of the same year.
