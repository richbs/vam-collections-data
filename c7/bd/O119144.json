Around 1998, after reading the journals of her great-grandmother, Josephine Waggoner, she began working with Native American history, making objects such as purses, arrow slings and moccasins. These are crafted from paper, cut and stitched to shape and lacquered with shellac, or from recycled vellum printed with images copied from her great-grandmother\u2019s journals.\n\nThe decoration on this pair of moccasins includes a transfer from a rubber stamp found in a craft store. At first sight the stamp looks like handwriting but on closer inspection it turns out to be a meaningless scribble. To Allen this suggests lost history, the fate of so much Native American culture. The moccasins themselves also have significance: Allen associates the feet with \u2018moving on, letting go and rising above horror and inequity\u2019.",
