When Lord Scarsdale was equipping Kedleston in the 1760s, he made up two sets using this cistern, another and a fountain, all made by Ralph Leeke in 1698. The fountain was  copied from an earlier  Paris example of about 1660 also acquired by Scarsdale.",

In the grandest households, the pair might be en suite with an even larger wine cooler holding bottles of wine to replenish the glass after rinsing.",
