It has been relined at an unknown date.\nA label on the stretcher inscribed <i>Autumnal Sun Set engraved for the \u2018English Landscape\u2019</i> possibly records an inscription on the back of the original canvas.  \nNo. 120 [127-1888] is a sketch for the mezzotint engraving by Lucas entitled \u2018Autumnal Sunset\u2019 (S. 14) which was first proposed as a subject by Constable in September 1829, and was published in <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> in June 1832.  There are a number of variations from this sketch in the plate, of which the most conspicuous are the addition of a small tree on the right and stooks of corn in the foremost field.  These were touched in on the progress of proofs at various stages by Constable; Shirley (S.:L., p. 173) gives details.  Writing to Lucas on 2 June 1832, Constable said \u201cThe Evng [\u2018Autumnal Sunset\u2019] is spoild owing to your having fooled with the Rooks\u2014they were the chief feature\u2014which caused me to adopt the subject\u2014nobody knew what they are\u2014but took to them only for blemishes on the plate\u2014\u201c (S.:L., p. 86).  In the letter to Lucas of 15 September 1829 in which he first mentioned the subject, Constable calls it \u201cEvg, with a flight of Rookes\u201d (L. ed. S., p. 245).  Leslie in his note on the letter records that this scene is sketched in the fields near East Berholt.  The tower of Stoke Church is on the right and Langham Hill and church on the left.  These details, however, were added on the plate and are not discernible on the sketch.  Lt.-Col. C. A. Brooks takes the view to be from the end of Cemetery Lane (Vale Farm), looking towards Langham Church.  \nHolmes, p. 242, dates No. 120 [127-1888] <i>c.</i>1812.  The similarity and style and subject to Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888] and 119 [324-1888] fully justifies this dating.  In the lists of contents of the complete sets of <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> this plate is known as \u2018Sunset.  Peasants returning Homeward\u2019 (S.:L., p. 230).\nE.E. Leggatt (<i>Complete Works of David Lucas</i>, 1903, pp. 33-4) says of the plate, presumably from notes left by Lucas: \u201cIt may almost be said that Constable knew every tree in that neighbourhood by name; the large one on the left, and in the middle distance, Dunthorne and he called the \u2018wig tree\u2019, from its shape\u201d\n\nNotes on Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], 119 [324-1888], and 120 [127-1888]\n\nAnother oil sketch of the same type, \u2018Dedham Vale\u2019 in the Ashmolean Museum, is dated 13 July 1812; and an oil sketch dated 12 July 1812 was in the Staats Forbes Collection.  J. G. B\u00f6hler, <i>Constable and Rubens</i>, pp. 36 ff. discusses Nos. 115 [121-1888], 116 [146-1888], 117 [328-1888], and 120 [127-1888], and suggests that the influence of Rubens to be found in them may have been mediated through Lord Radnor\u2019s \u2018Escurial\u2019.  Constable is known to have seen this painting at some time between May and November, 1812.",
