Women frequently hooked the wires into their headdress, just behind the ear, rather than into the ear lobe itself, because of the weight.\n\nThe circular wire and hinged pendants with coral beads on this earring are characteristic of traditional earrings throughout the Slav region.  It was described as modern Turkish work, when the V&A acquired it in 1867, but was probably made in the Balkans.  As much of the Balkans was still part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, this is not a contradiction.\n\nOriginally it was part of a pair, joined by a silver chain.  A few links of this chain still remain, attached to the top of the earring.  Slav earrings are often joined together by a long chain, which hangs under the chin.  It was bought for \u00a32 3s. 4d.
