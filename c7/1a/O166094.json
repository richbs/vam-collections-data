Painting, sculpture and architecture underwent an exciting evolution. The geometric abstraction of the Cubists, Constructivists and Futurists, the linear forms of Suprematism in Russia, and the straight lines of the Dutch de-Stijl movement continued to characterize the idiom of Art Deco jewellery.  \n\nThis bracelet with its abstract design reflecting the new art movements was highly fashionable in France and very modern.   \n\nJean Dunand was born in Switzerland and studied sculpture at the Geneva School of Industrial Arts. He moved to France in 1897 and first worked as a wood carver for Jean Dampt. Whilst in Paris Dunand met a Japanese lacquerer who taught him the technique, which he developed into a distinct style of his own. He applied lacquer to vases, screens and interior designs. In 1924 Dunand began to make jewellery.",
