They were made not only in the area around Venice itself, but north to Trentino and east all around the Adriatic coast as far south as Croatia.  They were often worn, by men as well as by women, as amulets.  By the late 19th century this motif was also being used on brooches and tie pins.  The shape of the headdress on these earrings is typical of those from Friuli.  \n\nThe pearl drops may not be original.  Pendants for Italian traditional earrings were often made separately, so that the plain earrings could be worn on working days, and the extravagant and sometimes fragile pendants added only on Sundays and festivals.  However, these pearl pendants are of a totally different style and type of manufacture from the moor\u2019s head earrings, which were traditionally worn without pendants.",
