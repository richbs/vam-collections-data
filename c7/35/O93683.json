            "public_access_description": "The doll depicts Elizabeth I of England (1533-1603) as a princess, based on an anonymous portrait of her in the Royal Collections. As daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth was born in 1533 to a life of great splendour. But she lost her royal status with the end of her parents\u2019 marriage and her mother\u2019s execution in 1536. Poverty and suspicion overshadowed her childhood and adolescence, but she eventually became Queen of England in 1558. Sheila Wallace, the doll maker, felt that in some ways Elizabeth symbolised the doubts and problems faced by the young of any century, and wished to show her as a girl with a turbulent and unknown future.",
