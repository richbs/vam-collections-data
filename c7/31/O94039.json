On the lowest there is an undulating stem with tendril offsets each bearing four pipal leaves, that is carved in fairly low relief in a broad band.  A more deeply carved register is bordered at the bottom and at the top by narrow mouldings of leaf motifs and saw tooth decoration respectively.  The band in deeper relief has a row of four indo-iranian ( sometimes referred to as Persepolitan) columns between which there are <i>caitya</i> arches  from the volutes of which hang bunches of some form of fruits either side of plain battered projecting bases. Within these arches are standing male figures in a variety of frontal poses which are now all in a variety of abraded conditions.\n      The panel is curved and the two ends of the top side have square cramp mortices. The mortice on the upper right hand side pierces through the top fillet adjacent to the capital of the right hand pilaster, the abacus of which obtrudes half way across the square-sectioned mortice hole, which is therefore L-shaped in section. The rear of the panel has lines of roughly vertically slanting chisel marks over the left portion with an off-centre pin-hole at the right hand edge of these marks. The stone slab is deeper on the chiselled portion which tapers slightly over the smoother opposite part.  A fissure runs down the right side at the back to the thicker base.",
