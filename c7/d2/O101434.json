His early work reflects the style of the artist and illustrator Charles Rickets (1866-1931). During the early twentieth century Philpot became popular as a portrait artist. Always concerned that his style would become stale he chose different poses and techniques for these works. Constantly dissatisfied with his work, Philpot travelled to different places including Paris, North Africa and Venice. The portraits that Philpot is best known for present a cross-section of early twentieth century, from his portraits of admirals during the First World War to the portraits of dancers from the Ballet Russes of the 1920s. \n\nFine pencil lines are used to create shading and the sense of movement in this study of a man turned looking up.  The drawing has been set within a frame drawn in two pencil lines by the artist with the title \"Study of a Head\" written in pencil in the bottom right corner of the page. This early drawing by the artist was possibly executed whilst he was studying at Lambeth School.",
