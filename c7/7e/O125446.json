This represents Prince Albert (1819-1861), or Albert Francis Charles Augustus Emmanuel, the second son of Ernest, duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and the consort of Queen Victoria, whose contribution to the monarchy was considerable and whose death from typhoid fever left Queen Victoria inconsolable. \n\nThe earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of  Queen Victoria (1819-1901).  Images of royalty proved a lucrative market and during the 1840s there were countless other royal figures issued by Staffordshire pottery firms, celebrating for example her marriage to Prince Albert in 1840, and the birth of the royal children. Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.",
