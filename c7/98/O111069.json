This necklace is part of a series of necklaces entitled 'Garlands' (in Dutch 'Guirlandes') which evoke the decorative garlands of architectural ornament. The decorative elements here resemble old gnarled roots rather than flowers and foliage, and the influence of nature is countered by the minimal black cable with its references to technology and electricity.  Nijland frequently works in glass, exploring its great versatility and the unexpectedly soft effects that it can create.\n\nHe explained his love of glass thus: \u2018I consider glass to be a noble material. It is in fact a \u2018non\u2019 material, because of its transparency and ability to freeze a movement. I love its contradictory nature; often it looks soft, while actually being hard. By combining materials, adding colours or treating the surface in different ways, I can change its character. It is a great challenge to give it a soul.\u2019",
