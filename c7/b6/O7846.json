The great hall was the usual setting for such displays, since it was here that the medieval lord feasted with his household and guests. These eye-catching decorations not only advertised his wealth, but also proclaimed his lineage and social alliances.\n\nPlace\nThis is one of a series of coats of arms relating the history of the Beaupr\u00e9 family. It is thought to have been commissioned for Beaupr\u00e9 Hall near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, by Sir Robert Bell. The majority of this series of  windows seem to date from the completion of a new great hall which Bell commissioned in around 1570. They were eventually moved from their original location and cut down to fit narrower lights.\n\nPeople\nSir Robert Bell was a prominent figure who married Dorothy Beaupr\u00e9, the sole heiress of her line, in 1559 and succeeded to the estate following the death of his father-in-law, Edmund, in 1567. This shield depicts the arms of Bell himself - 'Knight Lord Chiefe Baron of the Eschequer'. It was evidently a subsequent addition to the Beaupr\u00e9 series, dating from around 1577 when Bell fell victim of a 'pestilential vapour at the Oxford Assizes' and died. Unlike other examples of his arms in this series, this window seems to have been preserved intact. The Gothic helmet, crest (a falcon) and the border of his shield are almost totally authentic.",
