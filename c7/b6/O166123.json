Combs for secular use and decorated with classical Renaissance ornament were produced in considerable numbers for the growing market for luxury items. Such combs were also made in other materials such as boxwood, probably by the same workshops. Earlier references to the guilds to which these makers belonged suggest they were organised according to the type of object produced, the producers of secular items in ivory operating separately from those carving devotional figures.\nIvory combs, together with mirror cases and gravoirs for parting the hair, formed an essential part of the trousse de toilette or \u00e9tui (dressing case) of the typical wealthy lady or gentleman in the period. The two leading cities for ivory carving were Paris and Dieppe. Luxury items, such as combs were often made in Paris, especially during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During the seventeenth century Dieppe became increasingly significant for small-scale sculpture in ivory, perhaps because it was a port.",
