The joint blocks at the front of the chair and at the top of the back uprights are carved with flower heads and foliage. The uprights have small, turned finials.  The arms are down-curving, terminating in scrolls with light foliate carving.  The caning has been replaced and a section at the inner edge of the left (PR) rail of the back replaced.  An area of the front seat rail has been reinforced with a new section at the back, close to the left(PR) front leg.",

            "public_access_description": "The idea of using interwoven strips of rattan cane to make the seats and backs of chairs was a novelty of the 1660s which immediately caught on. The idea and the material both originated in Asia. Cane seats and backs made chairs much lighter than conventional upholstery and within a few years the new form of seating became extremely popular, creating a threat to both the makers of woollen cloth and the upholsterers. The older trades presented petitions to parliament but could not stop the rise of the new trade. Tens of thousands of caned chairs were produced each year, chiefly in London, and many of them were exported. This chair, with its spiral-turned legs, back uprights and stretchers, is a version of what became the standard form in the 1680s. Sometimes the decoration of the cresting at the top of the back centred on a crown held by two small boys, but here the cresting centres on a shell.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
