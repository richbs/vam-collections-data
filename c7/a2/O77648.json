Wall coverings embroidered in wool on a canvas ground were made to be both free hanging and more commonly, in the later 17th century, to be stretched on wooden frames and fitted to the wall around the sides of a room. That was probably the case with these panels.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe six panels in the Museum's collection each show a different central creature, a horse, lion, camel, unicorn, elephant and this dragon. Two further hangings in a private collection have the same horse and lion, but we do not know whether they were originally hung together as part of the same series, or just came from the same workshop. The design of the group of panels combines the Baroque style of classical columns, with the exuberant foliage and animal life which is typical of 17th-century English embroidery.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe embroidery is worked in a wide range of stitches, including tent, cross, brick and Rococo stitches, couched work and French knots. The panels would have been made in a professional workshop.",
