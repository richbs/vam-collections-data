The maker, Lorenzo Lavy, was a goldsmith and medallist from Turin who trained in Paris. His work, in the latest Parisian style, is typical of silver produced for the court of the Duchy of Savoy.\n\nThe Duchy of Savoy was represented in London by the Sardinian embassy in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields. The embassy chapel, with seven chaplains, was one of the most prestigious in London, and its services were open to the public. The survival of this altar service is a unique reminder of an openly practised form of Catholicism, from a time when the faith was severely restricted in England.",
