Although it looks like a conventional side table, when the top is raised it becomes a moveable stand with three shelves or a dinner wagon, like a modern trolley. Rectangular stands with castors and shelves were developed in the 1830s and were sometimes called 'running footmen'. These dinner wagons were very useful for Victorian homes, particularly for serving meals in a small room where there was not enough room for a sideboard. William Smee & Sons, a prominent firm of furniture manufacturers in London, published catalogues of their stock in the 1850s including two alternative designs for similar dinner wagons.",
