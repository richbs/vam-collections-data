            "public_access_description": "This design was probably created by Leon Sault, possibly for Charles Frederick Worth. Although Worth principally designed for women, he was known to occasionally create fancy dress and masquerade costumes for men too.  It probably represents Bacchus, the Ancient Roman god of wine, or his Greek equivalent Dionysus, sitting astride a decorated barrel wearing a wine-coloured velvet tunic trimmed with red grapes and vine leaves. To emphasise the theme, the figure is shown holding a wine glass. L\u00e9on Sault was a fashion and theatre designer and illustrator who later became a magazine editor, publishing some of his fancy dress costume designs as part of a series titled \"L'Art du Travestissment\" (The Art of Fancy Dress). His designs included characters such as Mephistopheles and embodiments of concepts such as Astronomy.\n\nDuring the 1860s, Empress Eugenie of France threw a number of extravagant masquerade balls which required the guests to wear elaborate and inventive costumes that were made up by Worth and other Paris dressmakers. Worth, a relative newcomer, became the Empress's favoured couturier at the end of the 1850s. This made him extremely fashionable, and the rest of the ladies of Eugenie's court also bought gowns from him - and so too did their husbands' mistresses, and anyone wealthy enough to afford Worth's very high prices. As a result, Worth was under great pressure to produce vast numbers of unique, one of a kind costumes and gowns, often at very short notice. This is one of a large number of similar designs and sketches that were given to the V&A as part of the archive and reference collection of the House of Worth, making it extremely likely that it was originally designed for a guest to wear to one of the Empress's magnificent balls.",
