The outfit reflected a style of dress worn by UK Rastafarian women in the 1980s.\n\nThe Rastafarian movement started in Jamaica in the 1930s. Working-class Jamaicans were inspired by the anti-colonial teachings of Marcus Garvey, who sought an \u2018Africa for the Africans\u2019, and by the coronation of the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie (Ras Tafari Makonnen). Followers of the movement rejected the trappings of western modernity. They wore clothes made of natural fibres and allowed their hair to form dreadlocks. \n\nThis Rastafarian woman\u2019s outfit reflects the Afrocentrism of the movement. The batik textiles were originally printed in Indonesia before being produced in the UK for export to West Africa as well as for domestic consumption.",
