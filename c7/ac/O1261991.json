Suddenly I hear music in the air. My footsteps halt, my spirit is enlivened. Such a tiny skylark. High, high above, touches the skin of the cloud. Turning round a hundred times its reed-like tongue, It does not depend on any pipe or string. Its clear tones drop like little broken jades. Drunk with its song it enjoys itself loftily. But who are the companions of this immortal ? THe tuneful notes of the thurush must be considered; The cuckoo's call, With the blackbird's gossipings blend in one. And then there are the cheep-cheep sparrows, Hopping up and down through the young twigs. Many grasses and weeds dance to welcome the wind; The flowers vie in charm with one another. I stand in smiling contemplation, As if intoxicated, maybe looking foolish, While nature thus reveals her wonders. I know no joy better than this! For the nonce I foget my weary, worrying body And feel removed from all material care. Others may not understand my rapture. Why should I mind ? Life is a dream, Its past is over and done, There is no need to guess about its future, Now is the time, not late, to enjoy myself.",
