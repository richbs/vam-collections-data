As in Britain, naturalistic floral designs and designs with trompe l'oeil (\u2018trick of the eye\u2019, an illusion) architectural features were very popular. However, this was exactly the kind of wallpaper pattern that dominated the displays of wallpaper manufacture at the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851. Such wallpapers appalled the design critics, who argued instead that they should be composed of flat and unassertive patterns.",
