One says 'Souvenir, 1919'.\nOne snake has been beaded to show several flags, French, British, Belgian, Romanian, German, Turkish and repeats the usual inscription in the Arabic script.\nOne snake is eating a baby lizard.\n\nOther items in the IWM include beaded purses, necklaces, a three-dimensional lizard and a bag with the prisoner's name and number and the date 1919. Their record cards suggest some were made in Egypt and the V&A has seen one with the word 'Kut' from Mesopotamia. One snake (inventory number EPH792) is broken and shows that the interior is made from loose threads and rags. The beading was probably done with a needle starting at the tail - the beads are not sewn on separately but are integral to the fabric.\n\nThe type of beads used vary little and the yellow cotton and the way of forming the head and mouth are consistently the same, but the patterns, colours and sizes vary enormously.",
