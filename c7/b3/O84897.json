He was billed as \u2018The Prime Minister of Mirth, England\u2019s Inimitable Comedian\u2019, and performed four songs. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nGeorge Robey (1869\u20131954) was one of Britain\u2019s most successful music hall comedians, a master of comic songs, caricatures and sketches. He made his first appearance on the London stage at the Aquarium in 1891. After appearing at the Oxford Music Hall in London the same year, he was engaged for most of the leading halls in London. His \u2018trademark\u2019 stage appearance consisted of enormous black eyebrows and a bowler hat. He had a special talent for making audiences cry with laughter just by coming on stage and looking at them quizzically. When he appeared at Hanley the previous year he was paid the enormous sum of \u00a3150 for the week.",

He made his first appearance on the stage at the Aquarium in 1891 and after appearing at the Oxford in the same year, was on the bill at all the leading music halls in London. He specialised in comic songs, sung in character, and elaborate character studies including 'The Chinese Laundry Man', 1900, and 'A Prehistoric Man', 1902. He was knighted in 1954, only the second music hall performer after Harry Lauder to receive such an honour. This caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
