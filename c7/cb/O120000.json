The two glass ampoules of semi-globular shape are lashed around the waist with textile (apparently silk, now degraded) and thread. The ivory frame consists of two turned discs with a series of shallow mouldings, joined by five turned balusters, presumed to be glued in place. Between the balusters, fitted to the inside of each disc, are five turned finials (2 of which are missing). Aligned with the finials, and positioned on the outside of each disc are 5 hemi-spherical 'buttons serving as low feet.Three rounded ivory knobs  are set into the outer faces of the top and bottom discs, serving as low feet. The glass contains orangy-red particles which no longer run freely.",

They are often illustrated in scholars' studies where they served meditation, or simply helped judge the time of day.\n\nSandglasses in this period were constructed from two matching glass ampoules sealed (often with wax or pitch) and bound with fabric at the joint. The 'sand' was usually a material less sensitive to moisture such as powdered metal, rock or eggshell.\n\nIt has not been possible to time the duration of this sandglass as the particles no longer run freely.",
