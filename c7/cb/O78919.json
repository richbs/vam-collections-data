            "physical_description": "Five wool embroidered satin panels forming a large, folding, gilt framed screen.\n\nThe ground of each panel is a coarse, warp faced dull gold satin with a brown cotton weft. Flat stitch embroidery is carried out in crewel wools, mainly in long and short, chain, twisted chain, satin, stem, couching and running stitches with the occasional French knot and more complex filling. The overall colour impression is of a rich brown, gold and silver with details in numerous colours and shades including yellow, red, pink, green, blue, cream and white.\n\nThe design is derived from grotesque ornament. Common to each panel is a central pillar enclosed by large floral and foliate arabesques and cornucopias on which various creatures (confronted or addorsed regardant) perch. The pillars on panels one, three and five are of a simple, almost Doric-like order wound with snakes and born on the backs of three squatting frogs or toads. The second and fourth screen panels have more florid Corinthian-like columns. There are slight variations in detail, but all pillars are broken at intervals by basins filled with pineapples, pomegranates and other fruits.\n\nAlong the bottom of each panel are lines in ancient Greek from Theocritus (Idyll XV, lines 78-83) in brown crewel wool couching on narrow strips of natural linen applied to the satin ground.\n\nThe panels are edged by glued on white silk braid, doubled at the top and bottom of each panel. The second, third, fourth and fifth screen panels have crimson silk repp linings. \n[Screen panel] First screen panel with a central pillar and, from top to bottom, a pair of doves on the wing with laurel leaves in their beaks confronted about a basket of fruit. Below are thrushes and underneath is a cock, pheasant, two parrots, the god pan facing a monkey, two snipes and, at the base, a pair of confronted swans.\n[Screen panel] Second screen panel with a central pillar topped by a winged cupid standing on a globe, balancing a vase of its head with one hand and holding a torch in the other. Beneath, in descending order, are a peacock and monkey, two parrots, a monkey and a peacock and, finally, a cat preparing to leap up at a robin, watched by a peahen.\n[Screen panel] Third screen panel with a pillar terminating in a flaming bowl over which a pair of snakes confront each other whilst, at each side, doves bearing laurel leaves, as in the fist panel, hover. Below this a cock and peacock, a pair of birds, a peacock and a pheasant, two birds and a swan facing a mermaid and dolphin.\n[Screen panel] Fourth screen panel with the same design as the second screen panel in reverse.\n[Screen panel] Fifth screen panel with the same design as the first screen panel in reverse.",

            "public_access_description": "This type of screen, made up of embroidered panels, was usually intended to be used as a decorative room divider. This unique example, however, was embroidered as a grand exhibition piece to show off the skills of the designer and embroiderers. The original five panels of this screen represent the four Elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. The complex composition inspired by historical designs is one that appealed to Walter Crane (1845-1915), who designed the panels. A similar arrangement can be seen in his wallpaper and border designs 'Peacock' and 'Amorini' which were printed by Jeffrye & Co. in 1878.\n\nThis screen was probably exhibited as part of the Royal School of Art Needlework's section at the Philadelphia Exposition in the USA of 1876. The British work shown there, and especially the Royal School's contribution, made a very strong impact on American audiences. It is now seen as one of the formative influences on American Arts and Crafts design. Crane produced many designs for the Royal School of Art Needlework, which was founded in 1872. It is likely that he was, for a time, under contract to the School.",
