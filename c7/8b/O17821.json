In Paris, he then entered the atelier of the history painter Paul Delaroche (1797-1856). He first specialised in portraiture and then moved towards the naturalistic style with peasant scenes for which he became best known. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Millet's peasants scenes for which he is best known. It depicts two men sawing a large trunk while another is chopping trees in the background. Although considered as a member of the Barbizon school for its technical approach of the rendering of light and colours, Millet favoured figures paintings to landscapes. His rural scenes are taken for the contemporary reality and are often interpreted as a reaction against a society that was becoming more and more bourgeois thanks to the industrial revolution.",

He went to Paris in 1837, where he was a pupil of Paul Delaroche, and for the next ten years painted mainly portraits and <i>scenes galantes</i> in the manner of Diaz. At about the time of the Revolution of 1848, he turned increasingly to painting rural scenes; in 1849 he moved to Barbizon, where he became a close friend of Theodore Rousseau, and where he remained for the rest of his life. Although attacked for his concentration on peasant subjects, he won increasing public recognition in the 1860s, and was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1868. \n\nLit. E.

Phillips, 1923) but the suggestion, never very convincing, that the painting is in fact by Daumier and not by Millet has been dismissed by the most recent authority (Herbert, 1962). \nMillet came under the strong influence of Daumier when he began seriously painting rural genre scenes in the years 1846-52 and <i>The Wood Sawyers</i> is one of his early masterpieces in this field. It may be placed not long after the various versions of <i>The Sower</i>, painted in 1850 (Herbert, <i>Barbizon revisited</i>, p. 150, no. 62). \nThe preparatory study in black chalk for this composition in the Mus\u00e9e Bonnat, Bayonne, has been dated c. 1850-51 (Herbert, 1962). Two further studies probably related to this composition were exhibited at the Leicester Galleries in November 1921 (nos. 94 & 98). There are two other versions in oils: (I) private collection, Paris, showing two figures instead of three, and the log sawn at one point only; (2) whereabouts unknown (authenticity in dispute), repr. <i>Der Kunstwanderer</i>, 1928, p. 75, exh. Beaux Arts Gallery, 1949, closer to (I) in that it shows only two figures, but the log is sawn, at three points as in the V. & A. picture. In view of the fact that the V. & A. picture is only one with the third figure in the background, it seems likely that it is the final version. It may be dated c. 1850-52. \n\nCondition.

His emigration to Paris was as typical of his kind as his subsequent feelings of isolation. His experiments with different styles illustrate his search to convey experience which was at once personal and universal. <i>The Wood Sawyers</i> cannot date from much earlier or much later than his move to Barbizon in 1849, the village on the edge of the forest of Fontainebleau which was to become the focal point of a landscape group. Even before then he had been inspired by the activities of the Paris <i>banlieu</i>, the semi-rural, semi-urban life of peasant migrants with whom he could so closely identify. At the same time he began to base his drawings on the direct observation of unposed models. A study for this picture illustrates Millet's efforts to make his image of the man's violent action really convincing, to find a creative parallel to the real world. \n\n<i>The Wood Sawyers</i> is an energetic presentation of physical labour, using strong contrasts of light and shade to dramatize the exertion. Detail is sacrificed to the overall silhouette. <i>The Athenaeum</i> in 1896 remarked that 'the exaggerated disproportions of the figures are such as actually to assist in intensifying the expressiveness of their attitudes'. Millet himself declared 'They say that one does see handsome peasants ... but their beauty resides not in their faces\u2026 it emanates from the total effect of a figure and its actions\u2026 Beauty is expression'. His use of colour is daring, as we see in the intense blue of the breeches of the nearer sawyer. \nThat feature, and the picture's sustained force of rhythm, links Millet with his contemporary Daumier, to whom it was once ascribed. Both artists manage to combine immediacy with mythic power. Whilst the left-hand sawyer is compressed to convey the effect of drawing the saw through the log, the weight of the right-hand figures is balanced on a pyramid of his solidly braced legs; and his form, which echoes Michelangelo, links <i>The Wood Sawyers</i> with the emergence of an 'epic naturalism' in Millet's work of the 1850s, exemplified by the explosive, heroic, almost sacred figure of <i>The Sower</i>. Millet made his mission to depict the rhythms of the peasant's life in relation to the cycles and seasons of the earth: his achievement lies in the expression of the peasant's toilsome experience, of the interdependence and mutual expressiveness of Man and Nature.\n\nMartin Kauffmann\u201d\nC.

            "history_note": "Most likely the same as the painting titled <i>Wood cutters in a French forest</i> shown at the in London June 1871 at the \u2018Second\u2026Exhibition of \u2026 The Society of French Artists\u2019 organised by the dealer Durand-Ruel; probably bought from Durand-Ruel by the Scottish art critic W.E. Henley around that time; probably sold directly to Constantine Alexander Ionides with whom Henley was acquainted (cf. letter from Henley to Ionides, 13.06.1883, NAL :86.ZZ.182, MSL/2006/132). Ionides had purchased CAI.47 by November 1881, when it is listed in the inventory of his collection (private collection), with a valuation of \u00a31200; bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\n\nIn 1881, W. E. Henley wrote <u>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet: twenty etchings and woodcuts reproduced in fac-simile and a biographical notice</u> in which this painting surprisingly does not figure. Henley was also the author of the catalogue of the <i>French and Dutch Loan Collection</i> exhibition at the Edinburgh International Exhibition of 1886.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Millet\u2019s peasant scenes executed in a free, broad technique characteristic of the Barbizon school. The present painting depicts two wood sawyers seen from the back while a strong contrast of light and shade emphasizes the strain of the figures to cut the wood while a third figure chops trees in the background.\nThere are two preparatory drawings in black chalk for this composition: one is in the Mus\u00e9e Bonnat, Bayonne, dated 1850-1 (Herbert, 1962) and another in Plymouth City Art Gallery. Two further studies possibly related were exhibited at the Leicester Galleries in November 1921 (nos. 94 & 98). According to Kauffmann (p.74), there are possibly two other versions: one is in a private collection, Paris whereas the other\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown (authenticity disputed \u2013 see <i>Der Kunstwanderer</i>, 1928, p. 75 illus.). \nMillet seems to have painted this vigorous scene soon after he moved to Barbizon, a village near the forest of Fontainebleau, which attracted a number of artists painting in a broad naturalistic style. The intense colours put this painting close to Honor\u00e9 Daumier\u2019s oeuvre, for which it has been mistaken once (M. Gobin, oral opinion, 1936). \nThree colours dominate the earthen palette: the intense blue of the near sawyer\u2019s trousers, his brilliant white shirt and the red of the third figure in the background. This colour scheme combined with the emphasis put on the strain of the figures may convey a political meaning. For instance, the <i>Winnover</i>, The National Gallery, London, exhibited at the Salon in 1848, has been interpreted as an allusion to the Revolution of February that year through the colours worn by the figure, blue, white and red, and the subject matter, separating the grain from the chaff. \nX-ray photography shows that the scene was painted over an earlier composition, most likely the lost oil sketch for <i>The Republic</i>, unsuccessfully submitted by Millet at a French state competition in 1848. Around this time, Millet made two other sketches entitled <i>L\u2019Egalit\u00e9</i> and <i>La Fraternit\u00e9</i> stylistically compatible with the underlying composition. \nWhether this picture was a rural interpretation of a former political composition or not remains uncertain but the peasant scenes <i>in se</i> were not exempt of a certain socio-political connotation. The Barbizon members as well as the Realist painters and their critics did not hide their preference for anti-bourgeois subject matters and reaction against the tradition. Millet\u2019s art was highly influential on both technique and subject matters of the next generation of artists including the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a \u2018Manifesto of Realism\u2019, entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
