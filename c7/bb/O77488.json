The mirror glass reflects the candlelight to increase the volume of light. Earlier sconces had metal backplates which also reflected artificial light. Here, the girandole frame has become a vehicle for elaborate Rococo carving, with flowers, leaves, bullrushes and birds (cranes). The gilded carved surfaces also reflect candlelight.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis mirror is very similar to designs for glass frames published by Thomas Chippendale (1718-1779) in the third edition of The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director (1762) as plates 167 and 168. Exotic crane-like birds also feature in his design for 'girendoles', plate 178, which is dated 1760. Chippendale engaged a team of engravers to prepare his designs for publication, thus each of these three by him was engraved by a different hand (W. Foster, M. Darly and B. Clowes).\n\nMaterials & Making\nLarge sheets of plate glass were imported from France at this date. The complex design of this mirror incorporates both smaller and larger sections of glass. For the smaller sections, offcuts from larger pieces could be used, thus making the most of this expensive material.",
