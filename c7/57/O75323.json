A group of ten such subjects in bronzed plaster that were formerly at Kirkleatham Hall, Yorkshire, are now owned by the Castle Museum, York (they are on permanent loan to York City Art Gallery). They comprise five poets (Homer, Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, John Milton and Pope), two painters (Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck), an architect and designer (Inigo Jones), a scientist (Isaac Newton) and a philosopher (John Locke). Given the strong literary bias of this group, they were probably intended for display in a private library. The V&A also has a lead figure of Edmund Spenser that is ascribed to John Cheere (inv. no. A3-1955).\n\nJohn Cheere (1709-1787) is the younger brother of the sculptor Sir Henry Cheere and was apprenticed to a haberdasher for a period of seven years from 1725, but later joined his brother's studio. He is most noted for the production of lead figures, which he executed at his own studio at Hyde Park Corner from 1737. Cheere seems to have taken over the yard previously occupied by the Nost family. He also produced plaster figures and busts of eminent contemporaries, including those made for the Turner family at Kirkleatham.",
