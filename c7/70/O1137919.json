The first film of George Lucas' trilogies was the most successful in American history and grossed over $290 million. Sequels released in 1980 and 1983 were equally successful. The films captured their imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and toy guns were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nEpisode 2: Attack of the Clones is a 2002 space opera film directed by George Lucas. It was released on May 16th of that year and was set ten years after the previous film, The Phantom Menace. The Tusken Raider can also be known as 'Sand People'. They are dangerous savages who live on the planet Tatooine.",
