Afterwards, the reception was held in the Regent Suite at the Great Central Hotel, on Marylebone Road, London, from 3.30pm to 8.30pm\n\nAccording to the donor of another Aida Woolf designed wedding dress in the collection, the dressmaker was an extremely high-class and exclusive London couturier of the period and a rival of Reville and Rossiter, who made the Princess Royal's wedding dress. Woolf's clientele, many of whom were renowned for their sense of fashion, insisted on absolute exclusiveness of design. This precluded any publication in contemporary fashion magazines of Aida Woolf designs. This lack of documentation and media attention has meant that Aida Woolf has become largely forgotten, although in her day she was clearly highly regarded by her clientele.\n\nAida Woolf was born in 1886 in Mile End, London, the daughter of Emmanuel Wolf, a commercial traveller. and Sarah Wolf. The family, with Aida and two younger children. lived in 70 Lincoln Street, London, in 1891. On the 1891 census her name is spelled Ada Wolf. In 1901 Woolf was an apprentice dressmaker in Hackney who lived at home. She married a Mr. Benjamin in 1914 in St Marylebone",
