The gesture underscores the role of the bodhisattva as the supreme expression of the Mahayana Buddhist concept of the compassionate saviour. (Bodhisattava is the name given to one on the path towards becoming a buddha.)\n\nThe figure is flanked by a lotus stem and flower asserting his dual title as Padmapani, the \u2018Lotus-bearer\u2019. He wears a three-pointed crown (\u2018mukuta\u2019) in the centre of which is the figure of Amitabha, the Buddha of Eternal Light and his spiritual mentor. An antelope skin (\u2018mrigajma\u2019), Avalokitesvara\u2019s principal attribute, is tied firmly across his chest. \n\nSeveral features reflect stylistic conventions that were part of the tradition of the Gupta period (320-about 540 AD) tradition that were well-preserved in Kashmir. These include the conventional folds of the figure\u2019s neck (\u2018kombu-griva\u2019), the flexed torso and masterfully modelled pleats of the waist-skirt.\n\nThe dating of Kashmir Buddhist sculpture is problematic, but this example has a close stylistic correspondence with one of the few dated Kashmiri bronzes. In this instance it is the Sugatisandarsana Lokesvara, which was dedicated during the reign of Queen Didda (980-1003).",
