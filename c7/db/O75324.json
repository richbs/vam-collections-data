Similar plaques may be found in a chimneypiece at Bretton Hall, near Wakefield, Yorkshire, and in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Merseyside. A closely related marble relief also acquired by the V&A from the Jones collection, originally attributed to Joseph Nollekens, has recently been re-attributed to Sir Henry Cheere or Collins (inv. no. 1176-1882). Collins served his apprenticeship under Cheere, and later became well known for his chimneypiece reliefs.",
