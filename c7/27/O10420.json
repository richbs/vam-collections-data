It may be an example of a printed type of camlet  described as 'paragon' in contemporary accounts. It was probably woven in Norwich, Norfolk, and may have been printed in London. Camlets were used for a wide variety of furnishings, including wall hangings, bed hangings, window curtains and upholstery.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAfter weaving, worsted furnishings could be decorated in various ways. The process of 'watering' involved crushing the fabric so that the ribbed weave reflected the light unevenly, producing a wavy pattern. The fabric could also be given a self-coloured pattern by pressing it with hot plates against a wooden block carved with a design in imitation of woven damask. A third method involved printing in a contrasting colour, as in this case, and this fabric has also had its surface glazed.\n\n Design & Designing\nThe stylised floral design here, with the fillings of flowers and leaves related to patterns in contemporary crewel-wool embroidered furnishings. It is now faded. It is stronger on the back, through to which the printing dye penetrated, and the bold original effect of the pattern is clearly evident.",

The condition was so poor that the worsted was removed with the best bits salvaged to be newly hung in another smaller room. The only worsted remaining in its original place is on the door to the original room (the Red Room), very faded, held by copper studs.",
