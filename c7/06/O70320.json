            "physical_description": "The Virgin, wearing a gown and a cloak, with a crown over a veil, sits on the left of the panel under an embattled and turreted canopy, with two cushions behind her; she is looking down at the Christ Child whom she holds on her lap. He leans against her, with his left leg bent and his right leg stretched out. He wears a skirt-like garment and rests his left hand on a cup held in the right hand of the bearded king Gaspar. The king wears a short belted gown, a cloak and a hood, and kneels on his right knee, holding a crown in his left hand. The crowned and beardless figure of the king Balthasar, wearing a long gown gathered at the waist and a tippet, stands behind him in the top right of the panel, holding a cup in his left hand and pointing upwards with his right. His head is turned to the left of the panel to the crowned and bearded figure of the king Melchior. He wears a gown and cloak and carries an oblong box in his left hand; and with his right he points to a circle carved on the centre of the canopy, which doubtless originally bore a painted star. St. Joseph, bearded and wearing a gown and hood, sits asleep in a chair in the bottom left of the panel, resting his head on his right hand and holding a cross-staff with a pointed end between his knees with his left hand. The heads of the ox and the ass, looking almost identical, are shown feeding from a manger next to him. Remarkably, there are carved haloes behind the heads of Melchior and Balthasar, although none behind the head of the Virgin.\n\nThe top of the panel is chipped. The head of one of the animals is damaged. The Child's right hand is damaged. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain at the bottom of the panel. Traces of red paint are on folds of the garments of the figures and on the two haloes. The hair and beards of two of the Magi and of St. Joseph are painted black. The back of the panel is marked with two horizontal scratches. There are four lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",
