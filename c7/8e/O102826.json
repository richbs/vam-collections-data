            "history_note": "The print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

            "historical_context_note": "In the 18th century, dancing was a necessary social accomplishment and dancing masters could be found in many European towns and cities.  They were not necessarily native to that town or even country.  The verse on the print satirises such a well-travelled dancing master, who has absorbed phrases from France and Germany. Dancers, teachers and choreographers have always been itinerant, working throughout the world and the tradition of the ballet master mixing languages in class has a basis in fact, as well as being kept alive in film and fiction.",
