The traditionally polished surface of gold was no longer fashionable, and instead jewellers played with flame and heat to create new textures and surface finishes. \n\nMinerals and gemstones were integrated in unique and often asymmetrical cuts. Inexpensive materials were combined with precious metals. The value of a piece of jewellery lay in the imagination of the creator rather than the materials used.\n\nHubert Taylor Rose was a self-taught jeweller, who remained an amateur. It has been said that the idea of  making jewellery was given to him by an Italian diplomat. In the fifties he then took some evening classes in jewellery making at the Central School of Art in London. The simplicity of his work goes back to his admiration for Bauhaus designs. Some of his pieces are kept today in the collection of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, in London.",
