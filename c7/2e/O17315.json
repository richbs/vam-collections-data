The large elongated oval shape of this miniature was never repeated in Hilliard's work and must relate to the now unknown purpose of the object.  Possibly it was incorporated into an expensive object such as a looking-glass.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nElizabeth was the heart of government and the focus of power in England.  As a woman ruler she encouraged a unique court culture, exerting her authority through elaborate rituals of courtship with her male courtiers.  This role-playing reached a pitch at the Accession Day ceremonial jousts at which the Queen received the homage of her knights. Each courtier presented her with a shield bearing an 'impressa', a combination of picture and motto 'borne by noble personages.to notify some particular conceit', usually  their devotion to the Queen. This culture is reflected in this portrait of a young courtier.  He wears the Queen's colours, black and white, and is surrounded by the eglantine rose, a symbol of the Queen.\n\n The Sitter\nIt has been suggested that this unknown young man is Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, the Queen's young favourite.  At this date he was about 30 years younger than the Queen he pays homage to, hand on heart.",

Thus, the <i>Young Man</i> has been wishfully the image of Mr W H, a wonderful complex summary of the Age of Shakespeare: its embodiment perhaps even if not its only begetter. It is a protean form that might be Sidney \nor Marlow at one moment, or a free androgynous figment of 20th-century imagination like Orlando, and in that role the aptest manifestation of our Elizabethan fantasies. \n\nWe now believe, as it seems on hard rational grounds, that the portrait is of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. As a miniature it fits into an exceptional series of full length works painted by Hilliard between 1585 and 1595, all of first rate court magnates with an interest in commissioning portraits of peculiar splendour, all of them young men who were very close to their sovereign, and the main proponents of her <i>ethos</i>. Thus with the portraits of George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, and Henry Percy the black Earl of Northumberland, we encounter champions of the revived imperialistic chivalry and of the new advanced learning. \nWith Essex himself we see an aspiring champion in both these fields, the friend of Sidney who publicly took on his role after his death at Zutphen. The <i>Young Man among Roses</i> shows Essex at this time, arrayed in the Queen's colours of black and white, surrounded by eglantine which was peculiarly her flower, standing by a tree of steadfastness, proclaiming his platonic devotion to her in an emblematic language that was precise yet remains esoteric. The motto - <i>Dat poenas laudata fides</i>, literally 'Praised faith gives wounds (or pains)' - may refer to the period when Essex, having covertly married Sidney's widow, was attempting to vindicate his loyalty to the Queen against her displeasure at the match.\n \nThere is a scene in Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> where the Virgin Queen is discovered gazing lovesick at a portrait of the young Amphialus, her beloved, as she sits in her coach surrounded by retainers arrayed in her colours. The emblems of the Young Man come exactly from this Arcadian-chivalric background, which was the common culture of the Elizabethan court class, and Essex, commissioning such a portrait of himself, must have had in mind that the Queen would gaze upon it and accept his amends.\n\nJohn Murdoch\"\nCampbell, Lorne, Miguel Falomir, Jennifer Fletcher and Luke Syson. <u>Renaissance Faces.

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>263 Young Man Among Roses, possibly Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex</b>\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.163-1910)</i>\nVellum stuck onto card, oval, 135.5 x 73 mm, 5 5/16 x 2 27/32 in.\n\nRobert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (1566-1601), the eldest son of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and Lettice Knollys, was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and introduced to the court in 1584 where he immediately attracted the Queen.  He fought in the Low Countries campaign was knighted at Zutphen.  In 1587 he married Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s widow, a secret kept from the Queen until his wife\u2019s pregnancy in 1590 brought it into the open.  During those years he established himself as a royal favourite and, from 1590 onwards, embarked on a career as a military commander and sought, with Francis Bacon\u2019s aid, to achieve \u201cdomesticall greatness\u201d.  He led and English expedition in aid of Henry of Navarre (1591), attacked and sacked the town of Cadiz (1596), embarked on an abortive Azores expedition and, finally, wrecked his fortunes in Ireland (1599).  He attempted to stir up Londoners in rebellion (1601) and was subsequently tried and executed.\n\nThe most famous of all Elizabethan miniatures, a <i>chef d\u2019oeuvre</i> of Hilliard\u2019s art and the perfect evocation of Elizabethan Arcady.  As the miniature has virtually no history before the present century the identity of its sitter and its meaning must, necessarily, remain speculative.  I cannot, however, accept Dr Leslie Hotson\u2019s identification of the sitter as a certain William Hatcliffe, a gentleman of the Inns of Court and identified as Mr W. H. of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets (see Leslie Hotson, <i>Mr W. H.</i>, London, 1964, esp. pp. 21-23, 204-15).  There is no real evidence for such an identification and its possibility is ruled out by the miniature itself.\n\nWhat follows is a summary of the only detailed study of the miniature which I made in <i>The Cult of Elizabeth</i>, pp. 56-83, in which I developed the proposition, first made in 1959 by David Piper, that the Young Man was Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.  The identity rests  on comparison with the earliest authentic portrait of the Earl, dated 1590, by William Segar (no. 278), depicting him at the age of twenty-four with a moustache.  Two other miniatures by Hilliard, one dated 1588 and gives the right age of twenty-two.\n\nThe portrait evidence has to be accepted or rejected subjectively although, in my view, it is right and the eyes throughout are brown.  Leaving aside that there is the interpretation of the emblems which can only relate to the Queen: (i) the <i>Young Man</i> is embowered in eglantine, the single white five-petalled rose which recurs in the Elizabeth mythology.  In its most extended form it took the shape of a full-length poem <i>Eglantine of Meryfleur</i> by the courtier, Sir Arthur Gorges; (ii) he is wearing black and white, the Queen\u2019s colours, worn by knights in the tiltyard and dancers in court masques.  At Sandwich, in 1573, for example, the whole town was hung in black and white in her honour; (iii) the tree against which he leans is a standard emblem of constancy.\n\nAll these would point to the sitter, hand in heart, presenting himself as a devotee of Elizabeth.  The motto, as Miss Carolyn Merion pointed out, is a half-verse from a famous speech out of Lucan\u2019s <i>De Bello Civili</i> in which the eunuch Pothinus counsels Pompey\u2019s death:\n\n<i>Dat poenas laudata fides, dum sustinet inquit,\nQuos fortuna permit\u2026</i>\n\nTranslated by Ben Jonson as:\n\n\u2026a praised faith\nIs her own scourge, when it sustains their states\nWhom fortune hath depressed.\n\nThe general drift would seem to be that faithful love and loyalty bring their own pain and suffering.  There is, as Leslie Hotson points out, an implied identification of the sitter with Pompey.  This would fit with the ambitious role in which Essex deliberately cast himself as successor to Sir Philip Sidney, for Pompey was a great military commander, a general at twenty-three, awarded two Roman triumphs by the age of twenty-five, besides being a popular hero of the citizens of Rome.\n\nThe miniature without doubt both on costume and in respect of the evolution of Hilliard\u2019s work is late 1580s.  To be of Essex it should date between the return of the Earl from the Netherlands in the autumn of 1586 and 1590.  The years 1587 and 1588 saw him establish himself as prince favourite and this would fit the <i>Young Man</i> exactly.\n\nThe contents of the miniature would have been dictated by the sitter but the pose with legs crossed must relate to Hilliard\u2019s memories of the art of the School of Fontainebleau and can be paralleled exactly in the work of Primaticcio, the source being ultimately antique.  Its sinuous elegance and its flower bedecked surface also echo the work of the Maitre de Flore.\n\nThe large elongated oval shape of this miniature is never repeated in Hilliard\u2019s work and must relate to the purpose of the object, which is hardly likely to have been a jewel on this scale.  Conceivably it was incorporated into an object such as a looking-glass worn at the end of a chain suspended from the waist.  It has flaked slightly and been restored.\n\nINSCRIBED: On either side of the head: <i>Dat / poenas laudata fides</i>.\n\nCOLLECTIONS: A Dutch Bourgeois family, who had owned it for several generations, sold it to Fritz Lugt, who in turn sold it to George Salting; bequeathed by him to the V&A, 1910.\n\nLITERATURE: C.
