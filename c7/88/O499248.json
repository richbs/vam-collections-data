His trademark is the patient observation of changes at a single location over many months or years. \n\nSoutham's subjects are predominately situated in the south west of England where he lives and works. He observes the balance between nature and man's intervention and traces cycles of decay and renewal. His work combines topographical observation with other references: personal, cultural, political, scientific, literary and psychological. Southam\u2019s working method combines the predetermined and the intuitive. Seen together, his series suggest the forging of pathways towards visual and intellectual resolution.\n\nSoutham uses a large format camera to produce 8 x 10 inch (20.5 x 25.5 cm) negatives that record a high level of detail. C-type prints are made from these.  When the pictures are enlarged from the negatives they reveal an entrancing wealth of information.\n\nThe diptych 'January 1997' is from the series 'The Pond at Upton Pyne', which charts the fortunes of a village pond transformed by successive periods of neglect and attempts at landscaping.",
