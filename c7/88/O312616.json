It has been suggested that this item was a preliminary model for the group surmounting the silver rose-water ewer and dish presented to King George V, when Duke of York, as a wedding gift by the officers of the Brigade of Guards.\nWhat appears to be the present piece is shown in a photograph taken in 1935 of the interior of Gilbert's studio in Kensington Palace.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. He epitomised the movement known as the \u201cNew Sculpture\u201d, with a new focus on naturalistic forms. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.",
