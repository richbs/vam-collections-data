They gave the finishing touches to elegant dress and were one of the few pieces of jewellery worn by men as well as women.  Gentlemen often wore matching shoe and knee buckles.\n\nMaking buckles became a highly skilled craft at which English silversmiths and jewellers excelled.  Exquisitely wrought designs, glittering pastes and precious stones reflected the status of the wearer as well as the occasion.  Cheaper and plainer versions were made of steel, brasse and other metal alloys.\n\nBy 1790, shoe buckles were falling out of use, except as part of ceremonial or court dress.",
