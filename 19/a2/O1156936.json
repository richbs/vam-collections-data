It is part of a collection made by Arthur Astill, who kept posters, handbills and advertisements from theatres where he appeared in variety. In Newcastle he appeared in an 'Entirely New Act entitled 'Early Morning in a Farmyard', assisted by a Dairymaid. She was Gwen Fontaine who later appeared with him as a double act, billed as 'Mirth, Mimicry and Ventriloquism'.\n\nArthur Astill (1887-1962) started his career in a Pierrot Troupe known as the Olympic Serenaders. He became a solo 'mimetic and whistler' and in 1912 was described as 'the Whistling Ploughboy'. He went on to work with Gwen Fontaine (1891-1962), who he married in 1911, in sketches which used Arthur's whistling skills in impersonations of birds, and his impressions of animals and children.",
