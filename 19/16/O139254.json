It bears London marks for 1718-19, an early example of full hallmarks on a London gold box..\n\nThe box had an eventful history during World War II.  It was the personal box of Martin Norton (1911-2005) of S. J. Phillips Ltd. of New Bond Street, London.  He was one of the great international figures among the dealers in jewellery, silver and gold boxes.  The box was in his pocket when his ship was torpedoed crossing the Atlantic.  His family delights in the story that, when he reached land and rang his wife, her first question, knowing what his primary concern would have been, was 'Is the box safe?'.",

He was one of the great international figures among the dealers in jewellery, silver and gold boxes.  The box was in his pocket when his ship was torpedoed crossing the Atlantic.  His family delights in the story that, when he reached land and rang his wife, her first question, knowing what his primary concern would have been, was 'Is the box safe?'.",
