At a time when many men idealised women, her characters symbolised ideal womanhood - feminine, spiritual, ethereal and unattainable.  \n\nTaglioni is dancing on pointe (on the tips of her toes). This is first recorded as an acrobatic trick in the 1820s; that it became an essential part of the ballerina's technique was mainly due to Taglioni and the choreography created for her by her father, which used it expressively to suggest character and mood. \n\nIf the dress were longer, Taglioni would be in the height of fashion; the fitted bodice, full sleeves, conical skirt and elaborate hairstyle are typical fashionable wear of the early 1830s. Even her shoes are little more than evening slippers of the period.  As pointe shoes, they gave little support, the only stiffening being a little darning at the back of the toes; the modern pointe shoe, with its flat, blocked toe, did not develop until later in the 19th century.",

Eventually numbering over 130 items, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Although it is often referred to as the Rambert-Dukes collection of Romantic Ballet prints, it includes important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched. The lithographs produced in London are notable for capturing the personality and style of individual performers in a theatrical setting.  They are a fitting tribute to one of ballet's richest periods. \nBefore the development of colour printing, the basic black and white prints were hand coloured.  There is often considerable variation from one print to another, both in colour and quality of the work.  The most important souvenir prints, such as this one, would only have been sent out to the best colourists, and it is often very difficult to tell the best hand colouring from early colour printing.  In the days before photography, such lithographs were expensive souvenirs, bought by the individual dancer's admirers.",
