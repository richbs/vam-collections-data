It is decorated with naked male trumpeters and bears the mark of an unidentified foundry, showing an anchor surmounted by a crown. The same mark appears on a smaller mortar, decorated with putti in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts Decoratifs, Paris. These 'putti' mortars were apparently produced in larger numbers; the Museum has two examples of lower quality (inv.nos. 353-1889 and M.22-1938).\n\nThe word \u2018mortar\u2019 comes from the Latin \u2018mortarium\u2019, meaning \u2018to bite\u2019.\nObjects like mortars were produced in a variety of materials and were, with their pestles, the primary means of grinding substances before the industrial revolution. Metal mortars were particularly effective for harder substances. During the 16th century when these mortars were made they would have been used in cooking and making medicines, cosmetics and other potions. They were found in hospitals, pharmacies and households (which also often produced their own remedies); in artist\u2019s studios (for grinding colours) and in the alchemist\u2019s workshop (for producing powders for use in experiments). The poisonous nature of some metals was known even in antiquity, and using substances ground in metal mortars was therefore potentially dangerous. However , probably due to their effectiveness, metal mortars continued to be used until powdered grinding machines took over. Of course non-metal mortars (notably ceramics, marble and wood) are still widely used.",
