            "public_access_description": "This silk programme was produced for the state visit of Their Imperial Majesties the German Emperor and Empress to the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, 8th July 1891 where they saw an evening of acts from four different operas, Wagner's Lohengrin, Gounoud's Romeo and Juliet, Gluck's Orfeo,and Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. The playbill is lavishly illustrated with images including those of the Emperor and Empress; Queen Victoria; the Prince of Wales and his wife Alexandra; an image of a scene from Lohengrin on stage, and images of  the Royal Italian Opera House, Covent Garden, where the event took place, and the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, both of the theatres of which Augustus Harris was the lessee at this date.\n\nWilhelm II (1859-1941) seen at the top of this programme with his wife Princess Augusta Viktoria whom he had married in 1881, was one of Queen Victoria's grandsons and the last German Emperor and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 1888 until 1918.  \n\nThe programme is printed with all the names of the performers who appeared, including the Australian soprano Dame Nelllie Melba (1861-1931), the leading lyric soprano at the Opera House from 1888, and the Canadian soprano Emma Albani (1847-1930) who had been awarded the title of Hofkammers\u00e4ngerin in 1882 by Kaiser Wilhelm l when she had performed the role of Elsa in Lohengrin  in German before him at the Berlin Royal Opera in 1881. \n\nThis programme must have been printed at the last minute, since according to a review in The Musical Times, 1 August 1891: 'A curious historical interest was lent to the occasion however by the withdrawal from the performance of the French artists and the consequent remodelling of the programme.'",
