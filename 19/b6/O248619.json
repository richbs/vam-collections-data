Wide border runs over both flange and well; four flowery branches with a mixture of Kraak flowers and leaves alternate with three pairs of large birds in flight and a further rock formation with a single bird.  Clusters of leaves and a mound line the centre and four smaller elongated rocks with T-growth border the inner rim.  A treble line encloses the main composition with its hatted figure seated on the ground of the centre with one bare leg stretched out.  His forearms are also bare.  A balustrade filled with a dotted textile is stretched out between the figure and a strange seat with two jars.  A pine tree and two bamboos rise from the left, a double-tailed simurgh dives towards the figure in the centre; to the right a Kraak cloud with tufted grass hangs over part of a hollow rock with a T-growth.  Three S-stems with a central lotus leaf and smaller leaves decxorate the outside in a more controlled fashion.  The large dish is one of three illustrating the change from formal Kraak designs to a transitional style.",
