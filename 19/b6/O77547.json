However, punch bowls did not normally have stands. As its capacity is small, it is also possible that the bowl was for serving stewed fruit or other sweet foods during the dessert course.\n\nUse\nPunch was first made in England during the 17th century. Its name derives from the Persian or Hindu word for five and refers to its five ingredients: spirits (originally arrack, from Goa in southern India or from Batavia, now Jakarta in Java), sugar, lemon or lime, nutmeg and other spices, and water.  During the 18th century punch became the favourite drink for parties and assemblies. New recipes, including sweet Malaga wine, rum and brandy, were invented and other variants, such as those combining gin or brandy with hot water and sugar, were also drunk. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe bowl is made of creamware, a type of glazed earthenware made by combining white-firing clays and calcined flint. Creamware is hygienic, hard wearing and heat resistant, making it highly suitable for tablewares.",
