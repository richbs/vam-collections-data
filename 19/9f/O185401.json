R. des Ecoles, 16.</i>\nNumbered <i> I</i>. E.272-1962\n\nThe Emperor and Empress carry plants which symbolize their infidelity. Tales of debauchery and illicit relationships emanated from the pleasure-loving court of the Second Empire. Napoleon\u2019s carnal weaknesses were public knowledge and many of the rumours concerning his succession of mistresses, including Marguerite Bellanger, to which this caricature refers, were true. Those relating to the beautiful Eug\u00e9nie were based on her informal and flirtatious manner, and were nurtured by her enemies even amongst the Bonapartes (pl. 6). In fact the Empress is said to have been frigid. The stories of her adultery with Ollivier, the theme of this caricature, and with her other ministers, are false.'\n\nNB: The 'pl. 6' referred to above is V&A object E.283-1962.\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
