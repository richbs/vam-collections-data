            "public_access_description": "This represents the great Ellen Terry (1847-1928) as Queen Katherine in Shakespeare's Henry VIII which she first played at the Lyceum Theatre on 5 January 1892 to Henry Irving's Cardinal Wolsey. Irving spared no expense on the lavish settings and costumes for this production, based on paintings by Holbein.  Ellen Terry was first employed by Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in 1878; she was his leading lady until 1902 and their on-stage partnership became one of the most famous in the history of the theatre. Royal Doulton produced a pair of figures showing them in their respective roles.\n\nRoyal Doulton began in Lambeth, London, in 1815 when John Doulton manufactured ceramic items such as stoneware bottles and sewer pipes. The Victorian revolution in hygiene and sanitation ensured its success, and Doulton's later produced tableware and commemorative items.  They moved to Burslem in The Potteries in 1882, added porcelain to their production two years later and were granted a Royal Warrant in 1901.",
