He is four armed; the upper right holding the wheel (cakra), poised between the first two fingers; the upper left, the conch (sankha), similarly poised. The lower arms embrace the goddess.  Varaha's right leg is pendent  and rest on the five hooded serpent, Adisesha.  He wears a cylindrical coronet (kirita akuta), sacred cord, waist band, bracelets at the elbows, and a striped lower garment.   His pig ears are illogically stretched like human ears and ornamented with makara-kundala ear pendants.  There is a srivasta symbol above his right breast.    Bhu Devi is sitting on his knee with hands in anjali pose, her hair dressed into a high bun (kesabandha).  She wears a striped lower garment and breastband (kucha-bandha).  When received by the museum, this image was very heavily encrusted with carbonate matter formed during earth burial; it was subsequently cleaned by electrolysis.",
