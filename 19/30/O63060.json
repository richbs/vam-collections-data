The stitches are so fine that the hanging appears to be printed unless it is closely examined. This type of fine chain-stitch is done with a combination of a needle and a leather-worker's hooked awl called an ari, a technique particularly associated with the professional embroiderers of the Mochi community from Kutch in Gujarat, western India. \n\nThis type of exotic tree pattern was immensely popular in Britain and Holland for furnishings and bed-hangings during the 17th and 18th centuries. While many of them were made of painted and dyed cotton (known as chintz), some also used the same designs in embroidery, as in this piece.",
