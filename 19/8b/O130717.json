Texts, images and objects sentimentalised and codified the processes dying and mourning. Deathbed scenes moralised the \u2018ideal\u2019 deaths of saintly characters too good for this world.  Unlike today, the death of a child was not a taboo subject in the 19th century. As on this song sheet cover, children's deathbed scenes were often infused with sentimental piety, with sleep used as a comforting euphemism. It implied a peaceful transition to a happier life in heaven, sparing the child from suffering in a sinful world. This illustration follows the lyrics of the of the first verse of the song: \"Lay her playthings all away/She will never need them more/Gone the sunlight of our day/ Gone to yonder golden shore/Clasp her hands upon her breast...\"",
