My interpretation of the title was to present two recognisable and rather graphic images as 3D forms; a traffic cone and a rearing horse. The horse is not fully formed, it is instead a 3D representation of a 2D graphic image taken from a book illustration. It is only recognisable as a horse from certain view points, it also relies on the cone to keep it upright.  The cone is a turned model of a typical traffic cone, a utilitarian form used to create control in the urban environment. Both forms are allowed to function physically and symbolically because of their pairing, they allow the viewer to consider the relationship between individual narrative parts.\nDawn Youll.

I was very aware of the Lloyds connection but it isn't modelled from that, it comes from an image of a horse in a book. For me I think the image of a horse conjures ideas of freedom (in both the nature of the animal and also health/wealth in people) and the cone represents the human attempt to exert control (which is often redundant as you see many solitary forgotten traffic cones lying around the place).\nEmail of 26/03/2011.
