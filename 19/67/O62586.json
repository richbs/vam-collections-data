His most noted projects include the city's School of Art, and a number of domestic interiors, including \u2018Windyhill\u2019, and \u2018The Hill House\u2019 in Helensburg, as well as several of Glasgow's celebrated tea-rooms.\n\nThis towel rail comes from a suite made for Mr and Mrs Sidney Horstman of Bath. In 1917 they commissioned Mackintosh  to renovate their house. Though he worked on a relatively small number of rooms in the house, he created startling differences in each room. The guest bedroom, for which this towel rail was designed, was furnished with dark mahogany. Some of the larger pieces in the suite were decorated with inlay. The style is very similar to that of a suite designed by Mackintosh for the guest bedroom of 78 Derngate, Northampton, the home of Mr and Mrs W.J. Bassett-Lowke. \n\nThe furniture was constructed by Prisoners of War on the Isle of Man in 1917.",
