They used them to display Japanese prints in their London apartment. The couple were aficionados of Scandinavian design and in the 1930s they had co-founded Finmar, a British company to import furniture by the Finnish architect and designer Alvar Aalto into Britain. However these frames were for their personal use rather than for sale by Finmar.\n  \nThe Danish designer of this picture frame was Kaare Klint (1888-1954). He studied painting before turning to architecture and is best remembered for his furniture designs. Most of these were produced by the small firm of Rudolph Rasmussen, which also made this frame. From 1914 Klint designed interiors and fittings for various Danish museums and in 1924 he helped to establish the Department of Furniture at the Royal Academy of Art in Copenhagen. Klint's best-known design was the Safari Chair. He designed it in 1933, basing the chair on earlier folding campaign furniture.",
