The seventh and tenth bands also have applied leaves cut from a large floral design. The fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and eleventh bands are of pieced patchwork, each employing two different small patterned cottons. The fifth, eighth and eleventh bands are made from triangles and diamonds, and the sixth and ninth bands consist of alternating triangles.\n\nThe central square is decorated with a large roundel, cut from a printed cotton with a bold floral design, and with a concentric circle made up from triangles of a small patterned cotton.
