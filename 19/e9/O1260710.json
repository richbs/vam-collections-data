Whilst living in Hammersmith, West London he began to organise and photograph a host of black beauty pageants from the 1960s to the 1980s, mostly targeted at women from the British Caribbean community. \n\nThe pageants echoed the sentiment of the \u2018Black is Beautiful\u2019 movement, which started in America in the 1960s. The movement encouraged black people to embrace their natural beauty, especially their hair. Albert\u2019s photographs also document the objectifying nature of the pageants as beauty parades. Female contestants continued to be judged on their physical appearance whilst male spectators were not bound by the same standards.  \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired seven of Albert\u2019s photographs documenting beauty pageants and the British Caribbean community in London as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
