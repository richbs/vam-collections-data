She supports the naked figure of the Christ Child who sits cross-legged on her lap. He turns to touch with his left hand a cup held out to him by the bearded king, Gaspar, who holds the unusually large cover of the cup in his left hand. His crown is not shown; his hair and beard are carved in a decorative manner. The bearded Melchior, wearing a crown, stands behind the bed, pointing with his left hand towards a star carved on the canopy and holding a boat-shaped container with his right hand. Next to him stands the third king, Balthasar, who wears a girded doublet and tippet. He points to the star with his right hand, holding a covered cup in his left. In front of the bed is seated the bearded St. Joseph, sleeping with his head resting on his right hand and holding his staff with his left. Next to him in the centre of the panel the ox and the ass feed from a manger.\n\nThere are many breaks repaired in plaster in the upper part of the panel. The bed canopy is a separate fragment which may be from another panel. The Child's right hand is missing. The original head of Balthasar is missing and has been replaced by what appears to be the head of the Virgin, with her characteristic trefoil crown, from another panel. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. Traces of gilding and reddish-brown paint remain on the hair of the figures, except Gaspar's hair and beard which are grey. The back of the panel bears three lead-plugged holes with looped latten wires attached. The bottom has been slightly cut away.",
