They were billed as \u2018The Irresistible Humorists\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nThe Griffiths Brothers are seen here in their sketch \u2018The Motor Car and the Duel\u2019. This was about an Englishman and a Frenchman who argue about their motoring experiences and end up in a wrestling bout, \u2018the Frenchman inexpressibly funny in his make-up\u2019.\n\nFred Delaney (1856\u20131940) and Joe Ridgeway (1852\u20131901) were the original act. After Joe\u2019s death, Fred was joined by his son Fred Junior, who is seen here on the left, and also occasionally by his daughter Lutie. The act worked the halls for more than 60 years with its famous \u2018animal burlesque\u2019 routines, \u2018The Blondin Donkey\u2019 and \u2018The Performing Horse\u2019.",

After Joe's death Fred was joined by his son Fred Jnr., who is seen here, and also occasionally by his daughter Lutie. The act worked the halls for over sixty years, its famous 'animal burlesque' routines 'The Blondin Donkey' and 'The Performing Horse'. This comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
