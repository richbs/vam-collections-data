The hilt is of steel (Lahuri type) covered with  a close floral pattern of gold koftgari work. The seating process is short and ends in a blunt point; the quillons are short and end in a flat dome; one of them curves back to form a knuckle guard which, in turn, curves back at the pommel in the form of a fluted knob. The grip is oval in section, bellied in the centre. The pommel is of a flat disc, curved away from the hilt at the edge, and is surmounted by a low cone ending in a striped knob. \n\nThe blade is of watered steel of the <i>kirk nadaban</i>pattern with a shallow channel in each face and Indian ricasso. The blade is two edged from the tip for about 12 inches of its length; the reverse edge then bears a chiselled nick ornamented with a koftgari inscription:-\n'Yah rahman'\n'Yah rahim'\n\nbefore the blade becomes single edged. near the root, on one face, there is a damascened (partly in relief) cartouche containing Quranic verses in Arabic lettering; on the other face there is a small circular cartouche in gold koftgari with the inscription:-\n'Alamgir Padshah 24'\nThe number may indicate the regnal year suggesting 'In the reign of King 'Alamgir (Regnal year) 24 i.e. 1091 AH = 1680 AD. \n\nBelow this are some pious phrases in Arabic. On the reverse is also an Arabic phrase (possibly an epithet of God) and a lion with 'Asadullah.

The calligraphy of this inscription is not of the quality that would be expected of the Mughal court at this time, though the superior chiselled Arabic calligraphy at the forte of the blade, and the very fine dark watering of the steel, do suggest a courtly provenance. The sword was formerly in the collection of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, and was given to the museum by his descendant in 1964.",
