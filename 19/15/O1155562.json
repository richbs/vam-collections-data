            "public_access_description": "Two Step is a strategy game whereby you must move your pawns to your opponents territory before they move all their pawns to your territory. It is also considered a co-operative game, which encourages teamwork, creative thinking and problem solving. It was made by Harmony Games, who began producing games in 1984, based in Stroud in Gloucestershire.\n\nThis game was previously owned by Bob Dixon, along with similar types of games. Robert Turnbull Dixon was a poet, author and peace activist. He grew up in County Durham and was very interested in assessing what affects and influences young people as they grow up. These types of games are valuable as we do not have anything like this within our collection, and they were an important part of the research for the books he wrote.",
