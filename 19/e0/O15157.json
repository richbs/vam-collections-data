On the centre of the interior are two characters 'kisa' (cyclical year), in black inlay, surrounded by an inlaid design of two fish amongst waves. The exterior carries four chrysanthmum motifs each within an oblong panel. There are areas of glaze degredation on the exterior and gritty adhesions on the interior. \nColour: Greyish green, white and black\n\nThis circular dish has the characters \"\u5df1\u5df3\"(gisa) inlaid in black clay on its inside bottom. Surrounding the inscription are a double-line circle and designs of fishes and waves inlaid in white clay. The wave motifs continue up the inside wall. The outside wall is divided into six sections. A greenish-brown glaze is thinly applied to the body. The foot is low, and the dish was fired on sand spurs. The characteristics of concisely executed fish patterns, curving wave motifs and sand spurs suggest that the dish was made at a kiln in Sadang-ri, Gangjin, in the year 1389.",
