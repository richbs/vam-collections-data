As far as we could see the painting is directly on the wood (with a support of e.g. gesso), but it was difficult to be sure of this, as the edges of the top are completely bound with metal, including the back edge.

They were placed against a wall, with one candelabra  or more placed on the top, so that the light could be reflected in a mirror. Such tables were mostly ornamental, as one can see from the lavish decoration of the top, and reserved for the grandest rooms of an important house.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe table top depicts Aurora, the Roman goddess of Dawn, scattering flowers before her chariot. It is adapted from a painting of 1614 by Guido Reni in the Palazzo Rospigliosi, Rome. The figures in the medallions at the sides represent Music and Architecture respectively.\n\nPlace \nAlthough untraced in any royal accounts, this table bears the inventory stamp 'G IV R' of George IV. It is thought to have been sold by Phillips' at a sale at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1836.\n\nPeople \nThe table top resembles a drawing by John Yenn, who was the leading draughtsman of Sir William Chambers, architect to George III. Chambers designed a similar table for Gower House, the London residence of the 1st Marquis of Stafford (1721-1803).\n\nThe top of the V&A table was probably painted by Giovanni Battista Cipriani, a decorative painter from Florence, Italy. He settled in England in 1756 and worked extensively for Chambers and to a lesser extent for Robert Adam. Cipriani executed a similar scene on the ceiling of  the library of Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire.",
