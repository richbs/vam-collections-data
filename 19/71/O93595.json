            "public_access_description": "Constable's characteristic use of zigzag shading is very much in evidence in this large and densely worked pencil drawing. He shows people working in his father\u2019s kitchen garden to the right, and there is a cowherd to the left.\n\nConstable had a life-long and rather nostalgic interest in agricultural work. He saw it as a 'natural' and satisfying employment. In fact, by the time that Constable was practising as an artist, traditional rural life had changed dramatically. Before the mid 18th century, land was usually farmed in strips that were owned by different individuals. With enclosure, these strips were reorganised into fields surrounded by hedges or fences. You can see this clearly in the background of the drawing. This was an expensive process. It meant that many poorer farmers were forced to sell their strips to wealthy landowners. Common land disappeared, so they could no longer graze their animals. Consequently, many moved to the new industrial towns and cities in order to survive.",

The drawing may therefore be dated, bearing the watermark in mind, c.1812 to 1816.  The house was sold by November 1818 (Beckett, I, p. 172), which provides an extreme date.  Holmes, p. 242, compares this drawing with No. 133 [437-1888], the small page from a sketch-book showing two views of Golding Constable\u2019s house, but the resemblance is one of subject matter rather than style.  Two oil paintings in the Ipswich Museum (given by the National Art-Collections Fund in 1955 from the E. E. Cook collection) were described in the sale of paintings formerly the property of Captain Charles Constable held at Messrs. Christie\u2019s, 11 July 1887, as:\nLot 85 The Kitchen Garden of the House of Golding Constable, father of John Constable, with the mill, at which the latter worked, in the distance.\nLot 86 The Flower Garden of the House of Golding Constable.\nCharles Rhyne has pointed out that the two paintings at Ipswich form a panorama; that the scene in No. 176 [623-1888] overlaps them both, and that the sketchbook page No. 132 [1259-1888], p. 38 shows the middle distance of the view seen here.  He takes them all to be scenes from an upper window of Golding Constable\u2019s house.",
