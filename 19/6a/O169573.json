A narrow band of tiny white- or red-outlined flowers is above and below and extends part way up the sides.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  \n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: red triangular flower on green stem pointing either straight up or down alternating with a greenish flower pointing either to the right or straight down. Dark green ground.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] divided into diamond sections: a stem with 3 red flowers and a pair of birds at the base alternating with a stem with 3 blue-speckled red flowers with a pair of birds at the base. Both are outlined with pink flowers.\n[b] Diamond sections.  A stem with 3 red flowers and 2 pairs of blue birds alternating with a stem with 3 red flowers and a  pair of what look like 2 pink birds.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, yellow, white, green, blue, light blue, light orange.",
