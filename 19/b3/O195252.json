The range, about as simple as wooden furniture could get, was a response to the worldwide economic slump of the 1930s. Rietveld intended the crudeness of the materials and form to be a design statement. Made from low-grade, single-thickness timber normally used for making crates, the planks were sold as a flatpack for home assembly, much like a base for a futon today. Rietveld's drawings indicate the construction of the bed base, the dimensions and where the screws should go. He was very specific about the positioning of the screws, and if customers wished to paint the furniture (he preferred them not to), as seen in the chair below, he wanted the screws to be fitted afterwards so that they showed as decorative elements. This particular design doesn't appear in any of the Metz & Co. catalogues and so might not have been produced. \n   Rietveld is better known for his revolutionary, abstract forms in furniture design. The 'Crate' range, however, for all its simplistic and plain design, is not very different in essence to more famous pieces such as the 'Red/Blue' chair of 1918, which comprises a series of geometric, standardised wooden uprights and horizontals. It did not receive its distinctive colouring until a year after it was originally made, and even the angle of the seat is very similar to the 'Crate' chair.\"",
