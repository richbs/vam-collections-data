Her brother was the novelist Ronald Firbank. According to his biographer, Miriam J. Benkovitz, Heather favoured 'exquisite clothes of a heather colour to complement her name'. The dress has a simple whitework collar. Its fresh youthful style conjures up images of leisurely summer picnics and boating parties from the years before the First World War (1914-1918).\n\nIn 1921 Heather's expensive clothes, bought from leading fashion houses, were packed into trunks and put into storage. There they remained for the next 35 years. In 1960 the V&A acquired well over 100 items from her wardrobe. This collection forms an invaluable record of a stylish and wealthy woman's taste between about 1905 and 1920. Many items were shown in an exhibition at the V&A in 1960. It was called 'Lady of Fashion: Heather Firbank and what she wore between 1908 and 1921'.",
