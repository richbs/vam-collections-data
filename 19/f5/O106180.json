Her hair is severely dressed with \u2018earphones\u2019 to either side and on her head is a coronet of palest yellow tinted palest orange roses.  Around her neck, wrists and sleeves are strands of pearls and on her feet, heelless ballet slippers.",

The ballet was choreographed by her father, Filippo Taglioni in 1832, to display her exquisite lightness and delicacy, which he expressed in the newly-developed technique of dancing on the tips of the toes (pointe work).  Previously, this had been merely an acrobatic trick, but La Sylphide was the first ballet to use it expressively to show the ethereal nature of the Sylph. \nThe print shows a moment when the Sylph, to please her human lover, flies into a tree to fetch him a birds'nest with its eggs.  The 'flying' was a simple moving platform, painted to blend into the 'trunk' of the tree, on which Taglioni posed and was lifted up to the nest.",

This image is number 4.   It shows the Sylph taking a bird's nest as a gift to her lover.  \nA complete Album d'Adieu + titlepage, was on offer in 1990 for $17,500 US.\nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.\n\nHistorical significance: The print shows Marie Taglioni, greatest ballerina of her day, as the Sylph in La Sylphide.  The ballet was choreographed by her father, Filippo Taglioni in 1832, to display her exquisite lightness and delicacy, which he expressed in the newly-developed technique of dancing on the tips of the toes (pointe work).  Previously, this had been merely an acrobatic trick, but La Sylphide was the first ballet to use it expressively to show the ethereal nature of the Sylph.",

            "production_note": "Attribution note: The word 'Proof'printed on the lithograph does not indicate a test copy made for revisions.  Because lithography allowed such large runs of a print, it was argued that they were of no worth as an art-print, unlike engravings, which had much smaller print runs.  Printing early pulls in a run with 'Proof' was a way of making them more attactive to print collectors, although they have no extra merit over any other pull in the run.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The large souvenir prints of the Romantic ballet, issued in the 1830s and 1840s, are among the most evocative images of dance in the 19th century.  Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched. The lithographs produced in London are notable for capturing the personality and style of individual performers in a theatrical setting.  They are a fitting tribute to one of ballet's richest periods. \nBefore the development of colour printing, the basic black and white prints were hand coloured.  There is often considerable variation from one print to another, both in colour and quality of the work.  The most important souvenir prints, such as this one, would only have been sent out to the best colourists, and it is often very difficult to tell the best hand colouring from early colour printing.  In the days before photography, such lithographs were expensive souvenirs, bought by the individual dancer's admirers.",
