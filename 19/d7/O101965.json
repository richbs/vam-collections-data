The stomacher finishes in a point at the waist where it is trimmed with 'tails' of gold metal lace backed with crin; the bodice is edged with a gold paper and crin braid from which hangs a pleated peplum overlaid with flat crin lappets.  The front of the neck is edged with  ecru lace from which run lines of a broad gold and black openwork ribbon overlaid with rosettes made of plaited gold foil each centered with an amber 'jewel' on a mount of plaited braid and 'gunk'.  The sleeves are covered with a similar lattice and rosettes.  Over the shoulder and upper arm is a bold oversleeve of silvery drab synthetic fabric lined with crin and decorated with gold foil rosettes with sequin centres, pink metallic shields and 'gunk' scrolls and abstract S shapes; above the lower edge  is a broad gold metallic openwork braid from which hang crin lappets, the lace overlaid with gold foil rosettes with sequin centres.  The overskirt is decorated with random sprays, made on a gunk base partly overlaid with a stiffened gold paper highlighted with gold beads and sequins (much deteriorated)   Down the front edges are large press studs to attach to the petticoat (missing).  The bodice is lined with white cotton and fastens down the left side of the stomacher with velcro and press stud.  The skirt is attached to the bodice with bars and the bodice is heavily boned.\n[Theatre costume] Full length skirt of gold lurex, the voluminous fabric pleated into the petersham waistband, lined with white synthetic fabric.

Thus the fabrics, cut and style of a theatre costume are at once recognisable as historical period and yet bear the signs of the age in which the production is being staged.  If the play was produced twenty years before or twenty years later, the costumes would be treated quite differently.  \nA costume may look historically correct, but the era in which it is created can often be told from the fabrics and the way it is made.  Fabrics are very typical of a period and when a costume is remade the same materials and trimmings may no longer be available. This costume for Queen Elizabeth from a production of Benjamin Britten's opera Gloriana in the 1960s, uses typical materials of the time, notably gold lurex and 'gunk' a composite made of the various new substances and adhesives that were being developed at that time.  Crin, a form of horsehair, and gold foil paper are hang-overs  from costume making techniques of the 1950s.  Close up the effect looks crude and messy, but at a distance, under stage lights, the individual elements would meld into an effect of regal sumptuousness.   The costume was remade in the 1970s (see S.15-2004) and the total effect was much more glitzy.",
