            "public_access_description": "This bottle, with its characteristic flagon shape, was used to hold and sprinkle rose water or other scented essence. Such objects were highly fashionable but never particularly common. Now there are only four known surviving examples of pear-shaped casting bottles, of which this is the least altered or damaged.  The decoration of the piece is indicative of an early Renaissance style, which went out of fashion around the middle of the 16th century.\n\nThis piece is an example of 16th century domestic silver. Such silver was both functional and ornamental. Objects for dining and drinking took elegant forms and were decorated in the latest styles. Beautifully crafted items intended only for display often adopted functional forms such as cups and dishes. Domestic silver was not confined to the most wealthy. Many people owned silver spoons or mounted vessels, items which often became treasured possessions.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
