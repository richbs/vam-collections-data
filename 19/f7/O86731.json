Both forearms are broken off as is the front of the face. Over his head are two winged figures, flying horizontally, carrying a parasol-like canopy. Two figures stand on either side of Siddhartha: on the left is a youth wearing a dhoti and dupatta and holding a bow diagonally in front of his body. The existence of the bow makes it probable that the young man is Mara, who wants to persuade Siddhartha to desist from his decision to retire from worldly affairs. The figure on the right is probably Mara's daughter, wearing a garment falling in soft folds covered by a cloak wrapped around her right hip and drawn over her left upper arm.",
