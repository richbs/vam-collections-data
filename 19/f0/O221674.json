He showed it as representing `Mr \nWatkins' the supposed product of an incestuous \nrelationship between Beardsley and his sister \nMabel. The original picture and the legend had been \nacquired in Paris in the 1920s by Lord Tredegar, \nwho knew the young man who believed himself to be, \nor perhaps merely passed himself of as `Mr \nWatkins'. Subsequently the image transpired to be a \nportrait of the illustrator Alan Odle (1888-1946) \nby his friend Allinson. The original picture was \nsold by Christie's, 7th November 1991, lot 15 \n(present location unknown).'",
