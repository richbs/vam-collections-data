Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \nA Rocky Bay \n1391-1869 \nPanel, 31.8 X 48.3 cm (12 \u00bd X 19 ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \nThe view may be identified as the tower and town of Amalfi, on the Gulf of Salemo, south-east of Naples, renowned for its beautiful coastal scenery. Stanfield visited Amalfi during his longest and most productive tour of the Continent between August 1838 and March 1839. Two drawings by Stanfield, of the tower and the town respectively, are in the British Museum Print Room. \nThe work may possibly be that exhibited at the RA in 1840 (476) with the title 'Amalfi, Kingdom of Naples' (Stanfield exhibited three other Amalfi subjects in 1842 and 1848, but their titles do not relate to 'A Rocky Bay'). The Art Union critic said (p74) of Stanfield's 1840 RA exhibits: 'all landscapes of a high order of merit; but it seems to us that the accomplished painter is contracting a hardness of style'. The Athenaeum (16 May 1840, p400), having dismissed Turner's 'Slavers ... ' as 'a passionate extravagance', commented: \nWith what a double pleasure, after lamenting Mr Turner's downward course, do we turn to Mr Stanfield's landscapes, no want of effect there, - none of colour - none of that delicate and poetical spirit, which adds something of the ideal to the familiar loveliness of nature, - and yet how simple, how unforced, how true they are! \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nWaagen, <u>Galleries and Cabinets of Art in Great Britain: Being an account of more than forty collections of Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Mss, etc</u>, London, 1857, p.178.\nThe following is the full text of the catalogue entry:\n\n\"Stanfield.- A rocky sea-coast with a town. In front a vessel on the rough water; the sun is just breaking through clouds. In point of attractiveness of composition, exemplary keeping, and well-felt and careful execution, this picture belongs to the most successful specimens of this eminent painter.\n\nGustav Waagen\"",
