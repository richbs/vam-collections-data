During this apprenticeship he attended evening classes at the West London Art School and Heatherley's School of Art. From 1892 Robinson worked as a freelance illustrator. Basically a self-taught illustrator, Charles Robinson's work has a freedom linked with a feeling for book design. His watercolour illustrations have a sensitivity that was greatly helped by the introduction of the four colour printing process. \n\nThis watercolour illustrates the line from Aladdin, \"The house was filled with slaves bearing basins of massy gold\". The traditional Arabian tale became popular in Europe following its publication in the eighteenth century. Rich colours create an opulent image of the slaves summoned by the genie. Their basins filled with gems were payment for the hand of the Sultan's daughter. The illustration was used for the Frontispiece to the Big Book of Fairy Tales, one of a number of books illustrated by Robinson and published Blackie and Son just before Christmas to appeal to a growing market for the Gift book.",
