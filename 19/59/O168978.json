The tubular arms and pierced decoration were responses to the severe Modernist forms of the building, notably the tubular metal hand rails on doors and staircases. Barber Osgerby reasoned that the chairs would mostly be seen from behind, clustered around tables, so gave the backs a twist with floor-level stretchers, creating complete loops of metal for the rear legs. The chairs were made for the Pavilion by a relatively new British furniture manufacturer, Established & Sons, which subsequently mass-produced the chair in a variety of colours, including black.",
