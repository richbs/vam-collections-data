Such models were frequently sold to tourists, many of them British, during the 19th century. On one level they were high-class souvenirs, but on another level they were well-made miniature versions of a celebrated monument that was widely admired all over Europe.\n\nSubject\nThe Alhambra Palace in Granada was built during the Nasrid dynasty (1232-1492), the last period of Moorish (or Muslim) rule in Spain. Granada was the last surviving bastion of Islam in Spain until captured by Ferdinand and Isabella  in 1492. The Spanish did not demolish the Alhambra, but protected and enriched it.  In the 16th century Emperor Charles V built his own palace within the site.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPlaster reproductions were made in great numbers during the 19th century. Plaster was a fairly cheap material and could be cast in moulds, so that copies could easily be made of the original sculpture or architectural detail, and further identical reproductions could be made to be sold more widely. Often, as here, the plaster model would then be embellished with colour or finer detailing.",
