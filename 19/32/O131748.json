Weekley, 1977\n\n\nVera Ross was a twentieth-century landscape and figure artist who was also known for the posters she designed for London Transport. She studied at The Slade School of Fine Art under the triumvirate of Wilson Steer, Henry Tonks and Randolph Schwabe and at one time shared a studio with Rex Whistler. In 1925 she exhibited at The New English Art Club and, in April of that year, at The Redfern Gallery, Old Bond Street where she displayed landscapes in watercolour. In 1930 she exhibited works including <i>The Holiday</i>, <i>Versailles</i> and <i>A Minuet to Olden Times</i> at The Imperial Gallery of Art, London. Of her works displayed at The Redfern Gallery, P G Konody for the <i>Observer</i> wrote that \u2018Miss Vera Ross reveals in her strongly emphasised figure studies the soundness of Slade School training. Her watercolours are lively and gay in accentuation, and executed with a frank and fearless use of the medium.\u2019(1) This frankness and liveliness can be seen in her work <i>Celebration</i>. She married Charles Montague Weekley with whom she had two children. In 1924 Charles Montague Weekley joined the Department of Circulation in the Victoria & Albert Museum and then in 1946 was appointed Officer-in-Charge of The Bethnal Green Museum (now The Museum of Childhood). During his time at The Bethnal Green Museum he implemented many changes, such as improving the children\u2019s section. Weekley gave <i>Celebration</i> to the Victoria & Albert Museum in accordance with Ross\u2019s wishes. Ross died in 1973.\n\n<u>Citations</u>\n1) P. G.
