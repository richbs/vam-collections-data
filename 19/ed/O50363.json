All the pieces are assembled and hand painted.\nThese traditional toys were and still are made in the Ergzebirge area south of Dresden, in and around the town of Seiffen.  Originally made by farmers in the winter months from locally grown trees, it became full time with many of the men working in cooperatives (especially between 1945 and 1990 before reunification between east and west Germany).",
