In liberating themselves from the conventions of traditional jewellery, designers looked back to the modernist principles of the Bauhaus and to earlier avant-garde art movements such as Surrealism, Cubism and Constructivism. This allowed them to create unique designs, often with a sculptural quality. Jewels of this period are often abstract in design and asymmetrical.\n\nE. R. Nele studied in Berlin, Paris and at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London. She was taught by the British jeweller Gerda Fl\u00f6ckinger at the Hornsea College of Art in London. She then moved to the Paris workshop of Lacouri\u00e8re. She is a sculptor and graphic designer, but also made jewellery. All these elements come together in this early neckpiece. Her later work was more sculptural with flowing shapes, often bizarre almost bordering on Surrealism.   \n\nThis neckpiece won the Gold Medal at the Milan Triennale of 1957. \n\n\n This collar was exhibited at the Milan Triennale of 1957 and also at the International Exhibition of Modern Jewellery held in Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall, London, in 1961. The aim of this exhibition was to demonstrate the artistic potential of jewellery and to revitalise the British jewellery trade. This had been depressed by wartime austerity measures and prohibitive purchase taxes.",
