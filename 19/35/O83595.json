The material is a sheer chiffon, machine embroidered with an all-over diamond design in clear, iridescent round sequins. The mesh is created by exposing the dark plummy-brown base fabric in between the groups of four sequins, which also creates a shimmering lizardine or snakeskin effect. The halterneck and bust area of the dress are lined with a nude coloured synthetic fabric for reinforcement, and the main body of the dress is unlined.

The design, which is pared down to the barest essentials, would have permitted energetic dancing. The sheer brown chiffon fabric is entirely covered with clear iridescent sequins which would have sparkled on the dance floor. Apart from a nude lining to the halter-neck, the dress is semi-transparent. The fashion journalist, Eve Pollard, selected this dress to be photographed for the front cover of the Daily Mirror's first colour supplement in 1972.\n\nLike many of her fashion designer contemporaries in the 1960s, Georgina Linhart was a graduate from St Martin's College of Art and Design. Her fashion label, launched in 1964, ran for ten years before closing down in 1974. Afterwards, she worked as a freelance designer for Quorum, working alongside Ossie Clark and Betty Jackson. She also worked for Jaeger, Wallis and Designer's Guild, and was Head of Design at Chelsea Girl.",
