It consists of an ankle length deep red skirt with a vertical strip of gold motifs at the centre and a gold band around the hem. Over this she wears a loose jacket of the same colour. The jacket flares out at the waist and is decorated with a wide band of gold at the hem and cuffs, these, and the collar are also trimmed with narrow strips of dark fur. She also wears a stiff wide brown fur hat with a band of pleated gold fabric at the brim and two strips of gold cloth, and one single red panel, either side of her face. Her gloves are pale gold and her boots a deep red. The design is signed Comelli and dated 1921. \n\nThe borders of design are bound in a transparent gauze which is pinned in place. There are also two scraps of fabric, one crimson silk velvet and the other patterned gold lame. A hand drawn chart detailing the measurements of the actress for whom the costume was intended is pinned to the rear of the design.",

The story follows Sybil, a singer from Paris, who arrives in Russia and meets an officer, Petrov who falls in love with her. There follows a case of mistaken identity in which Sybil is thought to be the wife of the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke goes along with this deception and his wife pretends to be Sybil. The Grand Duchess then becomes attracted to Petrov and the Grand Duke tries to attack him. After much confusion everyone's true identity is revealed and the play ends happily.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis production of the play opened at Daly's Theatre, London on 19th February 1921.",
