Vessels of this sort had been produced since the Neolithic period (5000-1700 BC), but were typically made of ceramic in many regions of China. During the Western Zhou dynasty (1050-771 BC) it became routine to cast these vessels in bronze and use them in various ceremonies and death rituals.\n\nThe tiny interlaced snake-like creatures, which decorate many Eastern Zhou bronzes, are  used on this example as background to a pattern of small protruding beads distributed symmetrically on the surface. The shape of the vessel, characterised by a hemispherical bowl on a high stem, was extensively reproduced during the Song dynasty (960-1279) when a taste for archaic objects was shared by the imperial court and wealthy \u00e9lites.",
