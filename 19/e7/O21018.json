The figure of No-body is not one of a pair and was probably made as a novelty, to act as a scapegoat for any domestic accident. The character can be traced back to the ancient Greek legends of the  poet Homer (9th century BC). It also appeared in the English play of 1606, No-body and Some-body, whose title page is displayed in the British Galleries (museum no. DYCE.6967). Throughout history Nobody has taken the blame when something goes wrong: 'Nobody did it'. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe long tradition of British ceramic figures probably began with figures such as these. There was, however, a time gap of almost 150 years between the unsophisticated two-piece delftware figures and the popular one-piece Staffordshire 'flatbacks'.  They were both made by the same process, in a press mould, the cheapest method of manufacture.",
