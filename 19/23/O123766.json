This custom, popular in Elizabethan Britain, was revived from 1750-1800 following fashions in continental Europe. Elaborate designs such as formal gardens, temples, obelisks, ornamental fencing and trellis work were all popular, particularly for the dessert course. The confectioner used pastes made of sugar, gum, starch or rice flour to make the ornaments from wooden moulds, such as this one. The robust construction of the mould meant that it could be used over and over again. Many of the designs for centrepieces and ornaments used in Britain were influenced by France and this mould is incised with a French name, Guichard, who may have been an ornament maker. W. Squire, whose name is also incised on the mould, may have been in the trade as well.",
