It is raised on a block plinth 10 cm high and takes the form of a pier table, the sides and front filled with panels, the front panel and its plinth recessed.  A plain frieze 10 cm deep below a shallow bolection-moulded cornice is apparently supported by square-sectioned pillars at the back edge and at each side at the front by tapering, square-sectioned herm figures, the bases carved as paw monopodia, the tops as Egyptian heads, these gilded and with giltwood feathered wings running back from them across the plain, recessed side panels of the cabinet.  Between the figures the front is recessed and present a single door showing book-matched mahogany veneers.  Above, the frieze does not follow this central recess.  It also shows book-matched veneers.The door is set centrally with a gilt bronze mount of a lyre, within a separate mount of a laurel wreath.  The front of each herm is set with the same trio of mounts, two different leaf sprigs flanking a patera.  The centre of the frieze is set with a mount of a roundel displaying a lion's head, flanked by elaborate scroll and anthemion mounts.  At each end, above the sphinx heads, are dished circular mounts, the edges finely chased, the centres plain and clearly missing the main motif.\nThe single door, with pin hinges to the right, opens with a double throw lock (key modern, made by the museum).  The carcase is of oak, stained red, but much of the carcase of the sides and front is in solid mahogany, some faced with more decorative veneers.  The door is of panelled construction with five vertical planks.  The cabinet is fitted with a ladder system of notched shelf supports and struts for shelves.  There is one shelf of panelled oak construction with 5 large (2cm) holes bored in a line towards the back.  A second shelf is of pine, not panelled and thinner.  Both are stained red.  The back consists of a single panel of oak, heavily chamfered on the back surface.\nThe marble slab is clearly from elsewhere.  The overhang is too pronounced and the flat cutting of the edge on such a thin slab, is perfunctory for a cabinet of such quality.",

Georges Jacob had already been producing furniture of high quality before the French Revolution of 1789, when the monarchy was overthrown. He subsequently formed a new partnership with his younger son. The family's furniture business, under the name Jacob-Desmalter, became one of the most prosperous and important in Paris in the early 1800s.\n\nJacob-Desmalter may have made this piece for Mar\u00e9chal Ney (1769-1815), who was one of the emperor Napoleon's most famous military leaders. It is of standard Empire form with elaborate gilt-bronze mounts in classical and Egyptian styles. But the quality of the craftsmanship is much higher than most other regular productions of the Jacob-Desmalter workshop. The slab of white marble is a replacement. The original may have been made of red Italian marble.",

            "history_note": "Part of a large group of pieces of French furniture, ceramics, metalwork, books and other decorative arts, from the late Empire period and earlier, acquired in Paris by Sir Charles Stuart (from 1828 1st Lord Stuart de Rothesay) (1779-1845).The Empire furnishings were probably purchased during his first period as ambassador to Paris (1815-1824), the earlier furnishings during his second embassy (1828-1830). The Empire furnishings may have been intended for  4 Carlton House Terrace which he acquired in the late 1820s and moved into in 1834. Older pieces were probably purchased for his country house, Highcliffe Castle, Hampshire (now Dorset), which was re-modelled and enlarged in the most ambitious Gothic style from 1830-1834, with some work continuing throughout the 1830s.  In 1841 the Carlton Terrace House was let. The family moved their London residence to Whitehall Yard. It was possibly in 1841 (or 1845, the date of Lord Stuart de Rothesay's death) that the Empire furnishings were moved to Highcliffe.\nLord Stuart de Rothesay's collections were inherited in 1845 by his wife Elisabeth, Lady Stuart de Rothesay (n\u00e9e Yorke). After her death, Highcliffe House and its contents passed to his second daughter, Louisa, Lady Waterford (1818-1891) who maintained Highcliffe. She left the house and its collections to her distant cousin, Major-General Edward Stuart Wortley (1857-1934). When his younger daughter Elizabeth ('Bettine') married Montagu Bertie, 8th Earl of Abingdon in 1928, he bought the castle and its contents from his father-in-law. The Abingdons sold Highcliffe and most of its contents in 1949 but retaineda number of pieces, including all those which later formed the Hole Bequest to the V&A. After her husband's death in 1963, Lady Abingdon lived much of the time with her close friends, Mr and Mrs Tahu Hole, to whom she bequeathed all her personal possessions on her death in 1978. Tahu Hole died in 1985 and a year later his widow Joyce approached the Museum and offered the collection as a bequest. She died in December 1986 and, in accordance with her will, the Museum chose those items that it wished to add to its collections. Other items from the collection were sold to benefit the Museum and the proceeds added to the funds bequeathed.\n\nIt is possible that this piece was made for Mar\u00e9chal Ney; in the Pi\u00e8ce servante..Petit Salon at the H\u00f4tel de Saisseval there was recorded in the <u>Inventaire apr\u00e8s d\u00e9c\u00e8s</u> of Ney a 'Petit armoire en acajou, figures \u00e9gyptiennes'. That piece is described as having a top in red Italian marble, a colouring much more suited to this handsome piece, which has clearly lost its original slab. It is tempting to relate this object to some of the seat furniture from the Hole bequest (W. 2a, b, c-1987, W.10a&b-1987, W.4a&b-1987). Certainly the treatment of the Egyptian heads is very close to that on the two <i>berg\u00e8res</i>, W.2a,b,c-1987, allowing for the difference in scale.\n\nHistorical significance: This cabinet is of a standard Empire form but the quality of the craftsmanship is of the highest found among the regular productions of the Jacob-Desmalter workshop.",

The small floret mounts found on the pilasters (and which also occur on W. 2a, b, c-1987 and W.10a&b-1987) occur very widely on furniture by Jacob-Desmalter. The main frieze mount is found on a number of pieces by Jacob-Desmalter at the Palais de Compi\u00e8gne. It is also found on a jewel cabinet supplied by Jacob-Desmalter in 1810 for the cabinet de toilette of the Empress Marie-Louise at the Tuileries. The roundel mounts above the Egyptian heads have lost their centres but in a list made in 1978 on the death of Lady Abingdon, these were recorded as lion's head mounts.",
