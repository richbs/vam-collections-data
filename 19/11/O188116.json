I'm not sure if you are aware but there is a second example that was formerly in Dresden...now at the Schloss in Gotha.  That said your dish was published in 1982 in the Willi Goder, etc. volume, Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger, Die Erfindung Des Europ\u00e4ischen Porzellans (Kohlhammer, 1982), Pl. 118.  \nSignificant is the following comment: 'Im Inventar von 1711 erw\u00e4hnt...8 passige Sch\u00e4lichen, inwendig mit Blumenwerk' 'An 8-sided dish inside of which is flower-work'.  Regarding the enamelling, it had to have been done in and around Dresden.  It's possible, Funcke, because I believe he did some enamelling.  But I'm not sure it fits his style of decoration.   I have two other candidates: first it's possible that both dishes could have been done in the workshop of the court lacquerer Martin Schnell.  There might have been an enameller in the workshop, along with the lacquerers.  Second what about the workshop of the court enameller and jeweller Georg Friedrich Dinglinger?  Another strong possibility is the court enameller Johann Martin Meyer, see the Goder volume above for coffee pots and a teapot in Dresden enamelled and set with garnets, pls. 113-115.  I think it's a pretty good bet that if indeed he did these coffee and teapots, he would have been responsible for the two octagonal dishes.'\n\nThe Gotha dish is published in Dirk Syndram and Ulrike Weinhold (eds.), B\u00f6ttger Stoneware: Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger and Treasury Art (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, 2009, p. 46).",
