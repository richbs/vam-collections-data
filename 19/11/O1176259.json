A ban on Christmas cards to conserve supplies of paper was mooted during the First World War but the idea was abandoned in the interests of maintaining the troops' morale. This propaganda postcard celebrates the alliance and excoriates the German attitude to treaties. The \"Little Scrap of Paper\" in question was the First Treaty of London or the Convention of 1839 by which the European powers were bound to uphold the independence and neutrality of the Kingdom of Belgium, the breach of which by Germany was seen by the allies as justification for declaring war in 1914.",
