There is an embroidered border 7.5 cm deep on all four sides framing the central field which holds a single composite multi-pointed star around a central 9-rayed white and black star, against a red and orange ground and an inner red and yellow central circle. Around this a blue circle framed with red, yellow and black points. In each of the four corners of the central field is a boteh facing towards the centre, holding a single flowering stem in red and yellow against a blue ground.  Around this motif is a series of embroidered elongated 'S' and 'Z' forms in red and pink with touches of black, and around the base of the boteh three broken rows of embroidery in red, blue and red with yellow. The border along each of the four sides is a densely packed repeat of two confronting botehs flanking a stylised cypress tree with a series of semi-circular and lobed triangles.  A blue stitched edging surmounts this band from which small blue and black botehs face anti-clockwise. At the base a 2.5 cm wide band of densely packed meander of a slender black stem carrying alternately a 7-petalled blue rosette or a blue/red boteh with white details and red highlights.  A line of very small red and pale blue 'beads' edge this band.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied wool: white, black, red, blue, light blue, pink, deep yellow.",
