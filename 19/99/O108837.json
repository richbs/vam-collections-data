The shape, with its inverted rim, was current in Iran for at least four centuries before this example was made. The decoration, however, is typical of the early 19th century. \n\nIt includes a row of oval cartouches containing a variety of scenes. They include: a lion attacking a deer, a hunter on horseback being attacked by a lion, and another mounted horseman spearing a dragon. Another contains several enthroned figures, one of whom smokes a long pipe. Others depict an elephant rider, a camel rider and a seated dervish. There is also a curious depiction of two naked figures holding blankets to conceal themselves. \n\nWe do not know the significance of these scenes. There are also a number of cartouches with calligraphy arranged around the top and bottom of the bowl. However, they are illegible and offer no clues as to what this lively menagerie might have symbolised.",
