At each external extremity, the feet are supported on small discs of metal with rounded edges.  The top edges are decorated with a single row of embossed pellets.

This piece has a distinctly modern style and dates from about 1904. Towards the 1920s Hoffmann turned to a much more curvilinear and decorative style which was in marked contrast to the design you see here.\n\nThe design was executed by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte (Viennese workshops). Hoffmann co-founded these exclusive workshops in 1903 with fellow architect and designer Koloman Moser and financial support from the wealthy businessman Fritz Warndorfer. Hoffmann and Moser had visited England where they had been inspired by the Guild of Handicraft founded by the English architect and designer C.R. Ashbee. The Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte became known for their progressive designs for furniture, glass and metalwork, such as this piece. It was disbanded in 1932.",
