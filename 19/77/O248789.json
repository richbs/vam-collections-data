S., p. 35 and Pl. 28) as Helmingham. Helmingham Park, Suffolk, was a seat of the Earl of Dysart, for whom Constable was to copy portraits in 1807. As early as 1800 Constable had written to Dunthorne \" Here I am quite alone among the oaks and solitudes of Helmingham Park... There are abundance of fine trees of all sorts, and the park on the whole affords good objects rather than fine scenery\" (L. ed. S., p. 16). It remained a favourite sketching ground for Constable.'",
