Schafroth documents how money is invested to regenerate a dilapidated area at the cost of those who have made it home precisely because it is cheap.\n\nSchafroth juxtaposes images of the poor and homeless in their broken-down neighbourhood with lines of text suggestive of real estate advertising speak; the dark, gloomy drawings are invaded by enthusiastic, greedy-sounding sales pitches.\n\nTaped inside the front cover of the book is a small plastic sample bag containing an old beer bottle top and a cigarette stub, at the back is a broken burnt out matchstick - souvenirs or artefacts from a place and its people swept away by 'progress'.",
