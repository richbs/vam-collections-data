It is probable that the mordant was printed rather than the pigment.\nBoth selvedges are present.\n\nCream ground with cusped arch form and partial capitals to either side with red spandrels containing large floral stems.  The field contains a vase and a stylised yellow cypress tree containing a vase and a flowering stem terminating in a roundel around a human face.  The tree comes from a large blue bulbous vase resting on a very stylised rocky mound, either side of which is a male lion or leopard [it has both spots and a mane] attacking a deer.  Above each pair of animals is a peacock and a small lion and a vigorous floral meander . This meander bears large blossoms with small peacocks and parrots and terminates with two confronting parrots.\nAcross the top of the central panel there is a band containing three ovals framed in blue.  The central one contains a vase, two birds and a floral arrangement.  The other two contain the joined front quarters of a pair of lions each holding a curved sword or scimitar. There are two side borders which fill two thirds of the central panel - these contain, from the bottom up, a vase, a pair of birds, a cypress tree, a pair of birds leading into two yellow ogival medallions and then a yellow cypress tree.\nAcross the top of the hanging is a wide border with a wide floral meander bearing parrots and large flowers.  Down the side of the hanging is a narrower border with similar motifs but no birds.  Across the bottom is a band with a line of blue and red swags below a line of botehs.\nThe design is similar to that on 5437.IS",
