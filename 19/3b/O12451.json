The bodice back has lines of shirring at the neck, and the fullness of fabric between shoulders and waist has been pressed into pleats.  The gathered skirt is finished above the hem with horizontal tucking, lace insertion and a narrow band of white speckle embroidery; the hem has a lace-edged flounce which has been fluted by an ironing technique.  The garment fastens at the back with neck and waist drawstrings, linen-covered buttons and stitched buttonholes, and with a lace-hemmed tie of self fabric attached at each side of the waist panel; the cuffs fasten with linen-covered buttons and stitched loops.",
