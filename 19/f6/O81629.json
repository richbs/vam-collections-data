In Paris, he then entered the atelier of the history painter Paul Delaroche (1797-1856). He first specialised in portraiture and then moved towards the naturalistic style with peasant scenes for which he became best known. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Millet's early output. It depicts a woman pouring water in jars by a well, before the artist's childhood house in Gruchy (Normandy, France). Millet is best known for his rural scenes although he painted a few portraits, and is one of the most authoritative exponents of the Barbizon school, an artistic movement that anticipated the Impressionism and derived somehow from the new interest for realism.",

He went to Paris in 1837, where he was a pupil of Paul Delaroche, and for the next ten years painted mainly portraits and <i>scenes galantes</i> in the manner of Diaz. At about the time of the Revolution of 1848, he turned increasingly to painting rural scenes; in 1849 he moved to Barbizon, where he became a close friend of Theodore Rousseau, and where he remained for the rest of his life. Although attacked for his concentration on peasant subjects, he won increasing public recognition in the 1860s, and was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1868. \n\nLit. E.

A photograph of the actual well and steps is reproduced in Moreau-N\u00e9laton, iii, fig. 310. \nThis painting combines two themes dear to Millet: the peasant woman filling pitchers at the well, of which this is an early example, and the portrayal of his family house at Gruchy. Although this appears to be the only extant oil painting of this house, there are several pastels and drawings with variant compositions. A pastel in the Mus\u00e9e de Lyon (formerly van den Eynde and Tabourier collections) has the same frontal viewpoint as the oil painting, but it contains no figures and is a later work. Two pastels in the Museums at Boston and Montpellier show the house and well from a different viewpoint, further to the right, and the woman feeding geese. \nFinally, a third type (formerly Feuerdant collection, Drouot sale, 23 Mar. 1934, lot 47, and cf. Boston Museum of Fine Arts, no. 61.625) has the same angle of vision as the Boston/Montpellier composition, but is similar to the V. & A. painting in that the woman is shown pouring water at the well. \n\nProv.

Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting was probably painted in the summer 1854 and is a fine example of Millet's rural imagery. It depicts a view of the artist's childhood house in the village of Gruchy in Normandy. The village and its surroundings especially the near cliffs of Gr\u00e9ville, were a great source of inspiration for Millet, who executed many views of the landscapes and figure studies. The peasant woman pouring water in two jars appears in different positions in a number of drawings in black chalk (see for instance RF 11226, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris). Millet also extensively drew the house from various points of view (see for instance in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon).\nThis composition does not display the vigorous free and broken brushwork, which is about to become the hallmark of the Barbizon school and appears therefore a fine example of Millet's early career. The ainting however already encloses Millet's earthen palette with dominant touches of vivid colours such as here the intense blue of the woman's sleeves, the brilliant white of her shirt and the radiant green of the left hand-side foliage. \nMillet described himself as a 'peasant painter' and favoured above all the depiction of the contemporary rural life. This favoured imagery was in part a response to the industrial revolution and the rural depopulation, which started as soon as the 1840s.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
