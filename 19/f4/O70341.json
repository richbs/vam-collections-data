Little distinction was made between bowls and dishes, cups and porringers, jugs and mugs.\n\nTrading\nWerra slipware was just one of the many types of pottery which could not be replicated in England, and which was valued for its stylish decoration. At the same time as these dishes were made by clusters of potteries along the River Werra, a similar range of slipware dishes, much plainer and mainly decorated with geometric designs, was made along another German river, the  Weser.\n\nDesign & Designing\nA stock range of stylised figures such as soldiers and clowns was developed for use on these dishes. These figures were reproduced over a long period but have no significance other than as decoration. What is distinctive about Werra slipwares is the mixture of techniques. On a surface that would betray even the slightest mistake the slip-trailing is handled deftly, while the sgraffito decoration shows a masterly drawing technique.",
