The altarpiece appears to have been executed between 1495 and 1508 for the Capella del' Annunziata in which the Confraternita dell' Annunziata, founded by Cardinal Torrecremata with the object of supplying dowries to poor girls, had its seat. A number of paintings by Antoniazzo Romano are known to have been based on earlier prototypes. It is possible that this relief was the model for the altarpiece.",
