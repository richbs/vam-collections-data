They were used to illustrate articles by Jaumann (1905) and Lux (1908) in which the concept of a machine aesthetic was discussed. These tables were popular enough to be imitated by Beiszbarth & Hoffmann of Mannheim-Rheinau, who even employed Hoffmann's pupil, Otto Prutscher (1873 - 1959) as a designer. \nMany of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte products were small and simple, exhibiting geometric purity and strong rectilinarity. However, more ambitious objects were attempted, for instance a table by Hoffmann incorporating a jardini\u00e8re and supporting a bird cage which was illustrated in about 1909.\n\nA photograph in the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte records in the \u00d6sterreichisches Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst (IX p.49, M 1408) shows this table model supporting small containers for cigars and cigarettes; according to the order book one unfinished table was made as a model for Cl\u00f6ter on February 2nd 1910, who supplied ten such tables, with glass tops, on October 12th 1910.",
