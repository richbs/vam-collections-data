The face, which is turned slightly to the left, has moulded and painted features, with fixed inset eyes of white and brown glass and hair lashes and brows; the long dark curls, in a mixture of mohair and human hair, are inserted with knife cuts.  The doll has a legless body of stuffed cloth which is mounted to revolve on a wooden stick; the front of the shoulder plate is moulded to indicate the breasts.  She is dressed in non-removable clothes, consisting of an ivory-coloured silk blouse with elbow-length sleeves, a black velvet corselet bodice laced at the front with red cords, a short skirt of dark red silk with rows of horizontal tucks above the hem, and a petticoat of white linen and lace.  The 'fortunes' were originally attached to streamers around the waist: when the doll was made to spin round, a fortune could be selected.",

But its founding member, Charles's great-grandfather Domenico Pierotti (born in Italy in 1760), acquired his dollmaking skills by chance, as a result of falling out of a tree at the age of ten. He came to England for medical treatment, staying with his aunt, who was a professional maker of decorative plaster mouldings and wax figures, and who trained him in these skills as he recovered.",
