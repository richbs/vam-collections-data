            "public_access_description": "The man who appears in this fragment is wearing a type of turban of a 'stuffed-roll' construction. These turbans were very popular in the 15th century and were worn by people of high rank as well as by those of more modest means. They were probably inspired by fashions from the Near East. Not enough of this fragment survives to indicate what type of scene this man appeared in. It is likely that the original panel was in a church.\n\nIn the early part of the 14th century a new technique for decorating glass was developed. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in a kiln, the silver compound would turn yellow and sink into the glass. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown\u2013black pigment. The style of painting used here suggests that it was made in England.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church. Much of the medieval stained glass in churches and cathedrals was damaged and only survives in a fragmentary state.",
