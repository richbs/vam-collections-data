The emperor sits on a pale grey horse riding through a landscape accompanied by his son behind him, also on a horse, and various retainers on foot. The painting has been mounted on an album with floral borders, and has a pale pink border with gold scrolling decoration with the attribution to the artist Manohar in black ink at the bottom. The painting has Manohar's distinctive colour palette, and is in the style of the reign of Jahangir, of whom this must originally have been a portrait. However, the faces of Jahangir and prince have been replaced with those of Shah Jahan and, presumably, his son Dara Shokuh, as shown by minute inscriptions above the brown horse's head and beneath Dara Shokuh's left hand, both naming Murar as the portrait artist.",

Various retainers are on foot. The painting has been mounted on an album page with floral borders, and has a pale pink border with gold scrolling decoration containing an attribution to Jahangir's leading artist Manohar in black ink at the bottom. Overall, the painting has Manohar's distinctive colour palette, and is in the style of the reign of Jahangir, of whom this must originally have been a portrait. However, minute inscriptions in black ink above the head of the brown horse, and beneath Dara Shokuh's left hand, specify that the faces are the work of a different artist, Murar, whose known work falls during the reign of Shah Jahan after his accession in 1628. Thus, the original faces of Jahangir and a prince have been replaced with those of Shah Jahan and, presumably, his son Dara Shokuh.\n\nThe folio which has fine calligraphy on the other side belonged to an album of Shah Jahan that was dismembered at an unknown date, and was consigned with other folios for sale at Sotheby's, London, in 1925. The lot was described as the property of \"a Nobleman\", who was said at the time to be Lord Minto.",
