When he was unable to finance his training as an architect at the Royal College of Art, he turned to illustration instead.  After producing his first cartoon for The Bystander in 1920 he developed quickly as a freelance artist and by 1921 was described by the Strand Magazine as \u2018the youngest of the men of his craft who have now an established reputation\u2019\n\nDuring the mid 1930s, Lee contributed to a variety of periodicals, and created the hugely popular \u2018London Laughs\u2019 series for the Evening News (1934-66) which has been credited as the first run of non-political topical cartoons in the UK. After almost 9000 cartoons \u2013 the longest running daily cartoonist in history \u2013 he retired to Norwich in July 1966 but continued to produce political cartoons three days a week for the local Eastern Daily Press and work for comics. In 1963 he was presented with an award for Special Services to Cartooning by the Cartoonists\u2019 Club of Great Britain.",
