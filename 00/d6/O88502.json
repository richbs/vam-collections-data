It is, however, unclear whether this piece was actually made under western patronage or simply uses western figures as part of its design. The outer border, which was added in the 18th century, is certainly of the type made for the western market.\n\nThe main part of the hanging is divided into two main sections. The upper part shows two men and two youths in Persian dress (although their pale complexions and blue eyes are incongruous), while the lower half shows two European, probably Dutch, men at a table, accompanied by a striped dog and two women in costumes that combine Indian and western elements. A Venetian glass sweetmeat dish is seen standing on the floor, and a European ribbed glass can be identified on the table. Other vessels are in both Chinese and Indo-Persian styles. The figures in the small niches surrounding the main part of the hanging are in Indian dress, and the architectural surroundings of the piece suggest an Indian palace.\n\nA companion piece with similar figures is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.",
