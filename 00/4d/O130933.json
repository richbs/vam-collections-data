According to Vasari, Granacci was often employed by the Medici to design scenery and festive decorations. \n\nThis painting of circular format could have been a tondo or a desco da parto (birth tray) due to its relatively small size. The subject presents St Jerome in the desert in a traditional way, the saint kneeling before a crucifix, a rock in his hand as a sign of penitence. This work may have been made for private devotion. On account of their edifying penitential subject-matter, images of St. Jerome in the Desert were especially popular as secular decorations in Renaissance Florence.",

The painting portrays St Jerome in penitence in the desert.\n\nSt Jerome is represented here in meditation before a crucifix, with books alluding to his dedication to study, and his simple drapery to his austerity. He holds a rock in his hand, with which he mortified his flesh so as to resist temptation. A lion, his traditional attribute, lies behind him, while his red circular cardinal's hat and robes hang lie beside him. The rocky cave alludes to the arid desert setting of St Jerome's life of abstinence.\n\nAlthough the present painting is small enough to have served as a circular <i>desco da parto</i> (birth tray), such a subject would be most unusual for such an artefact, which were typically decorated with auspicious allegorical subjects such as the 'Triumph of Love' or scenes of childbirth. This painting was probably made for private devotion, as the pentient St Jerome was an auspicious example for the devout. The penitent St. Mary Magdalene was similarly popular with female patrons.",

According to Vasari, Granacci was often employed by the Medici to design scenery and festive decorations.\n\nObjects and images were used for protection, intercession, and as votive offerings since Antiquity. Amulets, rings and talismans often included pagan and erotic imagery. Popular images were also produced for the purposes of intercession, protection and instruction. The Virgin, Christ and the saints were favourite subjects, as they were considered to be intermediaries with God, and agents of protection against evil. Christians expressed and strengthened their faith through public rituals, such as celebration of the Eucharist, and personal devotions. Believers were encouraged to contemplate events from the life of Christ, the Virgin, or the saints, and to imagine that they had been present at the scene. Small religious images of the Virgin and Child frequently emphasized their tender relationship and were especially popular for private devotion.\t\n\nSt Jerome was born Eusebius Hieronymous Sophronius and is recognised as one of the Fathers of the Western Church. He is best known for his translation of the Bible from Greek into Latin. From 375 to 378, after becoming a monk, he retreated into the Chalcis desert. St Jerome in the desert was a popular subject in Renaissance Italy, but few circular ('tondo') paintings represent a single saint. Two others depicting St Jerome in the desert are that dated 1500 by Piero di Cosimo (Museo Horne, Florence) and another by Fra Bartolomeo (formerly Collezione Vittorio Cini, Venice). \n\nThis work is currently on loan to Longleat House, Warminster, where it forms part of the decor of the State Drawing Room designed by Crace in 1877 as a Neo-Renaissance setting for the 4th Marquess of Bath's collection of Italian pictures.",
