            "public_access_description": "Photographer Neil Kenlock (born 1950) moved to London from Jamaica in 1963 and became determined to document black pride in the face of racial prejudice. Building on his background in protest photography, Kenlock brought the same sense of confidence to the colour photographs he took of British Caribbean people at home in the 1970s.\n\nFamilies had photographs like this taken to send to their relatives in the Caribbean to show that they had settled well in Britain. The compositions of these images recall studio portraiture. The lighthearted nature of this photograph presents a more playful take on the domestic scene, as a young girl pretends to use the telephone.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Kenlock alongside work by his contemporaries Charlie Phillips and Armet Francis as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
