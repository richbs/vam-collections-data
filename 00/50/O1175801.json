Directed in 1978, the film had a cast featuring the punk actress and model Jordan, Adam Ant, Toyah Wilcox and Little Nell (famous for her r\u00f4le in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)). It also featured appearances by Wayne County, the dancer and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, and Steve Severin and Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees. The film concerns Queen Elizabeth I who has been transported to a bleak and decrepit contemporary Britain (reflecting the decline of 1970s Britain), to find Queen Elizabeth II dead after a mugging, and Buckingham Palace taken over by a group of punks who have turned it into a recording studio. History is being rewritten by subversives and a gang of misfits take part in mass violence, sexual depravity and anarchy. Jubilee represents a stylised contemporary account of the impact of the punk movement in Britain.\n\nJordan is a model and actress noted for her work with Vivienne Westwood and the SEX boutique on King's Road, Chelsea, in the late 1970s. She was a fixture at many of the early Sex Pistols' performances and her style and fashion sense made her an icon of the London punk scene.",
