What appears to be one piece with five main darts sewn to create a point (there is a smaller dart coming off one of the main ones.)  The darts are sewn in whip stitch with linen thread. The piece is made with two layers, one undyed and one black, which is woven in such a way that the pattern is reversible. The warp threads, of both colours, are finer that the weft with the dark colour being more dark blue and therefore different from the black linen; z-spun. At the point a five pointed star is formed in the pattern. This star has a centre made up of five smaller stars with dots at their centre. Around these stars are the five points of the larger star which are created in a checked pattern. Each point of the large star is edged with a stepped, solid border; at each point is a floral fleur-de-lis and in between these are the heads of birds. Another five pointed star appears to lie around this. It's edges are formed with open, compass-like shapes with a scalloped border on one side. On the outer edge of each 'compass' is a floral shape with a central flower and eight circular petals surrounding it. The circular petals are filled with the same checked pattern as the star.  The piece has holes and some staining. At one spot on the underside there is fluff (hair?) attached to the fabric and at the very centre of the star is a glob of what might be glue. Sandy residue is also present.",
