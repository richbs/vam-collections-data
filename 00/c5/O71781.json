ISBN 1851773088.\nThis is a Madonna and Child for modern, or rather, postmodern times. The title refers to the trinity of mother, child, and, above them (toned in gold), the placenta. Like Julia Margaret Cameron before her (cat. 33), Helen Chadwick used \"low\" technology to create high art. The artist photocopied imagery from various sources, then cut and collaged the copies to form a design inspired by Madonna compositions of the Early Renaissance. The result is both overwhelmingly frank and as elusive as an echo.\nOne Flesh has been described by Marina Warner, one of its principal feminist admirers, as \"a Surrealist outrage,\" while Chadwick herself related the image to the idea of \"jouissance\" (\"enjoyment\") in the writings of Julia Kristeva. Shortly after its acquisition, One Flesh was shown at the V&A in \"Towards a Bigger Picture: Contemporary British Photography\" (1987), an exhibition that demonstrated the lively condition of the medium in the hands of a new generation of photographic artists and artist-photographers. In 1989 Chadwick produced a celebrated series of large-scale Polaroid photographs at the V&A. Her career was cut tragically short, however, when she died very suddenly, of unknown causes, on 15 March 1996.\n\nLit. Chadwick, 1989; Haworth-Booth, 1994b\n\nMARK HAWORTH-BOOTH\nKingsley, Hope with contributions by Riopelle, Christopher <u>Seduced by art : photography past and present</u> London: National Gallery, 2012\nWe have inherited prejudices from the late nineteenth century, when the grand religious set pieces and allegorical history paintings demanded by traditional patrons - the Church, the aristorcarcy and the State - were giving way to colloquial subjects for a secular market. By the end of the century, a reverence for historical art began to be seen as a refuge for those who did not understand of appreciate art's advance. This suspicion of high-art sources persists today, and part of Helen Chadwick provocation in <i>One Flesh</i> (fig. 13) was in remaking an old-fashioned Old master subject ... with modern media. \n\nChadwick pieced together a Madonna and child from photocopies of real objects - and bodies - placed directly on the galss platen of the copier. She tinted the prints with the vibrant colours of medieval manuscript and combined the section into a collage that was mounted within a simplified version of a traditional arched altarpiece. Just as Chadwick's technology marries old and new forms from collage to xerography, her imagery unites old and new readings of the nativity, from the traditionally draped Madoona to the modern surgical clamps for her baby girl's umbilical cord.
