It then consisted of a folded playing sheet mounted on linen and the version described above appears to be a variant.  In its original form each quadrant of the circular playing area was numbered consecutively outwards from centre to perimeter (ie Europe 1-28); but in the above version, although the order of the actual pictures remains identical with that given in the booklet of rules, every fourth number has been altered and exchanged with the number 60 spaces away, ie. 1 becomes 61, and 61 becomes 1, 5 becomes 65 and 65 becomes 5 and so on.\n\nThis game is a dismembered impression of a different state of the playing sheet Geographical Recreations with the central emblematical representation of the Continents missing, and as described above with different numbering.  As there are no actual rules it is not possible to state how this game was played and it may be simply that a playing sheet was cut up and placed in the box.  However, it may have been designed by someone (not necessarily the publisher) to make a dissected puzzle version as there are markers and a teetotum.  It may also have been part of E. 1766-1954 .\n\nRules placement: none",
