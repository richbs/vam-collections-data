Benjamin Huntsman's (1704-1776) invention of crucible or cast steel had a decisive influence on the Sheffield plate industry, and was crucial for the cutting of accurate dies used in the plating industry. \nPierced work was accomplished using a fly punch after the traditional silversmith's technique for executing pierced work with a fretsaw proved unsuitable for Sheffield plate. The teeth of the saw ripped the silver surface, tearing it away from the copper core and leaving a jagged edge. \n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
