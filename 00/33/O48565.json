Bread boards and platters became popular in the Victorian period, and bread knives, often with ornately decorated handles, may have been developed to accompany them.\n\nFood & Drink\nBread was a staple food for rich and poor alike. Bread and cheese formed one of the most common midday meals for working men and women. The same foods, served more elegantly in cheese dishes, butter dishes, bread baskets and platters, were offered at society dinners between the puddings and jellies and the dessert. Bread and butter were important components of other meals and social events such as afternoon tea, luncheons and supper parties.\n\nManufacturer\nWingfield Rowbotham & Co. were an important Sheffield cutlery firm  established in the 18th century. They produced a large range of goods, including saws, files, scissors,and  table and pocket knives.",

Bread boards and platters became popular in the Victorian period, and bread knives, often with ornately decorated handles, may have been developed to accompany them.\n\nHistorical significance: Bread was a staple food for rich and poor alike. Bread and cheese formed one of the most common midday meals for working men and women. The same foods, served more elegantly in cheese dishes, butter dishes, bread baskets and platter with specialist cutlery such as Bread knives and forks, were offered at society dinners between the puddings and jellies and the dessert. Bread and butter were important components of other meals and social events such as afternoon tea, luncheons and supper parties.",

(taken from  'The Sheffield Knife Book', Geoffrey Tweedale)\n\nWingfield Rowbothan & Co. registered the trademark of a crown over a harp on the 11th February 1885, claiming that it was an old corporate mark.  They were taken over by Thomas Turner & Co. in 1898 and Turners themselves registered the mark in July 1899.  Turners continued to use the name Wingfield, Rowbotham & Co. and their mark until they were taken over by Viners in 1932.  Viners continued to use the harp and crown mark until at least 1954.
