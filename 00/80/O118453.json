Recent research into the activities of 19th century forgers, however, has revealed the relief in the pax, and the pax itself, to be fakes. See Krautwurst (2002), pp.646 and 650 for a discussion of the central relief and the source for the iconography of God the Father in the pax tympanum; Truman (forthcoming, 2010): see his discussion of a 'Tabernacle house altar', no. 1973.1.1558 of the Lehman Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nIt was acquired by the Museum from M. Sampson of Paris on 15 March 1865 as possibly North Italian, and dated around 1540. Compare a similar example, also stamped twice with the 'ZP' mark, in the collection of Viscount and Viscountess Lee of Fareham (see Watts: 1936, no. 82). This piece may have been among the collection of early silver and other art treasures which the Viscount, Arthur Hamilton Lee, presented to Hart House, Toronto, Canada, in 1940 (see Baddeley, 2011).\n\nThe V&A also posseses a bronze version of Bernardi's Resurrection relief, Museum number 6889-1860, which is oval-shaped like the rock crystal intaglio.\n\nHistorical significance: The pax is important for the study of nineteenth-century forgeries, and particularly for an assessment of the sources of inspiration available to the Aachen jeweller and forger, Reinhold Vasters.",

First the celebrant, then the congregation, one by one kissed the image on the pax.
