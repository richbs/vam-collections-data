In the words of the Gospel of St Luke, she was 'washing his feet with her tears, and drying them with her hair, kissing his feet, and anointing them with the ointment' (Luke 7: 36-50). \n\nSimon asks Christ why he allows such a woman to do this. Christ explains that the greatest repentant sinners were more deserving of forgiveness than those who had sinned and repented less. Christ is making his point forcefully to Simon, who sits next to him. A man at the end of the table on the right looks taken aback at the female penitent. Others partake of the feast.\n\nThemes of charity and Christian forgiveness were commonplace in roundels. They provided moral exemplars for the domestic, civic or institutional viewer.\n\nThe imagery on this panel has often been confused with similar representations showing Mary Magdalene washing Christ's feet as he sat at table. But this refers to a different story related by the other Gospel writers, and Mary Magdalene is not described as a sinful woman.",

The panel here illustrates the story related by Luke when Christ was invited to a meal in the house of Simon the Pharisee in the city of Nain. The woman who came in to attend to Christ was described as a 'sinner'. Tradition ascribes the sin of adultery to her. The message related here is one of forgiveness of sins - the greater the sin, the greater the repentance.\n\nAlthough the details are confused, the other gospel writers record another story that has many similarities to the one by Luke but has a very different message to tell. In these, Christ and his disciples are in Bethany at Simon the Leper's house or at the house of Lazarus, brother of Martha and Mary Magdalene. In this story, Mary Magdalene washes and annoints Christ's feet with costly ointments. The disciples (especially Judas) object as the money could have been better spent on the poor. Christ informs them that 'the poor will always be with you but I shall not'.",
