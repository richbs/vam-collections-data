London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n<i>\nGustave Le Gray   French   1820-82\nThe imperial yacht 'La Reine Hortense' at Le Havre   1856\nGold-toned albumen print from wet collodion negative\nFacsimile signature in red ink\n323 X 415 mm   Mus. no. 68,006   Bequeathed by Chauncey Hare Townshend</i>\n\nGustave Le Gray's striking record of the Imperial yacht shows an effective combination of the high resolution wet collodion negative and the albumen printing paper, giving a finely detailed print.  The 15 minutes needed by Samuel Smith for his river scene (The River Nene, Wisbech 1861) were not necessary here, as the wet collodion process was appreciably faster, but the blurring of some of the quay-side figures - some are mere 'ghosts' - indicates that the exposure still ran to many seconds.  The print shows the typical yellowed highlights of the albumen print, partially gold-toned. \nLe Gray undertook commissions for the Emperor of France.  The steam yacht was named after the Emperor's mother and was much used for Imperial tours and visits following the conclusion of the Crimean War and the  Universal Exhibition of 1855 (at which Le Gray was awarded the highest medal for photography).  This view of the Imperial yacht was perhaps taken prior to its departure, bearing Prince Napoleon, on an expedition to Greenland and Spitzbergen in June 1856.  The tallest figure on deck, apparently smiling, has been identified as the Prince himself.  The figures would have posed for the picture, which must have been taken from one of the escort vessels of the expedition.  During the same summer Le Gray made his instantaneous photographs of the sea, which provided one of the photographic sensations of the decade.  The print indicates Le Gray's mastery of the wet collodion process and forms a comparison to the atmospheric effects he achieved with the wax paper process (see 'In the Forest of Fontainebleau', of 1851, Mus. no. 68,007).
