Liston created the role when the play was originally produced at Covent Garden Theatre, 20 November 1812. It was a great success and was revived many times. An expert dancer, by the time he retired Liston was the highest-paid comedian on the London stage, earning between sixty and a hundred pounds a week at the Olympic Theatre, a huge salary for his day. He retired in 1837 after a career that spanned over thirty years.\n\nThe dramatist James Kenney started his working life in a bank, but an earlier play, Raising the Wind, which he wrote for an amateur group with which he acted, was adopted by Covent Garden in 1803. It proved so successful that Kenney went on to write plays for both Covent Garden and Drury Lane theatres.",
