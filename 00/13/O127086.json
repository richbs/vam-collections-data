Both busts stand on their original wood plinths. A variant dated 1808 is at Brocklesby Park, Lincolnshire, the ancestral home of the Yarboroughs. The present bust may have been shown at the Royal Academy in 1810.\nNollekens was a prolific sculptor of portrait busts and operated a thriving workshop in London. Many of his busts are in the classical style, with loose drapery and antique hairstyles. He spent eight years in Rome from 1762 to 1770, where he worked with Bartolomeo Cavaceppi restoring and copying antique marbles. One of these copies, his group of Castor and Pollux, is in the Museum's collection (Museum no. A.59-1940).",
