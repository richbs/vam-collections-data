Both the bar and the foot rest are now missing. \n\nUnlike upholstered chairs, caned chairs seem to have been produced through a subdivision of piece-work labour by journeymen joiners, turners, caners and carvers, who seem often to have stamped their work with initials, as on one of the back legs of this chair (SR).\n\nOn loan to the Elizbethan House, Plymouth.",
