The lower niche is filled with a floral lamp, with carnations top and bottom. Above it is a white rosette and a tiny lamp in the point of the niche. In the centre of the field there is a vertical stem supporting pairs of jagged flowers: 2 pairs of tulips, 2 pairs of carnations, and 2 pairs of a single hyacinth with a pair of rosettes immediately above. The spandrels contain 4 incomplete bands of alternating dark red and light red serrated blossoms quartered by a cross on a light purple (?) ground with a small carnation on top of the niche. Above and below is a panel with a black (corroded) ground and 3 horizontal forked 's' - motifs, the second is reversed and bears a vertical cartouche with three diamonds. From the cartouche are two white leaf-like extensions. Around both panels is a narrow border of light green with a red twisted ribbon. \nMain border: Faded purple ground with square blocks formed by a diagonal sprig  of stylised carnations with 2 leaves. The black stems are corroded but remain at the lower border where the knots are dark blue.\nInner and outer borders: white cotton ground with diagonal ragged floral sprigs, either red or dark red, alternating in direction.\nCatalgue Date: 13.5.98",
