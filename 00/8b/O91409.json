The crudely engraved initials beneath the laurel are a later addition.\n\nAll persons who took up a craft or trade in Bergen had to be registered as burghers. Hinrich Farnou, from Minden in North Germany, became a burgher in 1626. His son Hinrich, whose name is engraved on the present tankard, became a burgher in 1680 but there is no mention of his profession in Bergen's 'Borgerbok'. The family seem to have been small traders: a Hans Josten Farnouw, who was probably a nephew of the Hinrich of the tankard, traded in furs, and another Hinrich, who became a burgher in 1718, kept a small shop for country folk. Of the Wejlandts, the family of Hinrich's wife, we know that Carsten, who became a burgher in 1706, was a baker and that his brother was a skipper.\n\nThere is a marked disparity of style between the chase decoration of the body and the engraved decoration of the lid, which fits a little loosely. A surprising feature is that the base of the thumbpiece, instead of resting flush on the top of the handle below, as is usual, is raised above it and is narrower. However, it appears to be a replacement. Both the technique of chasing and the all-over decoration are exceptional in Bergen at this period: hence it is possible that the body was originally plain except for the inscription and spray and that the chased decoration was added later.\nFrom Scandinavian Domestic Silver, Charles Oman, V&A 1959: Michel Vahle: b. about 1658; d.1704",
