He began his career in Basel, where he worked mainly as a painter of altarpieces and designer of woodcuts. He visited England in 1526 to 1528 and through Erasmus, he met Sir Thomas More and his circle. Returning to Basel he received commissions from city authorities and produced designs for stained glass and goldsmiths' work. In 1532 he returned to England, where he worked almost exclusively as a portrait painter, mainly under the patronage of King Henry VIII and his courtiers.\n\nThis particular design was made for a table fountain for Queen Anne Boleyn, wife of Henry VIII.",
