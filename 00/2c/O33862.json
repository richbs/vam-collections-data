Cliff Richard played Aladdin, with Una Stubbs as Princess Balroubadour.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of pantomime costume design of the second half of the 20th century and of the work of a designer who specialised in pantomime and variety design.  It is also an example of a pantomime costume for a principal boy and illustrates a feature of pantomime of  the 20th century: the employment of stars of popular music, entertainment and television in leading roles, rather than established actors.",
