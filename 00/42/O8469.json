Anglo Dutch early 18th Century\".\n\n22/8/53 letter Lee to Edwards\nstates he has \"no doubt\u2026. that this chair is English\".  He recalls purchasing a similar set in the past which had an English coat of arms inlaid in the splat; he thinks that workmanship was similar and they could easily have come from the same workshop as this chair\".\n\n25/8/53 memo Thorpe to Ashton\nrecommends accepting this \"interesting Anglo Dutch chair of early 18th Century date, with inlay similar to that of a Dictionary chair, and probably by a Dutch craftsman in England\".\n\n26/8/53 letter Edwards to Lee\ndiscusses the chair's provenance.  Chairs similar in type were made in England by Dutch immigrant craftsman.  He points out that the marquetry device on the splat exactly corresponds with a chair formerly in the Donaldson Colleciton (Dict. Of English Furniture Vol. 1, p.224).  He notes that Vol. 1 includes several contemporary chairs that are not English and have been eliminated in the 2nd edition.  The English origin of the Donaldson chair has never been challenged and the use of the same motive supports this chair being English.  He notes, however, that parallels can also be found at the Rijks and in other Dutch collections (he notes the character of the carving on the cresting, the scrolls of the stretcher and the shape of the back legs).  He will label it \"Anglo-Dutch\"; about 1700, possibly by a Dutch immigrant\".\n\n27/8/53 letter Lee to Edwards\nagrees with his views on provenance but re-states his position that it is of English origin.",
