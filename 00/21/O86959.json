It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nHands Across The Sea was originally performed at the Phoenix Theatre in January 1936 in the series of Coward's one-act plays produced  under the umbrella title Tonight at 8.30.  Dame Sybil Thorndike began her career touring with Ben Greet's Company and became a leading lady in Manchester for Miss Horniman's Repertory Company.  She was at the Old Vic Theatre from 1914 to 1918 where she played several Shakespeare heroines, but was well known for her versatility, and was created Dame of the British Empire in 1931.",
