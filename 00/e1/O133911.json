His second Christian name is wrongly given as John in DNB. Apprenticed for two years with James Baker Pyne in Bristol; a Member of the Bristol Sketching Club. Exhibited 17 works at the RA between 1833 and 1845, 14 at the BI 1840-45, and ten at the SBA 1836-40. Travelled extensively, making drawings which he used later for finished and exhibited paintings: seven months in Germany, Switzerland and Italy with the watercolourist George Fripp 1834-5, Greece, Egypt, Malta and Naples 1838-9, and Turkey 1843-5. Suffering from a heart condition, he died young in Bristol 8 September 1845. His studio sale was at Christie's 1-3 April 1846, and his work achieved high prices for some years after. A sketchbook and several watercolours are also in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1845, p318 (obit); Art Journal 1864, pp293-5; N Solly Life of William James M\u00fcller 1875; C Bunt The Life and Work of William James M\u00fcller Leigh-on-sea 1948; William James M\u00fcller Bristol City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1962; there was an exhibition of M\u00fcller's work at the Tate Gallery 1985, but no catalogue seems to have been published. \nSt Benet's Abbey \nP63-1917 Neg 18948 \nCanvas, 52.7 \u00d7 73.7 cm (29 \u00be \u00d7 29 ins) \nSigned and dated 'W J M[in monogram]\u00fcller/1833' br \nH L Florence Bequest 1817 \nOn the reverse, an old inscription on the stretcher reads 'The Ruins of St Bennetts Priory Norfolk/now used as a Windmill, for Grinding Corn'. The few remains of the abbey are at Homing, some 15 miles from Norwich; the most conspicuous part of the ruin is the 15th-century gateway. According to Solly (pp12-3), M\u00fcller visited Norfolk and Suffolk early in 1831; in 1833, the date of the present work, he toured Wales, Ireland, and Somerset. The painting does not seem to have been exhibited. \nPROV: \tPresumably in the G R Bumett sale, Christie's 13 February 1875 (141), bought Prance \u00a3367 10s (Redford (Sales) refers to a 'St Benet's Abbey and Mill, Norfolk' in a G R Bumett sale at Christie's in 1860; it does not appear in the catalogue of 24 March) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
