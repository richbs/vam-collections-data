Linocut was particularly favoured by him as a medium throughout the 1920s and 1930s. It provided a means of obtaining a strong linear pattern within an overall painterly surface. Linoleum was also very cheap and easily accessible, which encouraged spontaneity. Ben Nicholson printed in very small editions, usually giving the prints away as presents, but an impression of Three Mugs and a Bowl was in his own possession at the time of his death, suggesting it was a favourite.",
