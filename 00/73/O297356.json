The flowing style and motif are in the Japanese style, or 'Japonisme', popular in the art and design of the period 1890-1900. The panel was originally designed and made as part of an interior scheme for the Magpie and Stump. The architect and designer, C.R. Ashbee designed and built this house on Chelsea Embankment in 1893-4 for himself, his mother and his sisters. The leather was modelled by Bill Hardiman, a member of the Guild of Handicraft, founded in Mile End, London by Ashbee in 1888. Members of the Guild lived and worked together on metalwork, jewellery, furniture and books. Hardiman, who joined the Guild in 1890 and left in 1906, became the chief modeller for metalwork but also worked on leather panels for upholstery and for wall coverings.",

Ashbee, who founded the Guild, designed and built this house on Chelsea Embankment for himself, his mother and sisters in 1893-4. The leather panels were used to cover the wall at the back of the hall against which the staircase was placed. \n\nIn 1966 the Museum was given the opportunity to remove the leather panels from the house before it was demolished.",
