It was part of an elaborate centrepiece in Chinese taste modelled by the chief modeller at the factory J.J. K\u00e4ndler for King Augustus III's influential first minister, Count Heinrich von Br\u00fchl.  \n\nThis example was left white, probably as it suffered some firing damage during manufacture.  A few coloured examples survive, one in the Dresden Museum shows the accompanying pieces designed with it, namely an elaborate stand, two sugar shakers modelled as embracing Chinese couples, oil and vinegar bottles shaped as Chinese man and a lady riding a hen and a cockerel, and a pair of Chinese figures holding shell-shaped spice holders.",
