The machine-washable jacket is printed with a design of garden flowers and scattered typography.  The jacket reflects elements from 18th- and 19th-century men's tailoring, combined with the designer's approach to construction.  The hipster trousers recall 1960s styles.",

In Vogue, January 1994, he declared 'I am not interesested in fashion' and yet remains at the forefront of contemporary British fashion.  His clothes are technically and conceptually complex as well as stylish and wearable.",
