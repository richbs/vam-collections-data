These seal impressions were then attached to different types of legal document to signify approval, thereby authenticating them, just as a signature functions today.\n\n Ecclesiastical seals would have been used by individual officers within the Church and by all religious institutions, for instance cathedrals, monasteries and abbeys. The Virgin Mary was a very popular subject on seals, both for individuals and institutions.As well as images of the Virgin Mary or of Christ, ecclesiastical institutions often used images of their patron saint, or their coats of arms on their seals.",

These seals survive most commonly in the shape of a pointed oval. Ecclesiastical seals were used both by individual offices within the Church, such as archbishop or abbot, and by religious institutions like monasteries and abbeys. The Franciscan order of Pisa owned this matrix. Although it cannot be specifically identified, the iconography of the seal is in keeping with the imagery of ecclesiastical seals in the medieval period. The Virgin Mary was a popular subject for depiction. Monasteries often included images of their patron saint, or senior members of their order upon their seals.\n\nThe Franciscan Order (Officially known as the <i>Ordo Fratrum Minorum</i>, the \u2018Order of the Little Brothers\u2019), was founded by Francis of Assisi (1181-1226). The friars of the order followed a lifestyle of poverty and rejected  worldly possessions. Unlike many other impoverished preachers of the period, St Francis and his followers were strictly Orthodox and upheld all aspects of Christian Doctrine.

            "historical_context_note": "Seal matricies, made of base or precious metal, are used to stamp an impression into wax. Motifs were carved into a metal matrix, which was pressed into softened wax to leave the reverse of the carved image. Wax seals were placed at the end of documents (or occasionally suspended from ribbons or thongs of parchment) to authenticate them, and served the same function as a signature. Individuals, institutions and officers of State all used seals.\n\nSeals were made up of two elements; motifs (known as <i>types</i>) and inscriptions (called <i>legends</i>). These elements identified the owner of the seal through the use of image and word. A king for example, might use the image of his personal coat of arms with an inscription of his name on his seal. Each combination of <i>type</i> and <i>legend</i> was unique, which meant that seals provided good proof that a document was genuine.\n\nSeals were used both by laymen and churchmen.  As they were valuable items for authentication, they were often kept for safety in the possession of important members of office. The Keeper of the Privy Seal for example, held the personal seal of the King of England from 14th century onwards. Many seal matricies, including this example, have pierced loops at the back from which the matrix could be suspended around the neck or attached to a girdle.",
