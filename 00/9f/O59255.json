It was made by the largest and best-known furniture-making firm in Paris in the 1800s, Jacob-Desmalter. The firm had been founded in 1765 by Georges Jacob, who supplied carved furniture and chairs for Queen Marie Antoinette (1755-93) before the French Revolution. During the revolutionary years, Jacob took care to maintain favour with whichever government currently ruled France. In 1796 his sons took over the business, and in 1803 the firm of Jacob Fr\u00e8res changed its name to Jacob-Desmalter. The Emperor Napoleon spent huge sums on redecorating the former royal palaces, and the firm undertook much of the work. Its workshops also supplied furniture to members of the new imperial court.\n\nNey ordered this chair as part of a suite of furniture for his house in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Saisseval. It stood in the Petit Salon. An inventory of the house, taken after his execution in 1815, listed the furniture of the Petit Salon as of mahogany with upholstery of blue brocaded satin. The current brown upholstery was probably put onto the chair in the 1930s.",

As all three groups carry the same paper label referring to a set of 16, they were clearly treated as one set as early as 1816, when they were in the possession of Sir Charles Stuart. The similarity of elements of these armchairs to many other sets of seat furniture supplied to Jacob Freres and Jacob-Desmalter makes identification from inventories and accounts particularly difficult. The motifs were widely used by the firm of Jacob from c. 1800, both for mahogany chairs and for giltwood. These are close to a set of seat furniture now at Malmaison, in the Salon de Compagnie, originally supplied for Saint Cloud.",
