            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 275-76\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"STANFIELD, Clarkson, RA (1793-1867) \n\nBorn Sunderland 3 December 1793, son of an actor and wine merchant. Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \nHMS 'Victory' Towed into Gibraltar \n681-1893 NegFJ2281 \nMillboard, 28.9 X 44.5 (11 ?  X 17 \u00bd ins) Bequeathed by Miss E Anderson 1893 \n\nThe work is described in the 1893 correspondence between the museum and the donor's executor, Field Stanfield, the artist's son, (see the entry for 680-1893, above) as 'an interesting and valuable work of this artist being the finished sketch of the large and well known picture of the same subject now at Somer Leyton'. The large (176 X 262 cm/69\u00bc X 103\u00bc ins) painting was exhibited at the RA in 1853 (57); it was commissioned by Sir Samuel Morton Peto MP, who sold his collection in 1862 to Francis Crossley MP, whose son became the 1st Lord Somerleyton, in whose family collection the picture remains. \nThe RA painting was much admired by the critics. The Athenaeum found it 'full of poetry and movement' (7 May 1853, p566), the Art Journal 'painted with admirable spirit and precision, constituting this the most interesting marine picture which its author has for some time past exhibited' (1853, pI42), and the Examiner noted the 'sense of pathos and solemnity', admiring especially the treatment of the sea, concluding that it was 'a triumph of art; for without the use of any melodramatic accessories, or coarse suggestions of gloom, Mr Stanfield has succeeded in conveying the idea of a great sorrow' (1853, pp277, 326). The work was engraved by John Cousen (see the Examiner 1853, p358). Dafforne (p18) commented: \n\nNever, perhaps, was so impressive a subject so touchingly and powerfully painted ... It is a work not to be seen without emotion; there is grandeur in the conception, and masterly carrying-out of the diversified materials. The water is eminently successful- full, flowing, transparent and deep; the ships and boats are solid and rich in colour, and the aerial perspective of the giant Rock of Gibraltar is well managed, while the whole is brought together in perfect harmony. \n\n\nThe full title of the RA picture was given in the catalogue, together with lines of verse (possibly written by Stanfield himself) and an 'epigraph' by Lieutenant Paul Harris Nicolas: \nHMS 'The Victory' (With the body of Nelson on board) towed into Gibraltar 28th of October, 1805, seven days after the battle of Trafalgar. 'Battle stained and tempest tossed, a mighty ship comes on,lNo shout of triumph welcomes her for the glorious victory won,/For she carries her dead admiral, killed in Trafalgar's Bay,/And Nelson's flag hangs droopingly on that triumphant day./Sail on, proud ship! thy battered hull proclaims thy place in war,/A fitting bier for him who fell in the fight at Trafalgar.' Disabled ships continued to arrive for several days, bringing with them the only four prizes rescued from the fury of the late gale. The anchorage became covered with ships. In the mole lay six dismasted hulls, whose battered sides, dismounted guns, and shattered ports presented unequivocal evidence of the brilliant part they had taken in the gloriously contested battle; a little beyond, the more recently arrived lay at their anchors. At this proud moment no shout of exultation was heard, no joyous felicitations were exchanged, for the lowered flag which waved on the Victory's mast marked where the mourned hero lay, and cast a deepened shade over the triumphant scene. \nVan der Merwe (pI63) lists three other versions of the subject: an oil on panel, 45.7 X 69.9 cm (18 X 27 \u00bd ins), signed and dated 1854, in the Guildhall Art Gallery; an oil on canvas, 86.4 X 137.2 cm (34 X 54 ins), with Messrs Appleby in 1972; and an oil 41.9 X 53.3 cm (16\u00bd X 21 ins) in an American private collection. Another replica, attributed to Stanfield, 'with signature and indistinctly dated 1842' (which seems unlikely), 70.5 X 91.5 cm (27\u00be X 36 ins), was sold at Christie's 1 March 1985 (87). A copy, 44.5 X 58.5 cm (17 1/2 X 23 ins), is in the Greenwich Hospital collection, on loan to the National Maritime Museum. \nStanfield painted three subjects related to the battle at Cape Trafalgar: apart from the present work, 'The Battle of Trafalgar' was commissioned by the United Services Club and exhibited at the RA in 1836 (290, a copy is in the National Maritime Museum, 94 X 152.5 cm/37 X 60 ins), and 'The Morning Following the Battle of Trafalgar; the situation of HMS The Defence and her prize, El Sant Ildefonso' exhibited at the RA in 1863 (123, now National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia). M Butlin and E Joll (in The Paintings of J M W Turner 1977, I, p208) have drawn attention to the revival in the 1830s of 'interest ... in the dwindling number of veteran ships from the Napoleonic Wars', with particular reference of course to Turner's \"The Fighting Temeraire ... '\" (exhibited RA 1839 (43), now National Gallery) and cite Louis Hawes's opinion that Turner also offers 'a portrayal of the more general theme of the decline of Britain's mercantile power'. Interestingly, Turner also appended lines of verse to the title of his painting in the RA catalogue: the lines were taken from Thomas Campbell's celebrated Ye Mariners of England (written 1800) and may be compared to Stanfield's verse quoted above. For a full discussion of the subject of the present work, see van der Merwe's catalogue. \nIn 1941, the work was displayed near the Exhibition Road entrance of the museum; according to a note on the Department files, a fragment from a German bomb travelled across Exhibition Road, through the oak doors, winged a pilaster, passed through two plywood screens, and through the backboard, millboard, and glass of the painting, finally coming to rest in a pillar of the Octagon Court. The picture was restored after 1945. \nEXH: British Empire Exhibition Wembley 1924 \nLIT: \tvan der Merwe 1979, pp163-4 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
