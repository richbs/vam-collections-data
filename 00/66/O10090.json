The loops of the pile may be cut or left uncut, and it can be woven in different fibres to suit its purpose. This velvet has a ground structure woven from linen thread, with a woollen pile, and some pattern details highlighted in linen.\n\nMaterials, Making & Use\nWoollen velvet was woven in different qualities for different furnishing uses. The most hard-wearing was suitable for carpeting, and was usually patterned, with different colours in the pile incorporated during the weaving. Patterned woollen velvet of the quality of this example was soft and flexible, and suitable for the upholstered seats and backs of furniture. It would have been less expensive and more hard-wearing than a silk velvet of equivalent complexity of design and colouring. Plain woollen velvet was also produced, and could have a pattern stamped onto it with heated metal plates.",
