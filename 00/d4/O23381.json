The garment is of the usual kimono construction and has the addition of extra material either side of the front opening. There is a short overcollar of white cr\u00eape silk. The sleeves are open to just under halfway at the wrist side, and at the body side they are left open until they join the main body garment.\nThe kimono is made up of two different materials each having different designs. The top section down to about hip level and including the greater part of each sleeve is in a thin plain weave silk. This has a diagonally-aligned wood grain pattern in turquoise, green and white produced by sequentially stitching, gathering, knotting and dyeing the fabric. The bottom part of the kimono, the straight neckband, the wrist openings and the inside sleeve edges are of black silk cr\u00eape. On either side of the front opening, inside as well as outside, a tree design has been resisted out against the black and touches of embroidery in grey, white and silver have been added.\nThe main body of the garment down to hip level is lined with cream plain weave silk, and below hip level with black silk cr\u00eape. The sleeves are lined with red plain weave silk and they have an inside cuff lining of black silk cr\u00eape.",
