This unusual form of recreation attracted the public attention, and crowds came to his estate, Hawarden, to watch him at work. Many took home with them as souvenirs pieces of trees he had felled and made them into family heirlooms such as picture frames and book covers.\n\nHis opponents in parliament tried to score political points using this unusual hobby. In a speech on financial reform, Lord Randolph Churchill famously stated, \u2018For the purposes of recreation he has selected the felling of trees; and we may usefully remark that his amusements, like his politics, are essentially destructive. Every afternoon the whole world is invited to assist at the crashing fall of some beech or elm or oak. The forest laments in order that Mr Gladstone may perspire.'\n\nThe design registration mark on the back of the brooch shows that the design was registered in 1883.  The Birmingham hallmark appears to be for 1898-9, which suggests that this example may have been made to meet public demand following Gladstone's death in 1898.",
