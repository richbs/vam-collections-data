The gold filigree work set with turquoise and pearls is finished with a coral bead and the entire button is secured through a small loop with twisted wire.  The buttons fasten across the chest, leaving the skirt part of the coat open.  This facilitates movement, allowing the embroidered garments worn beneath, as well as the coat's bright blue cotton lining, to be seen.  The coat forms the top layer of an outfit that was collected between 1928 and 1932 in Khotan.  The ensemble shows a mix of stylistic elements and materials from China, India and Afghanistan; it can be compared with other garments in the V & A which come from culturally, though not politically, allied regions.",
