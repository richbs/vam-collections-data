Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThis white silk parasol has a cord either end of the cover, one attached to the ferrule (decorative tip of the parasol) to enable it to be held with the cover facing up and one around the rib tips to hold the cover closed when it is held facing down. The wooden stick and ferrule are both carved and painted to look like coral. This example also has an additional piece of matching silk on the inside covering the supportive structure of the shade.",
