St Anthony was originally from Portugal but he became a Franciscan monk in Italy and died there in Padua in 1231. He is often seen carrying a lily, as here, which is a symbol of his purity. \n\nAccording to a Life of St Anthony, the saint had a vision of the Virgin Mary carrying the infant Christ. In the art of the Counter Reformation, when the Roman Catholic Church was revived in the period from about 1540-1650, St Anthony himself is often depicted holding the Christ Child, as shown here.\n\nMuch of the stained glass designed for religious settings was removed from its original location and dispersed. This was often the result of religious and political upheavals.",
