They were worn tucked into the sash that formed a belt around such a man\u2019s coat. Daggers were a sign of status as much as a weapon, and they were often richly decorated. The hilt of this dagger is faced with a shiny metal, perhaps silver, set with what appear to be hardstones, including turquoises. The sheath has glossy lacquer decoration: the wood was coated with gesso, painted in colours and gold, and varnished. Even the blade, which is of fine watered steel \u2013 a high-furnaced steel with a surface resembling watered silk \u2013 has small areas of decoration inlaid in gold.",
