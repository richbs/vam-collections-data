Beene became particularly known for his highly constructed, 'architectural' dresses but during the late 1960s he also turned to popular culture for inspiration and introduced touches of whimsy into his designs. \n\nThis wedding dress, accessorised with a Frank Olive hat with a soft brim and a pair of Herbert Levine shoes, was worn by Catharina Oeschger to marry Peter Tinniswood at St Nicholas' Church, Thames Ditton, on August 9 1975. Before her marriage, Catharina had worked as a model for Geoffrey Beene in the 1960s and 1970s. He designed and made the elegantly understated dress exclusively for her. As the day was extremely hot, Catharina changed into her dress behind the church organ so that its linen fabric would not be wrinkled for the ceremony.",
