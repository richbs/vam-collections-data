Technical improvements in the casting of both base and precious metal candlesticks also substantially altered their form.\n\nIn the mid 1760s, when neo-classicism was popular, the characteristic shape for candlesticks was a straight or tapering column on a raised square or oval base. This example from about 1780. Later, beaded, engraved and relief ornament was added, and neo-classical types probably continued to be made in brass long after they had ceased to be popular in silver. Production of these candlesticks was further simplified by the development of casting the stem in one piece using a removable core, a process called hollow core casting. This allowed for a much finer and thinner casting to be made for both the base and the stem. It also encouraged the development of the multi-faceted candlestick form in the early 19th century, which was only made in brass. \n\nThe use of hollow core castings changed the method of extraction of the candle stump. The most frequent method of removal in use from the early 18th century onwards was a push-rod extractor, which this example has. It consisted of a disc in the nozzle connected by an iron rod passing through the hollow stem to a brass button under the base.",
