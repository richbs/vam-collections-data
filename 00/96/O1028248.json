This draw- \ning is one of several studies for the whole \ncomposition made in Antwerp before 1621, \nand there are others still extant in the  \nAmsterdam Historisch Museum, the Mus\u00e9e \ndu Petit Palais, Paris, and the Mus\u00e9e du \nLouvre, Paris. It is an early study which is \ncharacterized by the dramatic treatment of its \nsubject, achieved through free and incisive \ndraughtsmanship, bold use of chiaroscuro, and \na compositional structure in which a series of \npronounced diagonals lead from the bottom  \nleft to the upper right through the inclined  \nbody of Christ. In this and other studies, Van \nDyck was able to experiment with the content, \nstructure and mood of his final paintings \n(ultimately the subject is treated with far more \nrestraint and stability); the drawings are thus \nthe projections of his thought process as well \nas essays to be valued in their own right.\u2019 \n(J.
