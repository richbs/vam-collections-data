The jama traditionally fastens at one side and is secured under the arm with ties. The ties were often made into a decorative feature, either by being in a contrasting colour or by being beautifully designed in their own right, as they are here. A simpler set of ties at the waist holds the robe closed.\n\nThis robe fastens on the right, which traditionally denotes a Muslim wearer, with Hindus fastening their robes on the left. This practice, supposedly introduced by the Mughal Emperor Akbar (1555-1605), was not rigidly imposed or observed, but can serve as a useful aid when identifying subjects of court portraits.",
