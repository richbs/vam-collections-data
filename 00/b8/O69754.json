In his left hand he holds the cross-staff and banner of the Resurrection which rests on a small protruding ledge in front of the tomb. He steps from the tomb with his right leg, straight onto the chest of a moustachioed soldier. The soldier wears a pointed basinet, an unusually loose low-belted tunic with wide sleeves, gauntlets and leg armour; he lies asleep across the front of the panel, resting his head on his right hand. Three more figures of apparently sleeping soldiers, wearing low-belted jupons, are represented on the panel, one seated on a ledge on the right of the tomb, leaning his head on his hand supported by his battle-axe, his feet resting on another ledge. The second, behind him, holds a lance and the third behind the tomb on the left of the panel, leans on a spear which he holds in his left hand resting it on the ground in front of the tomb. A half-length figure of an angel, hands presumably raised in prayer, is shown on the top left corner of the panel. \n\nChrist's right hand and most of his cross-staff are missing. The head and hands of the angel are missing. The top of the spear held by the soldier on the left of the panel is missing. There are various small cracks in the panel. There are two holes through the panel by the left leg of the recumbent soldier in the foreground.\n\nGreen paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. The soldiers' faces are blackened to show their villainy. The background of the top of the panel is gilt. The halo behind Christ is painted blue. \n\nThe back of the panel is marked with two long parallel scratches and a large X, formed of two scratches. There are three holes drilled in the back, filled with lead, and holding latten wires. The bottom has been cut away.",
