Much of the detail of the carving has been removed or softened through subsequent polishing of the metal. The blade is signed \u2018Made and carved by Nobukuni in the precincts of the Hachiman Temple at Hakozaki in Chikushu [Chikuzen on Kyushu] on a lucky day of the first month of the third year of the Shotoku period\u2019. This date is equivalent to the year 1713.\n\nThe tang or \u2018nakago\u2019 - the part of the blade that goes into the handle - was where most inscriptions were carved and a wealth of information can be found there. This might include not only the smith\u2019s name, but also the date and place of manufacture, the owner\u2019s name, dedicatory or admonitory inscriptions, and the name of the person who created the decorative carving on the blade (\u2018horimono\u2019). Also carved on the tang were records of any cutting tests - a practice established during the Edo period (1600-1868), when official blade appraisers tested swords in various prescribed ways, often using condemned criminals or their corpses, which were sometimes bundled together to increase resistance to the cut. As fashions and styles of fighting changed, good early blades might be shortened and remounted in more contemporary styles. During a shortening process much, or indeed all, of the information on the tang could be lost and even the simple act of drilling a new hole for the securing pin could obscure important information.",
