Most of them were abandoned after his death in 1315, but this gateway is the most notable addition he made. It is 17.2 metres square.\n\nThe mosque and gateway are made out of rubble. It is the first of many Indian Islamic monuments to use a combination of white marble and red sandstone for the fa\u00e7ade. The plainness of this northern fa\u00e7ade is in marked contrast to the highly decorated southern fa\u00e7ade (see Museum no. 53225). \n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
