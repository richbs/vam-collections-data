(1829-1896)</b>\n\nPreliminary drawing for the oil painting \u2018Ferdinand lured by Ariel\u2019 (1849).  On the back are sketches, showing alternative standing and kneeling poses, of a young man clasping a woman\u2019s hands and holding them to his shoulders while about to kiss her; in two of the sketches there are attendant figures.\n<i>Inscribed on the back</i> Fanny Ludlow [?] <i>and with isolated words.  Numbered on the back</i> 22.\n<i>Pencil.  Size of sheet</i> 25.4 x 15.9 cm.\nE.311-1952\n\nBequeathed by Miss Rose Shipman\n\n<i>Note:</i> This drawing is illustrated on p.84 of Vol. I of <i>The Life and Letters of Sir J. Millais</i> by J. G. Millais, London, 1899.   The sitter for the figure of Ferdinand was Frederic George Stephens (1828-1907), painter and art critic.  The painting was No. 504 in the Royal Academy Exhibition, 1850.  The sketches on the back partly reflect the composition of \u2018Christ in the house of His parents\u2019, also painted in 1849.\u201d",
