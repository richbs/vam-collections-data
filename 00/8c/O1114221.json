Members of the audience are asked to choose one or more cards from the pack. These are replaced but magically reveal themselves by rising up from the pack in turn. Many methods of creating this trick have been devised. In 1947 the magician Devano invented a version in which the cards were placed in a drinking glass. The spectator could hold the glass and request a particular card to rise up, and it would obey the command.",
