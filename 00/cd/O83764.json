In 1969, the company launched a clothing range based on Edwardian summer dresses and gardening smocks. These designs captured the escapist mood and pastoral style popular throughout the 1970s in Britain and North American.  From the early 1970s Laura Ashley expanded, with shops established across Britain, Europe and the United States. \n\nThe pavement-sweeping style of this full-length dress features the sprigged cottons for which Laura Ashley became known, prints which exploited the British love of country life.",
