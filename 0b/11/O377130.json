Parts of the case are from different periods; the rams' head masks date from the 1760s; the other sections are probably 19th century reproductions although the central mask and finial are of good quality.  In an early 18th century clock, the movement would have been contained within in a polished back. This clock was made in the period 1830-1860 with the intent to deceive. The central dial does not fit the case. The surface chasing is too precise and busy for early 18th century work.",
