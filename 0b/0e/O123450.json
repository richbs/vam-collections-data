In the nineteenth century the area was considered to have fresh, unpolluted air and ragarded as a resort for health and holidays. William Mulready lived and worked in this area from around 1811. It was also a neighbourhood that was popular with other artists such as A.W. Callcott, John Linnell, William Collins and David Wilkie, all of whose work is represented in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nThis painting, dated to 1812/13 followed an earlier work of 1811/123 entitled  The Mall, Kensington Gravel Pits, number FA.136 in the V&A.",

Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \n\nNear the Mall, Kensington Gravel Pits\nFA135 Neg 76917 \nCanvas, 34 \u00d7 47.3 cm (13 \u00bd \u00d7 18 \u00be ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nAccording to the 1907 catalogue, painted in 1813, but more probably 1812, as recorded in the 1844 Art Union and the 1864 catalogue. It was originally rejected by the RA, and not exhibited until 1844. According to Stephens, this and FA136 below were commissioned through the painter A W Callcott, but were refused; eventually the present work was sold 'for a very small sum to Mr Welsh ... a singing master of some reputation'. \nThe Art Union critic called it 'A pendant to \"The Mall\" [FA136, below] and painted in the following year, 1812. This little picture has much the feeling and character of the other. Both are gems of rare value.' When they were exhibited again, at the Society of Arts in 1848, the Art Union found them 'simple in subject, but so extraordinary in execution and feeling, as to place them on a level with the very best productions of the kind that have ever been seen'. \nPointon (pp21-4) discusses this area of Kensington in the 19th century: 'with its gravel walks and unpolluted air [it] was regarded as a resort for health and holidays ...'. he area was called the Kensington Gravel Pits, now known as Notting Hill Gate. Other artists who lived and worked there in the early 19th-century included A W Callcott, John Linnell, William Collins and David Wilkie. Mulready had moved there by 1811. \nA pen and ink drawing, and a pencil sketch of the same area are also in the V&A collections. \nEXH: \tRA 1844 (334); Society of Arts 1848 (XXVII); William Mulready South Kensington Museum 1864 (36); Drawings by William Mulready V&A 1972 (61a); William Mulready V&A 1986 (23) \nLIT: \tArt Union 1844, p161, 1848, p208; Stephens 1867, pp66-7, 118; Rorimer pp46-7; Pointon pp24, 28, 47-9, 106, repr. in colour pl V. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
