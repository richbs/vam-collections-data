            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. \nThis inro is part of a unique set of 12 calendar inro by Shibata Zeshin, each representing a different month of the year. All 12 inro are of a different shape and size, while the decoration is carried out in different lacquer techniques. \nZeshin usually referred to a particular month by depicting some aspect of a popular or religious festival that took place at that time. This inro representing the seventh month is in the form of a silk-winder with a kaji, or type of mulberry leaf. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Weaver\u2019s Festival (tanabata) was celebrated. This marked the annual meeting between Shokujo, the Weaver Princess Star, and Kengiu, the Herdboy Star. According to legend, the princess, a most skilful and industrious weaver, fell in love with an oxherd. As a result of her hard work, they were allowed to marry. However, they soon began to neglect their duties and they were separated to opposite sides of the Milky Way. They were only allowed to meet once a year at tanabata. On this day, the princess received the supplication of those who wished to improve their weaving and sewing skills. At this time, it was also customary for young girls to write poems on pairs of kaji leaves. One leaf would traditionally be placed under the pillow, while the other would be cast into the heavenly river, ensuring future success in love and marriage.\nFrom the 1700s onwards, many artists signed the inro they made. This example is by Shibata Zeshin (1807-91), one of the most talented and renowned lacquer artists of the 19th century. He was head of a successful workshop with an enormous output.",
