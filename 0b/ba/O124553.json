            "physical_description": "A concertina-action card table, with large lobed corners supported on long cabriole legs with lapped knees and pad feet. It is veneered with a dark and light stripy wood, and has legs of a solid dark exotic wood -- possibly all cocus wood, though the veneer looks potentially like a fruitwood such as plum. The top, with the striped veneer arranged diagonally in four quarters, is edged with a narrow feather-banding, within a cross-banded border of alternating wide and narrow dark and light wood, which extends to cover the upright edge -- curiously, on the back edge as well as the front and sides, although this is only visible during the moments when the table is pulled into the room but not yet opened. Similar veneers (with still wider dark bands) are applied to the four frieze rails. The carcase appears to be made of oak throughout -- the veneered top and veneered frieze rails -- except for the legs. \n\nThe top folds out to reveal a green-baize-lined interior, with four recesses for holding the players' counters, which are again veneered in light and dark bands; so are the circles at the four lobed corners, in such a way as to form a dark cross defined by pale borders at each corner. When the folding rails are extended, they are each held in place by a hook and ring -- the ring fixed to one half of the rail, the hook to the other, and turned to engage in the ring and straddle the joint so as to prevent the two halves of the rail from folding inwards. The hooks differ from each other, but neither is original; on both sides there is a disused hole for an earlier, slightly longer hook. \n\nThe butt hinge at the back of each folding rail is fixed solely to the rail and the short section of frieze extending from the top of the leg (above the ear), so that when the legs are extended the hinge lies in a straight line (rather than being at an angle as it would if one leaf were fixed to the back rail); the hinge leaves are consequently very narrow. The leaves of each hinge taper in thickness towards the outer edges, and each leaf is fixed by one central screw and four nails. The quadrant hinges securing the two halves of each folding rail to each other are fixed entirely with nails. \n\nThe baize has been renewed. The back left leg has been damaged and repaired.",
