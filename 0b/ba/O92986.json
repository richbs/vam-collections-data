It was driven by improvements in the supply of zinc combined with an increasing understanding of the chemical structure of the alloy. At the same time brass founders began to favour moulds of sand instead of clay. This reduced the cost of casting, and soon the range of cast brass goods increased dramatically. By the 19th century, brass had become extremely versatile and inexpensive and the applications were almost endless.\n\nThis quill-pen cutter in gilt brass is a simple mechanical device of a type that would have been widely produced. Mechanical quill cutters were developed in the late 17th century to solve the problem of trimming a feather into a useable pen. In 1729, Isaac de la Chaumette recorded a patent for \u2018a pen knife yt make ye pen at once\u2019 although no details survive. This French quill cutter works by screwing the blades down onto the scoop of the quill to cut and slit the nib.",
