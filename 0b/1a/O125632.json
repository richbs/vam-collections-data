The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.  They represented a wide variety of subjects but those of actors and actresses were especially popular. \n\nThis represents King John of England (1167-1216), the youngest son of Henry II signing the Magna Carta.  After a failed attempt to seize the crown from his brother, King Richard, John was crowned in 1199, and at Runneymede in 1215 signed the Magna Carta, the basis of the English constitution.  Shakespeare's wrote his play The Life and Death of King John in 1596-8 and its production at the Princess's Theatre in 1852 with Charles Kean in the title role, may have been the impetus for the production of this figure.",
