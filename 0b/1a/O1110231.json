            "bibliography": "Paul Starkey & Janet Starkey, eds. &lt;u&gt;Travellers in Egypt&lt;/u&gt;; Chapter 16 \u2013 Two interpretations of Islamic Domestic Interios in Cairo: J F Lewis and Frank Dillon by Bryony Llewellyn.\nFrank Dillon visited Egypt four times between the 1850s and 1870s. During his second visit in 1861-62 he lived with two fellow artists in an Arab house in Giza, and made several local contacts. It was probably these that on his third visit in 1869-70 enabled him to gain access to two old Mamluk-style houses: the mid-seventeenth century house built by Raduan Bey, an influential emir, and the probably eighteenth-century \u2018House of the Mufti\u2019, which derived its name from the Shaykh al-\u2018Abbasi al-Mahdi, the mufti or judge of Egypt, who owned the house between 1847 and 1866. Both these houses are notable examples of the large residences built in Cairo during the Mamluk period, containing airy reception rooms with painted tiled carved and stuccoed decoration. Many still survived in Cairo until the mid-nineteenth century, but then fell rapidly into disrepair. By the time Dillon visited these two, they were already in some decay, and his concern was to record them before they crumbled completely. They may even have been more or less empty, looked after only by caretakers, Five watercolours by Dillon show different parts of the house of Raduan Bey, including an exterior view of the maq\u2019ad or loggia, an interior of the same loggia, and the mandara or ground-floor reception room. Three further watercolours depict the \u2018House of the Mufti\u2019: one shows its large mandara, another a liwan or recess in the room, and another a prayer niche at the eastern end of the same room.\nOn his last visit to Cairo, in 1873-74, Dillon gained access to a third house, which he identified as that of the Shaykh Sadat. His four watercolours of it show the hawsh or courtyard, the mandara, the qa\u2019a or largest room of the upper apartments for the women, and another smaller room on an upper floor.\nThese watercolours may have been painted by Dillon in Cairo: some are quick sketches on rough, possibly local paper, others are more finished with architectural and decorative details more carefully delineated and the paint, a mixture of watercolour and body-colour, more thickly applied.\nOn his return to England, Dillon used these as the basis for more elaborate watercolours and oil paintings which he exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere, notably \u2018Apartment in the Harem of the Sheikh Sadat\u2019 (c. 1875-76), in watercolour, and \u2018Recess in the Madarah of the House of the Mufti\u2019 (1872), in oils. In these the figures are slightly more substantial, but they are still generalised rather than real individuals. In the \u2018Sheikh Sadat\u2019 picture Dillon has made an attempt to relate them to one another and to the viewer outside the picture space, but despite their undoubted charm, they retain an element of stiffness and artificiality.\nThe particular value of Dillon\u2019s Oriental interiors is as vivid and accomplished portrayals of real houses. He creates atmosphere through his carefully observed rendering of the effects of bright sunlight filtered through the mashrabiyya windows onto richly decorated surfaces. Their interest lies in the depiction of the houses themselves, for their own sakes, rather than in events taking place within them or in the relationships between individuals who inhabited them.\nBy the 1870s the modernisation of the city meant that old houses were actually being destroyed and Dillon was aware that he was recording buildings and architectural decoration that would soon no longer exist. He later became active among a group of people committed to the preservation of Islamic buildings in Cairo, and displayed his watercolours during at least one meeting held at the RIBA to discuss Arab houses in Cairo.\n",
