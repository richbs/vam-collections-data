Cut paper work was a popular pastime from the late 17th century, although there are examples by artists from before then.  This example is more sophisticated than the work of most amateurs.  As a three-dimensional piece, it has required even more skill than that normally demanded of the paper cutter.  Each flower has had to be created individually, and then the individual parts of the design united to create an ensemble.\n\nPeople\nThe locket is inscribed on the back in an 18th-century hand: 'Honble Mrs O'Neile, August 1786'.  This is probably the Honourable Mrs John O'Neill (1756-1793), born Henrietta Boyle.  Mrs O'Neill's title was 'the Honorable' because she was the daughter of a Lord, in her case Charles Boyle, Lord Dunganon.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis is a particularly small and accomplished example of cut paper work. This object has not merely been created as an exercise, even if such intricate work was considered beneficial for the sight.  The locket setting seems to be original, sealed with wax, and is likely to have made a handsome gift for a friend or relative of Mrs O'Neill.",

Mrs. O'Neile August 1786. \n<i>Miniature cut-paper work on brown painted card, in a locket.</i>  5.1 x 3.8 cm.     \nP.26-1963 \n\nGiven by Miss Eleanor M. Powel \n \n<i>Note:</i> This locket was formerly in the collection of the donor's grandmother Miss Sally Caroline Fitzgerald, at County Clare, Ireland, who married Basil Cochrane in 1839.  The artist whose name is inscribed on the back can in all probability be identified with the Hon. Henrietta O'Neill, daughter of Charles Boyle, Lord Dungarvan.  She married, in 1777, John O'Neill, who became first Viscount O'Neill in 1795.  In 1786, therefore, she would be described as the Hon. Mrs. O'Neill by virtue of being the daughter of a lord.  She was a person of considerable capabilities; see <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1833, pt.2, p.130 ff.\"",

Mrs. O\u2019Neill by virtue of being the daughter of a lord.  She was a person of considerable capabilities; see <i>The Gentleman\u2019s Magazine</i>, 1833, pt.2, p.130 ff.\n \nThis locket was formerly in the collection of the donor\u2019s grandmother Miss Sally Caroline Fitzgerald, at County Clare, Ireland, who married Basil Cochrane in 1839.",
