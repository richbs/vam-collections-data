            "physical_description": "A circular box of smooth marbled lacquer, predominantly brown and red.\nFORM: A circular box on a raised foot, 0.7cms high*0.35cms thick. The upper and lower halves each have a 'stepped' profile, and the top of the lid is slightly domed. The lower half is fitted with a riser, 0.7cms high*0.3cms thick, which is flush with the interior. The foot and both halves are slightly irregular, not truly circular.\nCORE: The core, visible through areas of damage, is of softwood or bamboo, with a thick layer of a gritty composition between it and the lacquer. There is no visual evidence of a layer of fabric.\nSURFACE: The interior currently lacquered a patchy dark brown, the exterior with the typical irregular pattern of whorls and spirals, less random on the top than on the sides. This surface achieved by building up irregularly patterned layers of red, brown, ochre and green which were subsequently polished flat. The red and brown tones predominate.\nPROVENANCE: Formerly in the collection of Fritz Low-Beer, and illustrated by him in ''Chinese Lacquer of the Middle and Late Ming Period'' BMFEA 24 (1952) pp.27-137,(pl.47)\nDISCUSSION:This technique is known in the modern Chinese literatrue as 'xipi' (rhinoceros hide), though there is discussion as to whether this is the 'xipi' mentioned in text of per-Ming and Ming date. The fullest technical explanation is given by Yuan Quanyu (wife of Wang Shixiang), 'Tan xipi qiqi' ''Wenwu cankao ziliao'' 1957.7 pp.1-7. This also illustrates a box closely comparable to the present piece, dated by the author as 'Ming'. Some Qing examples are shown in ''Gugong qiqi tezhan mulu'' (Taipei, 1981) nos 85-87. (cc 4/2/1985)",
