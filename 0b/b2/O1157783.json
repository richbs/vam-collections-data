This is the first violin, second desk part and comes from a collection of manuscript music associated with the 'Cooper Family'. The frouteen pages have been notated in pen and ink and is divided in to numbered, short pieces with annotation to denote their pace, when they should be played and whether they should be repeated.\n\nA note connected with the manuscript suggests that a production entitled Gaspard Hauser or The Poor Idiot of Heildsbourg was produced by Fox Cooper at the City of London Theatre in May 1845. However, the first production recorded was at the Surey Theatre in 1838 for which these parts were originally written. With these parts are photocopies of programmes with casting list for both productions. It is signed by Harwood Cooper (probably in his capacity as Stage Manager at the City of London. Inscribed City of London.\n\nThis music comes from a collection of manuscript music relating to the 'Cooper Family', one of whom, Alfred Edward Cooper (1840-1901) worked as a 'Chef d'Orchestre'/Master of Music at the City of London Theatre and playhouses in South East England. Throughout his career Cooper collected and composed 'melos' to provide incidental music for Melodramas. \n\nThis piece, though not composed by Cooper, is likely to have provided incidental music for one of these Melodramas which were popular in the nineteenth century. Such dramas often featured a limited number of 'stock' characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent and a comic man engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. \n\nIn the melodramas produced in Paris, London music supplanted dialogue or, more often, augmented stage language, actors' gestures, and dramatic action, to evoke an emotional response or provide an aural signal of the true nature of a character.",
