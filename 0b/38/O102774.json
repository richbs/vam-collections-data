The plaquettes had the same multiple purpose as their Italian predecessors. They were used mainly by goldsmiths and in bronze foundries, but also by cabinetmakers. The models were carved in wood, stone, slate and wax, then reproduced in bronze and lead. \n\nCoriolanus was a Roman general who was banished from Rome. He planned an assault on Rome but his wife, mother and children pleaded with him not to attack, which is the scene depicted here.",
