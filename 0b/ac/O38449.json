This was part of a national scheme to evacuate their children to safer 'reception' areas, the first wave of evacuation taking place on Friday September 1st 1939.  The children and any accompanying adults were 'billeted on' (allotted to stay in) households in the reception areas.\n\nThe scheme had very mixed results: some children had better living conditions and caring hosts with whom they stayed in touch; some were abused and neglected, often suffering in silence for years afterwards; at the least, many hosts and guests found it difficult to settle down together, at least to begin with.  Some evacuee children returned home in preference to staying away from their families, and some parents also refused to send their children away.",
