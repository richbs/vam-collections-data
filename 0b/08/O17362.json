It is possible, but unlikely, that he left them out to improve the composition.  Prout specialised in the depiction of picturesque old buildings, which he regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Old Watercolour Society and which were more widely disseminated in the form of volumes of prints such as The Beauties of England and Wales.  For over twenty-five years, he travelled extensively in continental Europe in search of new and interesting subjects, refining his meticulous but lively style of rendering buildings and their inhabitants.  He was much copied, and by the 1820s was perhaps the most influential painter of his generation.  He also worked as a drawing-master, and published manuals of technique.  Towards the end of his life, he was a neighbour in south London of John Ruskin (see cat.no. 130), who admired his work a great deal.",
