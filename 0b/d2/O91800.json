This one is inscribed on the stem IHS (for Iesus Hominum Salvator, meaning Jesus, Saviour of mankind). \n\nLudwig Schneider was one of the most prolific Catholic goldsmiths in Augsburg during this period and produced a large amount of church silver. Augsburg was well-placed to develop as a centre of silver production. It enjoyed a high degree of religious freedom and offered opportunities for patronage from both Catholic and Protestant churches.",
