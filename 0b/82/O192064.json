            "public_access_description": "In 1987, a popular Lithuanian national poet, Justinas Marcinkevicius, published an article about the experiences of deportee Dalia Grinkeviciute's on the coast of the Arctic Ocean in 1941. This opened up the previously banned subject of deportation. Some survivors of deportation had returned to Lithuania, but they were treated as second-class citizens by the Soviet administration. They were not allowed to return to their homes which were now occupied by strangers. Sometimes they were not allowed to work or study at institutions of higher education in Lithuania and talking about their experiences in Siberia was prohibited.\n \nAfter this start, more memoirs of deportees were published by newspapers and magazines and monuments were erected to them. Expeditions to locations in Siberia were organised so that people could bring back the remains of family members who had died in exile and bury them in their family graves in Lithuania. The Soviet policy of 'perestrioka' (restructuring) meant that the communist authorities in Lithuania did not dare to oppose these activities and pilots from the Soviet bomber squadron stationed in Kedainiai flew the coffins out of Siberia. \n\nThe first mass deportation of Lithuanian citizens took place just before Nazi Germany attacked the USSR on the 14th of June 1941. When the USSR re-established power in Lithuania after the war, deportations were repeated almost every year until Stalin's death. Between 200,000 and 300,000 people were deported from Lithuania (according to different calculations) or around 7% of the population. When Lithuania began to assert its independence from the Soviet Union, the anniversary of the first deportation was established as the 'Day of Mourning and Hope'. The day is usually marked by a procession and the laying of wreaths at monuments to those deported. In 1989, an exhibition was organised to coincide with and commemorate the day. It was held at the Art Exhibition Palace in Vilnius and included the work of ordinary people as well as professional artists. The poster for the exhibition was created by a well known artist Gintaras Gesevicius.\n\nThe poster represents a hill with many crosses - an allusion to the Hill of Crosses near \u0160iauliai. This is a centre of pilgrimage in Lithuania with a long tradition of people erecting crosses to give thanks to god. During the Soviet period the crosses were demolished many times, but people constantly rebuilt them, usually at night. The hill therefore became a symbol of resistance to the Soviet regime.\n\nThe artist painted the background of the poster design in gouache and watercolour and drew the hill and crosses in charcoal and colour pastel. Text was assembled from photographically prepared letters or written by hand in gouache with a brush.",
