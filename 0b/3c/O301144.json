Being a large man, he thinks of furniture in ample terms. The Barcelona chair, the most beautiful piece of furniture he has ever designed, is large enough for two people to sit in. The single curve of the back crossing the reverse curve of the seat expresses \u2018chair\u2019 better than any other contemporary model. As always, Mies\u2019s impeccable craftsmanship plays an important part in his furniture design. Everything is calculated to the last millimetre: the width and thickness of the strap metal and the radius of the curves at the joints; the width and spacing of the leather strapping, the size of the upholstery buttons, the fineness of the welting and the proportions of the leather on the cushions. Phillip C. Johnson: Mies Van Der Rohe New York 1947\"\n\"Mies van der Rohe was appointed director for the German Government Pavilion at the Barcelona International Exhibition of 1929, and the chairs were specially designed for its interior.\"",
