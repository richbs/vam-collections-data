            "public_access_description": "The courtyard of a Venetian palace filled with elegantly dressed and posed figures in conversation, playing music and drinking. A green arbour shelters a splashing fountain in the middle ground and frames the classical palace beyond. At left, visitors disembark from gondolas on the lagoon.  Louis de Caullery (ca. 1580 - 1621, Antwerp) was a pioneer in the genre of courtly gatherings in Flemish painting of the 17th century. He probably came from the village of Caulery near Cambrai, but moved to Antwerp in 1594 to train with Joos de Momper and was accepted as a Master there in 1602. While the date he went to Italy in uncertain,  his works reveal that he spent time in Venice, Florence and Rome. He was particularly interested in genre painting and dealt with a high variety of scenes: carnivals on ice, fireworks, bull-fights, open-air entertainments, allegories of the five senses and get-togethers in the spirit of the Fontainebleau School. His figures are particularly elongated and strike elegant poses and are generally characterised with smooth pale faces and broad foreheads. His colour palette reveals the influence of the Italian painters: half tones, ocher-yellow, Veronese green and Burgundy red. He was particularly interested in the depiction of architecture and was skillful in representing his figures and their settings in perspectivecomposition and figures in 698-1883 are reminiscent of many of de Caullery's caprricci,  fantastical painted compositions which combine features of imaginary and/or real architecture, in a picturesque setting. Two other works attributed to the artists also include  a verdant cupola/arbour in the centre mmiddle groundwithin a rectangularly defined space receding into the distance such as A Garden Festival (Denis Vanderker Gallery, Winter 1967-68) and Elegant companionship under a garden bower (Rijksmuseum, inv. A 1956).  The couple walking hand in hand at center left is a particularly popular motif and reappears throughout de Caullery's oeuvre in works such as the Galant companionship at a Venetian Palace (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Quimper, inv. 873-1-237).",

Before 1800</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 66, cat. no. 63\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Louis de CAULERY (active first quarter of 17th century) \n<i>Flemish School</i> \nVery little is known concerning him. The painting of <i>The Five Senses</i> belonging to the Louvre (now in the museum at Cambrai) is signed <i>Louis de Caulery fecit et invenit</i> 1620. His work has affinities with that of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Francken II (Antwerp, 1578-1623).\n\nAscribed to Louis de CAULERY \n63 \nCOURT OF A VENETIAN PALACE \n<i>Oak panel</i> \n18 3/4 X 27 1/2 (47.5 X 70) \n698-1883 \n\nA date c. 1620 is suggested by the costume. Both style and subject have affinities with paintings by Caulery and there are Venetian and other Italian views attributed to him (F. C. Legrand, <i>Les peintres flamands de genre au xviie si\u00e8cle</i>, 1963, p. 82; see also Sotheby sale, 27 Mar. 1968, lot 84, 'Caprice view of Rome'; and 'Jardin d' Amour', Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum, exh. Ghent, 1960, <i>Fleurs et jardins dans l'art flamand</i>, no. 46, fig. 57). However, there are very few signed works by him and these will hardly support the considerable number of attributions made to him in recent years. Certainly, 698-1883 appears to be weaker in execution than Caulery's signed works (Legrand, <i>op. cit</i>., figs. 33-6). \n\n<i>Prov</i>.
