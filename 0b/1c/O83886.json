It states that the bucket was decorated by Zayn al-Din, whose signature is found on several other pieces in the same style.\n\nThis type of richly decorated so-called \u2018Veneto-Saracenic\u2019 metalwork was once thought to have been made by Arabs living in Venice. It is now known that it was originally produced in Egypt or Syria, and only later copied in Italy.\n\nIn the medieval period, there was a ready market in Christian-ruled Europe for luxury goods from the Islamic Middle East. These imports enjoyed such prestige that luxury goods made in Europe were often decorated in Islamic styles. By the late 15th century, when this piece was made, intense trade across the Mediterranean makes the lines of influence difficult to unravel.",

About thirty of these pieces bear the names of Muslim artists, including Muhammad, Muhammad Badr, Qasim, Umar, and Zayn al-Din. Some scholars feel the style was initiated by Timurid artists who immigrated to Venice at the end of the fifteenth century; while others point to the Mamluk tradition of Egypt and Syria as its source. Specific motifs seen on Veneto-Islamic pieces are related more closely to late Mamluk metalwork, and several bear the same Arabic inscriptions. Venetian metalworkers also worked in the Islamic tradition, calling themselves \"al-Azzimina\", after the Arabic word \"al-ajam\", meaning non-Arab.",
