ISBN 1851771026\nThe Following is the full text of the entry\n\n\u201c7 Thomas Worlidge (1700-1766) \n\n<i>David Garrick as Tancred in (Tancred and Sigismunda' by James Thomson</i> \n\nGarrick created the role of Tancred at Drury Lane on 18 March 1745 and played the part twenty-three times over the next few years. There were several performances in the Spring of 1752 when Worlidge painted the most important version of his portrait of Garrick as Tancreed. This is a life-size, full-length version in the Garrick Club, signed and dated 1752. (247 Oil on canvas 221 X 147.3 cm.) A reduced full-length version is in an English private collection (Oil on canvas 101.5 X 72.5 cm.).\n\n\nWorlidge produced an etching of the large picture, probably in 1752, and various versions showing the figure facing in the same direction as in the painting as well as in reverse had a long life in the print shops. An example in the Harvard Theatre Collection is printed on paper watermarked 1794 and another seems to be one of the several prints of Garrick re-published by T. Purland in the early 1850s. Editions of the play published in the late eighteenth century were given portrait frontispieces adapted from Worlidge's portrait, by Wenman and lames Roberts for instance, even though Garrick stopped playing Tancred in 1762. \n\nAn oval Liverpool enamel transfer-printed portrait plaque of about 1778 also post-dates Garrick's last appearance in the role. An example of the enamel was sold at Christie's in 1983 and another in Wolverhampton Art Gallery, show a half-length figure and reverse Worlidge's picture. However, Garrick was still playing the part when his portrait was translated into a Derby figure, produced by William Duesbury & Co. in about 1760. \n\nGarrick's costume consists of a red hussar's tunic with quantities of silver braid and tassels. Over his left shoulder he wears a dark blue short cloak with silver braid and tassels and a white fur border. The dark fur hat has a red and silver tassel. More obviously resplendent in the full-length versions of the picture, the costume is very close to the mid-eighteenth-century dress for masquerade. \n\nOil on canvas 62.9 X 52 cm. \n\n1752 \n\nProvenance: Rev. Alexander Dyce; Dyce bequest, 1869 \n\nLiterature: Allardyce Nicoll <u>The Garrick Stage</u>, 1980, pp. 152-3. \n\nCondition: Lined. Some of the original tacking edges remain and have been lined as part of the face of the painting.

The painting was bequeathed as part of the Dyce collection of 3347 works of art, including paintings, miniatures, watercolours and prints as well as his library of 14,000 volumes. \n\nReverend Alexander Dyce (1798-1869), literary scholar and art collector, was the son of a major, later lieutenant general in the Madras infantry of the East India Company. Raised by two maternal aunts in Aberdeen following his parent\u2019s departure for India in 1799, Dyce read classics at Exeter College, Oxford. At his father\u2019s insistence he was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1823, having rejected a career in the East India Company. He developed a career in publishing by translating Greek texts. However he is probably best known for his editions of sixteenth and seventeenth century poetry. Dyce collected many rare books covering English, Italian and Classical literature. His collection of paintings and works on paper is very varied.  In his collection of paintings, Dyce indulged his enthusiasm for the theatre, acquiring portraits of leading actors, while his drawings collection focuses on Old Master drawings from European schools. The Dyce bequest was one of the earliest of a collection of fine art given to the museum. It followed the Sheepshanks collection, which was given to the museum two years earlier in 1857. While the Sheepshanks collection was mainly of contemporary Victorian art, Dyce\u2019s collection focused on British eighteenth and early nineteenth art as well as paintings from Italian, Dutch and Flemish Schools. This bequest therefore helped to broaden the collection, which the museum was already beginning to do by purchasing works from British and Continental Schools.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Worlidge (1700-1766) portrait painter and etcher. He studied with the Geonese painter Alessandro Maria Grimaldi (1659-1732) and with Grimaldi's son Alexander (1714-1800). In 1736 he is documented working as a glass painter in Birmingham. Following his marriage to Grimaldi's daughter, Arabella, he returned to London in the late 1730s and settled in Covent Garden. Possibly because of his proximity to the theatres, Worlidge began to paint a number of theatrical portraits. These were often copied in etchings as well as porcelain figures. His most popular works were portrait heads executed in miniature, pencil, crayon and oil, which were particularly popular with the fashionable Bath society. Worlidge also became well known as an etcher, particularly for his pastiches of those by Rembrandt (1606-1669). Often his etchings were mistaken for those by the Dutch artist.",
