The effect of shaded colour or 'rainbow printing' can be seen in a number of fabrics at this time. The motifs show the characteristic Arts and Crafts preference for stylised floral forms.\n\nDay was a founder member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. He was one of the most commercially aware and successful designers of his generation. From 1870 he produced freelance designs for all kinds of textiles, wallpapers, ceramics and furniture. He lectured on design and wrote many books and articles on the subject for leading publications. In 1881 he became the Artistic Director of Turnbull & Stockdale, a Lancashire textile-printing firm. He gave 'a unity to the firm's goods'. His style is eclectic and often derivative, but his draughtsmanship is excellent. Day also sold his designs to many other fashionable firms and shops.",
