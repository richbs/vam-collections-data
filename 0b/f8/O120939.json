Her pastel-pink mantle billows around her and her left arm reaches forward to grasp the bull's right horn.  She looks out of the canvas directly at the viewer.  Three of the remaining four women appear on the central figure's left.  One kneels on the ground with her arms outstretched toward the central figure, a second extends her left arm across the first woman's back and the third, positioned behind them, reaches out her right arm while gazing at the central figure.  The woman to the right of the central figure has both arms raised and also looks toward the central figure on the bull.  The fragmentary figure of a cupid is visible at the right edge of the canvas.  There are flowers in the left foreground and a building in the background at the top left.",

London, 1973, pp. 133-5 cat. no. 153.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nPierre GOBERT (1662-1744) \nFrench School \nSon of the sculptor Jean Gobert, he was probably born in Fontainebleau. He is recorded as a portrait painter from 1682, became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1701 and was described as <i>peintre du roi</i> in 1705. In 1708-09 and again in 1721 he was also employed as a portrait painter by Duke Leopold of Lorraine.\n\nAscribed to Pierre GOBERT\n\n153\nEUROPA CARRIED OFF BY JUPITER CHANGED INTO A BULL \n(Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>, II, 835-77; VI, 103-07) \nWith (?) Mademoiselle de Nantes, Duchesse de Bourbon (b. 1673) as Europa. \nCanvas \n48 \u00be x 62 (124 x 157.5) \nJones Bequest \n549-1882\n\nThe fragmentary figure of Cupid on the right edge reappeared when the picture was cleaned in 1964. He was presumably painted out to hide the fact that the canvas had been cut down. \nLong (1923) catalogued 549-1882 as French School, early 18th century, drawing attention to a very similar painting, representing <i>Leda and the Swan</i>, then attributed to Nicolas de Largilliere, in the Prado, Madrid. Subsequently, the Prado picture was firmly given to Pierre Gobert and the figure of Leda identified as Mademoiselle de Blois (1677-1749), the illegitimate daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. According to the Prado catalogues from 1933 onwards, this painting was attributed to Gobert in the Palace Inventory of 1747, when Mademoiselle de Blois was still alive (<i>Catalogo de las pinturas</i>, 1963, p. 245, no. 2274). Gobert was essentially a portrait painter and there are not many mythological subjects by him, but on the basis of its similarity with the Prado picture, 549-1882 could also be attributed to him. \nThe fact that he was a portrait painter and that the Leda in the Prado picture was identified as Mademoiselle de Blois, lends support to the view, often expressed, that the Europa in 549-1882 is a portrait. The picture was originally described as 'Madame du Barry as Europa' (A. de Champeaux, 1883), but Madame du Barry was only born in 1746 whereas the painting dates from about 1700. F. R. Bryan (see Long, 1923) was the first to suggest that it represents Marie Louise Elisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchesse de Berri (1695-1719), daughter of Philippe Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans, Regent of France, and mademoiselle de Blois. Recently, Mrs Guy Wyndham (written communication) drew attention to a passage in the <i>M\u00e9moires de la Comtesse de Genlis</i>, I, 1825, p. 376, in which reference is made to the Duchesse de Berri having been depicted as Europa: 'Je m'arr\u00eatai plus longtemps devant un charmant petit tableau paint \u00e0 ravis, qui representoit l'enl\u00e8vement d'Europe;\u2026 le taureau d\u00e9tournoit de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sa grosse t\u00eate pour baiser un joli petit pied nu d'Europe. Je dis que je trouvois Europe tr\u00e8s belle, mais trop grosse: Mademoiselle Dessaleux sourit et repondit que c'etoit non une figure de fantaisie mais un portrait, et celui de la duchesse de Berri, fille de Monsieur le Regent.'\nIt could perhaps be argued that the general description fits 549-1882 but by no stretch of the imagination could it be described as 'small'. Nor does a comparison with portraits of the Duchesse de Berri (Largilliere; Louis de Silvestre, Versailles) support the identification. A more likely candidate for the identity of Europa, first suggested by Marcel Nicolle (1925), is Louise Francoise de Nantes, Duchesse de Bourbon (b. 1673), daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan and sister of Mademoiselle de Blois, the Leda in the Prado picture. She appears in a similar pose in a portrait at Chantilly attributed to Nattier (<i>Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Peintures de l'Ecole francaise xve-xviiie si\u00e8cle</i>, 1970, no. 126, repr.). Certainly, the date of the painting indicated by the costume fits better with a princess of this generation rather than the succeeding one: the Duchesse de Bourbon was in her twenties in 1700 whereas the Duchesse de Berri was only five. However, the resemblance of the features is sufficient only to support a very tentative identification. \nThe Rape of Europa, which is found illustrated on Greek vases, Pompeian wall-paintings and in the later Middle Ages, enjoyed a considerable vogue in the 16th-18th centuries (see A. Pigler, Barockthemen, ii, 1956, pp. 7883). In general terms the composition was fairly standard. 549-1882 has affinities in particular, with a drawing by Francois Verdier (1651-1730) in the Albertina, Vienna (no. 11840) which may have been inspired by a composition of Lebrun (J. Guiffrey and P. Marcel, <i>Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des dessins du Louvre ... Ecole fran\u00e7aise</i>, viii, 1913, p. 23, no. 6065, repr.). \n\nCondition. The painter enlarged the picture surface by adding strips of canvas on three sides. The width of the additional canvas on the left edge is 3 \u00be in.; on the right edge 1 in.; on the bottom 5 \u00bd in. Cleaned in 1964 (see above), the paint surface was found to be in reasonably good condition. The fact that the Cupid on the right is only partially visible and that the strip on the left edge is only 3 \u00be in. wide suggests that the painting has been cut down on both sides. \nProv.

            "historical_context_note": "This painting was ascribed to Pierre Gobert on the basis of stylistic similarities with <i>Mademoiselle de Blois as Leda and her Children</i> formerly in the Prado Museum, Madrid, attributed to Pierre Gobert in 1747 in the palace inventory. \n\nThe painting depicts the rape of Europa, a tale from the Greek mythology narrated in Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis</i> (2:836-875).  Jupiter, disguising himself as a white bull, came to where Europa played by the seashore and ravished her to Crete. \n\nThis painting is most likely a <i>portrait histori\u00e9</i>, a genre seeking to elevate the portrait by association with history painting. Europa is here probably embodied by one of the close members of the royal family. An old label reads the inscription: 'Madame du Barry as Europa' but Madame du Barry was not born until 1746 and this painting may have been executed around the same time as the Prado one, between 1710 and 1720. It may therefore represent Marie Louise Elisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchesse de Berri (1695-1719), daughter of Philippe Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans, Regent of France, and mademoiselle de Blois, daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. A passage in the <i>M\u00e9moires de la Comtesse de Genlis</i> (I, 1825, p. 376), made reference to the Duchesse de Berri having been depicted as Europa (Mrs Guy Wyndham, written communication, 1957). Another proposed candidate is Mademoiselle de Nantes, Duchesse de Bourbon (1673-1743), sister of mademoiselle de Blois.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of the fashionable <i>portrait histori\u00e9</i>, a genre in which the sitter assumes a role in disguise. This category allows the sitter to be projected into a world of fantasy and be seen as a heroe, god or goddess. This trend suits particularly the Rococo taste for recreating the Roman and Greek golden age in idyllic settings.",
