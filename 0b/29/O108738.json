Chinese ceramics are often categorized by the geographical area in which they were made, as the kilns of a particular region usually made only one or two types of ceramics at a given time in history. Jun ware was produced in the kilns of the Henan province and its height of production was during the Song dynasty (960-1279). It can be identified visually by its coarse stoneware body and its thickly applied glaze, which through firing gained an opalescent blue colour. At the edges the glaze ran thin, becoming semi-transparent and revealing the colour of the fired clay beneath.\nWhile most Jun ware is relatively modest in size, many larger pieces, such as this, were made for the purpose of plant cultivation and often bear \u2018earthworm trails\u2019 in their glaze. Rather than applying the glaze to the body in several coats, Jun glazes were applied a single, thick coat. On larger pieces, The gaps that developed in the raw glaze as it dried were later fixed in firing, creating the \u2018earthworm trail\u2019 effect visible on bowl\u2019s interior. Initially a fault in the process, this was later valued as a positive trait of larger Jun wares.",
