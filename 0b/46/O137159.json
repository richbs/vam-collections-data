The bassoon was developed in France during the 1630s, and derives from the dulcian (known in England as the 'curtal'), a Medieval reed instrument with a similar mouthpiece. \n\nRichard Goulding was an important English maker of woodwind instruments, working from about 1786 until his death in 1834. In 1798 he went into partnership with Thomas d'Almaine, and the firm traded under several different names and marks, such as Goulding & Co and Goulding London until 1823, when it became known as Goulding & D'Almaine & Co. After 1834 Goudling's name was dropped, and the firm wound up on D'Almaine's death in 1866.",
