This doll has a composition head (made from glue and sawdust), which was a common material used to make dolls heads during the 1920s, through to the 1940s. Unfortunately there is no distinct maker's mark, which implies that the doll is a copy from the larger doll companies which manufactured the composition dolls at the time.",
