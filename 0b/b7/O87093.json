Two butterflies of the same type fly above it with reddish wings with marginal spots.  The painting is achieved with washes and loose brush strokes hatched in darker tones for the detailing. The painting has an inner border of strips of an orangey-buff colour which have been cut back round the petals of the flower on the right hand side and the upper butterfly.  There is a gold line with black rulings at its outer edge which are set on the ivory-coloured page.  This has faded strips of paper of a similar colour to the inner border with a double line of black ruled lines on their inner edge.  A beige strip of woven textile acts as a gutter for the binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
