Subsequently, a considerable number of attributions have been suggested, including the names of Molenaer, Pott and Soutman. Individually, none of these are convincing, but they have in common a Haarlem origin and the influence of Hals, which are also the salient characteristics of this painting. A date ca. 1635 is indicated by the costume. \n\nCondition. Slight damage in area of join in the panel: cleaned 1959. \nProv. General G. Phipps (label on back): John Forster; bequeathed to the Museum in 1876. \nLit. <i>Forster Collection catalogue</i>, 1893, p. 2 (Hals).",
