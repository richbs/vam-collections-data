Bugatti was self-taught as a designer and was fascinated by Moorish and Oriental designs. His furniture is distinctive with geometric patterns taken from Middle Eastern and North African architecture. He also preferred designs of stylised flowers or insects and metals such as brass and pewter for inlay.The dragonfly, used for the handle, was one of his favourite motifs.\n\nThe sloping front can be pulled down to form a writing slope. Inside the box is fitted with four compartments lined with velvet, probably intended for stationery.",
