Beyond this is a light grey or blue ground decorated with light and mid-blue stems with flowers, leave sand rosettes in yellow, mid-blue, red, black, mauve and dark grey.  There is a pendant top and bottom of the red medallion.  In the four extended corners [spandrels] there is a red ground with similar decoration.\nthere is a series of borders each edged with a narrow undecorated black or orange border:\n[1] red ground with a pair of undulating lines almost forming a series of ovals in light green and white silk.
