It is undated, but the image is a version of Nash\u2019s characteristic view of the coast at Dymchurch, in Kent. We know that Nash first visited Dymchurch in 1920 (his earliest images of the place are the woodcuts Promenade No.1 and No.2, both dated 1920). In 1921 he went to live there and stayed for four years. On the basis of this, and other evidence from exhibition catalogues and so on, it seems likely that this poster dates from 1920.  Nash was a member of the Friday Club (established by Vanessa Bell in 1905) from 1913 until 1922 (when it was disbanded).",

It is undated, but the image is a version of Nash's characteristic view of the coast at Dymchurch, in Kent. We know that Nash first visited Dymchurch in 1920 (his earliest images of the place are the woodcuts Promenade No.1 and No.2, both dated 1920. Nash went to live in Dymchurch in 1921 and stayed for four years. He was a member of the Friday Club (established by Vanessa Bell in 1905) from 1913 until 1922 (when it was disbanded) and produced at least one other poster for a Friday Club exhibition, held at the Mansard Gallery at Heal's in Tottenham Court Road, which is dated 1921 (a copy is in the V&A collection, E.238-1980, given by Heal & Son Ltd.). The history of the Friday Club is shadowy because no minutes of its meetings exist and not all of its exhibition catalogues have been traced. There is evidence (in the form of catalogues and/or posters) for Friday Club exhibitions in 1905, 1907, 1908, 1910-1918, 1921 and 1922 (according to the list compiled by Richard Shone*) so it would seem plausible, on the basis of this gap in the record - 1919 and 1920 - and the evidence linking Nash to Dymchurch, to surmise that the most likely date for the poster must be 1920, since the dates of the exhibitions in 1921 and 1922 do not match with the dates in this poster, and nor do the venues.\n\n* Richard Shone, \u201cThe Friday Club\u201d in The Burlington Magazine, vol.117, no.866 (May, 1975), pp.278-284.",
