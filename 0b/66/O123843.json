In the Bible John is one of the Four Evangelists, the authors of the gospels. The convention of representing the four as winged creatures is based on the book of Ezekiel, chapter 1, verses 5-14, where Ezekiel tells of a vision of the four beasts. Medieval commentators argued that the eagle represents John because it is the bird that flies closest to heaven. John's gospel was thought to adopt a \"higher\" level of theology than the other three gospels.\n\nThis expressive panel  was carved from a single piece of oak, and was probably one of a set of four (another of which survives in the Museum, 675-1895). It was formerly in the collection of Emile Peyre (1824-1904), a notable Parisian collector of French Medieval and Renaissance woodwork. The V&A bought many pieces from him in 1895.",
