He trained at Guildford School of Art in England in the early 1950s and worked as an assistant to Cecil Beaton taking the official photos of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Whilst undertaking this, he began taking candid photographs of children in the streets of London.\n\nHis work is very diverse, ranging from fashion and advertising to photojournalism, yet this never stood in the way of his studies of children or interest in animals. This particular photograph comes from part of the 'Adventure Playground series'. Drysdale lives and work in London although his photographs are published all over the world, and is known for his pictures of unusual inter-species bonding and of children.",
