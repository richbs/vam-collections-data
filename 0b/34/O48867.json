For example, the plinth is decorated with scrolling anthemions (a motif based on the honeysuckle flower), which imitate the designs used on ancient  Etruscan vases.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe cabinet-maker is unknown, but the table was probably made in London, judging from the high quality of the workmanship and materials.\n\nDesign & Designing\nA table like this is illustrated as Plate 39 in Household Furniture and Interior Decoration... executed from designs by Thomas Hope, London, 1807. It is described as 'Top and elevation of a round monopodium or table in mahogany, inlaid with ebony and silver'. The publication allowed many commercial cabinet-makers to make versions of this design.\n\nA very similar table is featured in a watercolour (dated 1818) by Hope and the architect William Atkinson. The watercolour depicts the boudoir in Hope's house, Deepdene, near Dorking, Surrey.  This table was as one time thought to be the V&A piece, but the pedestal of the one depicted is plain.\n\nRelated Objects\nSeveral other versions of this table design exist with different details of decoration, including one with gilt-bronze mounts at the Art Institute of Chicago.",
