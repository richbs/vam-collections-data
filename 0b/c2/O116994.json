They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nNormandy has the greatest variety of crosses, many with large and distinctive patterns, and individual names.  Smaller kinds, like this one, are equally typical of the region, but do not have a distinctive name.  The stones, which may be local Normandy crystals, are backed with red foil to give them a more interesting appearance.",
