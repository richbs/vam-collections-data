Four weeks after they were taken to Turin to be exhibited for the first time to the Scientific Institute, and the Doctors, Fabami and Mosse, published a faithful description of this phenomenon. They pronounced it the most extraordinary freak of natuire even known. The twins were baptised - the one on the right Giovanni, and the one on the left Giacomo. The two bodies were joined at the sixth rib; the physiognomies are quite different. The weight of their bodies at birth was 4 and a half kilos (about 9lbs) but now weighs (sic) 8st.10lbs. From the abdomen downwards they appear as one person, but in the upper pportion of their bodies they are perfectly separate, each having a chest, heart, lungs and arms for his exclusive use. Each thinks with a head of his own, and often quite differently from that of his twin brother. When they quarrel their dispute often ends in blows, woith the aggrevating result that the combatants cannot be separated. There are two legs, one belonging to Giovanni, and the other to Giacomo. This renders walking a matter of difficulty, and necessitates the aid of some support in the movements; when seated they are naturally more comfortable.",
