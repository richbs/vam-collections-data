            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThis 1870s parasol is part of a gift of an entire outfit comprising a dress, cape, parasol and gloves. Coloured linings such as this yellow with purple were to co-ordinate with the bold purple lines printed on the dress. Bright contrasting colours such as these were popular at this time when the first chemical aniline dyes were being experimented with. The 1870s saw the revival of the longer 'staff' parasol first fashionable at the end of the 18thcentury. The long sticks were used as an aid to walking when the covers were closed.",
