Blue was regarded as a protective colour from ancient times onward, and its use as an amulet could be extended to any prized asset.  As male heirs were generally preferred, they were considered more in need of protection.  Pink may have been considered a suitable colour for girls as a contrast, when there was a certain amount of feeling against green and even yellow for use in children's clothing.  In some European countries, blue is a colour associated with the Virgin Mary, and thought appropriate for girls; pink is then for boys, and may be considered as a shade of red, sometimes associated with St Joseph.",
