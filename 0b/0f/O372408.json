This example has six courses (four of double and two of single metal strings), tuned in the key of C.  It was constructed by Remerius Liessem (active, 1750-1760) of London, who also made violins and 'cellos. This instrument was made in 1756 and is one of the earliest dated examples fitted with a 'watch-key' device. The player would turn small metal tuning pins with a watch-key, and these helped to make tuning more stable.",
