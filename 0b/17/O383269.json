Originally Swiss women used laces to keep their detachable white linen collars in place, but by the 19th century they had switched to silver chains.  They wore them in pairs, one on each side of the body.  These chains linked the lower outside corners of the collar, at the front and back, by passing under the arm.  At each end there was a decorative filigree hook, like this one, which was attached to the corners of the collar.  In this example, the loop at the lower edge of the front, which would have held the chain, has been lost.  The piece was usually finished with a large decorative filigree rosette, which hung down as a pendant from the front hook.\n\nG\u00f6llerketten were also worn in some parts of south-west Germany up to the 19th century, and this piece may be German.  It was described as 18th century German when it was acquired in 1872, but the shape is more typical of Switzerland than Germany.",
