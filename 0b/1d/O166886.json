The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. This process is evident here, where the tacking stitches and paper template are still intact. Geometric shapes can produce some of the most striking examples, such as this 'tumbling block' design. A simple, repeating composition of light, dark and medium tone fabrics creates the effect. \n\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century, developments in the textile industry led to a new range of brightly coloured dress and furnishing fabrics. Chemical analine dyes, first discovered in 1856, proved particularly successful when used on silks of the period. By the 1860s, fashionable middle class women across the country were moving away from cottons in favour of silks for use in their domestic patchwork projects, including quilts, cushions, piano covers, table covers and sofa pillows, and for small articles such as theatre and work bags.",
