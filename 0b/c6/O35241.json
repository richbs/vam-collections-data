The good characters are recognisable by their elongated eyes and their pointed noses, whilst the evil characters have round eyes, upturned bulbous noses and protruding teeth.  Even today Javanese puppet shows are imbued with mystical associations and  often form part of marriage, birth and thanksgiving ceremonies.",
