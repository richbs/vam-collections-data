There is a narrow pieced which has been added along the upper part of the right hand side.  The embroidery has been cut across the top. There is a border along the bottom and part way up both sides.  Outward facing floral sprays: 3 pink flowers alternating with 3 white flowers on a dark blue ground.  Edged either side with a black-outlined band with a yellow meander and small pink blossoms. This wide side border cuts abruptly across the diagonal banding. The border on the right hand side is longer than that on the left.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in pink and green.\nThe colouring of the following bands is very different. There are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: green ground with a row of flowers facing to the lower right: blue flower and pink carnation separated by a  pair of pink and white leaves.\n[2] wider stripes in three designs: [a] diamond segments: black-edged vase with lots of pale flowers, mainly pink, and a dominant pair of horizontal black-outlined leaves alternating with a yellow vase, central pink flower and 3 groups of 4 white flowers in a diamond shape.\n[b] less obvious diamonds: vase with 3 blue-outlined flowers forming a diamond along the central stem leading into a triangular pink blossom alternating with a vase and central pink blossom.  The colour of the vases changes randomly.\n[c] light blue ground: diamond of white and brown blossoms alternating with an angled chevron stem and large pink flowers outlined with red.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, yellow, black, blue, light blue, green, white, mauve, dark green, orange, cream, bright pink.",
