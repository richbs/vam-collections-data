Top: two black horses, one above the other facing in alternate directions, each with a rider worked in red. Middle: three drummers [upper body and head only] worked in red with black hat, facial features and drum.  Between these figures are two black trombones and two black french horns.  Bottom: two confronting women with blue dresses within a black arch.\nThere are two scenes on the right. Top: a large female figure elaborately dressed, with a crown and veil worked in white, red, black, pink, blue and  gold thread over light green silk applique.  To her left and right are a tower and  pair of birds in white. Bottom: white linen  applied panel forming a table on which a banquet has been worked in black. Below this are floral arrangements - three in white and two in black - and to either side is a leafly pattern in green.",
