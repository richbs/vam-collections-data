And on the back: 'By Esther Parada, published by the University Art Museum, State University of New York at Binghamton, as part of the Current Events series.'\nThe folder unfolds itself, four nearly equally sized parts or flaps can be flipped away, one to the top, one to the right, one to the bottom and one to the left. The left and right extensions contain pictorial information, photo-collages, and the upper and bottom part along with the centre piece form one plane, which contains written information about the project and comments on the content of the photo-collages.\nThe photo-collage on the left side flap contains North American Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North with one of his slides at the Iran-Contra hearing (taken by Paul Hosefros, chief photographer for The New York Times in Washington D.C. and printed on page 4 of The Times, July 17, 1987). Other elements in the collage are pictures of the training of the Nicaraguan National Guard by U.S. officers in Ocotal, Nicaragua, 1927. Another picture shows the closing ceremony at the school of the Americas in Panama (photo taken by James LeMoyne, printed in The New York Times, September 24, 1984, p. 8).\nThe photo collage on the right side flap shows photos from the life of the two Nicaraguan women Adriana Angel and her friend Maria Medina Pavon. On a bigger picture in the middle Maria Medina Pavon holds up her family photograph. On another photograph she leans into the shadows of her one-room cinderblock home, exposing the idyllic image on her T-shirt. On another photograph she sits under an AMNLAE (the Nicaraguan women's association) poster, and yet under another photograph Adriana's daughter Maranta with Maria's son Juan Carlos are wearing the Monimbo masks.",

The artist has said of this work \"In juxtaposing the words and images of North American authority - military officers, past and present, and U.S. political figures - with the words and pictures of two Nicaraguan families, I ask the viewer to question the hierarchy of U.S. media attention. By interweaving multiple versions of the same image, I intend to make blatant or explicit the manipulation which is an inevitable part of representation.\" (Patric Prince Archive, V&A, AAD/2009/19).\nThe artist scanned images she found in the U.S. Marine Corps historical archives and The New York Times.  She also digitized 35mm slides of photographs she took in Nicaragua turning them into black and white images using different forms of software, such as SuperPaint, Digital Darkroom or ImageStudio.  The artist aimed at variation in format, resolution, tonality and focus, in order to make her own intervention into the digital process apparent.",

The \"catalogue\" in this case is not documentation, but rather another exhibition venue. It could be described as a folding book or poster. The artist Esther Parada calls it an \"unfolding exhibition\". In using this experimental form she seeks to open up a dialogue between different elements of the work - such as the poster and the folder - as well as between the artist and viewer. \nThe work contained in this folder posits a historical framework dominated by the establishment and proliferation of United States military power throughout the hemisphere. This hierarchical relationship is represented visually through the expansion of a single image - the training of the Nicaraguan National Guard by U.S. officers in Ocotal, Nicaragua, 1927 - as a kind of pixel matrix (cit: taken from text within folder).",
