            "public_access_description": "Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809-1892), appointed poet Laureate in 1850, was a major source of inspiration for artists, and in particular for Julia Margaret Cameron, who was his neighbour on the Isle of Wight.  It was largely through Tennyson's celebrity that Freshwater became well known. It attracted many of the most prominent artists, writers, intellectuals of the time who came visit the great poet and who were called upon to sit for Mrs Cameron.  She made at least nineteen portraits of Tennyson often depicting him theatrically in a black cloak and cap, with a book emphasising his intellect and vocation as poet.  This, the last portrait that Cameron made of him, is a quiet yet noble likeness of Tennyson.  He is presented as more refined, wearing modern dress compared to her other well known photograph of him (\"The Dirty Monk\", V&A Ph 1143-1963). Light catches on the folds of draped fabric creating a golden aura behind the sitter. The focus of the image is sharpest around the poet's eyes and nose emphasising his visionary \"seeing\" gaze.",
