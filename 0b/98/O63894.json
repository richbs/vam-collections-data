Two of the smaller tirthankara figures stand before the framework of the back of the throne on either side of the main image and the other two are seated above them.  A pair of elephants above these figures support a canopy over Munisuvrata's head, surmounted by a torana with a kalasa as its finial.  At the front of the pedestal are two deer flanking a dharmachakra, the nine planets and two seated worshipping figures, all of which have been crudely executed.\n\nOn the reverse is engraved a human figure and a devanagri inscription which is no longer entirely legible.   This begins 'samvat 1552 varse,' mentions 'sri anchala gachchhe sri jayakesarisuri' and concludes ' sri m(u)ni(s)uvrata svami bimbam karita (prati?)stitam.'\nThus the image was dedicated through Muni Jayakesarisuri of the Anchala Gachchha in V.S. 1552.  An image was dedicated through a Muni Jayakesarisuri of the same community 51 years earlier (1444 A.D.).\nSee. K.C.Jain, Jainism in Rajastahn, Sholapur, 1963, p.97.",
