The rectangular form and flat front of this cabinet is based on French furniture of the 1780s, while the classical decoration is taken from a variety of sources, including English Regency pattern books. The two female figures are from designs by Thomas Hope, published in 1809 in his book Costumes of the Ancients, which was reprinted in an expanded edition in 1841. The high quality of the construction is typical of the work of Holland & Sons, one of the largest and most prolific of Victorian cabinet-makers.",
