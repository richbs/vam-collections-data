            "public_access_description": "From the middle of the 14th century, it became more common for people in England who had the right to bear coats of arms to display their family arms and the arms of the reigning monarch in their homes. This was an outward display of loyalty and allegiance.\n \nThese displays of heraldic alliances could be constructed as paintings (on woodwork and on walls in fresco), on cloths, as stone sculpture and in stained glass. \n\nThis panel, depicting the royal arms of Henry VIII, is believed to have come from Barham Hall in Suffolk. The panel was sold to the Museum in 1920 by the then owner. The Hall had been the residence of the Southwell family since about 1451 but the manor of Barham, in the possession of the monks of Ely, did not come to the family until after the Dissolution, around 1545. Robert Southwell had been Chief Butler to Henry VII and Henry VIII.\n\nThe royal arms displayed here show the arms of France (azure, three semi-de-lys, or) quartered with the arms of England (gules, three lions passant gardant, or). The arms of England, with the three lions, were in use from about 1198, during the reign of Richard I. In 1340, King Edward III claimed the throne of France and it was from that point that the English arms were quartered with those of France. At that time the French arms were azure, semi-de-lys, or, meaning a field of gold fleur-de-lys on a blue ground. The French arms are placed, as you face it, in the dominant quarters of the shield \u2013 in the first and fourth quarters. This was an overt political statement on Edward\u2019s part as he claimed the throne by right of descent from the last surviving member of the Capetian dynasty, his mother Queen Isabella. The French did not recognize descent through the female line so when all the male heirs to the Capetian throne passed away by 1328, the crown passed to a cousin, a member of the Valois family. \n\nIn 1376 the Valois changed the French royal arms to the form you see here, only three gold fleur-de-lys on a blue ground. The Royal arms of England remained the same as the change was not recognised by Edward III. However, by 1406, King Henry IV adapted the new form and the royal arms of England remained in this form throughout the Tudor dynasty. The arms of France continued to be quartered with that of England until 1801 when George III renounced the claim.\n\nSurrounding the arms of England is a blue belt with a gold buckle inset with the words: Hony soyt quy mal y pence. This is the motto of the Order of the Garter, a chivalric order established by King Edward III in about 1348. The motto is in old French and translates as \u2018Shame on him who thinks evil of it\u2019.",
