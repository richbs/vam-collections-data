NB. There may be additional, concealed wefts. The good condition of the carpet precludes further investigation. There are 11 knots per inch (44 per dm).\n\nPILE:  wool; 11 colours: red, light red, very dark yellow, dark yellow, dark green, dark blue, blue light blue, brown, cream, white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 warp threads; 110 knots per sq. inch (1738 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: one stout cord overworked in cream and red to form a chevron pattern, each end culminating in a tassel.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: 1.5 cms. plain weave with white wool ending in a 2 cm. fringe with the same weft thread securing 3 warp threads by twining.  From fringe to pile are 4 rows of weft wrapping in a) dark blue and red, b) light green and red, and c) light blue and light brown.  Upper: 2 cms as above but with 5 rows of weft wrapping in a) yellow and light brown, b) red and light green, and c) dark blue and red.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark blue ground. At lower left a three-legged lion bears a scimitar and a light red disk with red and green flanges; at upper centre a yellow headed eagle spreads multi-coloured wings across the field; above it are stars and a white crescent moon; at lower right, the small figures of a man (Adam) in straight trousers and a woman (Eve) in a full skirt stand either side of a shrub with a white flower beneath which a blue-eyed snake approaches Eve; elsewhere are small dogs, birds, stars, crosses, florets, etc.\n\nMain border: red ground with diamonds composed of pairs of florets alternating in light red/blue and dark green/yellow.  The diamonds lie within dark blue brackets with white or yellow pendant florets.\n\nThere are no other borders but across the top is a deep panel divided into three: in the left hand square a large, green-leafed sprig bears three yellow flowers; in the centre is a blue diamond boteh with a rightward curl, the trademark of MIRI Iranian Rugs; on the right a rider on a green-headed horse has to both sides a diamond boteh and a backward-looking animal.  As in the field the ground for each is dark blue, scattered with similar motifs.",
