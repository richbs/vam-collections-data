According to the donor, this one was given to her by Sir Clare Ford, who had been British Minister to Greece in 1881-4, and Ambassador to Constantinople in 1891-3.  The delicate silver filigree and the facetted red glass paste are both characteristic of the kind of jewellery made in Greece in the 19th century.\n\nIts original owner would have tied a ribbon through the loops at each end to fasten it.  She may have worn it round her neck, as the donor thought, but the little projection in the centre might have been rather uncomfortable, as it would have dug into the chin.  It could also have been worn as a forehead ornament, which was an equally common use.",
