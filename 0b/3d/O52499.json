London first saw it when Grisi and Perrot danced it at Her Majesty's Theatre in April 1844 (a month after Maria and Coralli had performed it at the Paris Op\u00e9ra) and it quickly found its way into ballets.  The costumes reflected the central European origins of the dance.  \nImages of Grisi and Perrot in the Polka appeared in prints and on illustrated music covers and is the most frequently used Romantic Ballet image on English ceramics.\nThe Romantic Ballet embodied two of the strands of the Romantic imagination, the pursuit of the Romantic ideal woman, in the form of an unattainable spirit, and the yearing for exotic locations, such as Spain or Scotland, which found expression in the national dances incorporated into ballets of the period or the foreign settings of many Romantic libretti.  The print testifies to the popularity of national dances in the Romantic Ballet period.",
