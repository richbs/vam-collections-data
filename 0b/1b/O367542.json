Within a narrow border of small flags are larger flags at the corners of the fields, groups of draped standards at the top having beneath them the inscription 'For Liberty'. Between these is a crown above the Union Jack in a laurel wreath.\n\nTo either side of the song are aeroplanes above. To the left, is a file of men from a Scots regiment charging with fixed bayonets, and to the right are soldiers firing a cannon. Directly beneath the song is a vignette of a domestic scene, mother at the piano, daughter at father's knee, a little boy in a sailor-suit with a song sheet, and on the wall by the fireplace a portrait of his brother in the forces.",
