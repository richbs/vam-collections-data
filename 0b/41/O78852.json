They did, however, tend to be more formal and tailored.  They were often worn with a girdle and a round embroidered nightcap.\n\nMaterials & Making\nDressing gowns were made of a variety of fabrics, including patterned silks, quilted silk satin, flannel and velvet.  They were often brightly coloured, as the following extract from the book Plain or Ringlets (1860), by R.S. Surtees, shows: 'Mr Bunting appeared in nankin peg-tops, an elegant cerulean blue Turkish silk dressing-gown with massive red tassels.'\n\nDressing gowns were often quilted on the inside for extra warmth.  In 1863 theMinister's Complete  Guide to Cutting (3rd edition) listed two main styles: 'The usual form, cut with a broad rolling collar which turns nearly to the waist; usually has a string run inside the waist so that it may be drawn in.  THE-FROCK-GREAT-COAT form is sometimes worn, the back cut whole and a banyan pleat at each hip and at the centre of the back.'\n\nOwnership & Use\nUntil the middle of the 19th century dressing gowns were worn informally indoors, for an informal breakfast, before dressing and in between changes of dress.  Subsequently they became more of a bedroom garment or wrap in which to visit the bathroom.",
