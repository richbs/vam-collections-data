The beading and openwork cotton have been backed by, possibly stuck to, another piece of coarse white cotton so that the bead stitching is not visible. \nThe remains of a different shape in a pencil or similar outline are visible on the openwork cotton. \nThis almost identical pair of toe caps have a zig-zag design in striped colours with a raised motif of a bird amid flowers in the centre. The beading entirely covers the toe shape. \nThese shoe uppers would have been used for backless slippers by women. While the beading itself was done by women, the slipper would have been made up and given a leather sole by a cobbler. \n\nMrs Garrett's card reads: 'Purchased: $5.00 Peel St HK; Beaded shoe upper on rough canvas.
