            "public_access_description": "Glazed ceramics were not widely used in the pre-Islamic Middle East, but in the 8th and 9th centuries, they began to assume the important role they have today. \n\nHigh-fired ceramics from China, first brought to Iraq by sea in the 8th century, were one stimulus for this change. In the early 9th century Iraqi potters began to imitate elegant white bowls imported from China. They used the local yellow clay, which they masked with an opaque white glaze. Soon they began to add new forms and decoration of different types in blue, green and metallic lustre. \n\nOnce Iraqi potters could successfully imitate Chinese whiteware, they began to treat the white surface of their ceramics as a blank canvas. Painting into the glaze in cobalt blue was a local innovation, which resulted in the world's first blue-and-white ceramics.",

This provided a blank \u2018canvas\u2019, to which the potters soon began to add decoration in cobalt blue. The Abbasid wares have long been thought of as the world\u2019s first blue-and-white, though it is still unknown whether or not ninth-century Chinese ceramics with blue decoration came first.",
