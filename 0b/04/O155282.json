Displayed behind glass. Displayed upside down.\nIt looks as if a thin piece might have been added to either side because the colours are noticeably different, but it may just be the way the panel was originally seamed and the thin strips might be unfaded.\nThere is a border along the bottom and part way up the sides.  Thick black lines outline it and it has a black ground with pink birds alternating with a downward pointing vase with 3 white and yellow flowers. The birds face towards the bottom in the right hand side and towards the top in the left hand side sections.\n\nThe pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left pattern with chevrons in pink and yellow.\nThere are two sizes of stripes: \n[1] narrow stripes: same design as the lower border but on a mauve ground.\n[2] wider stripe in two designs: [a] black ground with a downward pointing spray of three blue flowers alternating with a spray of 3 pink rosettes with petals outlined in white. [b] black ground with a spray of white blossoms plus a mauve iris alternating with a spray of 6 pink flowers and a curving leaf.\nColours: black, white, pink, green, yellow, mauve, dark blue, blue, dark pink.",
