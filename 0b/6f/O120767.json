At each cardinal point is a large white blossom. The border of both medallions has vestigial hooks. The red medallion is nearly enclosed by four blue diagonal hooked bars with pink and red horned motifs within a central cartouche containing an S-motif. In the two upper corners is a horizontal green bar with a similar cartouche and a S-motif. These are repeated in the same design position towards the bottom of the carpet. Beneath each is most of a red star-like medallion outlined in yellow with the outer side being one straight line. This may indicate that we have the complete width of a design which has been cramped into a small space. In the lower centre is a smaller multi-sided pink star and to either side, another pointed green bar, this time vertical. Elsewhere on the field are small rosettes, botehs, green leaves.\n\nWARP: white wool; Z3S; 15-17 threads per inch (61-69 per dm).\n\nWEFT: shades of brown wool; Z2S; 2 shoots after every row of knots; 8 knots per inch (30 to the dm).\n\nPILE: wool; 10 original colours and 1 re-knotted colour; dark red, red, orange (re-knotting, tones in well on the back but has changed to orange on the front), yellow, dark green, green, dark blue, blue, pink, dark brown (some areas of dark brown may originally have been purple), white; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 60-68 knots per sq. inch (915-1035 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: probably not original: 3 cords overcast in blue wool.\n\nEND FINISH:  missing.",
