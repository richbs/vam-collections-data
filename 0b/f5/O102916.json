            "public_access_description": "This statue brought Rodin to the attention of the public. It is Rodin's earliest full-scale, independently produced statue to have survived. He started work on the figure in 1875, having recently returned from a visit to Italy where he was profoundly influenced by Michelangelo and the works of classical and Renaissance sculptors which he sketched extensively. It owes much to these respected influences, but caused much controversy when the plaster model was first exhibited in 1877. Most wounding to Rodin were repeated accusations, due to the very life-like appearance of the figure, that it had been cast from life, rather than being freely modelled. Criticism was also made of the 'low type' of model chosen, which needed 'a little more nobility in the head, a little less thinness of the lips'. Rodin created the work during the Franco-Prussian war, when he left Paris to live in Belgium. He chose a soldier, Auguste Neyt, as the model, from barracks near to his home in Brussels. \nThe figure originally held a spear (shown in a drawing by Rodin), and its first title was 'The Vanquished'. When the spear was removed by Rodin soon afterwards, there was much confusion and speculation about the meaning of the statue.  Another title given to it was 'The Awakening of Mankind', before it was exhibited as 'The Age of Bronze' in the Paris Salon of 1877.\nThe figure was cast in bronze in May 1880 and a cast was purchased by the French Government, marking official acceptance of the work. It was set up in the Luxembourg Gardens in 1884. A number of versions have been cast since, from 1890s and into the 20th century.",
