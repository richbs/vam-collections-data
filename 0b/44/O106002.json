The precise geometric framework of the brooch's outline contrasts with the web of incredibly fine platinum threads specked with  granules of gold which swirls within. Of the themes underlying his work Corvaja has written 'My inspiration lies in both natural and man-made structures viewed through a microscope.... I am also further inspired by technique itself and the creative possibilities which emerge when knowing how to apply it, researching it further and, eventually pushing it to extremes'. \n\nTrained in Padua, an Italian city renowned for its innovative work in gold, and then at the Royal College of Art in London, Corvaja's technical mastery and artistic vision are widely admired.",
