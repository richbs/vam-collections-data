(The British Museum then held the collections that now comprise the Natural History Museum.) The human skeleton depicted is of no special significance, apart from the fact that it is probably of a European. The gorilla, however, shows evidence of severe trauma to its left arm - a bite from a lion to the lower part of its left humerus. Gorillas do not spend much time \u2018standing\u2019 upright because it takes muscle energy for them to do so. Thus, the supposedly \u2018neutral\u2019 presentation of a gorilla skeleton is in fact the presentation of an idea: \u2018a gorilla standing is not too different from a human standing\u2019.",
