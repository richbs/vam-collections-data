It is based on a design by the cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale, who became famous when he published his furniture designs in 1754.  His book was entitled The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director. His designs for elaborate \u2018Ribband Back\u2019 chairs were very difficult to carve. They were light and elegant, but not robust. Although the book became widely known, few cabinetmakers made chairs in this particular style in the 1700s. Chippendale designs became fashionable again from about 1860. Many reproductions of \u2018Ribband Back chairs\u2019 were then made.",
