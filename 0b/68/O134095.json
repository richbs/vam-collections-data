            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 18-19\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"CALLCOTT, Sir Augustus Wall, RA (1779-1844)\n\nBorn Kensington Gravel Pits, London, 20 February 1779, son of a builder. First studied music in the Westminster Abbey choir, then painting with John Hoppner RA; entered RA Schools 1797. Exhibited 129 works at the RA between 1799 and 1844, and 14 at the BI 1806-38. A few early exhibits were portraits, but he soon achieved success with picturesque landscapes influenced by Gainsborough and 17th-century Dutch painting. From about 1815 exhibited principally coastal and marine subjects; his work was compared to that of Aelbert Cuyp and, especially, Turner, with whom he had a close association. Also painted classical landscapes in the manner of Claude, and a variety of genre, humorous, literary and historical subjects. Travelled abroad, notably in 1827-8 following his marriage to Maria Graham, a writer of art and travel books and most famous for <i>Little Arthur's History of England</i> (1835). Elected ARA 1806, RA 1810, knighted 1837. Served on committees for the Government Schools of Design and the National Gallery, and was appointed Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures 1843. Died Kensington 25 November 1844; his studio sales of drawings and watercolours were at Christie's 8-12 May 1845 and 22 June 1863. Although in his lifetime his work commanded high prices and attracted the leading patrons of the day, it was not always well received by the critics, particularly in later years; Ruskin wrote that 'he painted everything tolerably, and nothing excellently'. \n\nLIT: \t<i>Athenaeum</i> 17 December 1831, pp817-8, 30 November 1844, pp1097-8 (obit); <i>Art Union</i> 1845, p15 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p9, 1866, p99, 1896, p334; J Dafforne <i>Pictures of Sir A W Callcott</i> ... nd [1875] (referred to below as Dafforne); <i>Portfolio</i> 1875, p161; DB Brown <i>Augustus Wall Callcott</i> Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (with full bibliography and list of archival sources) (referred to below as Brown) \n\n\n<b>Slender and Anne Page</b> \nFA10 Neg 31842 \nPanel, 50.8 x 71.1 cm (20 x 28 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nThe subject is taken from Shakespeare's <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> act 1 scene 1: \n\n<i>Anne:</i>\t\tWill't please your worship to come in, Sir? \n<i>Slender:</i>\tNo, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well. \n<i>Anne:</i>\t\tThe dinner attends you, Sir. \n<i>Slender:</i>\tI am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go, sirrah, for all you are my man; go wait upon my cousin Shallow. \n\nThere seem to be two other versions of the subject. 'Scene from the Merry Wives of Windsor' was exhibited at the BI in 1834 (236), most of the above quotation given in the catalogue and the size recorded as '15 by 18 inches'; a still smaller version is in the Royal Shakespeare Company collection at Stratford-upon-Avon. \n\nAfter the artist's marriage to Maria Graham in 1827, he painted several scenes with literary and theatrical subjects. For another scene by Callcott from <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, for example, see 'Falstaff and Simple', FA10. The Buxton Museum and Art Gallery exhibition catalogue comments on the popularity of Slender's inept courtship of Mistress Page as a subject for painters; in addition to Bonington's well-known depiction (c1815, Wallace Collection) several pictures were exhibited at the RA in the 19th century, including those by H P Briggs (1821), H Milling (1832), S Drummond (1834), T Duncan (1836), J C Horsley (1852), W P Frith (1854), H S Marks (1855), and C W Cope (1875 and 1882). There is also a painting by Robert Smirke in the Royal Shakespeare Company collection. C R Leslie exhibited a version of the subject at the BI in 1819, and invented a new scene to paint in which Slender accepts Anne Page's invitation and sits down to dinner with the whole cast of the play; this new scene was exhibited in two versions, at the RA in 1831 and 1838, and the latter is also in the V&A collections (see FA110, p158). \n\nDafforne's suggestion that 'Callcott evidently designed this composition with a view to the theatrical representation, for at each side are stage-hangings' does not seem likely to be true. \n\nTwo sketches, one for Slender and the other for Anne Page, were lots 113 and 114 in C J  Palmer's sale at Christie's 16 May 1868, bought Dott \u00a32 2s and Graves \u00a39 10s respectively. \n\nEXH: <i>\tShakespeare's Heroines in the Nineteenth Century</i> Buxton Museum and Art Gallery 1980 (2) \n\nENGR: Frederick Bacon, for <i>Finden's Royal Gallery of British Art</i> 1838 (three states in V&A collections) \n\nLIT: <i>\tDafforne</i> p23; G Ashton <i>Shakespeare's Heroines in the Nineteenth Century</i> Buxton Museum and Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1980, p8, reprp9 \n\nREPR: <i>The Sheepshanks Gallery</i> 1870, pl 10; <i>Abridged Catalogue of Oil Paintings</i> 1908, pl V; <i>The Studio</i> spring special number 1916 ('Shakespeare in Pictorial Art') pl 87 colour \"",
