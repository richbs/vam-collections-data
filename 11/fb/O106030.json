Their development into glove puppets began in the late 18th century, with the addition of mobile booths, that would save transportation costs and effort.\n\nThe character of Mr Punch originated in the Pulcinella of Italian Commedia dell\u2019Arte, similarly the inspiration for early British pantomime. He is instantly recognisable by his characteristic long nose and his reedy voice comes from the small metal \u2018swozzle\u2019 that the puppeteer or \u2018professor\u2019 holds in his mouth.\n\nWal Kent was a maker of Punch & Judy glove puppets, carving them in his workshop in Gravesend, Kent. Many of his figures were exhibited in The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild\u2019s annual exhibitions in the 1940s and 1950s, and were nominated for the Davidson trophy for the best glove puppet in show. His distinctive style has been widely imitated and many of his original puppets are still in use, over 50 years after carving, by companies such as Properpunch, in Yorkshire.",
