In the mid 16th century, coffee drinking had spread from Yemen to other parts of the Ottoman empire. By the 18th century, when this jug was made, it was widespread.\n\nThis piece was made in K\u00fctahya, in western Anatolia. The town had a long tradition of making pottery. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was overshadowed by the town of Iznik. But in the 18th century, after the industry in Iznik collapsed, K\u00fctahya became the main centre for fritware production in Turkey. Fritware, also called stone paste and quartz paste, was developed by Middle Eastern potters as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain.",
