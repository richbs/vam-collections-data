Remains of leather lining covered inside by the lid by crimson velvet, all later.  Lock long wanting.  On the lid (rear hinges foremost), a pair of addorsed angels supporting a blank cartouche, within a formal border.  On the front (hinges), a standing angel between standing cherubs within a formal border of leafy scrolls; similar borders above and below.  \n\nOn the rear (lock) pillastered [sic] panels, that in the centre containing reclining figures addorsed, the flanking panels containing standing cherubs, all within a pattern of leafy scrolls.  On each end, a pair of lovers.\n\nITALIAN; 16th century\n\nGeneral Remarks\n\nThe lid of a closely similar box, but not of this box has been put on wrong way round probably in the original workshop (and neither by an honest repairer nor by a dishonest vendor)\n\nBequeathed by Mrs Alfred Williams Hearn.",
