The turned knob handle on each drawer apparently added, as evidenced by inlay patches. The lower drawer originally with a single, centred handle.The drawer fronts bordered with a simple cushion moulding. The top, sides and drawer fronts with glued-on marquetry panels of rosewood(? visual identification), other woods (probably including boxwood), and bone (?), some engraved, the lines filled with a black composition, and some shaded by singeing. The top with a central cartouche surrounded by stylised flowers on leafy stems including carnations, set within a wide rectangular border with two baskets and stylised flowers on leafy stems. Some inlay missing especially at the corners. The matching sides with two symmetrical panels, each showing a vase in classical style decorated with three masks and gadrooning, from which extend numerous stylised flowers on leafy stems, two birds perching with wings extended on a scrolling stem. The drawer fronts each with a basket from which extends stylised flowers on leafy stems. The back cut (possibly not originally) for an inlay scheme of scrolling flowers on leafy stems, all the inlay now missing. The bottom of plain oak board (split and with a replacement section), the grain running front to back, nailed up.",

Apart from their convenience for storing small objects, their appeal must have consisted in their decoration. Panels of marquetry using different coloured woods were glued to the top, sides and drawer fronts. It has been suggested that such work was influenced by Spanish woodwork of the period, partly because of the use of rosewood, a costly imported hardwood not normally found in 16th century English furniture, and partly because the delicate, scrolling stems are similar to those seen on Spanish woodwork of the time.",
