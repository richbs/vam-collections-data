Advertising Theatre de Complicite's touring production of  Help! I'm Alive.  The logos of  the sponsor, Beck's Beer, features in the lower left section, recto and verso, with the logos of  The British Council and the GLA very small, lower right.  The image is dominant but is overprinted in small lettering with the name of the company; the title of the play; the cast details; details about the Italian writer Ruzzante and Commedia dell'Arte and the words 'text combines with rhythm to make music. sitting on a chair becomes a dance. death is a joke and a joke turns to tragedy. the tragedy is about a struggle to survive'; and 'what we have we do not want. what we want we cannot have. death, love, sex, hunger, money, defacation, everything we don't admit and need to celebrate'.  It is printed in black verso with details of  the 1990-1991 Company news, and tour dates and venues.",
