Their inspiration was Italian Futurism. The Futurists, obsessed with machinery and dynamics, made pictures and sculptures characterised by semi-abstract geometric form. Wadsworth's main printmaking activity was confined largely to the period 1913-1921, in which he made about 50 woodcuts. They are recognisable for their sharp tonal contrasts and dizzying articulation of space, most striking in the black and white images. In the last year of World War One, Wadsworth's design talents were harnessed by the Royal Navy, then in need of dazzle camouflage for their warships - bold diagonal patterns and zigzag bands intended to confuse the enemy.",

London, V&A Publications, 2001.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Edward Alexander Wadsworth (1889-1949)</b> \n\n<i>Fa\u00e7ade</i>, 1914-15 \n\nIn July the Vorticists burst onto the scene with the publication of a manifesto in their journal <i>Blast</i>.  One of the signatories was Edward Wadsworth and this print epitomizes his Vorticist work.  Announcing a desire to engage directly with the modern industrial world, the Vorticists declared 'machinery is the greatest earth medium', and although the title of this print sounds architectural, the image suggests powerful interlocking machinery, perhaps the looms with which Wadsworth was familiar from the Wadsworth family mill at Cleckheaton in Yorkshire. \nThe bold black-and-white shapes of the print display Wadsworth's gift for abstract design, a talent that was later to be employed in the dazzle-camouflage of ships.  From 1918 he supervised work on over 2,000 ships, mostly at Bristol and Liverpool, covering them with extraordinarily bold diagonal patterns and zigzag bands intended to confuse the enemy. \nWadsworth's affinity with the woodcut is apparent here: the flat impersonal quality of the medium suited the machine-like character of his art and he cut the intricate interlocking designs with remarkable precision.  Responding to a letter from the New York collector John Quinn, Wadsworth wrote: \n<i>You seem to like the woodcuts best.  To a certain extent I agree with you: I think they are probably best in that they are most complete - that is to say, the means of expression is in a more complete accordance with the thing expressed in them...</i> \nWadsworth's woodcuts won the admiration of the artist Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who carried some with him as a soldier on the Western Front.  Writing to Wadsworth from the trenches, he made a special request: \n<i>I have your letter with the woodcuts...When you send me some more, as I am greedy to see much vorticism just now, just print them on the thin paper.  The reason is this, I have room for them in my knapsack and the less weighty the individuals are, the more I shall be able to stuff in.</i> \nGaudier was among Wadsworth's friends killed in the Great War, and like many artists, Wadsworth found his attitude to mechanization changed after the appalling carnage of those years.  When he returned to portraying the northern industrial scenes that had inspired his early pictures, his vision was bleaker: the machine age had shown a darker side.  Wadsworth abandoned the woodcut, the medium that had been central to his Vorticist work.  This print represents that brief period of innocent untarnished enthusiasm for machines that preceded the First World War.\"",
