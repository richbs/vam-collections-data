To be seen on the hunting field was an essential attribute of social success. This coat is from an important collection previously in Castle Howard, Yorkshire, that includes seven scarlet coats and one blue coat as well as waistcoats, breeches, stockings and boots. \n\nThere were many different hunt membership rules regulating the colour of the coat, collar and buttons. The initials engraved onto the buttons show that the wearer belonged to a particular hunt. This type of coat was known as a field hunt coat. It was generally adopted for hunting during the 19th century and changed very little in style for well over a hundred years. Field hunt coats were generally single-breasted and cut in the style of a frock coat. They often had collars that could be buttoned well up to the neck and had woollen or flannel linings for extra warmth.",
