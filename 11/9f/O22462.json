By the time this wine flask was made in the late Choson dynasty (1392\u20131910) such porcelain had come to dominate ceramic production. Plain white wares, with their connotations of purity and honesty, were popular in a culture embedded in Confucian philosophy. However, porcelains painted under the glaze with iron brown, copper red and, as in this case, cobalt blue were also prized.\n\nRepeated three times around the bulbous body of the flask is the Chinese character for longevity surrounded by four bats, which carry the same symbolic meaning, and a scrollwork frame.",
