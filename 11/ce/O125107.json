            "history_note": "Historical significance: Giambattista was one of the most renowned painters of eighteenth-century Italy. He studied in the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini. However Tiepolo moved away from the classicising style of his master, creating instead works with a focus on tonal qualities in the manner employed by his contemporaries Giambattista Piazzetta and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. This follows in the tradition of the sixteenth-century artist Tiepolo. Tiepolo began his career painting a series of canvases depicting <i>Prophets</i> and <i>Apostles</i> for S Maria dei Derelitti, Venice, in 1715-16. He is documented on the register of the Venetian confraternity of painters in the following year. \n\nBy the 1720's Tiepolo's success at home brought many commissions from outside Venice. Between 1725-6 he worked in Udine, on a scheme of frescoes for the Patriarchal Palace (now the Archbishop's Palace) for the Patricarch Dionsio Dolfin. In 1730-31 Tiepolo worked in Milan producing works including frescoes for five ceilings in the Palazzo Archinto. During the 1740s, Tiepolo was at the height of his fame. He produced paintings indcluding  the <i> Family of Darius before Alexander</i> (1743) and the frescoes of <i>The meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> for the Palazzo Labia, Venice. From 1750-3 Tiepolo worked in W\u00fcrzburg on a commission for frescoes of the ceiling and walls for the Kaisersaal of the Residenz at W\u00fcrzburg. Again in Venice, Tiepolo became the president of the Venetian Academy in 1756. In March, 1762, Tiepolo was summoned by Charles III of Spain (reigned 1759-88) to paint three ceiling frescoes in the Palacio Real, Madrid. He travelled that year with his sons, Giandomenico and Lorenzo, to work on the project. He was to remain in Spain until his death in 1770. Tiepolo's works ranged from frescoes and paintings on canvas of histories, mythologies and religious subjects. As well as these works, which were the result of commissions from patrons, Tiepolo also produced a series of etchings. Tiepolo was an expert printmaker. His output can be seen in the two main groups of etchings that he produced, the <i>Capricci</i>, a group of ten prints, and the 24 <i>Scherzi di fantasia</i>. Stylistically these works probably date to the 1730s or 1740s.\n\nThis sketch is related to the study in the National Art Gallery London (inventory no. NG6409) and the great canvas at Archangelskoye, near Moscow. The story of the relationship between Mark Anthony (83-30BC) and Cleopatra (69-30 BC) was a popular subject for artists in the eighteenth century, covering themes of love, war and death. In this composition Tiepolo represents the famous banquet that Cleopatra holds for Mark Anthony. A drawing after the painting by Fragonard was made in 1760. A note on the drawing records that the painting was in the collection of Angelo Vecchia in Vicenza. It was probably commissioned by Carlo Cordellina in 1743, possibly for his palace in San Maruizio, Venice, which was sold following his death in 1792. The canvas then passed to Saint Petersburg. \n\nThe scene that is represented here is taken from the Roman historian Pliny\u2019s <u>Natural History </u> (AD.77). This episode represents the famous contest between the Roman and Egyptian rulers, who would eventually become lovers, in which Cleopatra wagers that she can hold a feast more lavish than those which Mark Anthony is famed for. This drawing shows the moment when Cleopatra removes a pearl from her necklace and drops it in vinegar to dissolve it before drinking the concoction, thus proving the extravagance of her feast.\n\nThe composition, with steps in the foreground leading up to the main scene, recalls paintings of the sixteenth century artist Veronese. Tiepolo drew heavily from the work of Veronese and the sixteenth-century dress of Cleopatra in this drawing also reflects the work of the earlier artist. Various figures are sketched seated on the stairs, showing the artist working out the composition. In the National Gallery oil sketch, the staircase has been placed at the centre of the composition, thus leading our eyes up to the banquet. The architectural backdrop is made symmetrical in the later sketch, thus strengthening the setting and emphasising the grandeur of this famous banquet.",

            "historical_context_note": "The theme of the banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra occurs frequently in the work of Giambattista Tiepolo. There are canvases of the subject in Stockholm and the National Gallery of Victoria, Melborne (inventory no. 103-4), dated 1743-4. The frescoed room in the Palazzo Labia, Venice, painted in 1745-50, is decorated with scenes from the lives of these ill fated lovers. Although the composition of the V&A sketch is reversed in the Palazzo Labia fresco, with Cleopatra on the left instead of the right, there are similarities in the treatment. Comparison of the sketches at the V&A and National Gallery with the finished versions, both fresco and canvas, show Tiepolo developing a theme. These paintings were mainly produced for Venetians. However the canvas now in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melborne, was purchased directly from the artist's studio by Count Algarotti and dispatched to Dresden, thus reflecting the popularity of the subject and artist within Europe during the middle of the eighteenth century.",
