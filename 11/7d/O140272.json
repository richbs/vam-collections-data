            "public_access_description": "This relief is said to have come from Syria. Probably, with A.2-1912 from the covers of a book.\nThe iconographical tradition of representing Christ was slow to develop in Byzantine art. Once established, however, images of Christ remained remarkably consistent because of an emphasis from sixth-century onwards on the authentic likeness of Christ that were all supposedly derived from Acheiropoiet fashioned during his lifetime but lost. \nThe best known type is that of Christ Pantokrator - \"all sovereign\". Traditionally the pantokrator was depicted frontally disposed, a severe bearded figure, blessing with his right hand raised before his chest, while clasping a Gospel book or scroll in his left. On the present example the type of the head is unusually free, and full of character, and in this respect resembles the heads of Christ on the reverse of coins of Justinianus II (685-695); these also have the cross behind the head, without the halo.\nReliefs treated with stain in the manner of this panel, are rare, and the colour was probably used to give the appearance of steatite. The green hue could also come as a result of burial, as ivory is extremely permeable and may absorb colour from surrounding materials.",
