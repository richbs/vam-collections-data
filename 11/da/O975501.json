            "history_note": "Andrea Pozzo (1642-1709) was an Italian painter, architect, theorist and painter of interiors. He first began his training in Trento, where he was born. He later moved to Venice where he completed his training. He is best known for his spectacular trompe-l\u2019oeil frescoes. In 1665 he joined the Jesuit Order and remained a Jesuit lay brother for the rest of his life. In the church of Sant\u2019Ignazio in Rome, he realized his most famous works, the Allegory of the Jesuits' Missionary Work in the ceiling of the nave between 1680 and 1690 and the illusionistic architectural dome painted on canvas at the beginning of the following century. He travelled with his work to Vienna, in 1703, where he later died. During his life he enjoyed a European-wide fame and he left many followers at his death.\n\nAs a theorist of perspective Pozzo wrote the Prospettiva de pittori e architetti d\u2019Andrea Pozzo della Compagnia di Ges\u00f9 between 1693 and 1698. The first part was published in Rome in 1693, while the first complete edition consisting of both parts one and two was published in 1700, also in Rome. The book was intended to teach artists the proper use of perspective, both in painting and architecture. It contained 220 plates, all of which were accompanied by a technical explanation. The book became a manual for artists and architects alike across the world and was translated into several languages, including English, German, French and also Chinese.",
