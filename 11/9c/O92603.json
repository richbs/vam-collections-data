From the Museum's inception in 1852, its founding principle has been to make art and design accessible to all. The plain-spoken language in the poster's copy was meant to emphasize the easy, democratic nature of accessing the V&A collections. The work of art depicted in the poster is an ivory sculpture, Venus and Cupid, by Le Marchand.",
