Its traditional jewellery often retains many medieval characteristics lost elsewhere.\n\nIcelandic woman wore many decorative appliqu\u00e9s on their costume, on their dress and headband, as well as the belt.  The filigree decoration on this belt is typical of the kind worn by women in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Filigree was popular throughout the Nordic region, but Icelandic work is different from that made in other countries.  The regular asymmetric designs recall the sinuous lines of Viking ornament. The silversmiths were often farmers, who only worked part time at metal work, but they underwent full apprenticeships in places like Copenhagen, and the quality of their careful work is the equal of that from anywhere else.",
