            "public_access_description": "This large, flat dish has lustre decoration in yellow and brown. Experts think this two-colour combination, seen also in some contemporary glass, represents the earliest phase of lustre production in ceramics. \n\nPotters in Iraq invented the technique of lustre decoration on ceramics in the 9th century. First they made a glazed vessel or tile with little or no decoration in the normal way. When the piece had cooled, a design was painted over the glaze in metallic compounds. The pot or tile was then fired again, this time with a restricted supply of oxygen. In these conditions, the metallic compounds broke down, and a thin deposit of copper or silver was left on the surface of the glaze. When polished, this surface layer reflected the light.",
