On the front is a printed image, from an illustration signed Douglas Annand, depicting Randwick race-course.\n\nThe image is printed from an outline drawing coloured in pastel washes in pink, several shades of green, brown, orange and grey. The perspective is set as though viewed from above. The top of the image is framed by the race-course building. In the centre, which is landscaped with trees, is the crowd of race-goers, all wearing a variety of hats, and dotted among them are betting stands below umbrellas. In the foreground are horses and jockeys and the bottom of the image is framed by stands in which more horses and jockets wait for the race to start.\n\nThe text on the back of the menu card, printed in black in a serif font, describes the race-course. This is headed with an italic headline font 'Orient Line' and 'Randwick'. At the bottom, in a smaller italic font, is text mentioning that this is one of a series of seven impressions of race courses by the same artist; the V&A has one of the others, E.356-2005. Separating the two headlines and the two texts is a pink star.\n\nInside, the dinner menu is printed on the right half  in a black sans-serif font with occasional italics, centered.",

Illustrated menus such as this were printed in advance on land with the inside (menu part) left blank, to be printed on board ship. Passengers often kept them as souvenirs. The menus reflect the luxury of cruise liner travel during its heyday. \"Oronsay\" was a new liner, making her maiden voyage in 1951. \n\nDouglas Annand (1903-1976) was a designer and leading light of Australian modernism. From the 1930s he designed the corporate images for some of Australia's largest companies, including the Orient Line (later P&O). Based from 1930 in Sydney, he also produced magazine covers, advertisements, labels, wrapping papers, and textiles. He is well known for his large public mural work, which earned him the Sir John Sulman award in 1941, 1947 and 1951; one of these was for a mural for Orient Line headquarters.",
