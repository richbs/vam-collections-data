Such figures were originally intended to be set out on the dessert table, but by the time this one was made they were also widely used in interior decoration, much as they are today. The finest Zurich porcelain figures were modelled by Johann Valentin Sonnenschein between about 1775 and 1779, but this one may have been modelled after he left the factory. The Zurich porcelain factory had been founded in 1763 and contined production until the end of the 19th century.",
