Each piece becomes an enchanting, decorative work of art. Professor Rabinovitch established a close rapport with each artist, always encouraging a freedom of creative expression.  The response of these silversmiths has been not only to be strikingly imaginative but also to honour him by giving him their best work.\n\nThis collection is testimony to the significant contribution that one individual can make to supporting the craft of silversmithing.  After commissioning work from some of the most illustrious names in British and North American silversmithing, Professor Rabinovitch has very generously donated his entire collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, through the American Friends of the V&A."

The slightly domed circle is bevelled all around and features a central, enamelled, stony pool, with fish abounding.  The enamelling combines <font -i>basse taille</font> and painting (Limoges) techniques.  The pool is surrounded by engraved silver \"stones\" with silver lily pads at the rear.  The front half of the pool is shallow, with brown green coloration;  the stony bed and a swarm of fish are clearly seen.  The rear half of the pool, deeper, is blue green in colour with fish and stones less clear and with enamelled lily pads at the rear - carried on by the silver pads.  The handle junction is a circular growth of gilded stiff reeds (spiked leaves out of which rises the stalk of an iris.  It has large engraved, frilled and patterned leaves which constitute the handle, and which bend over in an S shape and encompasses the stem of an iris flower, the finial decoration.  The leaves form a comfortable handle close to the lift.  The handle is completely gilded.  It may be dismounted for cleaning by a screw under the blade.  The server is both modestly functional and highly decorative.",
