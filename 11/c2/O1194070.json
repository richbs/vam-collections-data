This doll is a good example of this made, by Clifford Toys Registered and manufactured in Hong Kong out of hard plastic. \n\nAnother doll for boys is Action Man, who started life in 1964 in the USA where he was known as GI Joe and was a revolutionary toy at the time, since dolls for boys had never been popular before. He arrived in the UK two years later and was given the new name Action Man. Cowboy dolls can be viewed in the same light and although the Museum has some cowboy paraphernalia, it does not have many dolls. A later example of a popular cowboy doll can be seen in the example of Woody, a toy cowboy that comes to life starring in the Disney film Toy Story in 1995.",
