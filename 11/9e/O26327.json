Dramatic social changes were taking place and the idea of teaching through this form of play was quickly falling from favour. However, with the accession of the new queen in 1837, a number of games were updated to include her coronation and marriage. This game looks very like a dissected puzzle. Portraits of 40 British kings and queens--in 80 playing spaces altogether--are shown with events from each of their reigns.",

The Card sold with the Game is to be divided.  The Letters are to mark the players' position on the Game; the Numbers and Blanks are to be placed in a lady's reticule or bag.\nII.  Draw for the first player; the highest number to begin.\nIII.  Each player on drawing a number is to place his letter on the same number on the Game, unless otherwise ordered in the directors, which must be read aloud.  When it is his turn to draw again, he must add his number to the one where his letter stands, and remove it accordingly.  If he draws a blank, he must remain where he is.  Each card is to be returned to the bag.\nIV.  The game is to proceed in this manner till some player arrives at the Marriage of Queen Victoria, who wins the game.\nV.  When a player is sent back, he is not to read the Directions, but wait his turn to draw again.\nThe history of each reign may be read or omitted at the time of playing, as the players think fit.\n\nFollowing the Rules are the Directions which accompany most but not all of the medallions.  These must be followed when playing the game.\n\nFollowing the Directions are the descriptions of each of the medallions which may or may not be read aloud during the game and these can be omitted if all the players agree.  The first describes the pre-Roman Britons and the last Queen Victoria and includes her marriage, February 10, 1840 but not the birth of her first child in 1841.  This suggests the date of 1840.\n\nThe medallions are arranged with No. 1 in the top left corner, 16 in the top right, 17 starts on the left as the second row; this pattern continues until No. 80 in the bottom corner of the right at the end of the fifth row.\n\nRules placement: booklet",
