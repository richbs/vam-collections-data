After A.W.N.Pugin's death in 1852 the house was let until 1864 when the Pugin family returned. \n\nE.W. Pugin inherited his father's architectural practice and followed the same principles  when designing furniture. This chair shows A.W.N. Pugin's preference for revealed construction in the pegs holding the legs and stretchers together. His influence is also seen in the use of chamfers or shallow grooves running along the edge of the legs and back. E.W. Pugin combined his father's ideas with new details such as the broad back support in a quite different chair in the Gothic style. This design influenced commercial furniture firms such as C.& R. Light of London who advertised a very similar chair in their catalogue of 1880.",
