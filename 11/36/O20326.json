However, it does have features which lift it out of the ordinary.  Dresser's commitment to practicality led him to include a dip in the soup plates to make the last spoonful easier.\n\nPlaces\nThe Old Hall Earthenware Co. Ltd. was the first limited liability company in the Staffordshire potteries.  It was founded in 1861 in Hanley, and was formerly Charles Meigh & Son. In 1886 it became the Old Hall Porcelain Works. Earthenware production was less expensive than bone china or porcelain and this tableware would probably have been used in a comparatively modest home, although one with some artistic aspirations. It may also have served as everyday ware in a home where more expensive bone china was kept 'for best'.\n\nPeople\nDresser was a trained botanist and perhaps the most radical and prolific of 19th-century designers. He was often described as a 'pioneer of modern design' and he promoted quality, machine production and new materials. His interest in and  commitment to commercial design meant that he actively sought opportunities to design for inexpensive mass production.",
