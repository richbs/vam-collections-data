This chair was based on a medieval chair at York Minster.\n\nPeople\nWindham Henry Wyndham-Quin, 2nd Earl of Dunraven (1782-1850), was a self-taught architect, collector, traveller and medieval enthusiast, whose marriage to an heiress enabled him to demolish the modest Georgian house at Adare in County Limerick in the 1830s and replace it with a vast Gothic mansion. He employed the architect L.N. Cottingham (1787-1847) to make working drawings of his architectural ideas and also to design appropriate furniture, including library bookcases and a pair of these chairs.\n\nPlaces\nThe Long Gallery at Adare Manor was furnished with medieval-style furnishings, either old or new, by Lord and Lady Dunraven. During their visits to the Continent in 1834 and 1836 they acquired 17th-century Flemish carved oak choir stalls.  They bought Elizabethan portraits, used 15th-century carved panels for the doors and commissioned designs for heraldic stained glass from the antiquary Thomas Willement (1786-1871). The room also contained Victorian copies of 17th-century Indian ebony settees and two of these chairs.",
