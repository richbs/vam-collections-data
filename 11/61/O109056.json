In Catholic belief the wine miraculously transforms into the blood of Christ during this service, so chalices were usually made from precious metals to reflect the precious status of their contents. \n\nThis chalice was made for Catholic worship in Mexico. The inscription under the foot tells us it was made for the Third Order of Franciscans at Quer\u00e9taro, in Mexico, in 1773. In the early 13th century St Francis of Assisi is said to have founded three monastic orders, the Friars Minor, the Poor Ladies or Clares, and the Brothers and Sisters of Penance (the Third Order). \n\nThe Franciscans were very influential in Spanish-owned territories. Spain established colonies in South and Central America from the 1520s onwards and introduced Catholicism with missionary zeal.",

Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
