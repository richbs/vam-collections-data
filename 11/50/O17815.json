He completed his artistic training with a three-year journey in Italy and specialised in contemporary subjects upon his return to France.  His work is characterised by a wide range of media (drawings, prints, pastels, paintings and sculptures) and shares many components with the Realist and Impressionist movement even though he remained quite independent. At the end of his life he was regarded as a major artistic figure.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Degas' opera scenes. It depicts the final act of the Romantic opera Robert le Diable when deceased nuns come back to life and execute some bacchanal dance. The scene is depicted from behind the orchestra and the first rows of spectators among whom can be recognised some friends of the artist. This compositional idea is quite typical of Degas and is recurring in several stage representations. Although Degas was close to some Impressionist painters, he rather defined his work as realist.",

Though the colour is more sober than that which we have come to regard as characteristic of the painter's maturity, the work contains in embryo the qualities which we admire in the more brilliant work of Degas's later years - the striking unconventionality of design, the directness of expression, and the unfailing grip of character and reality in the drawing, which make a great art out of material which in other hands may be fit only for the poster of a <i>caf\u00e9 chantant</i>. The quality and vividness of the heads in the foreground recall Goya almost as much as does the weird lighting of the dancers behind them, but the actual craftmanship has in it elements of firmness to which Goya attained but rarely. Goya was content to be a brilliant <i>improvisateur</i>. Degas seems to improvise, and yet works all the time with a consumate science that makes one think of Terborch's dainty sureness in using white and black as a foil for the human face. In England, where the later developments of French art still appeal only to a limited audience, it is fortunate that Degas should be represented thus, because here it is still the custom to talk as if the so-called Impressionists were at least imperfectly trained if not also imperfectly gifted. This single picture is enough to show that, in the case of one important master at least, such an idea is an utter mistake. It has also the advantage of being a starting point from which further additions to our national collections can easily be made, so that they may some day be brought up to date without any serious lack of sequence.'\nKauffmann, C.M., <u>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, II. 1800-1900</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 24-25, cat. no. 58.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nHilaire Germain Edgar DEGAS (1834-1917) \nFrench School \nBorn in Paris, the son of a wealthy banker, he first studied law at his father's wish. In 1855 he took up painting and went to classes at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. He went to Italy in 1856-57 and on his return painted history subjects. The influence of Ingres dominated his student years but from about 1865 this was replaced by that of Manet, whose friend he had become. In the war of 1870-71 he was in the artillery and a year later he visited the U.S.A. He exhibited at seven of the eight Impressionist Exhibitions held between 1874 and 1886, but open-air landscape painting never played a predominant role in his work as it did in that of the Impressionists. In the second half of his career he concentrated on painting ballet dancers in pastel and oil. \n\n58 \nTHE BALLET SCENE FROM MEYERBEER'S OPERA 'ROBERT LE DIABLE' \nSigned lower left <i>Degas</i> \nCanvas \n29 \u00be x 32 (76.6 x 81.3) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.19\n\nMeyerbeer's opera, which was first performed in Paris in November 1831, contains a scene dominated by the phantoms of nuns who in life had been unfaithful to their vows. They were conjured from their tombs by a mysterious character called Bertram, who intended to use them to bring about the ruin of his son Robert. Degas devoted some two-thirds of the composition to showing the shadowy forms of the nuns on the stage; the foreground contains the orchestra and the front three rows of the stalls, effectively forming a group portrait of some of Degas' friends. Albert Hecht, the collector, appears on the extreme left holding his opera glasses; next but one to the right, in full profile, is D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dihau, the bassoonist in the orchestra; the bearded figure seen from behind towards the right is the amateur painter Vicomte Lepic (for other portraits of these friends of the artist see J. S. Boggs, <i>Portraits by Degas,</i> University of California Press, 1962). \nAn earlier version, upright in format and with the stage taking up only about half of the composition, which was painted for Albert Hecht, is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (H. O. Havemeyer Collection, 26 x 21 3/8 in., Lemoisne, ii, 1946, no. 294). It is dated 1872 and therefore predates by four years the Museum's version, which was completed in 1876 for the baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure (<i>Letters,</i> 1947). The relationship of the two versions to each other and to similar compositions by Degas of this period is fully discussed by Jonathan Mayne (1966). \nThere are five brush drawings of nuns - presumably sketches for the 1872 version - in the Museum (E.3685/88-1919: three repr. by Browse, 1949, pls. 6-7; four by Mayne, 1966, figs. 4-7), and another drawing in a notebook in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris (T. Reff, <i>Burl. Mag.,</i> cvii, 1965, p. 614).\nCAI.19, painted in 1876, was bought by Ionides in 1881 (the formerly prevalent view that it was bought by him in 1872 was based on a confusion with the New York version). It is, therefore, one of the earliest paintings by Degas to have been acquired by an English collector, though in this respect Ionides was preceded by Henry Hill and Louis Huth in the 1870S (Pickvance, 1963). It was, however, the first painting by Degas to enter an English museum: a work by him was not found acceptable by the N. G., even as a gift, as late as 1905 (Cooper, 1954, p. 67). \nThere is a copy of this painting by the American artist Everett Shinn entitled <i>La Favorita</i> (<i>Apollo,</i> lxxvii, 1963, p. 62, fig. 9). \n\nProv. 1876, Jean-Baptiste Faure; 28 Feb. 1881, Durand-Ruel; 7 June 1881, Constantine Alexander Ionides (see Pickvance, 1963); bequeathed to the Museum in 1900. \nLit. <i>Degas letters,</i> ed.

In a notebook of 1869 he wrote: 'Work hard on effects of evening, lamps, candles, etc. The intriguing thing is not to show the source, but the effect of light.' This scene is an excellent example of his experiments since it combines three separate light sources: the footlights, the gaslight in the flies to simulate moonlight, and the desk lights in the orchestra pit. \n\nSeveral aspects of the composition are strikingly novel for its date: The low angle, as if <i>we</i> are part of the audience, and the contrast of monumental style with a casual 'snap-shot' view. (In fact, the seemingly arbitrary cropping and the sense of spontaneity owe little to photography, which was still academic rather than informal at this date, but are thought to be derived rather from the asymmetry of the Japanese print). This format, of a stage viewed from orchestra pit or stalls, juxtaposing a dark and massive foreground with a hazy brilliant backdrop, occurs several times in Degas' oeuvre. For instance, there is another (upright) version of this scene, painted in 1872, in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. \n\nMeyerbeer's opera was first performed in 1831 and continued to enjoy popular success until the end of the century. The plot reflected a taste for macabre fantasy and 'Gothic' romance. In this scene the phantoms of nuns, who had been unfaithful to their vows in life, are conjured from the grave to entice the hero Robert to ruin and damnation. There are five drawings in the Museum, executed in the fluid oil-medium invented by Degas and known as 'peinture \u00e0 l'essence', of dancing nuns, which relate, though not directly, to this and to the earlier composition. \n\nThe picture also includes an informal group portrait. In the foreground, which encompasses the orchestra pit and three rows of stalls, are three identifiable figures, friends of Degas. On the extreme left, looking out through his opera glasses, is Albert Hecht, the collector who purchased the 1872 version of the painting; next but one to the right, seen in full profile, is D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dihau, the bassoonist in the orchestra; the bearded figure seen from behind towards the right is Vicomte Lepic, an amateur painter. \n\nIn 1881 the picture was bought by the collector Constantine Alexander Ionides. It was included in his bequest to the V&A in 1900, and was thus the first painting by Degas to enter an English museum. \n\nGillian Saunders\"\nGuy Cogeval et Beatrice Avanzi (eds), <u>De la Scene au Tableau: David, Fussli, Klimt, Moreau, Lautrec, Degas, Vuillard...</u>, Paris, 2009, pp. 255-256.\nM.

            "history_note": "1876, Jean-Baptiste Faure; 28 February 1881, Durand-Ruel (95, New Bond Street, London); from whom purchased by Constantine Alexander Ionides (possibly advised by Legros), 7 June 1881; listed in his inventory of November 1881 (private collection) with a valuation of \u00a3400; bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides in 1900.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting depicts a ballet scene from Giacomo Meyerbeer's (1791-1864) opera, <i>Robert le Diable</i>, a spectacular Romantic opera based on a chivalric romance which premiered on 21 November 1831. This semi-historical opera had a considerable success and was still performed 40 years later when Degas devised this composition. His first, rather smaller and more vertical version of this painting (66 x 54.3 cm), dated 1871, belonged to Mrs H.O. Havemeyer, who bequeathed it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (29.100.552) in 1921. \n\nThe painting depicts one of the final scenes when a company of deceased nuns come back to life and try to tempt the main protagonist, Robert. However the artist here focuses more on the accompanying musicians in the ground-floor box and the first rows of the audience rather than on the scene itself. The relatively stiff attitute of the figures in the foreground contrasts with and therefore enhances the sense of movement of the dancing nuns.\n\nAmong the figures in the foreground, one can recognise the collector Albert Hecht, on the far left holding his opera glasses, next to the bassoonist D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dihau, who appears in the exact same position in another painting (California palace of the Legion of Honor-1952.69). The bearded figure seen from behind towards the right is the amateur painter Vicomte Lepic.\n\nDegas executed several preparatory drawings for this subject, four of which are in the V&amp;A (see E.3685-1919, E.3686-1919, E.3687-1919, E.3687-1919, E.3688-1919), Degas' himself confessed: 'My art has nothing spontaneous about it, it is all reflection'. His preference for urban subjects, artificial light and use of preparatory drawings distinguishes his work from most other Impressionist painters.\n\nWalter Richard Sickert (1860-1942), who specialised in scenes from London music halls, probably knew this painting, which on its bequest to the V&amp;A in 1900 became the first painting by Degas to enter a public collection in Britain.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists. This new interest also extended to genre painting and urban modern life.",
