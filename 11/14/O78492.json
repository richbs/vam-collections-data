The introduction of forks made this less important and ewers and basins became display pieces for the sideboard.\n\nPeople\nThomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Raby and 3rd Earl of Strafford, had served with distinction in the British army under William III and Queen Anne. He was described by a contemporary as a 'loquacious, rich, illiterate, cold, tedious, constant haranguer in the House of Lords who spoke neither sense nor English.' After the death of Queen Anne in 1714 power shifted from the Tory party, which Wentworth supported, to the Whig party. He was impeached for his part in the Treaty of Utrecht (April 1713) that ended the War of the Spanish Succession and retired from political life.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis basin and its matching ewer (museum no. M.23A-1963) were made by Philip Rollos I, one of the great Huguenot goldsmiths. The Huguenots were French Protestants forced to emigrate to the Low Countries and Britain because of religious persecution in their home country. They brought many innovations in design and technique to Britain. Large basins such as this one with its heavy gadrooned border and simple decoration are characteristic of their work.",
