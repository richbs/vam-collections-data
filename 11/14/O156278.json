There is a narrow border along the top with a thick black line on 4 sides enclosing a row of red or yellow downward pointing blossoms linked by a green line along the top and divided by a light blue line forming an arch around each blossom.  There is a border along the bottom which continues part of the way up each side and enclosed by a thick black line: white ground with outward pointing red flowers alternating with a spray of 3 grey and orange flowers.  \nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  There are thick black diagonal lines. \n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark red ground with linked pairs of arrowheads segmented and outlined with black and filled with blue, pink, red, light green, light blue and pale grey.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] black ground with downward pointing diamond shaped geometric arrangements of a stem and branches with green leaves and red or pink and white buds.  The colours alternate so that one has a pink and white centre and red outer buds and vice versa.\n[b] Green ground with downward pointing geometric arrangements of a straight stem and either a central red flower and 5 pink flowers or vice versa.\nIn the lower left hand corner the triangular space has what loos like a small triangle of unworked ground inside a red triangle inside a yellow triangle. In the 'extra' triangular space immediately above the left hand border is what looks like later embroidery using faded mauve, black, orange and yellow silk.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; black, dark red, light blue, dark blue, light green, yellow, mauve, orange, dark orange, pink, dark brown, white, dark pink, dark green.",
