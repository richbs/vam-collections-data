            "physical_description": "Marquetry cabinet in three parts: a shallow top box with lifting lid, the main compartment of the cabinet with two hinged doors, and a low plinth with a shallow drawer. \n\nThe top consists of a shallow box with concave sides and a lid held on two metal hinges. The exterior of the lid depicts a man on horseback and a dog, the interior of the lid a man and woman playing cards (within an oval cartouche), the floor of the box (visible from above with the lid raised) with a unicorn resting under a tree.\n\nBoth doors (inner and outer surfaces), sides and back of the cabinet main compartment depict garden scenes (with backgrounds of buildings and landscapes) containing men and women feasting and playing musical instruments (bagpipes, horn, lute, spinet) accompanied by jester-musicians, dogs and birds. On the left end is a black man holding a falcon with a discarded lute and music at his feet. The back scene is divided by a central column and a double arch, but as only the lower part of the arch is visible, it seems possible that larger panels were reduced in size. (This may indicate that early panels were reduced in size at a later date, or that ready-made panels were originally bought in by the cabinet-maker.)\n\nThe main compartment is enclosed by two doors (each held on two hinges), and consists of a central well surrounding by six small drawers, one medium width drawer (above the well) and a long drawer (below the well) which in turn contains two small drawers (at each end) and a very shallow sub-drawer with dividers. The drawer bottom is inscribed, suggesting that medals were kept here). All the drawers have a turned ivory knob (possibly replacements, certainly on the shallow sub-drawer of the wide lower drawer?). The three upper drawers have plain sides while the five drawers flanking and below the central well, and the internal faces of the well itself are veneered with banding around a central panel of ash. Apart from the upper three drawers, all the drawers contain a concealed reverse-opening sub-drawer at the back (with a metal pin handle), accessible only when the drawer is removed.  The drawers and cupboard doors (inner and outer surfaces) depict similar garden scenes in very small scale marquetry. The bottom drawer depicts two scenes of lovers standing in front of a garden landscape, behind a balustrade flanking two vases within a double arch. The two square fronts with two vases within a double arch and geometrical marquetry borders.\n\nThe low base sits on a low moulded plinth and is veneered on all four sides with burr walnut (?), and contains a concealed shallow drawer (now fitted with a sprung lock and keyhole, and thus no longer concealed. There is no evidence of it having been fitted with feet.\n\nThe main doors are fitted with sliding bolts, top and bottom and an internal lock (with sprung catch). The metalwork may be partly or wholly replaced. Some or all of the drawer knobs may be replaced.",
