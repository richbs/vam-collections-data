This type of lightweight, highly decorated container was probably used for presents between lovers or to mark a betrothal, following a long tradition. The imagery of hunting had long been used to allude to the chase and capture of love, and on this casket depicts hunt scenes on the lid and front. The leather is parcel gilt and tooled with a series of stamps, very similar in technique to contemporary bookbindings, and possibly carried out by the same craftsmen.",

Their picturesque hunt and joust scenes evolve from the decoration of much earlier, late medieval caskets, many of which were almost certainly used as betrothal and love gifts. Such scenes were probably understood to allude to romance (the chase of love) and fidelity. Gall (1965, pp.232-5, see History and References) dated the costumes worn by hunters to the late 16th century, noting one with the arms of Charles V, and the fleur-de-lis of the house of Bourbon. Other commentators note stylistic and technical parallels between the way in which these coffers are decorated by the same techniques using metal stamps as found on a Friesland bookbinding c.1625, suggesting that the same craftsmen may have been involved.",
