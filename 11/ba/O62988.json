The climax of the ballet was the Pas des d\u00e9esses, which was obviously the Manger, Benjamin Lumley's attempt to repeat the success of the Pas de Quatre of 1845, when four of the great ballerinas of the Romantic era performed together.  \"Le Jugement de Paris\" brought together three of the same dancers, Taglioni, Cerrito and Grahn, but this time giving the 'contest' a context in the story of the Judgement of Paris.  In the print Saint-L\u00e9on as Paris holds the golden apple and looks down upon Taglioni, as Venus, to whom he will award the prize.  \nThe print was probably designed as a pendant to the 1845 lithograph of the \"Pas de Quatre\", being of the same dimensions and comparable typography.  \nThe print came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: The print is one of the rarest of the Romantic Ballet lithographs.",
