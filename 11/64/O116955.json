Major-General Rebow, who owned the estate, commissioned him to paint two small landscapes of the environs.  This small pencil sketch may have been a preparatory study for the first painting, but although Constable did show men fishing from a boat in the finished picture, he used neither the composition nor that detail from the sketch.\n\nConstable made this sketch a few months before his marriage to Maria Bicknell.  The couple had been engaged since 1809, but due to the disapproval of their parents and Constable's precarious financial state, they were forced to wait seven years to marry.  Writing to Maria after the visit to Wivenhoe Park when he made this sketch, he said of his hosts, 'They are both well acquainted with our history, and hope to see us there together.'",

Reynolds, <i>Victoria and Albert Museum: Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, 1973, pp. 110-11, no. 146.\nPart of Constable's letter to his wife-to-be, Maria Bicknell, concerning his visit to Wivenhoe Park and the commission of two paintings by Major-General Rebow is included in the catalogue entry.  The first of these paintings, which represents Wivenhoe Park, is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington; the second, which represents the Quarters House, Alresford Hall, is now in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 110, 111\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nPage from a sketch-book, trimmed.\nThis page is from the same sketch-book as No. 147 [823-1888].\n\nThe first recorded visit by Constable to Wivenhoe Park, near Colchester, the seat of Major-General Rebow, was made in September 1812 (L. ed. S., p. 55).  Writing to Maria Bicknell on 21 August 1816, on his return from another visit to General Rebow, Constable said \u201cThe general and Mrs. Rebow are determined to be of some service to me.  I am going there again, and shall stay a week, in all probability [this he did at the end of August]\u2026I am to paint two small landscapes for the general; on in the park, of the house, and a beautiful wood and piece of water; and another a wood, with a little fishing house, where the young lady (who is the heroine of all these scenes) goes occasionally to angle\u2026.They are both well acquainted with our history, and hope to see us there together\u201d (L. ed. S., p. 93).\nThe former of these paintings, representing Wivenhoe Park, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington: Widener Collection (reproduced in L. ed. M., Pl. 14).  In this painting, two men are seen fishing from a boat, but neither the composition, nor the detail is taken from the drawing.  The latter painting, which represents The Quarters House, Alresford Hall, is now the property of the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne.",
