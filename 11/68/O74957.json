Women could wear them for work during the day and then, with a change of accessories, wear them out in the evening. This version was designed by Jean Dess\u00e8s in about 1955. It has a modest bodice with a high neck and long sleeves. The bodice is made in matte wool and fastens in the front with self-covered buttons. It has been cut and fitted to fit closely. The skirt is made of pleated lustrous silk taffeta.",
