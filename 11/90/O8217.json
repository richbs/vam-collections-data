The decoration borrows from classical and late Renaissance ornament, which spread to England through French, German and Flemish engravings.\n\nOwnership & Use\nCourt cupboards were placed in the hall or dining parlour in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. They often housed eating and drinking vessels. Although they were connected with eating, some were placed in bedrooms where they provided shelf space for other domestic equipment.  The name 'court cupboard' derives from court, the French word for 'short', perhaps meaning that the cupboard was short in stature.\n\nPeople\nBrigadier William Ellis Clark gave the V&A more than 80 pieces of furniture between 1946 and 1968.  He lived at Elmstead Place, Chislehurst, Kent, and collected all periods of English furniture. It was displayed according to dates and timbers - oak and walnut in a large oak-panelled room, mahogany in the dining room.\n\n",

It would have been covered with cloths of decorative textile and linen damask, similar to these reproduction cloths.  The lower one is of dornix, a cloth of linen, wool and sometimes (as here) gold thread.\n\nHistorical significance: The court cupboard originally served as a series of tiered tables, on which the owner of the household displayed his plate. By the mid to late 16th century, shelves were introduced to the tiers, thus enabling storage. The decoration of this court cupboard borrows from classical and mannerist ornament, which spread to England through French, German and Flemish engravings.",
