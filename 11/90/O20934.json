Of these, the relief-moulded 'Fecundity' dishes are unlikely to have been used, except perhaps for fruit.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe moulded and brightly colour-glazed pottery produced by the leading 16th-century French potter Bernard Palissy  (1510-1590) hardly reached England during his lifetime. His designs, however, became influential long afterwards. This 'Fecundity' dish is closely copied from French earthenware versions (such as museum no. 77-1865) that were moulded directly from a bronze dish by Palissy himself. But as with other forms of artistic reproduction, the copies stray further and further from the original. Here the wonderful coloured lead glazes of the Palissy original are missing, while the wells around the rim are painted with crude symbols borrowed from contemporary Chinese porcelain. Outlines have been painted around the figures where the moulding is blunted with thick tin-glaze. However inferior this copy may seem to us, the strking image must have appeared exotic at the time, since dated examples range between 1633 and 1697.",
