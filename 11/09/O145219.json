Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nBy the 1980s avant-garde artist jewellers had increased the scale of jewellery and pushed wearability to the limit. The wearer became more conscious of the jewellery interacting with the body. From this evolved the theme of sensual jewellery, which flows and moves with the body. \n\nRachelle Thiewes explores movement as well as sound in her jewellery. The wearer is made conscious of their every move by the spiky shapes and dimensions of her pieces. The body motion creates a musical effect through the rhythmic sounds coming from the chiming pendants. She has described how her first introduction to jewellery was through the long rosaries worn by the nuns at her catholic school: 'The rosary hung on the outside of the leg and dropped in length to almost the ankle. When the nuns moved, so too did the rosaries, swinging in rhythm to the body's movement. The \"Reflections of St. Mary's\" series of necklaces were inspired by this early experience of jewelry / body motion ideas'.",
