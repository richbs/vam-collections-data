Colourful tilework panels and friezes decorated the walls of courtyards of traditional Qajar houses from about 1850 onwards, as seen in buildings surviving in Isfahan, Shiraz and major provincial towns. It is executed in the cuerda seca technique which relies on matte black outlines to separate colours during firing that might otherwise run together. Many of the design motifs are inspired by European styles or Chinese ceramics and textiles made for export to the West.\n\nThe treatment of the subject of this tile shows a nostalgia for the period of Fath Ali Shah (r.1797-1834), in the dated costume, maquillage and hairstyle found in European-style oil paintings from his reign. In addition, the Western style landscape employing shading and perspective",
