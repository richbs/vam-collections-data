Harold Stabler was an extremely versatile designer, working in wood, stone, ceramics, copper and silver at different times in his life. He studied at the Kendal School of Art in Cumbria before specialising in metalwork at the Keswick School of Industrial Art, where he later taught.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe establishment of the Keswick School, together with others such as C.R. Ashbee's Guild of Handicraft, reflects the revival of base metals as an art material that took place towards the end of the 19th century. Initially, Stabler was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, participating in their exhibitions until 1912 when he became disillusioned. Inspired by the Deutsche Werkbund exhibition in Cologne in 1914, Stabler cofounded the Design and Industries Association (DIA), a centre for excellence in industrial design. In this respect, his significance lies in his move away from the nostalgic ethic of the Arts & Crafts movement towards the more modernist and impersonal ideology of the early 20th century.",
