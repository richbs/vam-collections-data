The introduction of forks made this less important and ewers and basins became grand display pieces for the sideboard. Ambassadors were expected to have a magnificent collection of silver, issued to them by the Royal Jewel House.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe helmet-shaped ewer became popular in England around the end of the 17th century. The form is based on an earlier shape made in earthenware in Rouen, France. The cut-card ornament around the base is often found in Huguenot silver. It was cut out from a sheet of silver and applied to the body, requiring great technical skill. The handle is in the shape of a female caryatid and the lip has a cast mask of Diana.\n\nHuguenot craftspeople fleeing Europe because of religious persecution and economic change brought new vitality and a high standard of design to English decorative arts.\n\nPeople\nThis ewer and basin were produced in 1705 for Thomas Wentworth, the 3rd Earl of Strafford, who settled in Berlin after Queen Anne made him Ambassador Extraordinary to Prussia.  Ambassadors were issued with a large amount of silver, which they were often allowed to keep on their return to Britain.",
