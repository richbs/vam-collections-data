            "physical_description": "Boy's Highland or 'Scotch' suit, consisting of kilt (with bodice), jacket, waistcoat, short trousers, sporran, plaid, brooch and glengarry bonnet.\n[Kilt] Boy's kilt, of wool in the Urquhart tartan, mounted on a sleeveless round-necked bodice of black satinised cotton lined with cream cotton.  The bodice (which has a large horizontal tuck just above the waist to allow for growth) fastens at the centre front with four buttons and stitched buttonholes.  The kilt fastens just below the waist: to the true left hand side with one button and stitched buttonhole, and to the right-hand side with two buttons and stitched buttonholes just below the waist.\n[Jacket] Boy's single-breasted highland dress jacket of black velvet lined with black satinised cotton. The garment has a round collarless neck, concealed breast pocket (on true left), and wrist-length sleeves: each sleeve is finished with black braid and three lozenge-shaped buttons of white metal moulded with a thistle motif. The 'skirt' of the coat consists of a series of overlapping tabs bound in black braid, the four largest finished with buttons matching those on the cuffs.  The jacket is edged with black braid, and is open the length of the centre front with nine pairs of buttons matching those on the cuffs.\n[Waistcoat] Boy's waistcoat of black velvet with the back of black satinised cotton; lined throughout with white cotton twill pin-striped in blue.  At each side of the waist front is a (non-functioning) pocket flap, each of which has three lozenge-shaped buttons of white metal moulded with a thistle motif.  The garment is edged with black braid, and fastens the length of the centre front with six stitched buttonholes and six buttons matching those on the pocket flaps.\n[Trousers] Pair of boy's short pull-on trousers, of black velveteen lined with buff-coloured cotton.  The trousers have no fastenings or openings (apart from one at the crotch), but have metal buttons at the waist to attach to braces\n[Sporran] Sporran, consisting of a leather purse with metal mounts, decorated with a long fringe of cream-coloured animal hair at the front, and finished with two metal tagged tails of black animal hair.  The front of the mount is of shaped black leather with a metal boss of a mailed arm brandishing a dagger.\n[Plaid] Woollen plaid of Urquhart tartan with machine-stitched edges and fringed ends.\n[Brooch] Circular celtic-style brooch (for fastening the plaid) consisting of a facetted imitation topaz raised on a six-spoked white metal mount and set within a flat ring of white metal with thistle and plaid motifs.  The brooch fastens at the back with a white metal hook and bar.\n[Hat] Glengarry bonnet of black velvet lined with quilted black silk, with a pompon cockade of black threads in the centre of the folded crown.  The bonnet is decorated on the left side with a bow of black petersham ribbon, pinned with a white metal brooch in the form of a thistle; a pair of crossed black petersham ribbon streamers hang from the back.",

It was originally worn in Yorkshire by the sons of a butcher, George Smith: it was given to the elder son, George Everard Smith (born 1910) by his paternal uncle John Smith, who worked for the Co-Operative Wholesale Society in Grantham.  It was subsequently worn by the younger son, Thomas Jobson Smith (the donor, born 1916), his son John Smith (born 1953) and daughter Margaret Smith (born 1955) and Margaret's son John Paul. The kilt and plaid appear to be of Urquhart tartan, but the Smiths have no Scottish ancestry that they know of.\nTom Smith recalls that he wore it once to be photographed in, and once to the birthday party of the vicar's son, Teddy Deely, where the young Tom (rather than the birthday child) was the centre of attraction for his unusual outfit, although his grandmother, with whom he lived, would not allow him to wear buckled shoes with it \"because he's a lad\".",
