Its founder, Helen O'Brien, devised a witty entertainment containing all the elements traditionally associated with night club entertainment - singers, dancers and glamorous showgirls - but presented them in a highly original way. Her designer, Ronald Cobb, created costumes for sequences with unexpected themes, such as Shakespeare's plays, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and The Mind of Goya. The club appealed to a sophisticated audience that enjoyed spotting the references.\n\nIn the 1970s the majority of the Eve showgirls were topless. Their costumes were minimal but elaborate, no more than a headdress, sleeves and a G-string, but all incorporated amusing references and symbols appropriate to the theme. The Postage Stamp costume, from a sequence based on methods of communication, included a 'body shield' which provided the girl with a little cover - until she opened her arms at an appropriate moment.",
