His work for the periodical The Yellow Book confirmed his position as the most innovative illustrator of the day, but as a result of the hostile moralistic outcry that followed the arrest and trial of Oscar Wilde in early 1895, John Lane and other publishers panicked and dropped Beardsley. Thereafter, almost the only publisher who would use his drawings was Leonard Smithers. Smithers was a brilliant but shady character who operated on the fringes of the rare book trade, issuing small, clandestine editions of risqu\u00e9 books with the boast: 'I will publish the things the others are afraid to touch'. Smithers encouraged Beardsley's already growing interest in French, Latin and Greek texts of this kind and commissioned drawings to illustrate Aristophanes's famously bawdy satirical play Lysistrata and the Satires of the late Roman poet Juvenal. \n\nChoosing in particular Juvenal's Sixth Satire, 'Against Woman', Beardsley made several drawings including two representing Bathyllus, a minor character referred to by the author only in passing. Bathyllus was a dancer, famed for his female impersonations and much admired by decadent Roman audiences for his lewd and suggestive performances. Beardsley, who delighted in coded references to depravity, told Smithers 'I am doing a Bathyllus No 2 as I feel I cannot say all I want to about him in one picture'; in this, the more suggestive of the two illustrations, Bathyllus's pose and gestures are unequivocally obscene.",
