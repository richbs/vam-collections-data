It was made at the Bombay School of Art, which produced ceramicstraded under the name of 'Wonderland Art Pottery' under the direction of George Wilkins Terry, the School's first drawing master who had been appointed in 1857.  The pottery flourished from the mid 1870s until about 1890. Early wares such as these were influenced by those manufactured in Sind, because Terry set up his workshop under the direction of a Sindhi craftsman called Nur Muhammad.",
