It was probably taken soon after William Morris's death in 1896. (A photograph of the dining room was taken at the same time.) It shows the fireplace, with the settle that was designed originally for Morris's Red House in Bexleyheath in Kent. Other furnishings from Red House include candlesticks designed by Philip Webb (1831\u20131915), the architect of Red House, and the Prioress's Tale Wardrobe. The wardrobe was painted with illustrations from Geoffrey Chaucer's story in The Canterbury Tales, hence its name.\n\nThe wall covering is Morris's 'Bird' fabric. His daughter May described the pattern as \u2018intimate and friendly . . . the most adaptable to the needs of everyday life\u2019.",
