In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nJones made many maritime photographs and often they reveal his interest in technological developments in shipping. Several of his compositions emphasis linear pattern: in this harbour view, a railway line is set into the cobbled quay side surface and a parallel chain divides the foreground of the quay side from the water and the dark hulls of two ships. The columnar steam funnel of the warship is repeated by the foreground bollard, and coiled chain and ropes, and the warship itself is visually linked to the bowsprit and prow of the tall ship by a line of small boats and distant gantries.",
