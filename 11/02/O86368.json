They were billed as \u2018An Eccentric Wire Act. Fifteen Minutes of Continuous Laughter\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. This one is signed by Alf Meers, who invented his \u2018endless wire trick\u2019 for the act. \n\nThe Three Meers were on a bill in 1904 that was topped by Charles T. Aldrich, the quick-change star whom Cooke also drew. When The Three Meers appeared at the Grand previously, in May 1903, they had returned from a tour of the Continent. A reviewer noted that \u2018the daring nature of the feats and novel balancing positions caused almost continuous rounds of applause\u2019. Many acts that we now associate with circus were popular on the variety stage in the early 1900s. Comical wire acts still feature in the circus. They require great skill to appear to have none.",
