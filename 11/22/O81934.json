Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>81 Unknown Man, called Sir Robert Henley</b>\n<b>1659</b> \nPl13-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 71 x 57mm</b> \n\nFeatures boldly and freely hatched in brown and sanguine, with some blue shadow and touches of white heightening, over a thick creamy carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched with darker colour and heightened with pale gouache; cravat and sleeves in white over grey wash; doublet in hatched brown wash with bronzing and buttons in gold; brown-curtain background, with blue sky and grey clouds; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Fresh, some small losses and retouches in the hair and face; marginal abrasions. <b>Signed: </b>Lower right, in black: <i>SC</i>: [interlaced] <i>1659</i> (see F in Appendix 2). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century gold locket, convex back, straight sides with single broad channel, the bezel turned over the convex glass; the hanger of tear-drop form made with wire of D-section, with a central channel down the middle and bifurcating into flattened tapering spirals of three turns; a scroll-and-leaf engraving on the back beneath the hanger. Scratched on the back: <i>TMW /The Earl of Sandwhich [sic] / by Sam\u2019l Cooper / Nwt Cl\u2019n 734 \u00a3to</i> with a label printed <i>D. of Hamilton.</i> and written over in pen [Earl]<i>of Sand[ wich ]</i>; and Salting's printed label 1628 corrected by hand to 4628. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Dukes of Hamilton; Hamilton Palace sale, 15 July 1882,lot 1598, bt Philpot, \u00a3267.155.; C H T Hawkins, his sale, Christie's 13 May 1904, lot 906, bt Hodgkin, 470 gns; acquired by George Salting.(1) and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. Probably identical with lot 734 at the sale of Lord Northwick's collection at Thirlestane House, 5 August 1859, bt Farrer of New Bond Street, \u00a331.10s.; see inscription on case above. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> South Kensington 1862, no. 2380 (lent by the Duke of Hamilton, as Sir Edward Montagu). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Propert 1901, repro. p. 108; Salting Collection, 1911, p. 46; Foster 1911, p. 1548; Foster 1914-16, vol. Il, p. 66; Goulding 1914-15, p. 22; Long 1929, p. 469; Long 1930, p.13; Foskett 1974, pp. 115, 134, frontispiece (repro. in colour); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nThe sitter was identified as Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, until the arrival on loan at the Museum in 1917 of the Beauchamp miniatures; this collection contained a copy of the present miniature, signed <i>MW</i> and traditionally identified as Sir R Henley. (2) Foster expanded the initials <i>MW</i> as M Wright, but as Long pointed out, this was purely a guess. Reynolds (3) wondered whether the style of the Beauchamp version did not resemble that of Flatman, but this cannot have been intended as an attribution. The old identification was finally dismissed by Long in 1919 when he compared this miniature with six recognised portraits of Sandwich and decided that there was no resemblance whatever. \n\nVarious difficulties arise, however, with the Henley identification. The standard Sir Robert Henley is the engraving by William Faithorne,(4) but comparison with the miniature portraits is unsatisfactory and quite inconclusive. Possibly this is because there were two Sir Robert Henleys, and it is not certain whether both portraits represent the same man. They were respectively father and grandfather of the wit and politician Anthony Henley (d. 1711). The Catalogue of Engraved Portraits in the British Museum allocates the Faithorne image to the grandfather, who was Master of the Court of King's Bench (fl. 1658), but the apparent age and character of the sitter argues against this. More consistent, at least as to age, would be the younger Sir Robert, known as Sir Robert of the Grange, near Alresford, Hampshire, MP for Andover in 1679, of whom the wit Anthony was the younger son. Unlike his father and the descendants of Anthony in the next generation (the Lord Chancellor, Earl of Northington), this Sir Robert was not a man of law, and was thus more likely perhaps to have had his portrait painted by Cooper in the costume shown here. (5) On the other hand, the traditions attached to objects in the Beauchamp Collection are no more authoritative than those in any connoisseur's or family's collection, and there may well be as little in this as there was in the Northwick/Hamilton tradition that the sitter was Sandwich. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4628. \n2 Repro. in Foster 1914-16, vol.
