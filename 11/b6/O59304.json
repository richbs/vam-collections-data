In 1841 he left Siena for Florence where he set up a workshop, his production being primarily wood sculpture and cabinet-making. Barbetti was one of the foremost carvers who encouraged a major revival in the art of woodcarving in Italy.\n\nThis cabinet was exhibited as part of a group of pieces by Barbetti at the Great Exhibition, held in London in 1851. Barbetti was awarded a prize medal for this display and, although some criticised this cabinet on stylistic grounds, the South Kensington Museum, later the Victoria and Albert Museum, purchased it for \u00a3400 as a fine specimen of carving. Barbetti went on to exhibit at the Paris Exhibition of 1861 and in Vienna in 1873.",
