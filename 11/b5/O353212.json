The fabric is blue silk and is quilted in geometric patterns with a blue silk thread. Decoration is achieved by design on the tips of the triangles. Three tips have six small holes forming a triangle, that are stitched with button hole stitch using blue silk. The tips in between have thin strips of gilded leather sewn across to form a triangle. One strip of gilded leather runs across one of the triangles. The head band (750mm in width) has one band (20mm across) of gilded leather strips. The rest of the band is decorated with quilted rows of zig-zagged diamonds that run around the cap. The lining is undyed, plain weave linen. Between the lining and the silk is a layer of paper/fibre which helps shape the quilted design. Paper has been attached to the band in recent times, using small metal pins, for support as one side of the hat is badly torn.",

            "public_access_description": "A head cap of woven silk and linen.  Egyptian, possibly Mamluk, ca. AD1250-1500. From a tomb. The cap is comprised of a skull cap and a head band. The skull cap is made of six triangles of fabric sewn together. The fabric is blue silk and is quilted in geometric patterns with a blue silk thread. Decoration is achieved by design on the tips of the triangles. Three tips have six small holes forming a triangle, that are stitched with button hole stitch using blue silk. The tips in between have thin strips of gilded leather sewn across to form a triangle. One strip of gilded leather runs across one of the triangles. The head band (750mm in width) has one band (20mm across) of gilded leather strips. The rest of the band is decorated with quilted rows of zig-zagged diamonds that run around the cap. The lining is undyed, plain weave linen. Between the lining and the silk is a layer of paper/fibre which helps shape the quilted design. Paper has been attached to the band in recent times, using small metal pins, for support as one side of the hat is badly torn.",
