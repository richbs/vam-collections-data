            "public_access_description": "Dennis Morris moved to Britain from Jamaica in the early 1960s and began taking photographs from the age of eight. His personal photographs of British Caribbean community life in Hackney came to form the series Growing Up Black. \n\n\u2018Dignity in Poverty\u2019 presents the harsh reality faced by many post-war Caribbean migrants who were forced to live in sub-standard tenement housing. Morris was part of this community, living in one room shared with his mother when arriving in England. Recalling the experience he emphasises, \u2018Although conditions were cramped, we all had a sense of pride. Our rooms would be spotless and everything was kept in place.\u2019 In order to create a home within a single space it became, according to Morris, \u2018customary to part the room with a curtain. One side would be the bedroom and the other side the sitting room.\u2019\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Dennis Morris as part of the Staying Power project. A photograph by Charlie Phillips depicting a racially discriminating housing advert in 1959 was also acquired as part of the project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives.  The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
