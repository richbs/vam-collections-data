In 1919 he formed the British Drama League 'to assist the development of the arts of the Theatre and to promote a right relationship between Drama and the life of the Community'.  He was awarded the CBE in 1947.  He relinquished the directorship of the League in the following year to become Chairman of the British Drama League's Council.  As Hon. Secretary of the Shakespeare Memorial National Theatre Committee from 1930-1951, Geoffrey Whitworth fought tirelessly for the establishment of a National Theatre.\n\nThis portrait was given to the sitter at the Royal Society of Arts in November 1934.  It was presented by George Bernard Shaw, who praised Whitworth as 'one of the most important people in the theatre today'.  Roger Fry (1866-1934), who did not live to attend the ceremony, was closely associated with the British Drama League.  He had presided over its first Committee meeting and served on its Plays and Publications Committee.  The League became the British Theatre Association in 1972 and finally closed in 1990.",
