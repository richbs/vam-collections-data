At Queen Victoria's wedding in 1840, The Times reported upon the wedding favours given to the guests:\n\n\"Every lady exhibited a white favour, some of which were admirable specimens of refined taste. They were of all sizes, many of white satin riband, tied up into bows and mixed with layers of rich silver lace. Others merely of riband intermixed with sprigs of orange flower blossom.\"\n\nBy 1840, imitation orange blossom was a popular trimming for weddings. This wedding favour is on a less grand scale than Queen Victoria's favours. However, the concept is similar in that it features wax and cloth orange blossoms and myrtle flowers tied up with cream silk satin ribbon.",
