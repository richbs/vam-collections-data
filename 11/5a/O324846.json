As a trivet it is unremarkable but as a spit jack it is a rare survivor.\n\nSpit jacks, or spit engines, were fixed above the fireplace in the kitchen and turned the iron spits on which meat was roasted or pots were warmed. Clockwork and lever driven engines were in operation in England by the 16th century and replaced men, or more often boys, called turnspits. Most are in iron but some brass examples survive from the 17th century including this example decorated with a figure of Atlas, signed TD and dated 1670.",
