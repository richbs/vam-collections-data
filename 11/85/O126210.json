The design is consists of peonies and sprays of plum blossom amid gold clouds on the front and top back, while the lower half of the back is dominated by a scene showing two <i>shishi</i> (mythical lion-like creatures) facing each other on a bridge over a waterfall or rushing stream. There are the usual five crests (<i>mon</i>) across the top of the garment resisted out and so left white against the mauve ground. The water is also left white against the darker ground although there are traces of blue brushed dye.\nA variety of embroidery techniques was used for all the other motifs - satin stitch in both twisted and untwisted silk yarn, small knot stitch for flower centres, large, loose knots in green for vegetation on hillocks and rocks, gold wrapped thread laid down singly and in pairs and couched down in orange, twisted silk yarn couched down (bridge outline), twisted silk yarn and gold-wrapped thread twisted loosely together and couched down (landscape features), highly twisted silk yarn laid alongside gold wrapped thread and couched down (manes and tails of the lions). The couching is often raised up over padding.\nThe garment is wadded and lined throughout with scarlet plain weave silk. The lining material also forms a wadded hem in the usual way.",

It is embroidered with two shishi, mythical lion-like creatures characterised by their fierce expressions, large eyes and curly mane and tail.  They are shown fighting across a bridge over a waterfall surrounded by peonies.  The eyes of the shishi are of glass and the embroidery is padded, giving the scene a very three-dimensional quality.  The dramatic design suggests that this kimono is a stage costume for kabuki, the popular theatre of Japan.",
