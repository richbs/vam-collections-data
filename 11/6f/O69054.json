ISBN 1851773088.\nC. F. A. Voysey, an architect by training, became one of the most popular and prolific of freelancers, providing designs for all aspects of the domestic interior, including furniture, metalwork, wallpapers, and textile furnishings. As a designer, he came to specialise in flat pattern design, although he also continued to design many houses. Voysey's \"Alice\" design was taken directly from the original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel (English, 1820-1914) for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, English, 1832-1898). A well-known caricaturist, Tenniel was already admired for his political cartoons in Punch when he took on the Alice illustrations and, later, those as well for Carroll's \"Alice\" sequel, Through the Looking Glass (1872).\nBeginning in the 1880s, a strong interest in children's book illustration developed in England, and this Voysey pattern, typical of his original and witty style, continued to be popular for a very long time after its introduction. The Alice in Wonderland fabric came to the Museum as part of a large group of textiles and original design drawings donated by Jocelyn Morton, a descendant of the founder of Alexander Morton & Co. of Darvel, Scotland, which manufactured some of the best of English Arts and Crafts textiles.\n\nLit.
