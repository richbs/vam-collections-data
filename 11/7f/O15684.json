The controlled movement on the curved, fitted bodice is achieved by the dextrous pleating of fabric cut on the bias, fronted with no visible seams.\n\nThe scalloped pleating encloses the front torso up to the low, strapless d\u00e9colletage, and continues across the back in straight, horizontal lines. The bodice fits the figure tightly to the hips and from there the skirt falls in long, soft pleats.",

London: V&A Publications, 2007. p. 84-5 and pl. 3.17\nFurther evidence of Dess\u00e8s' precise pleating can be seen in a 1951 cocktail dress.  The bodice's composition of curving pleats with a pattern suggestive of waves fits closely to the body; the dress then tapers to a narrow waist, and swells into a full skirt of soft pleats.  Referencing the colouring of a sailor's uniform, Dess\u00e8s chose royal blue for the dress and white cotton piqu\u00e9 to trim the collars and cuffs of the silk chiffon over-jacket (not shown).",
