He is proud to acknowledge his mentors Bertel Gardberg, Reinhold Reiling, Anton Cepka and Hermann J\u00fcnger. His degree in anthropology from the University of New Mexico has influenced his work. The title of this brooch 'In the Shaman's Bundle' is a reference to the sacred medicine bundle of a Native American traditional healer. It could include objects  such as seeds, pine cones, grass, animal teeth or claws, horse hair, rocks, crystals, tobacco, beads, arrowheads, bones, or anything else of relatively small size that possesses spiritual value to the bundle's keeper.  A medicine bundle is considered a very precious possession which represents a person's spiritual life, and may possess powers for protection and healing.",
