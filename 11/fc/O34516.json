In order to make its tapestries more widely available, the workshop put together a collection of specially designed small tapestries, to be woven in limited editions.  \nPatsy Hely is a ceramicist.  She studied at the National Art School, graduating in 1979.  Her ceramics are delicately executed and are made from porcelain, often based around functional domestic ware, such as tea pots, cups and saucers.  She has an immediately recognisable style, which is typified by the fluid shapes she constructs and her perception of fragility that can be seen throughout her work.  This making of functional domestic ware is no accident, her paramount interest is in the part that objects play in our lives.  When constructing a piece, Hely thinks carefully about how one would hold the object in everyday use, how it is passed from one person to another and how they will look at they move through space during use.  Bottlebrush perfectly demonstrates Hely's use of simple shape and colour.",
