This unadorned bathing costume was manufactured by the British firm Shepherd during the Second World War. It is an example of design under Britain's Utility Scheme. Introduced by the Board of Trade in 1941-2, the Utility scheme encompassed a wide range of objects including clothing, hosiery, gloves, furs, footwear, household textiles, bedding and furniture.  The scheme's well recognised CC 41 mark came from the initials for 'civilian clothing' and indicated the date of its first use. The package of administrative measures not only established restrictions on the production and consumption of cloth and men's and women's clothing, but also regulated the style of clothing.  \n\nParticularly in women\u2019s fashion, after the Utility scheme was introduced garments became closer-fitting and shorter in an attempt to save material. Extraneous elements such as embroidery and garment linings were restricted.  The scheme\u2019s larger aims were to simplify design by setting quality and sizing standards.  In a 1944 media briefing, The Board of Trade claimed that: \u2018The Utility mark is \u2026 a guarantee to the public \u2026 which has become the widest known official \u201ctrade mark\u201d ever introduced.\u2019 \n\nThis swimsuit, in its complete lack of ornament or hint of high style, is an example of the Utility scheme's functional, economical designs for the essential objects of daily life. There were disputes between the Board of Trade and retailers over what was meant by 'essential'. As some might see swimwear as expendable, surviving Utility examples are particularly significant.",
