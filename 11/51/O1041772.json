            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 204, 206, 207\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"The drawing is on a sheet of paper which has been folded horizontally above the centre. The top part, with inscription only, not reproduced amongst the plates. \n\nThe drawing is of the house only and was made for the architectural details. In a letter of early 1832 to Leslie (original in the Victoria and Albert Museum Library), Constable says \"My House tires me very much. The windows and window frames & chimneys and chimney pots are endless- but I shall fill the canvas beyond repentance\". \n\nNote on Nos. 340-344 [345-1888, 255-1888, 1258-1888, 1258a-1888, 1258b-1888]\n\nNos. 340, 341, 343 and 344 [345-1888, 255-1888, 1258a-1888, 1258b-1888] are all studies for the painting which Constable exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1833, with the title 'Englefield House, Berkshire, the seat of Richard Benyon de Bouvoir, Esq.-morning'. No. 342 [1258-1888] was made in connection with the same commission, which was obtained by Constable through the recommendation of Samuel Lane, the deaf-and-dumb painter. The first mention of it is in Constable's journal for 2 June 1824 (Beckett, H, p. 323); as the note on the back of No. 340 shows, he did not start on the picture until he left for Englefield House in the company of his sponsor Lane on 22 August 1832. He took with him the sketch-book which he had used at Epsom in 1831 and again in East Bergholt in this year (see note following No. 350 [347-1888]), since it is on a page of this book that No. 340 [345-1888] is drawn. Nos. 343 and 344 [1258a-1888 and 1258b-1888], being studies of architectural detail, must have been made on the spot: and it is probable that Nos. 341 and 342 [255-1888 and 1258-1888] were also made there. The man walking with a dog in No. 341 [255-1888] is introduced into the finished picture; and No. 342 [1258-1888] shows the house further away and from an angle not found in any of the other drawings, which are the only recorded ones for this work. \n\nOn 27 March 1833, Constable wrote to his son Charles (original letter in the Victoria and Albert Museum Library): \"I have almost done the large picture of the house, and Mr. Binyon de Bouvoir is much pleased I believe with it. It is called Inglefield House-from a great Battlefield there of the Danes-it is near Reading in Berkshire it looks very bright and cheerful-and all like it who see it\". On 3 April 1833, he reported to Leslie that Lady Morley had said of the picture\" 'How fresh, how dewy, how exhilarating!' I told her half of this, if I could think I deserved it, was worth all the talk and cant about pictures in the world\" (L. ed. S., p. 299). There was a dispute about the hanging of it at the Royal Academy and Constable wrote to Lane \"S[hee] told me it was 'only a <i>picture of a house</i>, and ought to have been put into the Architectural Room'. I told him it was' a picture of a summer morning, <i>including a house</i>' \" (L. ed. S., p. 302). It is interesting to note that this is borne out by Constable's inscription on No. 340 [345-1888]. A disagreement with Mr. Benyon de Beauvoir followed, details of which are given in Lane's letter of 21 March 1834 to Constable, printed by Shirley (loc. cit.). (See also Beckett, IV, pp. 107-17) \n\nThe painting now belongs to Mr. H. A. Benyon of Englefield House, and was lent by him to the exhibition 'The First Hundred Years of the Royal Academy', Burlington House, 1951-2 (No. 231). <i>Pentiment</i> in the foreground whereby cows had been painted out and replaced by deer shows that Constable had met his patron's objection that it \"looked as if he had his farmyard before his Drawing Room windows\". The painting of Englefield House by Milbourne referred to in the note on No. 342 [1258-1888] formerly belonged to the late Mr. Eustace Hoare.\u201d",
