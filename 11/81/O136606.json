The figures are line-drawn and appear like a series of hieroglyphs crowding the page with a series of shapes and forms. The title gives the print a sinister edge by suggesting a state ruled by the mob. \n\nThe artist Timo Lehtonen was born in Finland of Finnish/Nigerian parentage and has lived in both those countries as well as in Britain. Issues of cultural identity are a recurrent theme in his work. In a 2001 article in Printmaking Today Lehtonen quotes critic Robert Hughes' proposal that 'Abstraction is a sign for the emotional state of deracination, of not belonging'. He goes on to describe his own work as an 'attempt to illuminate the relationship between creativity and a sense of belonging'.",
