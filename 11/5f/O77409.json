The savoury fattiness of marrow was highly prized and with the refinement of  table manners in the 17th century  new implements evolved for eating it more elegantly. Marrow scoops were made in large numbers in the 18th  and  19th centuries. In Victorian Edinburgh, for example, enthusiasts met at the Marrow Bone Club and each member had a heavy silver scoop ornamented with marrow bones.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe first utensil specifically designed for eating bone marrow was the marrow spoon. It was developed in the 1680s and had a spoon-shaped bowl with the handle formed as a scoop to extract the marrow.  The marrow scoop evolved from this spoon design in the early 18th century.  At least one marrow fork  from the same period has also survived. \n\nThe marrow scoop was made in two forms. The first was a single-ended scoop with one narrow channel and a handle; this was easier to hold. The second was the double-ended scoop, as here, where the unequal width of the channel enabled marrow to be extracted from large and small bones.  Early pieces were broader and smaller than the elegant, elongated scoops of the mid and late 18th century. In the next century they were often made to match the rest of the cutlery service.",
