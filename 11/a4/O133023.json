Here the compasses rest against the scaffolding on the right and, with the heavy rectangular wooden forms, represent the law of reason, perhaps to signify the forces by which Christ was to suffer, or to imply that these forces were to be reconciled with those of love and imagination as part of Man's Redemption through Christ. \n    From the Butts and Stirling Maxwell collections.\"\nButlin, Martin. <u>The paintings and drawings of William Blake</u>.
