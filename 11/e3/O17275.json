Introduction to Lancashire and Westmorland, p.1.\n'Even without a war, Lancashire could scarcely be recorded fast enough.  What is left of its landscape is of exceptional beauty, but often it is necessary to shut one's eyes to the chimneys creeping along its valleys and the pylons breaking the line of its crests.  As for the towns and cities which, in the industrial areas, form a London-like, an almost uninterrupted mass of brick and stone, they contain little that is not nineteenth century as well as blackish, and that little needs a deal of finding.'\nMellor, David, Gill Saunders and Patrick Wright. <u>Recording Britain: A Pictorial Domesday of Pre-War Britain</u>.

Now that the two end ones, to the right of Ye Olde Wellington Inn, are united as Sinclair's Oyster Rooms, the street is reduced to three premises, unless we include the antique-dealer over Mr. Kenyon's wine shop.\n\nA rather widespread levelling of houes took place in 1720, to make room for the new St. Ann's Square.  Old Shambles just escaped then.  Two hundred and twenty years later it had a still narrower, a less complete, escape.  One side of it is down and has long been carted and swept away; it has ceased to be a passage; and its lurching fronts, once hidden, are now visible from all sides of the new, wide, shapeless expanse speading unrecognizably between Corporation Street, Victoria Street, Deansgate, Market Street, and Hanging Ditch.'",

In 1940 the Committee for the Employment of Artists in Wartime, part of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, launched a scheme to employ artists to record the home front in Britain, funded by a grant from the Pilgrim Trust. It ran until 1943 and some of the country's finest watercolour painters, such as John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint and Rowland Hilder, were commissioned to make paintings and drawings of buildings, scenes, and places which captured a sense of national identity. Their subjects were typically English: market towns and villages, churches and country estates, rural landscapes and industries, rivers and wild places, monuments and ruins. Northern Ireland was not covered, only four Welsh counties were included, and a separate scheme ran in Scotland.\n\nThe scheme was known as 'Recording the changing face of Britain' and was established by Sir Kenneth Clark, then the director of the National Gallery. It ran alongside the official War Artists' Scheme, which he also initiated. Clark was inspired by several motives: at the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a concern to document the British landscape in the face of the imminent threat of bomb damage, invasion, and loss caused by the operations of war. This was allied to an anxiety about changes to the landscape already underway, such as the rapid growth of cities, road building and housing developments, the decline of rural ways of life and industries, and new agricultural practices, which together contributed to the idea of a 'vanishing Britain'. Clark also wanted to help artists, and the traditional forms of British art such as watercolour painting, to survive during the uncertain conditions of wartime. He in turn was inspired by America's Federal Arts Project which was designed to give artists employment during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nOver 1500 works were eventually produced by 97 artists, of whom 63 were specially commissioned. At the time the collection had a propaganda role, intended to boost national morale by celebrating Britain's landscapes and heritage. Three exhibitions were held during the war at the National Gallery, and pictures from the collection were sent on touring exhibitions and to galleries all around the country. After the war, the whole collection was given to the V&A by the Pilgrim Trust in 1949, and it was documented in a four volume catalogue published between 1946 and 1949. For many years the majority of the collection was on loan to councils and record offices in each county, until recalled by the V&A around 1990. The pictures now form a memorial to the war effort, and a unique record of their time.",
