            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe folding fan originated in Japan and was introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century.  The principles of construction of the Japanese version were adopted, but with European decoration.\n\nOwnership & Use\nA fan was an essential accessory in the formal dress of a wealthy woman. The manner in which a lady held and moved her fan conveyed her feelings toward those around her.  In the case of this particular fan, it could reveal her political beliefs, if she chose, or display only an innocuous floral design.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis is a very simple fan, made with plain, uncarved ivory sticks. The fan itself is of paper painted with gouache (opaque watercolour), with accents of gold paint.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis fan's decoration symbolises Jacobite support for the Stuart royal family after George I, Elector of Hanover, succeeded to the British throne in 1714. On the left Charles II is depicted hiding in a tree after his defeat by Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Next to him Queen Anne is shown ascending to heaven after her death in 1714, while beside her a lady mourns the loss of the crown. On the right are the Stuart arms, with a white rose and two rosebuds below, representing the son of James II, James Francis Edward ('James III' or the 'Old Pretender').  The two buds are his sons, Charles Edward and Henry Benedict.\n\nTime\nIt is difficult to date the fan precisely.  The inclusion of Queen Anne suggests the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715.  However, if the interpretation of the white rose and two buds is correct, the fan must have been made after the birth of Prince Henry in 1725.",
