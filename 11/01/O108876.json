On the left-hand side is the Salimgarh fort, which was built by Islam Shah (reigned 1545-1554)also known as Salim Shah. At the time of his death only the walls had been constructed, after which it was abandoned. The British built the railway line through the fort.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
