F H A Wallop in Ireland; lent to the V&A 1927-49; given to Alan Evans, 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 78 (Anon., English, mid-seventeenth century). \n\nThe typed Museum label draft stuck into the Wallop Loan Book attributes this esoterically as 'possibly by the master of Simon Digby'. \n\nDigby was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, became Rector of Dunshaughlin, chaplain to the Earl of Ossory (1668), Bishop of Limerick (1678) and of Elphin (1691). Miniatures by him are at the Digby family home, Sherborne Castle, Dorsetshire, and the National Gallery of Ireland, etc.(1) An attribution to Digby himself was doubtless ruled out by the date of the miniature: 1659 being too early for him, the work must therefore have been by his master. The logic was not Long's, and Long wrote firmly above the label 'Owner's description'. \n\nThe identification of the sitter was probably due to a member of the family similarly matching dates of portraits to the family tree. The Kennedys were the Earls of Cassillis in the Scottish peerage, important Presbyterians in the generations following the conversion - said to have been by Cranmer himself - of Gilbert Kennedy (1515-1558), 3rd Earl of Cassillis. The family had Irish and American ramifications typical of these dynamic west Scottish families. The inscription on the case specifying the sitter as the Deputy Governor of Jamestown probably resulted from a search of R Pitcairn, <i>Historical and Genealogical Account of the Principal Families of the Name of Kennedy</i> (Edinburgh, 1830) or of the <i>Historical Account of the Noble Family of Kennedy, Marquis of Ailsa and Earl of Cassillis; with notices of the principal Cadets thereof</i> (Edinburgh, 1849). \n\n1 Long 1929. p. 125; Foskett 1972, vol. I, p. 245, vol. II. figs 227-8. The framing of the miniature seems intended to reinforce this Irish ecclesiastical association. The hanger is, uniquely and awkwardly, shaped as a shamrock, or lesser-clover; the shamrock, used by St Patrick to illustrate the doctrine of the Trinity, became the emblem of the Irish nation.\" ",
