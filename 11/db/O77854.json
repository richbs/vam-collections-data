They were produced in large quantities from the mid-19th century, primarily for use in floors. Such tile pavements were frequently laid in churches. However, inlaid tiles were also occassionally used to decorate various forms of church monument. Memorial tiles, such as this example, were set directly into graveyard monuments or into the walls of the church.\n\nMaterials & Making\nInlaid tiles were formed in plaster moulds, which carried the decoration of the tile in relief. When removed from the mould, the impressions that were produced in the tile surface  would be filled with the contrastingly coloured clay. The use of moulds facilitated the mass production of such tiles. It is therefore slightly surprising that the technique should be used for the manufacture of memorial tiles such as this, which were clearly one-offs. The finished tiles were, however, extremely durable, and thus well suited to their function.",
