The material of this gown has a delicate trail of repeating floral sprays. The restrained decoration illustrates the growing influence in the Neo-classical style in textile design.  \n\nThe gown has a fitted back and open front below the waist, revealing a petticoat of the same fabric. The lightness of decoration and use of cotton instead of silk indicates that this gown was probably worn during summer afternoons for card games and tea parties, rather than for evening dress.",
