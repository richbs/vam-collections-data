His work has provided both a record of costumes and scenery and of the dramatic effect of Irving's performances.\n\nThis image shows the actor Henry Irving (1838-1905) as Dr. Tregenna in The Medicine Man, a play written by Henry Duff Traill in collaboration with Robert Hichens and produced by Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in May 1898. The play did not prove successful, it opened on 4th May, but only ran for 22 performances.",
