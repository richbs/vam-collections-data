The top of the large central compartment is filled in with a trefoil arch enriched with floral scrolls, monsters' heads, a vase, and a cherub's head in openwork; the top of each of the compartments is similarly decorated with floral scrolls terminating in dolphin's heads. Each group of two small compartments in the upper stage is surmounted by an entablature with a frieze decorated in relief, with scrolled cartouches alternating with groups of floral scrolls; the lower stage has a similar entablature, the frieze being further decorated with cherubs' heads in high relief. The compartments in the upper stage are separated by fluted Corinthian columns, with a cherub's head on the base of each, and those in the lower stage by gropups of two similar columns; on either side of the upper portion of the large compartment is a baluster-shaped pilaster supporting an angel. The whole rests on a plinth ornamented with floral scrolls alternating with cartouches enclosing oval bosses. The altar is further enriched with colours and gilding, and is enclosed in a case which originally had doors.",
