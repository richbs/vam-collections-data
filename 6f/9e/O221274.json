It has a fun design with its coloured writing and traffic lights, unlike the other utilitarian devices of the time. \n\nThe pencil belonged to a boy named Michael, who used the pencil when he visited his aunt who lived in Chingford. His aunt was a librarian and worked for many of the libraries within the old North East London Polytechnic area, Duncan House, Maryland House, Waltham Forest and Barking Colleges.\n\nMichael describes the pencil as having an odd charm about it that 'draws' the person to using it. Possibly something to do with the colourful traffic light design. Although it has stayed on a shelf for years his children have also taken it down especially to use it, despite having many of their own pens and pencils.  \n\nIt has obviously been used a lot as it has been sharpened many times using a knife, and has a few teeth marks where the user has chewed it!",
