In the nineteenth century chairs such as this, with caned sides and backs, were referred to as bergere armchairs.  This example is closely based on a Regency model and is typical of the sort of furniture Morris & Company were making in the 1890s.  According to the Morris and Company catalogue of about 1912 this type of chair was still available for purchase from the firm.  The loose cushions of this particular chair are covered in a chintz designed by William Morris called \u2018Tulip\u2019. \n\nThe chair was given to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Mrs Amy Tozer, the daughter of John Carruthers who was a friend of William Morris and who bought the chair directly from Morris & Company.",
