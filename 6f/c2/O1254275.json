It was intended that the mythological story should be presented as if staged by a serf dance company in early 19th century Russia, but neither the ballet nor its designs by Georges Braque were successful and Diaghilev ordered revisions to the choreography and costumes before the work was seen in Paris and London later in the year. When the ballet was staged in London the programme noted that the 'Masks and symbols' were by Oliver Messel. This was Messel's first credited work for the stage. According to dancer Alicia Markova, the masks were already in use in Paris in June 1925 though Messel was not mentioned in the Paris programme.\n\nA review of the London production which appeared in The Queen, 18 November 1925, commented that the Muses 'wear Mycenian gold masks on the tops of their heads as though they were Watteau hats'.",
