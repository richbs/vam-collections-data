Eileen was a keen and precocious ballet dancer, who performed regularly as part of a juvenile dance troupe in the 1920s. \nOne of the stockings has Eileen's initials embroidered into the seam, but the second has a handwritten inscription commemorating the date 1838 and the words 'At St Georges'. Eileen's great-grandparents were married in that year at St Georges church in Hanover Square, so this stocking may have been a family heirloom.",

Eileen Brock was a keen and dedicated dancer from a young age, and the mendings on these stockings suggest they were worn and looked after. The Museum of Childhood also holds a number of photographs of Eileen wearing similar stockings with ballet shoes.\nThe older stocking may not have been worn, but passed down as a memento or heirloom.\n[Stocking marked with signature] Possibly belonged to the donor's great-grandmother, Lucy Piercy, who was married in St. George's Church, Hanover, London, in 1838.",
