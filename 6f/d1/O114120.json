This print shows his version of an Ionic window design, rather more elaborate than the traditional classical orders. It is very rich in decoration, with vases, flower ornament and Ionic touches throughout. One of the columns is supported by a female figure: her bow and arrows suggest she may possibly be the goddess of hunting, Diana (as she is known in Roman mythology) or Artemis (Greek mythology).",
