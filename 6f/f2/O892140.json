The text is as follows: VERONA: late 16th century 513 Seated Virgin, in profile, with the Child on her knee Pen and ink heightened with white on grey washed paper 8 x 7 \u00bd (203 x 190) D.1048-1900 PROVENANCE Count J. von Ross (Lugt 2693); Dalton Bequest 1900 LITERATURE Dalton Catalogue, p. 17 (as a copy after Fra Bartolomeo) The drawing is connected with, and perhaps copied from, a drawing in the Uffizi ascribed to Lorenzo di Credi (no. 56E: photo Gernsheim 1133-1950; not listed in BB). The composition is derived from a sculpture in low relief which exists in several versions, notably in a marble in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (A. 84-1927), usually attributed to Desiderio de Settignano. Several drawings after one or other of these reliefs are in existence. They are discussed in connection with no. 34 above (School of Baccio Bandinelli).",
