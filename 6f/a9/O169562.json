Predominant gold thread is used for the ground. \n\nThe decoration consists of Chinese characters at the top of the picture. Flanking the inscriptions are two discs symbolising sun and moon (a three-legged bird and the lunar rabbit pounding a mortar, respectively) supported on colourful clouds. Below on clouds are two groups of four apsaras bearing tribute of plate of cakes, shell, etc., facing inwards to an elaborate umbrella. In the centre: three figures of Buddha Amitabha depicted in his aspect as Buddha of the Three Ages - Past, Present and Future. Below him the Four Heavenly Kings with attributes: serpent, pagoda, an umbrella, musical instrument and a sword. In the foreground are the eighteen arhats holding symbols: pagoda, staff, beads, book, a tiger etc. standing in and on clouds, and flanking a large bowl of flowers also supported on a cloud structure. Clouds and waves decorate the bottom of the panel. Border bears repeated lotus and diamond motifs.\n\nTechnique: the dark silk wrap is divided into three portions. One binds the coloured pattern weft on the surface of the cloth in 3/1 twill, the thickest portion forms a wrap twill making the blue background which alternates with coloured pattern on the surface, the third loosely binds the bundle of pattern wefts not in use on the back of the material.",

As rulers who have inherited the Mandate of Heaven to rule China, the Manchu emperors of the Qing Dynasty continued the religious practices of preceding ruling dynasties. By the 18th century Buddhist devotion became important at court, and this textile was produced by the imperial workshop for religious worship at court. \n\nThe thangka depicts the Buddha Amitabha (Buddha of the Infinite Light), in his aspect as the Buddha of the Ages Past, Present and Future. The Buddha is here surrounded by apasaras (celestial beings), the 18 Arhats (followers of the Buddha), and the Four Heavenly Kings. \n\nOther examples of this thangka exist in the Palace Museum (Beijing) and the Potala Palace in Tibet.",
