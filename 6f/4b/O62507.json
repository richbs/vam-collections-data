At this time tea rooms in the city were numerous and popular; when hung with paintings by the Glasgow Boys some of them became almost like art galleries. None could match the tea rooms of Kate Cranston with their startling decorations and the provision of such amenities as billiard rooms and ladies' rooms.\n\nDesign & Designing\nIn the Willow tea room Mackintosh had total control of the project both inside and outside; his wife contributed some of the decorative motifs. On the ground floor he set up an unpainted frieze of plaster panels, their angular outlines leading the eye deeper into the stems and branches of the willow wood. Above, in the Salon de Luxe, a leaded-glass frieze with pink and green insets was placed against white painted walls, and on the curved bay, leaf-shaped mirror glass shimmered like the stirring of willow leaves. The fireplace came from this room and echoes these motifs.",
