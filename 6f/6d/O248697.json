Although, with its mass of pin-dotting, it appears to be a simple design, it uses many subtly different colours and eighteen blocks were needed to complete the pattern. It was issued initially in eight ways; some expensive variants employed gold or silver spot grounds. \n\nThe original design is at Birmingham Museum and Art gallery.'",
