Above is a crown surmounted by an orb and flanked by two swans and two sets of initials 'E R'.\n\nThe ground  is scattered with sprigs of strawberries, pansies and roses and with small dogs and rabbits. Also scattered over the ground are a number of initials. The sachet is lined with pink silk and there are the remains of six irregularly placed pairs of pink ribbon ties. Behind the ties and in the seams are fragments of a second lining of black silk.",

Usually, it was a profession of loyalty to, or a symbol of patronage from, a particular monarch. The initials which surround the armorial are probably those of the family who owned the pouch.\n\nThis pouch probably contained sweet-smelling herbs, which were thought to help induce sleep. Pleasant scents were also believed to help to ward off sickness, with a prime example of the use of this theory being the \u2018beak\u2019 masks worn by plague doctors from at least the seventeenth-century.\n\nThe richness of the materials used in the object\u2019s production suggest a wealthy source, and the somewhat na\u00efve execution of the design points to an amateur craftsperson, possibly a child, as its maker. This would not have been unusual, as even aristocratic girls were expected to learn needlework as a means of education, instilling discipline, and as a means of expression.",
