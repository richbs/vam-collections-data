This style was  influenced by 18th-century French designs. Originally the chair was covered in crimson damask (a patterned woven fabric). The present upholstery is based on fragments of silk found on the chair and on the original sketches and estimates produced by the upholsterer for the commission.\n\nPlaces\nThe Court Drawing Room, Goldsmiths' Hall, London, was the room on the first floor of the Hall intended for the use of female guests of the Goldsmiths' Company. Originally decorated with a red, white and gold scheme, the Drawing Room had crimson satin curtains and wall hangings, and white and gold mouldings. The furniture included window seats, sofas, 4 large armchairs, 18 fly (lightweight) chairs and 8 chairs like this one, which cost \u015356 each.\n\nPeople\nPhilip Hardwick (1792-1870) was Surveyor of the Goldsmiths' Company who commissioned him to design a new Hall. His building was in the Italianate style with six Corinthian columns (one of the classical orders of architecture) on the front.  Hardwick designed the Court Drawing Room on the first floor for the use of female guests. He commissioned the furnishings, including a set of these chairs, from W.& G. Wilkinson, 14 Ludgate Hill, London.",
