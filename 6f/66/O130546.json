To ensure reality, Mendes asked the military historian Taff Gillingham to give a talk to all the cast members on the life of a soldier of 1918 and especially members of the Tank Corps. He was appointed Military Adviser and was asked to read through the script and make observations before rehearsals began. He was also asked to help the individual actors develop their characters. Every character had a full pack containing everything his 1918 counterpart would have had. Writing paper, revolvers, tank crew leather equipment and chainmail masks were all faithfully reproduced to original patterns. Alkl the soldiers had uniforms correctly badged for a unit of the Tank Corps in August 1918. Specialist uniform items including the proper overalls were found and copied to get as near as possible to the real thing. A quantity of Great War shirts were produced in the original material. The Officer of the tank crew, Dougray Scott, was a Scot and even his tunic was adapted to conform to the Highland pattern.",
