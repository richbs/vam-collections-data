'Hades' has also been used to refer to the dwelling place of the dead, over which the Lord of the Underworld presided. In this painting by George Cruikshank (1812-1870), it is unclear as to whether the Hades of the title refers to a person or a place, because central to the chaotic scene is a large and menacing creature. \n\nAlthough it is unconnected to this oil painting, Cruikshank also produced an engraved Comic Alphabet, 1836, for which the letter 'O' was illustrated by a scene of  the hero Orpheus playing a violin for Hades and his wife Persephone.\n\nCruikshank is best known for his humorous and satirical art work. Many of his images deal with the darker aspects of life. He also worked as an illustrator for the author Charles Dickens (1812-1870).",

After James Gillray\u2019s death 1815, he became the leading political caricaturist of the day. In the 1820s he turned to book illustration, receiving many commissions to provide plates for novels; the success of Dickens's <i>Sketches</i> by Box (1830) was largely due to Cruikshank's designs. In the 1840s his success and reputation declined, especially with the advent of <i>Punch</i> (1841). Many of his later works are concerned with the cause of temperance, and he enjoyed considerable success with his series of prints 'The Bottle' (1847). A prolific maker of prints during a long working life (there is an extensive collection in the V&A), the number of works in oil is small; he exhibited eight at the RA between 1830 and 1867 and 15 at the BI 1833-60, the subjects principally literary and genre. Died London 1 February 1878; a good deal of his studio collection was presented to the V &A by his second wife Eliza. \n\nLIT: G Reid <i>A Descriptive Catalogue of the Works of George Cruikshank</i>  3 vols, 1871; W Bates <i>George Cruikshank</i> 1878; B Jerrold <i>The Life of George Cruikshank</i> new ed 1898; A Cohn <i>George Cruikshank: a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9</i> 1924; <i>The Inimitable George Cruikshank</i> University of Louisville Libraries, Kentucky, USA, exhibition catalogue 1968; W Feaver <i>George Cruikshank</i> V&A exhibition catalogue 1974; H and M Evans <i>The Man Who Drew the Drunkard's Daughter </i>... 1978; M Wynn <i>George Cruikshank: His Life and London</i>1978; G Buchanan-Brown <i>The Book Illustrations of George Cruikshank</i> Newton Abbot 1980 \n\n<b>Hades</b> \n9569 Neg HF3740 \nMillboard, 20 x 25.4 cm (7 7/8 x 10 ins) \nSigned 'George Cruikshank' bl and inscribed on the back as below \nGiven by Mrs George Cruikshank 1884 \n\nAs mentioned in the entry for 'Tarn O'Shanter' (72-1880, p56), Cruikshank was very interested in the supernatural, and particularly the <i>diablerie</i> of texts such as Chamisso's <i>Peter Schlemiel</i> (which he illustrated for the edition of 1823-4). The present work is inscribed 'Tarn O'Shanter' twice on the upper stretcher, presumably by the artist's wife, first in pen and then in pencil.\"",
