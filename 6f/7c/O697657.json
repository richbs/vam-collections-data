For the reasons given below there is evidence that the following designs may be firmly associated with these specific artists: \n \nThomas Stothard     E.110,111-1964\nJohn Flaxman     E.l19-1964 \n\nOn grounds of style E.109-1964 may also be attributed to Stothard.\nOther designers who worked for the firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell\nat the time and whose drawings may be included in the volume are\nWilliam Theed I and Edward Hodges Baily, R.A. \n\nAmong the items of interest are: \n \nDesign for a wine-cooler, based on the design of the Warwick Vase. Several wine-coolers of this design are in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, with the maker\u2019s mark of Paul Storr, dated 1812 and 1814-15. (G.140 - 144, Pl.XLVI) The Harewood House dessert service also includes a pair of wine-coolers, dated 1812, of the same design.      E.77-1964\"",
