The upper compartment depicts the Resurrection, with Christ stepping from the tomb over two sleeping soldiers wearing chain mail. Christ is wearing a pink tunic and blue cloak and his wound marks are visible as red circles with black centres. He carries a white cross and has a red halo. The tomb resembles green marble and the inside is red. In the backround are stylized trees. The lower compartment shows the Ascension, with Christ's lower legs just visible. Two angels flank the top right and left corners. In the background are hills and in the foreground is a crowd of people wearing tunics and cloaks of blue, green, orange and red. The compartments have black outlines. Around this is a pink border then another border composed of blue strips at the sides, top and bottom with mock Cufic lettering in white, and corners of burnished gold. There is another outer border in pink and the whole has a double frame in black outline. \n\nOn the verso is Christ in Majesty surrounded by symbols of the Evangelists.  Set against a blue background with white stars is a mandorla with a thick border in green, white, red and green. Christ sits on a pink cushion against a blue background wearing red tunic and blue-grey cloak. He has a white halo with red cross and holds a red bound book in his left hand. His right hand is raised in blessing. Beneath him are two rainbows of the same decoration as the mandorla border. In the corners are four roundels, with symbols of the Evangelists, clockwise from top left; 'S. Joh-es', a brown eagle facing right, 'S. Mathevs', wearning blue tunic and yellow cloak facing left 3/4 view, 'S. Lvcas', a brown bull with grey wings facing left, 'S. Marcvs', a brown lion with grey wings facing front. Each is set against a green background, has a red halo and holds a scroll with the saint's name.

Psalters contained the Book of Psalms and were usually also accompanied by a calendar showing important saints days according to region, a litany of the saints (invocations to individual saints) and prayers. In monasteries and churches the Psalms were recited over the course of a week during the eight 'canonical hours' into which each day was divided. Psalters were also used for private devotion before Books of Hours began to be made in the thirteenth century. \n\nPsalters might also be richly illuminated with series of full-page miniatures. This example is from a series showing scenes from the life of Christ. In others the life of King David, the supposed author of the Psalms, might be represented.",

            "historical_context_note": "William Ottley (1771-1836) was a major collector of manuscripts and fragments. He declared that he had profited, when in Italy, from the chaos that followed the French invasion of 1796: in fact, he had been collecting there from 1791. There is evidence that Ottley cut up manuscripts that he owned. By 1817, when Dibden's 'Bibliographical Decameron' was published, Ottley's collection of leaves and manuscripts was famous. When sold in 1838, it provided a rich source for English collectors.\n\nEarly Italian painters were perhaps Ottley's chief interest; his collection was outstanding in Italian illumination. However, he also collected illumination of other regions. \n\nWhat kind of manuscript were available on the English market in the 1850s? J.C. Robinson, acquired many pieces of illumination, much of it German or Netherlandish, in Cologne in 1857-8. Foreign sources of supply were significant: the Victorian interest in medieval illumination involved importing large numbers of manuscripts to satisfy the collector.\nFrom 'Vandals and Enthusiasts: Views of Illumination in the Nineteenth Century' by Rowan Watson; Victoria and Albert Museum; 1995\n\nMedieval manuscripts of the psalms were used in liturgical as well as private devotional contexts and often contained ancillary texts such as a calendar, canticles, creeds, a litany of the saints (invocations for deliverance and intercession addressed to the Trinity, the Virgin, angels, apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins individually and as groups), and prayers. Psalters designed for use in the performance of the divine office often contain other relevant texts, such as the Hours of the Virgin. The Psalter was the principal book for private devotions before the emergence of the Book of Hours in the thirteenth century. \n\nThe Divine Office was at the core of the Christian liturgy. It was a cycle of daily devotions  - the prayers of the canonical hours - performed by members of the religious orders and the clergy. By the eighth century the cycle of eight canonical hours had been fixed; they were (times approximate), matins (2.30am), lauds (5am), prime (6am), terce (9am), sext (12 noon), none (3pm), vespers (4.30pm) and compline (6pm).\n\nIn the non-monastic roman liturgy of the middle ages, all one hundred and fifty Psalms were recited each week, the majority at matins and vespers. The cycle began at matins on Sunday with Psalm 1 and continued at matins on the following days: Psalm 26 was the first recited on Monday, Psalm 38 the first on Tuesday, Psalm 52 the first on Wednesday, Psalm 68 the first on Thursday, Psalm 80 the first on Friday, Psalm 97 the first on Saturday. The cycle for vespers commenced on Sunday with Psalm 109 and continued throughout the week with the remaining Psalms (some Psalms were set aside for other hours). Other divisions of the Psalms are occasionally found. Such divisions would often be given prominence within the decorative programme. Depictions of King David, author of many of the Psalms, frequently introduce the psalter (especially as historiated Beatus initials to Psalm 1). \n\nPrefatory cycles of illumination were often added to Psalters, consisting of scenes from the life of Christ as seen here, or of King David.\n\nTaken from <i>Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts: A Guide to Technical Terms</i> by Michelle P. Brown (London, 1995)\n\nData taken from notes compiled by Rowan Watson.
