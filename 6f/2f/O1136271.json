The dolls were designed by Sasha Morgenthaler (1893-1975), a Swiss artist in the mid 1960s.  She was a keen observer of children and wanted to produce a doll that reflected all the word's children.  The Sasha doll was designed so that she was affordable and would have universal appeal.  They are unique in that they have a stylised form, their skin colour is a blend of all children, they have realistic proportions and are well balanced.  Just as much care went into the clothing which were hand made, including the knitted stockings.\n\nThey were produced by two companies a German company, Gotz-Puppenfabrik Gmbh from 1965-1970 and again 1995 to 2001.  Also a British company Trendon Toys Ltd, which was owned by the Doggart family who donated these dolls to the collection.  They produced the dolls from 1966 to 1986.",
