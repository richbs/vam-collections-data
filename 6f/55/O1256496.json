The next has upper case letters. The remainder of the book is a series of sentences starting with different letters in alphabetical order; there are two on each page. The inscription 'Henry Hood, May 10 1846' is written on the reverse of the fourth page. There is a calculation of distance on the obverse of the fifth page, written in pencil.\nThe back cover is densely covered with single letters, ink blots and the words 'Joseph Wilson' and 'Leicestershire'.",
