Huge fortunes were invested to construct Buddhist temples and monasteries in Beijing and across the empire, and to perform religious rituals to facilitate state affairs or to pray for the individual salvation of aristocrats and emperors at court. \n\nOfficial porcelain vessels were specially commissioned for Buddhist altars. They were decorated with Buddhist symbols, and often enriched with Sanskrit, Tibetan and Mongolian inscriptions. The inscription on this saucer is written in Mongolian characters; as a daughter of the emperor Daoguang married the prince of Western Tumet, a principality of Southern Mongolia, this was probably part of a service made for her.\n\nThe decoration is composed of a lotus flower and a vajra in the centre, and with the Eight Buddhist Emblems (ba ji xiang) on the rim; the wheel of Law (lun), the conch (luo), the emblem of victory (san), the parasol (gai), the lotus (hehua), the vase (guan), the twin fish (yu), and the endless knot (panchang), each associated to a blessing. Originally from India, they were introduced into China in the early 14th century by Tibetan Buddhism, and they soon became popular decorative and auspicious motif for porcelain, textiles and cloisonn\u00e9 objects.",
