            "history_note": "Historical Significance:\n\nDraughtsman, printmaker and potter, Francis Places was intended for the bar and entered Gray\u2019s Inn, London, in 1665. However he left following the outbreak of the Great Plague in the same year. An income from his father, and an advantageous second marriage allowed Place to pursue his interest in art, etching, pottery and fishing. Whilst in London Place had met the artist Wenzel Hollar (1607-1677) and began collaborating with him in the same year.  Place was later to write of Hollar in a letter to George Virtue \u2018He was a person I was intimately acquainted withal, but never his disciple\u2019 (See Hardie, I, p.62). Both Place\u2019s subject matter and style however betray his close association with Hollar. This can be seen in the wide views, often of townscapes along rivers neatly outlined in pen with limited tones of wash applied. However Place\u2019s work is freer in style, often employing looser pen strokes and applications of wash. Place made a number of sketching tours including London in 1683 and Wales in 1699. He resided for most of his life in York where he hosted meetings of the <i>virtuosi</i> of the city. Many of his dated sketches record visits he made to sites in Yorkshire, for example <i>Knaresborough Castle</i> in 1703; <i>Middleham Castle</i> in 1715 and <i>Byland Abbey</i> in 1713.\n\nThis drawing looks down the river Thames towards Vauxhall and Lambeth. The river stretches across the foreground of the river, before curving in a sharp bend at Vauxhall. \n\nThe format of a wide view or \u2018prospect\u2019 of a town, built along a riverbank recalls the work of Wenzel Hollar. The drawing has been wrongly attributed to Hollar as can be seen in the inscription \u2018W H\u2019 on the lower left of the old mount. However Place uses much freer pen strokes to outline the view and suggest the constant flow of water along the Thames. Applications of was in tones of grey and green give form to the composition whilst, used for the rooftops draws our attention to the buildings on the left. \n\nPlace has noted the areas represented in the view (from left to right, Lambeth; Vaxhaul; Millbank; Parliament House; Westminster). This follows examples by Hollar and other seventeenth-century topographical artists. A drawing by Place of the Thames showing Peterborough House, Lambeth and the Strand, is dated 1683. It is likely that the artist also made this drawing on the same visit to London and possible date of 1683 can therefore also be given to this work.\n\n\nReferences: Martin Hardie, <u>Watercolour Painting in Britain, I, The Eighteenth Century, (London:1967)",
