Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from the Romagna.  The applied filigree decoration on the spheres is often called Etruscan, and it is typical of 19th century work from this region.\n\nThis earring was bought for \u00a31 4s.
