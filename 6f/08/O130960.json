            "historical_context_note": "Garry Winogrand was among a new generation of photographers who became active in the 1950s.  Initially, he had worked in photojournalism. There his work, and that of his contemporaries such as Dan Weiner and Diane Arbus, seemed very casual in comparison with work by established photojournalists.  By the 1960s, partly due to the decline of photo magazines and also to his growing awareness of photographers such as Robert Frank, Winogrand increasingly orchestrated his subject matter into a larger, personal scheme.  This is reflected in the division of much of his work into general themes.  He produced a series of images in the 1960s of zoos in which Winogrand observed human behaviour as well as the animals.  Winogrand gave up commercial photography in 1969.  He had received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1964 and had enjoyed the freedom of having no commercial pressures.  During the 1970s and early 1980s he took up lecturing posts in American universities.  He was uneasy about teaching not only because he was self-taught, but also since he strongly defended his own work against theoretical interpretations.  He left a vast body of work unfinished at his death in 1984, possibly 300,000 exposures which he had not developed or printed.",
