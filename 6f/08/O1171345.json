They  were involved in a variety of activities similar to those of the Scout and would attend camps and do outdoors activities but there was also a strong focus on domestic duties and skills such as cooking and cleaning. As with the Scouts and the Brownies, the Guides had a promise and their own 'law' that they should follow:\n1. A guide is loyal and can be trusted.\n2. A Guide is helpful.\n3. A Guide is polite and considerate.\n4. A Guide is friendly and a sister to all Guides.\n5. A Guide is kind to animals and respects all living things.\n6. A Guide is obedient.\n7. A Guide has courage and is cheerful in all difficulties.\n8. AGuide makes good use of her time.\n9. A Guide takes care of her possessions and those of other people.\n10. A Guide is self controlled in all she thinks, says, and does.",
