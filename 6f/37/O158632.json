The ground is quilted with yellow silk into a diamond shaped lattice. Inner and outer border with a light green meander with red, sometimes purple, trefoil flowers.\nThere is a lobed roundel in the centre formed by a green band with red spots.  There is a central red and purple flower with a metal thread centre.  This is enclosed within an 8-pointed green star which links 4red and purple flowers and 4 white flowers in profile. There is a small red tree at the compass points together with a pair of white birds.  There are 4 more birds around the edge of the roundel.\nA quarter of the roundel is in each corner. \nThe rest of the ground is decorated with random floral sprigs, predominantly red flowers bending to the left, but there are smaller sprigs with 3 blue and white flowers.  The flowers are upright in the lower half, and downward pointing in the upper half. The ground is quilted in the diamond pattern. The quilting and embroidery is worked through a layer of fibres and through a plain weave white cotton fabric.\nThreads: red sometimes replaced with purple, light green, pink, light orange, white, blue/green and dark brown.\nMetal Thread: silver stripe close S-wound on white silk core.\nBacking: pieced; blue ground with close off-set rows of a white and brown flower on a black stem with green leaves.
