            "public_access_description": "Elton John started performing as a pub singer at the age of 15, working his way up the music industry ladder by playing in bands with his friends, eventually becoming a staff songwriter for DJM Records. On gaining a record contract in 1970, at the age of 23, his live performance became bigger and more flamboyant. Backed by a large catalogue of ballads and piano rock, his scintillating stage shows involved him performing in wild costumes such as this one.  \nDesigned by Bill Whitten, this costume was known as 'Bicycle John' and John wore it on his 1974 American tour. The lurex fabric is decorated with a bicycle bell, mudguards, reflectors, and handlebar covers and the platform soles and four inch heels of the boots are covered with multi-coloured glass rhinestones. A matching bicycle was also created, covered in rhinestones corresponding with those of the platform soles.\n\nBill Whitten is a costume designer to pop stars and for Hollywood film. His designs have included iconic costumes for Michael Jackson, Earth Wind and Fire and Lionel Richie and movies including the 1980 remake of The Jazz Singer, and tend towards the camp and flamboyant .",
