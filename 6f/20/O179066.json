'Jesse Tree' windows are a visual representation of Jesus Christ's genealogy which was traced back to Jesse, the father of the Old Testament Prophet/King David. \n\nThese prophets announce the coming of Christ from the line of David and appear on the Tree accompanying images of Christ's royal ancestors. The whole window would have culminated at the top with either an image of Jesus Christ or an image of the Christ Child with his mother, Mary. At the bottom of the window would have been an image of Jesse from whom the genealogical Tree emerges.\n\nThe prophet here can be identified by the name 'Roboan'. There was no prophet by that name but there was a King Rehoboam who is portrayed in some Tree of Jesse representations, including English ones of the 14th century. It is unknown why King Rehoboam would be depicted as a prophet and it is likely that the figure has not been correctly identified. Jesse Trees with their kings and prophets were produced in all forms of church art from the 11th century and throughout the medieval period. There was no standard convention for the depiction of the prophets and the kings.\n\nThe style of painting on this figure is very much like that of the prophet series 5 to 5C-1881 but the figure is more robust in its form, as seen in the other series (5D-E and 6-C-1881).  Most of the prophet figures in this collection are paired, are mirror images of each other, indicating that each pair was made from the same cartoon or design drawing. 5D and 6C-1881 are exceptions and it is likely that there was originally a pair to each. \n\nTwo other panels in the museum (Mus.nos. 6D and 6E-1881) depict Kings from a 'Jesse Tree' window but were not originally part of this series of prophets panels.",

This chapel had been restored in the 19th century and some of the medieval windows were removed.\nPrior to 1936 opinion had changed and it was thought that the original location of these panels was Troyes Cathedral, possibly in the axial chapel. In 1779 the central window of this axial chapel had been removed.\n\nHistory of Troyes Cathedral:\n(c.1200) Work started in the eastern choir, leaving the axial chapel last.\n(c.1200-10) First phase of work.\n(c.1210-1220s) Second phase of work.\n(1228) Much wind damage to cathedral and collapse of the upper choir. So there probably had been damage to the Jesse window which would account for a 15-year gap in styles. \n(1779) Central window the axial chapel removed (not for revolutionary reasons)\nJesse apparently occupied the centre light with Life of Virgin and typological Life of Christ on either side\n(c.1800?) 4 STG panels from a Tree of Jesse were indentified amongst the shattered glazing of the axial chapel after the Revolution\n(1837) Arnaud: descriptions of 4 panels of a Jesse Tree located in the lowest parts of the two facing windows of the Public Life of Christ in the 2nd and 6th bay of seven-bay axial chapel\n                \tKing David plays a \u2018rote\u2019\n                \tSolomon carries a cithar in his hand\n                \tMary holds a palm branch\n                \tChrist is blessing\n(1955) Jean Lafond: Chapel's central opening (reconstruction?)\n\t\tLife of Virgin - Jesse Tree - Life of Christ\n\t\t\t\tOR\n\t\tLife of Christ - Jesse Tree - Life of Virgin\n(1958) Grodecki noted that the V&A prophet panels were of a similar quality to the Jesse panels at Troyes.\n\nJesse Panels at Troyes:\nLocated in the current Jesse window in a north ambulatory chapel:\n1) \tKing panel: Daniel [?], holds a guitar like structure and a bow which goes across the instrument and not on the shoulder\n2)\tKing panel: Solomon [how identified?]\n3)\tVirgin panel\n4)\tChrist panel \u2013 topmost as is arched\n\nPaston Comments on why V&A panels are from Troyes window:\n1) \tmeasurements match height of Troyes panels\n2) \tall would fit into the axial chapel window\n3) \tall panels exhibit similar pitting\n\nA series of prophets at the V&A have been associated with the glass at Troyes since Grodecki (1958). The dimensions of the panels (65 x 36) fit perfectly in the axial window and complement the trunk figures. However, the prophets of this series are executed with a vaiety of pictorial styles associated with the years 1220 and 1230. This suggest that they were completed in a certain period and that they are probably from a ancient disruption of the glassmaking.",

It is reasonable to think the representation in a window was based on an earlier minature.
