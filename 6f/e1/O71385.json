The left-hand figure wears a chasuble, probably representing an archbishop, possibly that most popular of English medieval archbishops, St. Thomas Becket. The middle figure wears a girded alb and a tippet and holds a sceptre in his left hand and an object representing a ring his right, indicating that he is Edward the Confessor. The right-hand figure wears an alb and amice and holds with his right hand one of two cords which hang from a cardinal's hat. \n\nThe top of the panel is missing and the bottom is badly chipped. The right-hand figure is broken across near the bottom. There is a hole through the panel to the left of the sceptre. The fragment is craked from top to bottom down the middle. Very slight traces of paint remain on the panel, including the usual daisy pattern on a green ground. The back of the panel is incised with a circle containing rows of short lines and small drilled cirles. There are three holes in the back, two of them plugged with lead. The bottom of the panel has been cut away.",

The left-hand figure wears a chasuble, probably represents and archbishop, possibly St. Thomas Becket. The middle figure wears a girded alb and tippet and holds a sceptre in his left hand and an object representing a ring in his right, indicating that he is Edward the Confessor. The right-hand figure wears and alb and amica and holds with his right hand one of two cords which hang from a cardinal's hat. \n\nThis fragment is almost certainly from a panel forming part of a Te Deum altarpiece made up of panels of such subjects as the Prophets, the Nine Orders of Angels, Male Martyrs and Female Martyrs, all looking towards a central panel of the Trinity or Crucifixion.",
