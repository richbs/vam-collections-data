By 1873 it had 173 employees and set up its own school for training young craftsmen. It was the first to specialise in making objects in the Russian style and focused on enamel wares becoming  the leading producer in Moscow of this type of cloisonn\u00e9 enamel. These enamel products were very popular with the conservative middle and merchant classes from the mid nineteenth century until the revolution in 1917. They all follow the same formula of geometrically arranged foliage in brilliant opaque colours. \n\nCloisonn\u00e9 decoration used enamel on a metal base. The design is outlined by metal fillets (cloisons) secured to the metal and the enclosed spaces are filled with coloured enamels which are then fired.",
