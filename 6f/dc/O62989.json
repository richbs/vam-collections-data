She devoted her life to composing and singing hymns in praise of Shiva, and her example of selfless devotion to her god had a profound influence on popular devotional Hinduism.  \n\nBorn in the 6th century to a wealthy merchant family in the port city of Karaikkal, Karaikkal-Ammaiyar was blessed with great beauty. She married young, but after a series of miracles dedicated her life solely to Shiva. She achieved her emaciated state after beseeching Shiva to free her from her all worldly encumbrances, including her beauty. \n\nShiva granted her wish, transforming her into the form of one of the skeletal spirits who dance before Shiva at the cremation grounds. Karaikkal-Ammaiyar spent her days as an emaciated figure singing Shiva\u2019s praise, accompanied only by her hand cymbals. \n\nKaraikkal-Ammaiyar  settled in Tiruvalankadu, the forest famed as the site where Shiva performed his \u2018tandava dance\u2019 in the midst of cremation pyres. There she spent the remainder of her life, writing hymns in praise of her Lord, many of them rich in gruesome imagery of death and decay. She signed her poems Karaikkal-pey, identifying herself as one of Shiva\u2019s grotesque goblin followers, and kept the company of Shiva\u2019s other dwarfish attendants, the \u2018ganas\u2019.",
