The most important initials might be historiated with a figurative picture (istoire being the term for a story) or images of saints as seen here, while divisions of lesser importance had decorated initials.\n\nThe Master of the Budapest Antiphonary is named after a Franciscan manuscript in the National Library of Budapest (MS Clmae 462) which dates to around 1444-1450. This artist's style is characterised by fluid lines and complex spacial composition. Sometimes a monochrome colour scheme, using light-brown with touches of pink or blue, contrasts with brightly coloured foliage in green, pink, orange and blue. The work of the Master of the Budapest Antiphonary is sometimes confused with a the work of the Master of the Franciscan Breviary. The two artists overlap in their careers and the stylistic development of both illuminators show the influence of Lombard miniaturists such as Michelino da Besozzo.",

He seems to become more monumental in his later works. For this reason I would place a striking illumination of St. Francis in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, Ms. 4928, in the artist's later period, where the combination of fluid lines and expression heralds the style of Mathias Grunewald.\", page 31.",

The cutting was stolen from a V&A gallery (Room 14) on the 11 January 1984 but was subsequently found in the United States and returned to the V&A in 2003.\n\nHistorical significance: In Italy, illuminated choirbooks and liturgical manuscripts contained the work of a large number of miniature painters. Choirbooks in particular were produced in sets of many volumes (often more than thirty). From the early nineteenth century onwards such choirbooks provided an easy source of images that connoisseurs eagerly sought to add to their collections of paintings. Medieval illuminated manuscripts could be cut up to make them more marketable and pleasing to the collector. Single leaves survive, but also initials, as here, cut to shape. \n\nThe illuminations gathered by the South Kensington Museum in the nineteenth century represented a new kind of collection. It aimed to provide examples of medieval illumination for students to copy. From the beginning, the Museum tended to buy ready-made collections. This manuscript comes from a portfolio of Italian cuttings bought by the Museum in 1866 from J. & W. Boone.",
