            "public_access_description": "Ernest Nister (1842-1909) began his publishing career in 1885 when he acquired a lithographic workshop in N\u00fcrnberg and printed books for London publishers. In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nE. Heatly's illustration appears in several of Ernest Nister's publications, including Mother Goose Jingles (no. 759) and The Favourite Nursery Rhymes (no. 912a), both published ca.1898. It illustrates the fourth verse of the popular nursery rhyme, Simple Simon:\n\nSimple Simon met a pieman\nGoing to the fair;\nSays Simple Simon to the pieman,\n'Let me taste your ware'.\n\nSays the pieman to Simple Simon,\n'Show me first your penny';\nSays Simple Simon to the pieman,\n'Indeed I have not any'.\n\nSimple Simon went a-fishing\nFor to catch a whale;\nAll the water he had got\nWas in his mother's pail.\n\nSimple Simon went to look\nIf plums grew on a thistle;\nHe pricked his fingers very much,\nWhich made poor Simon whistle.",
