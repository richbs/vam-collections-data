            "public_access_description": "Geoffrey Beene founded his fashion label in 1963, creating clothing characterised by a relaxed informality, clean lines and simple silhouettes. In his first years as a designer, Beene became known for his highly constructed, 'architectural' dresses and also his whimsical references to popular culture. By the early 1970s,  recognising that his clientele appreciated the comfort, affordability and classic styling of sportswear, Beene moved away from the structured garments of his eart career and experimented with draping his designs in lighter fabrics such as the tan jersey of this skirt. Beene's signature aesthetic became softly draped, loosely-constructed separate pieces that gently suggested the body beneath. \n\nThis jacket and skirt ensemble was worn and given by Catharina Tinniswood who worked for Geoffrey Beene as both a show and fitting model in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The designs Tinniswood donated to the V&A were the garments she modelled for Geoffrey Beene. To complete the full outfit, Tinniswood also donated a knitted tie by F. R. Tripler and a pair of clip-on pearl and diamant\u00e9 earrings.",
