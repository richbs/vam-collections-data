The former used loam casts for his skillets and the founder's scratch mark was often scratched in the mould. This skillet is more likely to have been produced by John Fathers II as his later sand-cast models like this example have no scratch marks.",

            "history_note": "This skillet was made in the Fathers' family foundry in Montacute, Somerset in around 1700. The Museum bought it from Mr A.K. Greaves in 1920 for \u00a34.\n\nThe signed handle of the skillet is one of ten recorded variations of this design and was used by John Fathers I (1636-88) and John Fathers II (1670-1749). The former used loam casts for his skillets and the founder's scratch mark was often scratched in the mould. This skillet is more likely to have been produced by John Fathers II as his later sand-cast models like this example have no scratch marks.\n\nHistorical significance: The foundry has been the subject of extensive research and its links with the Sturton foundry in nearby South Petherton have been examined in detail and published.
