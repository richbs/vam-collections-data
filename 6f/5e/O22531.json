By the time this bowl was cast in the 13th or 14th century, the demands of a large ruling elite and wealthy Buddhist monasteries after the turn of the Koryo dynasty (918\u20131392) had stimulated important new developments in the production of metal.\n\nThis bowl was buried in a tomb, where it was believed to accompany the dead person into the afterworld. Prolonged contact with the earth has produced a striking corrosion pattern on the bowl\u2019s surface. Its shape is similar to that of ceramics from the same period. A Korean saying states that ceramics are for summer use and metal for winter and it was not uncommon for metal and ceramic versions of the same vessels to be made.",
