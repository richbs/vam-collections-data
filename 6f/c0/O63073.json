            "history_note": "The drawing is a template for a wooden cut-out figure of  Vera Nemchinova in the Adagietto from Bronislava Nijknska's ballet \"Les Biches\", premiered by the Diaghilev Ballets Russes in 1924 with designs by Marie Laurencin.  The dance historian, bookseller and publisher, Cyril Beaumont, commissioned designs from various artists which were then executed by the Aldon Studios and coloured by hand for sale in Beaumont's shop at 75, Charing Cross Road.  Nemchinova created the androgynous role, traditionally known as La Garconne, and danced it until she left the company in 1926.  \nBeaumont had admired Caran d'Ache's satirical wood carvings of political  personalities, and, about 1914, he conceived the idea of two-dimensional wooden figures of principal dancers of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes.  The figures represented the dancers in cotume in a typical pose from the chosen work; they were cut out from two-ply wood, hand painted and mounted on detachable stands.  Each design was limited to fifty copies, originally hand-coloured by the artist and issued at 7s 6d.  They sold steadily. Adrian Allinson designed nineteen figures in all and after the War, Beaumont turned to other artists and commissioned a separate artist to execute the colouring.  \nA figure made to the template of S.689-2001 is included in The Complete Catalogue of the Publications of C. W. Beaumont, 1928, which lists 49 wooden figures.  The Cyril Beaumont Bequest includes 40 examples of these (some not listed in the catalogue) plus 17 templates or art work for 16 different figures.   7 of these relate to wooden figures in the collection (two of which are not listed in the 1928 catalogue) and 8 to figures listed in the 1928 catalogue.  \nThe 1928 catalogue included the following description of the cut-outs (p.25): \n\"These figures of celebrated dancers of the Diaghileff Ballet have been issued with a view to supply the demand for something between a photograph and a statuette - something that would preserve the memory of a dancer as she appeared in a particular ballet.  Each figure is based on drawings made from sittings given by the dancer herself, and from sketches made during an actual performance.  The designs are by the following artists: Adrian Allinson, Eileen Mayo, Vera Willoughby, also working under the name of Vera Petrovna, Randolph Schwabe and Ethelbert White. The figures, which are of wood, average 8 3/4 inches high, and are hand-coloured with special care to ensure accuracy of costume.  The black stands on whcih the figures are mounted are easily removable to afford facility in packing.  The figures are priced at 7s. 6d. net.\"\n\nHistorical significance: The making of the series of wooden figures, for which this template was produced, are a testimony to the popularity of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes in London, and a growing 'popular' audience who demanded memorabilia and souvenirs.  As the only specialist bookseller and publisher in London, and with access to the dancers and company, Beaumont was quick to identify the market and he commissioned the figures, prints and illustrated books to fulful the demand.",
