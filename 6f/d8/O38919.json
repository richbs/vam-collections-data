The dress has a round neck edged with a double frill of white machine made lace and pink velveteen ribbon, and puffed sleeves edged with a double frill of white machine made lace and pink velveteen ribbon tied in a bow on the outer edge.  The lower edge of the yoke is worked at front and back with feather stitch in blue thread, and the fullness of the skirt front is hand smocked in blue thread to match, using stem, chevron and diamond stitches.  The garment fastens at the back of the yoke with three stitched buttonholes and white plastic buttons, and the velveteen ribbon which trims the neck ties in a bow at the back; there is also a pair of pink velveteen ties, one at each side of the waist, stitched within a buttonhole-stitched slot to suggest that the ties are actually an inserted sash which runs behind the smocked panel.",
