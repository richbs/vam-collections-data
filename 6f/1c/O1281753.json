The book is concerned with the effect of cast light and shadow and should be viewed with a single light source at a 45 degree angle to the left of the book, three feet distant.\n\nAs the pages are turned, shadows are formed and move across the page. The reader plays an essential part in the book's creation in the sense that the cast light and shadows are not part of the physical book itself, only coming into existence during the act of experiencing the book, that is, as the pages are turned.\n\nNAL copy is no. 11 in an edition of 50 copies, signed by the artist.",
