John Hassall (1868-1948) was a contemporary of Dudley Hardy (1867-1922) and produced many posters for the clients of the printers David Allen & Sons. His greatest strength was his humour, which made his images highly popular both then and now. The image of the fisherman, first issued by the Great Northern Railway in 1908, and from 1925 repeatedly used by the LNER, still promotes the Lincolnshire town of Skegness today.",
