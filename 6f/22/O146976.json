He started his career as an Abstract Expressionist painter but moved on to more hard-edge, geometric abstraction. He came to critical attention in the late 1950s and 1960s for his canvases covered with shapes such as crosses, squares, rectangles or circles, cut from another canvas and dipped in pigment. In other works, flat compositions were made up from  plaster, wood and other materials, or sometimes part of the composition would be derived from negative space - with areas cut away.\n\nIn this piece, working with the essentially flat surface of print on paper, Ortman suggests his interest in exploring the cross-over between ambiguity and reality and between depth and surface, through overlaying geometric patterns which are combined with physical \u2018cut outs\u2019 in the sheet. [Another impression of this print is Circ.530-1969]",
