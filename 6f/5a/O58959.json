            "public_access_description": "Johannes Christopher Zumpe emigrated from Germany to England during the 1750s. He set up business as a piano maker in Princess Street in London in 1761. This is one of his well-known single or 'English action' pianofortes. Basically, it is a square pianoforte with a single action, the precursor of the modern piano. It is one of the earliest known examples of its type. \n\nJohann Christian Bach (the son of Johann Sebastian Bach) gave the first public pianoforte recital in England in 1768, on an instrument that he had acquired from Zumpe. It is probable this recital that accelerated the popularity of the pianoforte. Johannes Christopher Zumpe made his fortune producing such pianos.",
