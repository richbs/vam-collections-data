This medal has only the obverse representing the bust of Katharina Sratch facing left, wering a hat with an ornate upturned brim, and a chain.\n\nThe groove along the edge of this piece was probably made so that the negatives of the obverse and reverse could be lined up if a medal was to be cast, and this indicates that this is indeed a model, although no medals after it are known. Habich and Bernhart had previously suggested that it was a model for the medal of Magdalena Haunolt, for whivh no drawing exists. However, as Mau\u00e8 has pointed out, the drawing for this medal is in the Staatsbibliothek, Bamberg, and is entitled Katharina Starckk. \n(Trusted, Marjorie.
