            "physical_description": "Vase. Bronze, hexagonal, with long curved neck, and handles formed by the heads and tongue of monsters. It is chased with raises diapers in panels.\nThis is a large vase, with some signs of deterioration. The brown patinated surface has a number of areas where bright green material is emerging. This green material is found particularly on the handles, and is very obvious on smooth surface. The two handles emerge from animal heads. The vase has an inset base which seems to have been soldered. An insert is visible near the rim and close to one of the handles. The vessel interior is discoloured at this point. \nAnalyses were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The body, the base plate, and the inset near the rim were all investigated. The base plate obviously has a different composition from that of the body, particularly because it contains more tin and lead. It must have been a separate casting. The insert metal also differs from that of the body, because it has higher lead and tin contents, and because nickel was detected as a trace element only in the insert. The insert differs from the base plate, in that it has less lead, and because of the nickel impurities. Iron, arsenic, and silver were identified as impurities in all three parts, although antimony was only apparent in the body metal. Zinc was apparently present to a small extent in each part, as well as tin, but the overall figure for the alloying components was apparently only 5%-7%. It seems unlikely that such a small zinc content would be due to a deliberate addition.",
