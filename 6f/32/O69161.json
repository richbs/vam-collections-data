            "public_access_description": "The most important French porcelain factory was founded in 1740 in the royal chateau of Vincennes. In 1756 it was transferred to S\u00e8vres, the other side of Paris, and shortly after was bought by Louis XV. The support and protection of the king and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, enabled it to secure the best artists, sculptors, designers and chemists. S\u00e8vres porcelain soon became the most sought after in Europe.\nThe royal manufactory at S\u00e8vres specialised in luxury porcelains, many of which were destined for the French court. Each year it displayed its newest models in the king's apartments at Versailles. The factory was very responsive to changes in fashion and introduced many innovations in design and decoration. Its products were admired throughout Europe and its style was widely imitated. \n\nThe enamel 'jewels' on this example were applied over stamped gold foil. This style of decoration is associated with Philippe Parpette, a flower painter who had worked as an enameller before joining the factory, and Joseph Coteau, who came to Paris from Geneva and is known as an enameller of clock faces. It was popular for just a few years around 1780.",
