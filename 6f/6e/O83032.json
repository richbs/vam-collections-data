Though similar to a 'mor pankhi' it lacks the necessary peacock head and wings, and is too elegant for the 'bajra' most commonly used. It may be that the ivory carvers made boats like these as souvenirs of festivals whendecorated boats of different shapes floated on the Ganges.\nSee Mode [1973] p.23 and pl.33b.\nFor different kinds of boats owned by the Nawab of Murshidabad see Welch [1978] p.35, fig.5a.",
