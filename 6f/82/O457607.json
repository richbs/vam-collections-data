Both left and right cuffs were embroidered onto the same piece of material as seen here and then cut out when they were sewn onto the garment. The background silk was often white, cream or a pastel shade in contrast to the gown itself which was a stronger colour. Several of the silk lengths in this exhibition could have been used for cuff material.\nEach of these cuffs is decorated slightly differently with flying bats holding ribbons with plaques attached to them. Eight plaques each contain one of the Eight Buddhist Emblems - the parasol, fish, vase, lotus, conch shell, endless knot, canopy and wheel - while the other two show peaches and blossom. These decorative emblems, seen on other textiles in this exhibition, do not have a particular religious significance here although the design is unusual for cuffs. This may be why Sir John bought them as he was interested in items with unusual patterns or motifs."
