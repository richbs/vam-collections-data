Paper folds in four. Inscribed in ink on reverse: 'EB' in a heart above 'No.7'. Below is a red oval stamp enclosing 'Tonqua'. Inscribed below in ink: 'Shawls.'\n\"According to family tradition, the tradesman's card was sent by Captain John Whitall to his sister to choose a colour for a silk cr\u00eape shawl. It has not been possible to identify the initials in the heart. Tonqua is listed as a 'Chow Chow' merchant - meaning he dealt in a bit of everything - in Robert Waln Jr's (qv) 'Standing, Character, Articles of Trade & Residence of a Number of Canton Native Merchants'.
