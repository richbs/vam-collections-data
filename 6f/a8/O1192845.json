The products described are mostly dolls, although there is also a section for accessories, such as bath sets, dolls' shoes, including with high heels, and nylon stockings. The front cover shows a colour photograph of a girl sitting on a red armchair with a Pegdigree doll on her lap with the text 'Pedigree Dolls' in yellow on the left, and the text 'they're as good as gold' in white arching over her head. The back cover is blue and white, and lists the directors of Lines Bros. Ltd., as well as the addresses of Tri-ang Works and home and overseas Lines Bros. showrooms. The font cover folds out, with details of Talkative Jane and Tiny Talker on one side, and information on the new range of Pedigree Dolls on the reverse.",
