The great cost of these trimmings meant that they were often specified in inventory descriptions of furniture.\n\nSince the purpose of the trimmings was to enhance the visual effect of furniture and hangings, they were usually made in eye-catching materials, gold and silver thread or brightly-coloured silks. Contrasts in pattern and texture were achieved by building up layers, often in quite complex three-dimensional forms. Sometimes the trimmings were imported from France and Italy, but they were also made in London.\n\nThis fragment of braid came from the state bed at Clandon Park, in Surrey, probably made for Sir Richard Onslow in about 1710.",
