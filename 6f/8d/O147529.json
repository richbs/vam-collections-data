The medallions and their pairs of pendants share a dark blue ground and an outlining, in the lower medallion of dark red, blue, light red, green, and in the upper, of green, red, blue, dark red.  Each medallion has at its centre a blue flower outlined in yellow, the double cross on which it lies becomes the stems of leaves of four stylised floral sprigs with, at the cardinal points, a red blossom.\n\nIn the top and larger medallino these are red, outlined in dark red as is the flowerhead in each pendant; in the lower, each blossom is dark red with a contrasting centre, its top pendant repeating the pendant above and the bottom one containing a bar with two buds.  Other flowerheads fill the medallions.\n\nThe field has a profusion of dark red and red flowerheads often supporting or being supported by small, diamond-headed sprigs.  There are seven birds - five are blue and two are green - with red or purple wings, together with ofour pairs of small, stylised animals; elsewhere are botehs and rosettes.\n\nThe field has a triple guard stripe forming an undulating border that tapers inwards at top and bottom , creating four triangular spandrels.\n\nSpandrels: dark blue ground with diagonal lattice in white, each compartment at the upper end containing  small red or dark red stylised floral sprigs in the shape of a cross, this motif partly repeated in the smaller areas of the lower two spandrels.\n\nBorders: main border: dark blue ground lies between the undulating guard stripes (see above) and outer border.  In the recesses formed by the former are white vertical lines from which spring horizontal dark red stems with blue, red and green buds to fill the irregular spaces.\n\nOuter border: along both sides and across the top of the field and the two upper spandrels is a dark blue ground barred horizontally with white.  Along the bottom there is evidence of a yellow ground border with multi-coloured motifs.",
