The lip was sometimes formed  as a mask, as in this example,  or the jug could have a plain cylindrical neck. \n\nPlace\nThe jugs were first made at the Worcester porcelain factory, and then at Lowestoft (Suffolk), Caughley and several of the Liverpool factories. The design was also copied in Chinese porcelain for export to the West.\n\nPeople\nRobert Chamberlain (1736-1798) had been apprenticed to learn 'pot painting' at the Worcester porcelain factory and  in due course was put in charge of the 'ornamental part of the production.' Around 1786 he left the factory and started his own business in Worcester. At first he ran this as an enamelling studio, working as a subcontractor for Caughley, but he also bought Caughley wares and decorated them for resale on his own account. \n\nThe bird painting here is probably by George Davis, who also prepared some of the enamel colours used by the factory and ground the gold for the gilding.",
