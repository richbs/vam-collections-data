This was quite necessary as the innovations made by Voltaire had been forgotten and bombast had returned to the French stage.  His Othello, Hamlet, Neron and Oedipe were particularly admired.  His later friendship and admiration for Napoleon did not prevent his continued fondness for England where he had spent his early youth and to which he returned in the second decade of the 19th century to be present ar the dinner in honour of John Philip Kemble's farewell to the stage.\n\nThe ink stand was subsequently owned by the great English actor Sir Donald Wolfit (1902-1968) who used it when playing Jonathan Swift in The Solitary Loverat the Winter Garden Theatre in 1948.",
