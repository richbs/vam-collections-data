He was billed as \u2018the Original Immobile Comedian\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nOne of Mayo\u2019s songs was \u2018I Never Stopped Running Till I Got Home\u2019. When he was at Hanley in May 1905 the theatre held a competition to find the person who could most accurately imitate him.\n\nMusic hall performers liked to cultivate specialities. Like his contemporary, Alf Gibson, Mayo specialised in standing still on stage, often with his hands between his knees. He also sang songs at a piano wearing an old dressing gown, a motoring cap, a yellow wig and a lugubrious expression.\n\nBorn Sam Cowan in Waterloo Road, Lambeth, London, in 1881, Mayo made his first music hall appearance at the Alhambra, Sandgate, in 1898. Later he toured in his own revues. He wrote songs for himself and others, and regularly appeared in pantomime. Mayo claimed to hold the record for the number of nightly music hall appearances, when for four weeks he was on the bill of 12 London halls every evening. In the days of horse-drawn transport, this meant rushing from hall to hall by hansom cab in time for his \u2018spot\u2019 on the next programme. He died in 1938.",

Mayo was known as 'the Immobile One' and who often wore a dressing gown in his act. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke. It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.\n\nThe reviewer in <i>The Staffordshire Sentinel</i> noted that Mayo had often appeared at the Grand and that during the week in May there would be a competition for any member of the audience who could sing his song 'I Never Stopped Running till I Got Home' in the best imitation of him. The prize was a silver cup; the semi-final was held at the first house on Friday night, with the final at the second house.",
