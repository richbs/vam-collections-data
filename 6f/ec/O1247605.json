The fabric has a white and navy blue ground with flowers in light and navy blue and leaves in beige and yellow. The bodice of the dress has a shaped bust with a band in the centre to gather the pleats - it resembles a bikini top. The halter neck straps are 3cms wide and, along with the bodice section of the dress, are double thickness. The dress flares out under the bust line into a A-line shape skirt. There are no fastenings on the dress but the back has a low back line which is gathered by the use of a wide piece of elastic in the hem allowing  it to be easily stretched to get on and off a child.",
