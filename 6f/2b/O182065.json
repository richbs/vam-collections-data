It is decorated with the coat of arms of an English family, the Skinner, and is part of a service made for one of three brothers: Richard, a London merchant, Matthew, Chief Justice of Chester, or Samuel, an East Indiaman captain killed by pirates in 1731 off the coast of India. \n\nDuring the 18th century the fashion for Chinese porcelain, then available at affordable costs, was at its heighest in Europe. In addition to traditional shapes and designs, European customers also ordered tableware and household objects made in imitation of western items or with specific decorative motifs, including coat of arms, monograms and inscriptions. The East India trading companies supplied models and patterns to be copied to the Chinese potters.",
