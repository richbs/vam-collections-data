The earliest pieces were designed for the domestic market. Production increased from 1650 onwards, with a large part of the industry being directed towards the making of pots for export to Europe. The use of a central scene surrounded by a panelled design is common among blue-and-white porcelain imported into Europe from both China and Japan. The centre of this particular dish bears the coats of arms of Francois de Vinq and Aletta Pancras, who were married in 1667.",
