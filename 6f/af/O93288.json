It represents Queen Maya's dream of the white elephant and the legendary conception of the Buddha.  Maya, wearing a long garment with her head and upper body turned away from the viewer, lies against a couple of cushions on a draped couch set  between two columns supporting a chequered roof or balustrade above her.  Above her knee a white elephant appears within a nimbus, its trunk stretched out towards her.  At either side of her in two arches which spring from the pillars stand two attendants in a flexed pose with inner arms pointing across the pillars towards the queen.  Remnants of rectangular panels enclosing pillars and capitals terminate the scene on either side.  A decorative moulding of a bifurcated leaf or petal runs along the top of the relief.",
