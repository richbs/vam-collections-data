The earliest sockets were polygonal in cross-section; by the 15th century they were round. At first, two vertical apertures were cut into the socket to facilitate the extraction of the burnt-out stub. Over time these became smaller and by the 15th century they tended to be horizontally cut. \n\nThe form of the stem and base of candlesticks at this time is the result of a complicated interplay between two typological currents. The first type naturally evolved from the simple European pricket candlestick, where the shaft is supported on three legs. The second type originated in the Near East and had a high cylindrical or slightly conical base surmounted by a flat circular wax pan and a short circular stem. \n\nBroadly speaking the development of the base can be attributed to Near Eastern influence, while the stem, which gradually became longer, with an increasingly complicated range of knops and balusters, is largely European in origin.",

Before this period, candlesticks often had prickets to secure the candle. Candlesticks were very much part of home life. They were often made of robust materials such as bronze and brass. This candlestick reflects the fashion for simple shapes from late medieval Germany and Flanders. The height of the candle socket may have been intended to shed more light over the desk or ledge where it stood. The base of the candlestick seems to be well shaped for carrying, suggesting that candlesticks like this example did not stay in one room but were moved about the medieval house.",

Dinant is situated on the River Meuse, Belgium, and was an area with an international reputation for the quality of its metalware. Dinanderie is used to describe later medieval objects (pre-1466), cast in copper-alloy (high zinc and lead-level and low tin-level). This term is used for functional and decorative metalwork, for example: hanging lavers, candlesticks and chafing dishes.\n\nThe Flemish origin of this candlestick is confirmed by the style: a very simple shape with flattened knops. Similar candlesticks can be found in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (K.O.G. 995)",
