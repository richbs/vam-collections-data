The briar rose has a circular centre with six lobe-like petals which extend over an outer ring of twisted bands with small leaves at intervals. There is another smaller exotic flower head with pointed petals to the left of the large flower head. On the left of the base of the main stem springs another flower head in profile on a stem with three coiling leaves below the flower head.",

When put together the panels show a design of magpies with foliage, echoing the name of the house. The architect and designer, C.R. Ashbee designed and built this house on Chelsea Embankment in 1893-4 for himself, his mother and his sisters. The leather was modelled by Bill Hardiman, a member of the Guild of Handicraft, founded in Mile End, London by Ashbee in 1888. Members of the Guild lived and worked together on metalwork, jewellery, furniture and books. Hardiman, who joined the Guild in 1890 and left in 1906, became the chief modeller for metalwork but also worked on leather panels for upholstery and for wall coverings.",

Ashbee, who founded the Guild, designed and built this house on Chelsea Embankment for himself, his mother and sisters, in 1893-4. The panels were stitched together to cover the back wall of the hall, against which the first flight of the staircase was placed, and the complete design shows magpies with foliage and flower heads.\n\nIn 1966 the Museum was given the opportunity to remove the leather panels from the house before it was demolished.",
