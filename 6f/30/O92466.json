The ports of China were thriving places and the labourers who found work in there loading and unloading the cargo ships were known as 'coolies'.  The word derived from 'k'uli' meaning bitter strength.\n\nThis early-20th century mechanical toy shows two coolies carrying a teachest. The clockwork mechanism, which no longer functions, is contained inside the chest and would have operated the two wheels beneath it and the two rods which extend from the top edge of the chest. The coolies' hands are attached to the other ends of the rods. These rods are also connected to the upper legs of the two men. When working the men would have walked bearing their load. The figures are wearing white jackets, red trousers, white socks and black caps and shoes. The chest has the trademark, Lehmann, a sunburst and the names of the ports Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tientsin, Peking, Nanking and Canton.",
