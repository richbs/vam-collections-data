The two young people (aged 14 and 16) were given medals for being \"daring aerial artistes. Their feats are quite original and artistic and receive general appreciation\" . They performed at the Prince of Wales Baths, Blackpool in August 1895. The medals were presented on the last day of their engagement by the manager of the Baths, W.H. Broadhead. The family name was Munday but Fitzroy, Fred's middle name became his professional name.  His sister used the name Miss Adeline Patty. Her family name was Adeline Martha Munday. \n\n The V&A was given a small collection of medals awarded to Fred Fitzroy and a photograph of him aged about 12 is in the Theatre Museum. The medal itself was mass produced by a manufacturer in Birmingham and then probably commissioned from a local jeweller in Blackpool. It was specially engraved to present to Fred (and presumably an identical medal for his sister) in recognition of outstanding performances.",
