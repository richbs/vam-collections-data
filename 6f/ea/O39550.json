It was a gift from Ghazi-ud-din Haidar, Nawab and King of Oudh (ruled 1814 to 1827), to Lord Amherst, Governor-General of India. He probably gave it to him during Amherst's visit to Lucknow in 1827.  The Scottish artist Robert Home almost certainly designed this chair. He was court painter at Lucknow, where he devised regalia as well as royal carriages, howdahs, barges and palace furnishings.  These followed European fashions but, like this chair, they often carried the twin-fish badge of the rulers of Lucknow.",
