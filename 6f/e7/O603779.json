            "bibliography": "On December 16, 1799, Sir Walter Scott became Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire. This was a seasonal post, requiring his presence from mid-July to mid-November and permitting him to spend the rest of the year in Edinburgh. There was, however, a rarely enforced law of residence stipulating that the Sheriff Depute live in Selkirkshire for four months of the year. Initially Scott based himself at an inn in Clovenfords for the duration of the circuit. Eventually, though, he felt that it would be politic to find a family house in Selkirkshire. Accordingly, in 1804, he gave up Lasswade and leased the property of Ashestiel, six miles from Selkirk on the south bank of the Tweed. Ashestiel (sometimes written Ashiestiel) had belonged to Scott's uncle William Russell, whose heir now lived in India. It had originally been an old Border tower, part of which is still enclosed in the centre of the house. Scott's aunt Mrs Russell (his mother's sister) had added a west wing, turning it into an unusual three-cornered building. Built for defence, it was protected to the north by the Tweed and to the east by a deep ravine. It was here that Scott wrote the works that would bring him poetic fame, <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel, Marmion</i>, and <i>The Lady of the Lake. </i>Ashestiel itself is immortalized in the epistles to friends which preface each of the six cantos of <i>Marmion</i>, where Scott describes the effects of the changing seasons upon its scenery. Ashestiel also saw Scott begin the next phase of his literary career with the first abortive draft of Waverley in 1805. The lease at Ashestiel ran out in May 1811 and Scott moved to a farm, Cartley Hole, which he renamed Abbotsford.",
