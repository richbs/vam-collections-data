The demographic tensions inherent in a society bound to dynastic success yet afflicted by decades of plague epidemics resulted in a ritual of childbirth that was intended to affirm, comfort and encourage. As the production of maiolica flourished in Italy during the sixteenth century, ceramic wares, painted with birth-related images, became integral parts of the material culture necessary to this ritual. The images on these ceramic vessels were often concealed on the underside of lids or within bowls; to be seen only by the mother and those most intimately connected with the event.\nThis broth bowl and trencher (a flat plate used to cover a bowl) likely formed part of a more extensive birth set, or scodella da impagliata. As well as commemorating the birth of a child, these bowls were customarily filled with broth and other such nourishing foods, specially prepared for a new mother during her confinement.",

The demographic tensions inherent in a society bound to dynastic success yet afflicted by decades of plague epidemics resulted in a ritual of childbirth that was intended to affirm, comfort and encourage. As the production of maiolica flourished in Italy during the sixteenth century, ceramic wares, painted with birth-related images, became integral parts of the material culture necessary to this ritual. The images on these ceramic vessels were often concealed on the underside of lids or within bowls; to be seen only by the mother and those most intimately connected with the event.",
