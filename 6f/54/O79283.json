They always have pin fastenings, often concealed by a decorative plaque.  They were originally worn in pairs, one on each wrist, and in some places were regarded as the mark of a married woman.  They were worn by Christian and Jewish women, as well as Muslims.\n\nJewellery made of nets of interlocking filigree rosettes, including necklaces and triangular brooches as well as bracelets, became immensely popular with tourists in the 19th century, and is still being made in the region today.",
