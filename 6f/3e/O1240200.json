He had designed for the stage in Australia but it was in Britain that his theatrical career developed. His spectacular sets and costumes for Michael Benthall's 1951 production of The Tempest at Stratford-upon-Avon established him as a leading designer. Sainthill's work encompassed opera, notably Rimsky-Korsakov's Le Coq d'Or at Covent Garden in 1954, Shakespeare, pantomimes, musicals and revues, and although he became associated with a flamboyant and opulent fantastical style of design, he could also create an everyday reality, as demonstrated by his interiors for the film version of John Osborne's play, Look Back in Anger.\n\nSainthill designed the costumes and setting for Othello,which was directed by Tony Richardson. It was the final stage performance of the actor and singer Paul Robeson (1898-1976), who had previously played Othello in London in 1930 and on Broadway in 1943.",
