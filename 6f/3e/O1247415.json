It represents the installation process, during which large sculptures are carted into the space while a crowd looks on. The 1855 Exposition Internationale set out to rival the Great Exhibition of 1851 held in London's Hyde Park, and attracted 5,162,330 visitors. It was the first of five World Fairs held in Paris in the 19th century. \n\nEyre Crowe (1824-1910) spent his early  years in Paris, and in 1839 entered the studio of the history painter Paul Delaroche. He later settled  in London and registered at the Royal Academy Schools. He became secretary to his cousin, the novelist William  Makepeace Thackeray,  and accompanied him on a lecture tour of  America in 1852 as his \u2018factotum and amanuensis\u2019. After his return  to England, Crowe built a successful career as a painter of genre  and historical subjects. He exhibited annually at the Royal Academy from 1857 to 1908,  but never attained the rank of Academician. He was an honorary  member of the 'St John\u2019s Wood Clique', a group of artists who specialised in historical genre painting.\n\nFrom 1859 Crowe acted as occasional examiner and inspector of  the Government Schools of Art, based in the Victoria and Albert Museum (then called the South Kensington Museum). He designed two mosaics for the museum's gallery of portraits known as the \u2018Kensington Valhalla\u2019 (William Hogarth and Sir Christopher Wren), and in 1868 he painted one of the lunette paintings in room 101 of the V&amp;A showing scenes relating to art education, Modelling from Life.",
