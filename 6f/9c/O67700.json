Within a short space of time there were approximately 400 coffee houses in London alone. The coffee pot came in many shapes, styles and sizes, and the pear shaped type came into fashion in about 1740. In time, the body became more waisted and by 1760, the so called \u2018dropped bottom\u2019, as seen here, appears, thus increasing the capacity of the vessel considerably. This example is chased and embossed with a rococo cartouche, flowers and leaves. The lid is decorated with a wreath and finished with a cone shaped knob.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
