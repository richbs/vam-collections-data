Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, or gilded metal, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring was acquired in southern Italy, but the design is not distinctive.  Although it is marked on the wire, it is probably made of gilded metal, not gold.  Marks like this are more typical of French goldsmiths, rather than Italian.  It may have been imported from France, or possibly made in Italy when the country was under French administration at the beginning of the 19th century. \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
