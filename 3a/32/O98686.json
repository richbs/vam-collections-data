His photographs epitomised the playful, graphically dynamic style of commercial photography practised in London during the period. In 1962 he met the model Jill Kennington, sparking an exciting period of high-octane image-making for numerous magazines and newspapers. \n\nThis image comes from a series taken for Queen magazine in which Kennington poses against a backdrop of historical sculpture, in this case the Temple Bar Memorial with its bronze griffin bearing the motto of the City of London, \u2018Domine dirige nos\u2019 (Lord guide us). Her defiant stance seems to challenge the traditional, establishment attitudes that can be seen in much public sculpture, reflecting other social upheavals during the decade.",

This exhibition was more recently toured by Fondacion La Caixa around regional venues in Spain. Key images from Cowan's oeuvre shown in the exhibition were selected by Charlotte Cotton for the national collection and given to the V&A by Cowan's estate holders. These will boost our holdings of fashion photography and act as a record of his successful exhibition and tour.\n\n'Monumental Ideas about Dressing', five fashion studies from a series for <i>Queen</i>, published 4th December 1962.",
