He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\u2019s film version of Romeo and Juliet was the most expensive production in the studio\u2019s history up until 1936. Messel had spent four months in Italy researching for the film and during his trip, he took 2,769 photographs of villas, piazzas, balconies, frescos and paintings. The paintings of Bellini, Carpaccio, Botticelli and Pietro Della Francesca were studied for inspiration for costumes and sets.Romeo and Juliet was nominated for four Academy Awards including Set Design and Best Picture.\n\nIn this photograph, Messel is designing costumes for Norma Shearer, who played Juliet in the film. Norma Shearer\u2019s costumes for the film required over one hundred yards of fabric, which were finished with hand embroidery and the application of thousands of beads and pearls.",
