When this chair was added to the collection of children's furniture at the Bethnal Green branch, little information was available about children's chairs, particularly nineteenth-century styles.  Although the Keeper was an expert in the decorative arts, he had evidently not seen a chair like it before, and felt sure that the panels of carpeting must be replacements. The donor was to ask her father, its first owner, what the original upholstery had been like.  But panels of carpeting are absolutely characteristic for this type of chair, which probably originated in America,  and sure enough the donor's father replied that as far as he knew \"the rocking chair had never been covered other than with a carpet-like material\".",
