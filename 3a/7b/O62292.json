The mutoscope is made up of about 680 photographic prints mounted on a wheel made to revolve by turning a handle. A small catch in the casing holds each photograph in full view until it is pushed forward by the force of those compressed behind it.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe event captured in the mutoscope shows Queen Victoria (facing the camera), and other dignitaries, drawing up in a carriage outside this Museum, and a female student of the Royal College of Art presenting the Queen with a bouquet of flowers. The carriage then moves away from the stand. This marked the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone in 1899 for the extensive new building work.",
