For the pioneer Art Potters of France, the impact of Japanese ceramics was profound, prompting a rougher aesthetic. Fascination with the high-temperature glazes of Chinese court porcelains meanwhile led to obsessive experimentation. \n\nA former professor of chemistry, Bigot became interested in Chinese ceramics at the Paris 1889 exhibition and, like many of his contemporaries sought to recreate the high-temperature copper-red flamm\u00e9e glazes of 18th century Chinese porcelain.",
