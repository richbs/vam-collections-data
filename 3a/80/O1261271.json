            "public_access_description": "Designer Hella Jongerius (1963) is one of the most celebrated and imaginative designers of the last twenty years. Her work is represented in all the major international collections of contemporary design.\n\nJongerius studied industrial design at the Eindhoven Design Academy and has since combined elements of that discipline with those of traditional craftsmanship in products, textiles and ceramics. Many of her early designs were manufactured by Droog, the influential Dutch design collective, and she subsequently put much of her own work into production through Jongeriuslab, her Rotterdam studio which moved in 2007 to Berlin, Germany. Her designs are also produced by manufacturers such as Maharam, Royal Tichelaar Makkum, Nymphenburg and Vitra.\n\nIn 2009 we acquired Table service B-set by Hella Jongerius, which is on display in the new ceramics galleries (Room 142). This set, designed in 1998-1999 consists of 7 different parts including a decanter-bottle. Hella Jongerius has consciously created irregularities in this dinner service that deviate from the 'ideal' form. Slight deviations in the shape of each individual piece lend the seven-part service its character.\n\nIn 2001 Jongerius used the decanter bottle of this set to create a new design for the exhibition 'Delft in Detail' in the Hague Municipal Museum. She altered the function of this object by strapping on bronze handle with nylon cable ties. The 'Delft Blue B jug' has since become a design classic. \nOver the last 10 years or so, various artist have incorporated notions of alteration, re-cycling and repair in their works and the 'Delft Blue B jug' by Hella Jongerius is one of the earliest and best examples of this practice.",
