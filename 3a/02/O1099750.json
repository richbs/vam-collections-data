(1) Ginsburg considered the coiffure and head-dress closely comparable to that in Cat. No. 146, and compared the scarf to that in the portrait of Mme de Maintenon (see entry for Cat. No. 141). She added the thought that the present miniature was 'marginally earlier' than either Cat. Nos 141 or 146. \n\nThe sitter was Anne Gibson, younger surviving daughter of Richard Gibson (q.v.), by his wife Anne Sheppard. She spells her name with a final <i>e</i>, rather than <i>a</i>, in her signature witnessing the death of her father and the finding of his will in July 1690. The inscription on the back of the miniature refers to her by her married name. \n\nThe story of her marriage, summarised from a deposition of 24 September 1681, made by Richard Gibson to the Hof van Holland, was published by A Bredius. (2) \n\nAs an unmarried daughter, Anne accompanied her parents when they went to Holland in the suite of Princess Mary in 1677. The family lodged initially in Amsterdam, at the house of Johan Nieulant, a silversmith in the Singel. Shortly after, when the Gibson parents had to return to England on business, Nieulant and his housekeeper were placed in charge of Anne, and they allowed her to receive visits from a young man, Marinus Dibbouts van Vrijbergen, the son of Bonifacius van Vrijbergen, a Deputy in the States General. Although Marinus was still legally a minor, he appears to have been a councillor in the Sovereign Council of Brabant. His visits to Anne Gibson were received on the basis that he would, in due course, obtain the approval of her father to seek her hand in marriage. For reasons that are not clear, however, Anne consented to a private marriage on 14 November 1679, in the presence of 'a Romish priest named Lodovicus Hachoanus de Bruij, a missionary of English Nationality here at the Hague, with a promise to celebrate the marriage publicly at the first opportunity'. The couple then lived together. Anne in due course became pregnant, and with the approval of her husband set off in October 1680 for England in order to give birth. In England she stayed with her mother and brother, her father having meanwhile returned to The Hague. She received numerous affectionate letters from her husband, which included affectionate messages from her 'dear little father'. The child was born in 1681, a daughter who was named Elizabeth after Marinus's mother. But meanwhile Richard Gibson discovered that Marinus had formed an affection for another woman, in whose favour he wished to repudiate his marriage to Anne. In September 1681, therefore, Richard sued the van Vrijbergens in the Dutch courts, requiring that Marinus should make good his promise to marry Anne publicly in a church. The Gibsons won, but, as part of the arrangement, Anne signed a deed promising not to compel Marinus to co-habit with her. Thereafter, Anne lived with her parents, evidently returned with them to England in 1688, took up residence in Henrietta Street with Susannah-Penelope and Michael Rosse, and witnessed with them and two of her brothers the finding of her father's will in 1690. \n\n1 Minute of December 1974, departmental files. \n2 Bredius 1910.\u201d\n",
