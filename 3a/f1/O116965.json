            "public_access_description": "Antonio de Saliba (?1466/7 -?1535) nephew of the famous Antonello da Messina (c. 1430-1479), worked primarily in Sicily. Stylistic evidence and the presence of works associated with him in and around Venice suggest however that he also spent some time in the north of Italy. His paintings flaunt their debt to his uncle's style and also incorporate elements introduced by Giovanni Bellini, Cima da Conegliano and Bartolommeo Montagna. Antonio produced numerous paintings for provincial churches, and the majority consist of modernized reworkings of Antonello's prototypes.\n\nPainted Crucifix' such as this were commonly either placed behind the altar or suspended from the chancel arch. The iconography of the Crucifix was dominated by theological expressions of the incarnation and resurrection. \nOn the terminals of 323-1895, Mary and St John each convey a different reaction to and express their grief at Christ's Crucifixion. They are exectued in a style close to that of Antonello. At the top of the crucifix, a pelican pecks at her breast to feed her young with her own blood; a symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on the cross whose body and blood similarly nourishes the celebrant during Mass.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 10-11, no. 8\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nANTONIO de Saliba (?1467-1535) \nSicilian School \nBorn probably in 1467, he is documented from January 1480, when he worked with Jacobello, son of Antonello da Messina, until May 1535. \n\nLit. S. Bottari, <i>La pittura del quattrocento in Sicilia</i>, 1954, p. 88, pls. 133-43. \n\nAscribed to ANTONIO de Saliba\n\n8 \nPAINTED CRUCIFIX \n<i>In the terminals: top:</i>THE PELICAN IN HER PIETY \n                      <i>sides:</i>MARY AND ST JOHN \nTempera on poplar panel  \n85 \u00bd x 60 \u00be (217 x 154) \nIn a carved openwork frame, which appears to be a later addition \n323-1895\n\nTraditionally said to have formed the rood of the parish church of Hever, Kent, this crucifix has usually been considered Italian 14th century. Recently, however, it has been firmly placed in Sicily, late 15th century (by Everett Fahy, oral opinion), and Professor V. Scuderi of Palermo has tentatively attributed it to Antonio de Saliba. \nThe figures of Mary and St John betray the influence of Antonello da Messina (active 1456-79), but otherwise this work adheres closely to the most usual type of 14th century Italian crucifixes, in which the body of Christ lies straight against the cross bent only slightly at the knee, with a single nail piercing both feet. The 'Pelican in her piety' pecks her breast and causes the blood to flow in order to feed her famished young. This legend is found in early medieval Bestiaries, where it is paralleled by the sacrifice of Christ's blood to save the parched soul of mankind. Originally derived from a passage in the Psalms (Psalm 102, 7), this comparison was well known to medieval commentators and consequently the pelican is quite often depicted from the 13th century as a symbol of the Crucifixion. \n\nCondition. Badly rubbed on the left side of the body especially on the loin cloth, also on the face. Cleaned in 1968. \nProv. According to tradition (unsupported by documentary evidence), from Hever Church, Kent, where it is said to have formed the rood. Bought in 1895. \nExh.

Stylistic evidence and the presence of works associated with him in and around Venice suggest however that he also spent some time in the north of Italy. In addition to using the same name, Antonio often closely imitated the paintings of his uncle, consequently the artist have often been confused with each other, a situation perhaps intentionally encouraged by de Saliba who used various forms of his uncle's signature on his works. His paintings flaunt their debt to Antonellos' style and also incorporate elements by Giovanni Bellini.  A number of Antonio's documented Sicilian commissions are lost, but the Virgin and Child Enthroned (1497; Catania, Mus. Civ. Castello Ursino) characterizes his style with its references to Antonello's Virgins, as well as to the works of Bellini, Cima da Conegliano and Bartolommeo Montagna. Antonio produced numerous paintings for provincial churches, and the majority consist of modernized reworkings of Antonello's prototypes.\n\nOn the terminals, Mary and St John each express their grief at Christ's Crucifixion and are exectued in a style close to that of Antonello. At the top of the crucifix, a pelican pecks at her breast to feed her young with her own blood; a symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on the cross whose body and blood similarly nourishes the celebrant during Mass.\nThe carved openwork frame appears to be a later addition",

            "historical_context_note": "A painted Crucifix is a painted wooden panel in the form of a cross, with a central figure of the crucified Christ. Other figures or scenes are sometimes also included on the apron (on either side of Christ\u2019s lower body) and on the terminals (rectangular extensions of the cross arms). Painted Crucifixes were commonly either placed behind the altar or suspended from the chancel arch. The double-sided construction of some suggests that they may also have been carried in liturgical processions. \nPainted crosses became popular in Italy by the 12th century.  The earliest surviving Tuscan painted crucifix' represent Christ as<i>Christus Triumphans,</i> or the \u201cTriumphant Christ\u201d with his head up and eyes open.  This form was supplanted in the 13th century with the <i>Christus Patiens,</i> or \u201cSuffering Christ\u201d type who is shown often with his head fallen on his shoulder and his eyes closed.  The iconography of the suffering Christ appears to have developed out of a new interest in Christ\u2019s human nature, the development of the feast of Corpus Christi and with increased importance given to the Eucharist.",
