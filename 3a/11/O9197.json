It would have used in an Ottoman palace, set before guests who sat on a low bench, or divan, built against the walls.\n\nMany large polygonal tiles survive from the Ottoman period, but this example is one of the very few that still serves its original purpose as a table top. It was made in Iznik, north-west Anatolia, which was known as a centre of ceramic production.",
