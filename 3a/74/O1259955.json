Fry felt that decorative objects could be used to train the eye to appreciate these characteristics. \n\nThe Omega Workshops were based in Bloomsbury. Their premises at Fitzroy Square included both public showrooms and studios. Under the umbrella of the Omega Workshops, numerous artists produced a wide range of objects for the home, including painted furniture and furnishing textiles. Affiliates of the Workshop were salaried, but were expected to spend only 3 days a week in the group studio and to devote the rest of their time to fine art projects. A number of leading British modernists produced work for the Omega Workshops, including Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant and Wyndham Lewis. All of the Workshops' output was anonymously, with artists sometimes using the omega symbol as a signature.  \n\nThis lampstand, one of six painted lampstands in the V&A's collection, displays the Workshop's preoccupation with form and colour. It also shows an interest in the geometric shapes and stylised decoration found in the painted vernacular tradition.",
