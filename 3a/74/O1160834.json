Dewhurst was a circus clown who was also an accomplished 'leaper', which was an attraction of ground acrobats in the early 19th century, and a popular amateur sport in the north of England. Dewhurst in described on this poster as 'the loftiest leaper living', and on other contemporary publicity was fancifully described as being able to leap over a garter 14 foot high, over ten horses, and through six balloons.\n\nThis poster is printed in large and very small typeface, to appear to give the shocking news that Richard Dewhurst had been apprehended for setting fire to the Tower of London. Those who examined the poster at very close range could read that it was in fact advertising Dewhurst's Benefit performance, and he was only moving near the Tower of London. Since Dewhurst would have received a percentage of the box office takings that night, it was in his interest to produce eye-catching publicity such as this.",
