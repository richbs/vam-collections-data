The artist grew up in Pakistan in the 1970s during President Zia's oppressive rule and her work like many of that generation explores the placement of women in that society. Her female figures are depicted as headless torsos to highlight the imposed perception of women in Pakistan and their non-recognition as individuals. The circle is a recurring symbol in her work which she uses as a means of conveying the constrained lives of human beings. Circles also indicate the hallowed space of various rituals as well as the sun and moon. \n\nThis print consists of a circle and a square. On the left hand side there are several headless female figures flowing with arms out-stretched from the top of the circle to the bottom of the square. From the bottom right hand side of the print a fluid mass enters the circle. In the top left hand corner is a much smaller circle with a stylised lotus.",
