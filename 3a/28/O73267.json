The address on the cigarette case probably refers to his home residence (now the site of the Stafford Hotel). Later references to him and his family in <u>The Times</u> record that he lived in Chelsea and Bayswater. His Dutch wife, Suze, had learned piano with Arthur Rubenstein, and between the wars their house in Palace Court, Bayswater was a favourite meeting-place for the great figures in the world of music (<u>Times</u>, 1961). L\u00e9on Rueff died 'suddenly', aged 80, on 18th September, 1942; his son, Marcus, had been killed in action in North Africa the previous year on April 7th or 8th, 1941 (<u>Times</u>, 1942).\nLise Ruess (Mrs Herbert Seligmann: see <u>New York Times</u>, 1984) gave the cigarette case to the Museum in 1997 'in remembrance of my aunt and uncle Suze and L\u00e9on Rueff whose only son died an Officer of the Hamlet Rifles in Libya in 1941' (letter dated 13.11.1997, R.F. 1997/1184). Mrs Seligmann's gift also comprised an evening bag and a manicure case (Museum nos T.112 and 113-1998).\nAlbert Barker was a London-based silversmith and retailer who in 1887 is recorded as 'a manufacturer, inventor and patentee of travelling dressing bags, gold and silver work, gem jewellery, writing cases, electroplated goods, dressing cases, art stationery, fine cutlery, fancy goods of finest English and foreign manufacture'. In 1892 he held a special warrant of appointment to the Prince and Princess of Wales. At the time the cigarette case was made, his retail business was established in 5 New Bond Street. Barker continued to trade until around 1915, when the business passed to successors Baxter and Shuttleworth. See Culme (1987), p.27.\n\nHistorical significance: An alternative to pipe- and cigar-smoking, cigarettes appeared at the end of the nineteenth century and retailers were swift to produce a range of accessories tailored especially for them. As the dimensions of this case show, cigarettes at the turn of the century were smaller than the king-size ones of today. Rueff's cigarette case, designed as a stamped addressed envelope, may have formed a set with a match safe --- a case for matches often made to resemble miniature visiting cards or envelopes during this period (Helliwell, 1988, pp.139-42).",
