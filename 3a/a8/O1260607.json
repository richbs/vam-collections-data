It is broken along the two vertical rows of diagonal peg holes. The saggar must have been for firing very small objects, as the space in between the pegs is about 4 cm which would correspond to the maximum height of the object and its inside diameter would have been less than 7cm. The taller side of the saggar fragment shows parts of five peg holes, the lower side four. The inside of the saggar is unevenly covered with splashes of colourless and/or opaque whitish lead-glaze.",

            "public_access_description": "Saggars are fire-clay containers used for stacking and protecting pottery during firing. Saggars are usually cylindrical and have three or two evenly spaced rows of triangular holes in their sides. Each hole could be fitted with a peg, triangular in section, and usually three pegs supported a piece of pottery to be fired. Once filled the saggars could be stacked, one on top of another, in the furnace for the glaze firing. Apart from its ease of stacking,the benefit of firing in a saggar was that they protected the pieces inside from kiln debris. Therefore, the pots could be placed in the saggars on their base rather that up-side-down. When the glaze stuck to the pegs, it would have left only small scars on the back-side of the pot and not on the front as with firing on spurs.\nThis saggar would have had an inside diameter of no ore than seven centimetres and would have been used to fire very small objects such as small pots, cups, saucers or lids. Unusually, and because of its small diameter, it would have had only two rows of peg-holes. This means that the objects inside had to balance on two pegs only and must have been supported in some other way too. \nFragments of such saggars were found in their hundreds at the site of a former canal which backed onto the premises of some of the Delft potteries.",
