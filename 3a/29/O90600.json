Tea urns were an essential part of the tea service. They kept the water warm so that the hostess could replenish the tea kettle and refresh the tea leaves. The hot water was drawn off by using the tap at the front of the urn. \n\nThis example is in copper, with an openwork base with floral decoration. The body is removable, allowing charcoal to be loaded into a brazier that fits within the bottom of the urn. A long funnel extends from this brazier, through the urn, to expel smoke at the top. The finial on the top forms the handle of a pair of tongs for picking up charcoal.",
