Diameter 26 cm \nVAM 2404 \n \n\u2018Vasari states in his life of Franco that Franco \nmade \"infiniti disegni\" for the Duke of  \nUrbino\u2019s majolica factory at Castel Durante, \nincluding designs for a service presented to \nCharles V and another given to Cardinal \nFarnese, brother-in-law of Duke Guidobaldo \nII.

Mallet, \u2018Battista Franco as a designer for \nMajolica\u2019 in <i>The Burlington Magazine</i>, 118, \n1976, p. 404] have partially reconstructed for  \ndrawings and surviving pieces of majolica a  \n<i>History of Troy</i> service with which our \ndrawing is probably connected. No dish corre- \nsponding with the central design has been  \nfound, but the rim was used to decorate a dish \nformerly in the Richard Zschille collection \n(Clifford and Mallet, p. 407, no. 15, fig. 71). \nClifford and Mallet identify the old man in \nour drawing as King Priam and the kneeling \nwarrior as Hector taking leave before fighting \nAchilles, or Paris asking permission to marry \nHelen.\u2019 \n(PWJ I 141)\"",

Clifford and Mallet have partially reconstructed from drawings and surviving pieces of majolica a 'History of Troy' service with which this drawing is probably connected. No dish corresponding with the central design has been found, but the rim was used to decorate a dish formerly in the Richard Zschille collection (Clifford and Mallet, p.407, no.15, fig. 71). Clifford and Mallet identify the old man as King Priam and the kneeling warrior as Hector taking leave before fighting Achilles, or Paris asking permission to marry Helen.' \nExtract from Peter Ward Jackson, Italian Drawings, vol. 1, 4th to 16th century, 1979.\n\nHistorical significance: Franco's drawings remained in use in local maiolica workshops in Castel Durante and Urbino. The fact that no dish corresponding with the central design has been found, but the rim was used to decorate a dish formerly in the Richard Zschille collection may indicate that the maiolica painters used the designs in a flexible manner.",

Thinking Franco\u2019s skills were better suited to working on a small scale, the Duke commissioned him to make designs for maiolica produced at Casteldurante; a typical example is a plate with Moses Striking the Rock (V&A).\nVasari says that Guidobaldo 'thought his drawings, when carried out by those who made excellent earthenware vessels at Castel Durante and who had much used Raphael of Urbino's engravings and those of other able men, would be very effective. So he made Battista do a large number of drawings which when executed in that, the finest earthenware in all Italy, turned out marvellously well. Such great quantities of these vessels were therefore made and of so many kinds that they would have sufficed for and don ehonour to a royal service, and the painting on them would not have been better had they been done in oils by the finest artists...Duke Guidobaldo sent a double service of this ware to the Emperor Charles V and a service to Cardinal Farnese, brother of Signora Vettoria his wife'.",
