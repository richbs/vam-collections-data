One story tells that he is the son of Eos and Cephalus and the other that he is the son of Helios and Clymene In the second one he tried to drive his father's chariot through the sky and was hereby struck down by Zeus's thunderbolt to prevent a universal conflagration, which hurled him back into the river Eridanus.\nToday he is a symbol representing those who aspire things beyond their reach or capabilities.",
