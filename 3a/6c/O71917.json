            "public_access_description": "Although Henri Matisse (1869-1954) is celebrated as one of the great colourists of the 20th century, drawing in black and white was extremely important to him. This included his lithographs, of which he made over 300. Of these, almost a third are in the V&A's collection. Very many are of female figures, nude or otherwise dressed in exotic clothes, as they appear in his paintings. Matisse stressed that it was relationships between colours, rather than individual colours on their own, which gave them impact; monochrome lithography gave him the opportunity to experiment with, and analyse, the tonal relationships that juxtapositions of different colours provide.",

Matisse is an innovator, but he renovated rather than innovates,' wrote Apollinaire in 1909.  This statement is particularly true of Matisse's attitude to lithography.  When he made his first lithographs in 1906 he was in close touch with Paul Signac and Henri Edmond Cross, two of the greatest exponents of the colour lithograph, and a year or two earlier his paintings had been influenced by their pointillist doctrine.  Yet, in spite of his love for resonant colours, he chose to remain faithful to the nineteenth-century tradition of chalk lithographs printed in black, except in a few examples towards the end of his life. \nMatisse made a total of well over three-hundred lithographs, ninety-five of which are in the Museum's collection, thanks to the National Art Collections Fund which bought ninety-one from his daughter on a visit to London in 1935 and donated them to the V&A.  They vary from works in line to rich chiaroscuro compositions like this.  In an article on his drawing style Matisse said that he believed his line drawings, mistaken by some as mere sketches, to be the purest and most direct translation of his emotion.  But he stressed the importance of the drawings built up with shading.  Finding this a less demanding way of drawing, he was able 'to consider simultaneously, the character of the model, her human expression, the quality of the surrounding light, the atmosphere and all that can be expressed by drawing'. \nThe subject matter of his lithographs is close to that of his paintings.  This example, executed during the hot summer months in Nice, relates to a number of vibrantly coloured odalisque paintings of the same period.  Yet Matisse believed that composition 'alters itself according to the surface to be covered'.  Normally, Matisse worked on related compositions in different media concurrently: the lithographs were parallel developments to his paintings rather than studies for them or copies after them.  Matisse stressed that it was the relationship between his colours as much as their individual brilliance that caused their impact.  It is as if the discipline of lithography provided an opportunity for a monochromatic analysis of the relationship between colours.  Finding the black and white equivalents of the surrounding colours, he achieved with his subtle balance of light and shade the 'living harmony of tones, a harmony not unlike that of a musical composition' that he so desired.\"",
