Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nSusan Ewing has explained that the theme she worked on with the students was tea. 'Having participated in traditional Japanese tea ceremony, I wanted to create an abstract work that captured the essence of that experience, of a beautiful, crafted object moving in time and space - with the potential for passing, sharing, examination, contemplation, and ritual, as well as a spirituality embodied in an object cradled in the hands.
