Wilhelm also designed the costumes and Farren was responsible for the dances and action, although the solo dances were essentially choreographed by the dancers themselves. The programme claimed Adeline Gen\u00e9e\u2019s dances were choreographed by her uncle, Alexander, although she was probably responsible for them herself. The ballet was set to \u2018A Terpsichorean Pot-pouri of Popular Melodies, past and present\u2019 selected and arranged by Cuthbert Clarke. It is set in Covent Garden Market early in the morning: after the scene is established revellers from a fancy dress ball re-enact scenes from light operas. After Adeline Gen\u00e9e\u2019s departure for the USA a second edition, in which five of the eight operetta-divertissements were changed, was first performed on 30 December 1907. This version was led by Topsy Sinden (a step dancer rather than a classical ballerina) as Trixy Fay. An abridged version Covent Garden. Episodes from The Belle of the Ball was presented with Zanfretta in the lead from 21 July 1908.\n\nThe designer Wilhelm (William Charles Pitcher RI, 1858-1925) was one of the most inventive and prolific late 19th century costume designers, whose early passion for stage spectacle led to his employment designing pantomime costumes for Drury Lane Theatre. His attention to detail and his ability to create visually stunning and decorative costumes appealed to producers and public alike and led to a constant stream of work.",
