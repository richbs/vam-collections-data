This was a commemorative medal made for Princess Claude of France. A gold version of this medal was given in 1547 to Princess Claude of France, the daughter of Henry II, as a christening gift by the Swiss Confederation. The date of this medal is therefore likely to be around 1547.\n\nStampfer was a Swiss die-cutter, medallist and goldsmith born in Zurich, who worked for the Mint in that city. He produced portrait-medals, seals, commemorative coins, not only for Zurich but also for other Swiss cities and German patrons, such as the Archbishop of Salzburg.",
