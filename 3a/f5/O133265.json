Fancy dress and costume balls were a feature of 20th century society, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, even into the 1950s, and theatrical costumiers, such as Morris Angel (who also held a wide stock of military uniforms) would often have supplied or made the costumes. \n\nMany families also played charades or sometimes put on plays.  The  dressing up box and raiding of the family attics providing most of the costumes. Messel would have kept this costume for reference or for his dressing-up box of miscellaneous costumes and accessories.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel\u2019s style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

The jacket and trousers then probably formed part of Messel's dressing up box, which might have been used for reference or for family charades.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
