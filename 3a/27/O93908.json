At each end are two more linenfold panels.\n\n15th June 2005\n<u>Notes from Loan visit to Oakwell Hall:</u>\nStamped ID on PL rear leg side;\nThe back incorporates a part finished linenfold panel into the back, otherwise the back panels are very plain rebated panels;\nThe panelled lid on 3 staple hinges;\nThe base formed by a single plank nailed up (a single split), probably replaced at the same time that the PL rear foot replaced;\nMissing till at PR end.\n\n<u>Repairs</u>\nRepair for a lock ring on the top rail.\nModern wooden reinforcer behind central front panel.\nThe top fitted lock hasp nailed on (hand made nails) but appears to be an adaptation, and is missing corresponding metalwork under the lid.\n\n<u>Summary:</u> Good, with honest repairs and stripped of white paint (which probably explains the extensive exposed worm channels). Not much wear obvious under the feet.",
