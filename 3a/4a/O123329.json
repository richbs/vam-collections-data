Both were fascinated by old guide-books and by the albums of topographical views that had enjoyed such a vogue in the years around 1780-1820. Experimenting with the old-fashioned aquatint etching process, Piper found a medium which exactly suited his desire to combine abstracted pattern with carefully rendered architectural detail. Remarkably receptive to both the elegance and rackety, decaying charm of Brighton, Piper made a set of twelve plates. They were published in a traditional oblong album format, with descriptions of the subjects by the artist and an introduction by Lord Alfred Douglas. A small number of sets were bound up with the prints individually hand-coloured by Piper himself, his wife Myfanwy and John Betjeman.",

Going west from the West Pier one passes buildings that gradually become later in date, and on reaching First Avenue one is in an atmosphere of the late Victorian. Balconies and other decorative features have more importance, more flourish; porches are richly wreathed in wrought iron, and white-painted pinnacles stick up like the pins in a well-stocked pincushioin. But the atmosphere is still gay. Victorian architects let themselves go in Brighton: The air and the clients were encouraging. Compared with the Regency, calm, the static elegance of most of Brighton front, the buildings here are frantically 'busy', but they have none the less a vivid sense of <i>seaside</i>, and a magnficent swagger. Queen Victoira, imposing in dark bronze, looks out to sea from the pedestal. ",
