The idea of the commission for the sculpture was to have four groups representing the Continents. Each group was to have four figures, illustrating aspects of relevant countries or peoples, arranged around a representative animal on which is seated a fifth figure, female in every case, which was intended to personify the spirit of the continent. There are sculptural groups representing Africa, Asia, America, and Europe at each corner of the base of the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park, London. \n\nThis is one of three drawings by Bell for the Continent of America in the V&A. It shows a simultaneous view of the front and back of the sculptural group on either side of the central vertical axis.  The left view of the group consists of a Native American brave, personifying the United States, with the figure of America sitting on a bison.  The right view shows Canada carrying a cornucopia full of corn, the back view of the America, and the face of the Native American brave, as the United Sates, now on the far side of the bison.",

The figure appears to have remained female from then onwards until the final execution of the sculpture in marble. \n\n1861 was the date of the outbreak of the American Civil War (1861-1865) when eleven Southern slave states declared their secession from the United States.\n\nThat this design (one of 3) was one of Bell's first is supported by Richard Barnes's comments about them in John Bell. <u>The Sculptor's Life and Works</u>, p. 67.
