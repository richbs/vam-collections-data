The design, together with those for larger dining tables for the college refectory, is a rare example of domestic furniture produced by an architectural practice primarily concerned with church commissions. \n\nThe table\u2019s honesty of structure and revealed jointing system reflect the influence of the architect A.W.N. Pugin.  These qualities were also valued by designers of the Arts and Crafts movement.  This is seen in the furniture of William Morris and Philip Webb, both of whom were once pupils of Street at his architectural practice.",
