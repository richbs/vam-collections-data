The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe poster depicts the map of a unified Germany divided up by its 16 states. The slogan on the poster states: '16 L\u00e4nder, ein Deutschland', meaning '16 States, one Germany'.\n\nThe Alliance for Germany was an opposition coalition formed on the 5th of February 1990 in then West-Berlin to stand for the 'Volkskammer' (People's Chamber) election. It got the majority of the seats and thus formed the interim-government until reunification, with Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as Minister President.\n\nThe DA, DSU (German Social Union) and CDU (Christian Democratic Union) were part of the Alliance. The political aims (reunification of Germany and reconstitution of the federal states) were mainly determined from the West German side of the CDU. The then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared at many election campaign activities for the East German CDU.\n\nThe 'Demokratischer Aufbruch' ('Democratic Awakening') was founded in 1989 as a Christian-conservative oriented opposition party in the GDR. Just shortly before the elections the then head of the party, Wolfgang Schnur, was convicted for being a long-standing spy for the GDR secret service and consequently had to resign.",
