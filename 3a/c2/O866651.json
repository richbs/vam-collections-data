The full text of the record is as follows: Robert Seymour (1798-1836) <b>Four Sketches by Seymour</b> Plates from a series of 180 caricatures published by R. Carlyle, London, 1834-35 Each lettered with title, publisher's name and address and dates, etc. Lithograph No 5 vol. 3 'In it or trying the Middle' No 19 vol 3 'Hunting may be sport, but I'm bless'd if it's pleasure' No 19 vol 4 'Shooting from a bank' No 21 vol 4 'Have you caught anything, Sir?' E.1192-5-1963 The first illustrator of <i>Pickwick Papers</i> was Robert Seymour (1798-1836). The son of a decayed gentleman, he was apprenticed in his youth to a pattern drawer, but aspired to the 'higher style of art'. At the house of his uncle Thomas Holmes (whose daughter he married in 1827) he formed an acquaintance with the painter Joseph Severn. By 1822 he had established himself as an illustrator, and in the following five years contributed wood-engraved designs to a large number of books. After the bankruptcy of his first publisher he worked, now in etching and lithography, for Thomas McLean. In the early 1830s his series of 'Sketches' began to appear. They depict the adventures and misadventures of cockney sportsmen, a theme particularly congenial to Seymour. He designed caricatures for the magazine <i>Figaro in London</i>, from 1833 to 1834 and 1835-36. He died by his own hand in April 1836.",
