Size of sheets, each 36 x 26 cm\nD.125.30, 32-1905\n\nPerkins was the son of an architect under whose direction the general restoration of Worcester Cathedral was carried out. After leaving school he joined the office of Sir Gilbert Scott before becoming an assistant to Thomas G. Jackson for fourteen years. Later he set up his own small private practice, concentrating o domestic work. He was also known for his watercolour perspective views, a number of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1889 to 1895.\n\nThese two sheets come from a group of 28 drawings made in the Museum between 1881 and 1884. They were acquired, with a number of sketch-books showing measured drawings of architecture, ironwork, wood carving etc, from his widow who suggested that they might be of use 'as examples to set before Branch Schools of Art' (letter 30/1/1905). The fact that the drawings had remained in Perkins's studio indicates that they were made for his private use: to train his eye and his hand, and to build up a store of ideas. But they were purchased by the Museum as examples for other students to study. The correspondence dealing with their acquisition is full of comments from Museum staff like 'the style of drawing is excellent from the technical point of view' and 'This very valuable collection ... will not only be useful owing to the richness and variety of the objects selected but will also, if framed for school  use, set an admirable example of useful sketch-book work for students to follow ...'\n\nSL'",
