He was a cultivated admirer of the arts and a gifted musician, composer and linguist. He was passionately interested in gold boxes, and took a keen interest in their design. He carried a box at all times: one is even said to have saved his life by deflecting a bullet during a battle.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
