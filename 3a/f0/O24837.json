The route was favoured by pilgrim monks on their way to visit holy sites in India. The caves were excavated by German archaeologists in the early 1900s who removed many of the paintings and took them to Berlin where most were subsequently destroyed during World War II.",

This was one retained by Madam Le Coq from whom Ratton has obtained it\".\n\nHistorical significance: Many of the paintings removed by the German expedition in the early 20th century were taken to Berlin and subsequently destroyed during World War II.",

            "historical_context_note": "This fragment provides a glimpse of the rich tradition of central Asian Buddhist painting.   Kyzil was an important centre on the central Asian trade routes.  It appears to have been largely Hinayana Buddhist, with rich temples endowed by the wealthy merchant community.  Sections of  wall paintings were removed from the ruined temples at Kyzil by the third expedition of the Berlin Ethnological Museum in 1906.  This fragment was subsequently in the collection of Albert von Le Coq, the expedition leader.",
