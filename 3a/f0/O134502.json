Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk playbill was produced to mark the 1,000th performance of The Mousetrap two and a half years into its run. The actors John Paul, Allan McClelland, Mignon O'Doherty, Aubrey Dexter, Jessica Spencer and Martin Miller had all played their roles since the play opened at the Ambassadors Theatre on 25 November 1952, when Sheila Sim and Richard Attenborough were Mollie Ralston and Detective Sergeant Trotter.  When this was issued in 1955 marking 1,000 performances, no-one would have imagined that the production would still be running over half a century later.",
