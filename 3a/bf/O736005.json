He learned his craft from his father Jodocus Murer and after his father's death in 1580 he left his native city to work in Strasbourg with the Swiss-born artist Tobias Stimmer until Stimmer's death in 1584. In 1586 he returned to Z\u00fcrich and worked extensively in that city until his own death.\n\nThis elaborate composition includes a distant view of Jerusalem - with mountains beyond - which is analogous to the landscape of a distant town and braod river between  mountains seen in the panel of painted glass (cat. no. 3.1.c).'\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1936</u>, London: Board of Education, 1937.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'MURER (or MAURER), Christoph (1558-1614).</B>\n\nDesign for a panel of painted glass.
