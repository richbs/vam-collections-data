Originally designed and marketed by the Kempston Micro Electronics company, it became known generically as a Kempston Interface, even when manufactured by other companies, such as this one by Datel Electronics.\n\nThis interface was one of the products that made Datel a success in the 1980s, later finding fame through their console gaming cheat devices Action Replay and Game Shark. While the original Kempston company faded into obscurity, Datel managed to outlive the home computer market through these developments and is still developing console products in the 2010s.",
