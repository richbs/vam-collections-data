The Tsar rests his hand upon the head of the boy.  Abraham Hannibal would have been in his mid twenties when this was painted and cannot therefore be the page.\n\nThe frame was opened by Conservation on 25/3/10.  The vellum is stretched around copper, so it is not possible to view the \"back\" of the vellum.  It is likely that the artist stretched the vellum around copper which was not an unusual practice, the metal acting as a strong support for the vellum.",

During his reign Peter introduced a programme of military, religious and administrative reforms that began the modernization of Russia, and its development as a great European state. Many of his reforming ideas were inspired by his travels in Europe, and these Western influences can be seen in this miniature.  \n\nThe miniature was painted by Baron Gustav von Mardefeld, an artist, Prussian diplomat and soldier, who was his state\u2019s ambassador in Russia.  It was probably a diplomatic gift and interestingly combines Western classical references with elements of Russia\u2019s own cultural traditions.  Peter wears fashionable French dress and is clean-shaven \u2013 one of his cultural reforms was to enforce shaving on polite society, against traditional Russian orthodoxy.  He carries a baton of office and wears a breastplate with the Russian insignia of the double-headed eagle, both indicating his standing as  military leader.  He also wears the sash of the Russian Order of St. Andrew, which he had founded.  Other Western artistic conventions are seen in the decorative helmet, which is classical in inspiration, indicating ancient lineage and tradition, and the presence of the black page.",

Born about 1660, died in Pomerania 6th December 1729.  He was said to have been a pupil of David Krafft.  He was first in the service of the court of Hess, and later of the King of Prussia who sent him in 1719 as Ambassador to St. Petersburg, Russia.  Towards the end of his life he was president of the Cabinet of Magdeburg.  He worked as a miniature painter in Sweden, Germany and Russia, but his works are rare.  The Museum of Stockholm has a portrait of Peter I, Emperor of Russia, signed on the reverse: Gustaff B. Mardefelt.  Fecit 1720\".  Two miniatures, both unsigned but authenticated by old inventories, are in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich, Germany [www.bayerisches-nationalmuseum.de], no. 402, portrait of the artist by himself wearing a hat and a blue cloak, on parchment stretched on a copper plaque and No. 403, portrait of the Palatine Elector Johann Wilhelm wearing armour under an ermine cloak and a wide red ribbon with the Golden Fleece, in the background a battle scene, on parchment.

Neither of the two miniatures is signed.  Neither has been closely examined recently, but the following information is on file and the miniatures are on the museum's database:\n(1) Unknown Boy: Unsigned. Painted on parchment.  \"We know the provenance of the Young B: it was owned by Christoffer Eichhorn in Stockholm; after that it belonged to Edvard Nystrands collection in Stockholm; and then Paul Sinebychoff bought it in 1900.\"\n(2) V\u00f6lschow :Unsigned.

The Stockholm miniature shows Peter the Great in the same pose exactly, but to the waist only, his hands omitted.  In the V&A version he holds his commander's baton in his right hand and rests his left hand on the head of his page, who holds his helmet.  In the Stockholm miniature he wears the same blue sash, but his jacket is red and he does not wear the breast-plate shown in the V&A miniature.  In the Stockholm miniature he is also depicted against a plain background of blue-grey, with some shadowing.  The Stockholm miniature is signed on the reverse, according to Leo R. Schidlof  <u>The Miniature in Europe</u> (1964), \"Gustaff B. Mardefelt.  Fecit 1720\".\n\nHistorical significance: The entry on \"Gustav Freiherr von Mardefeld (also Martinfeld)\" in Leo R. Schidlof  <u>The Miniature in Europe</u> (1964) offers a limited amount of biographical information about Mardefeld.  But almost nothing seems to be known about his training as an artist.  Schidlof notes that he was \"said to have been a pupil of David Krafft\".   An entry in German on \"Mardefeld, Gustav von\" in \"Wikisource\" [accessed:26/3/2010] discusses only his role as a diplomat.  There are references to him in Paul Bushkovitch <u>Peter the Great, The Struggle for Power, 1671-1725</u> (Cambridge University Press, 2001), but again only in his diplomatic role; \"The new Prussian ambassador Gustav Baron von Mardefeld explained the situation...\" (p.376) (N.B. Gustav Baron von Mardefeld should not be confused with the Swedish General Mardefelt).\n\nIn 2004 this miniature featured in a V&A web-project called \"Every Object Tells a Story\", under the title \"A Case of Wishful Thinking?\".  The entry read:\n<i>\"This painting entered the V&A in 1882, but it was another 120 years before it was realised that the boy standing next to Peter the Great might be the famous Abraham Hannibal (c.1696-1781).\n\nHannibal was born in Africa, the son of a noble family whose precise geographic origins are much debated. Kidnapped at an early age, he was adopted by Peter the Great in 1704 and went on to enjoy a highly successful career in the Russian army. His two great legacies were the impressive fortifications he designed while Chief Military Engineer, and his great-grandson, the celebrated writer Alexander Pushkin.\n\nThe exact date of this painting is not known, but Peter the Great was born in 1672.  If he is in his mid-thirties here, then the date must be around 1707. Hannibal would have been about eleven. The dates and faces fit and the two figures seem to be on good terms. But, tempting as it is, there is insufficient written evidence to prove outright that the young boy really is Abraham Hannibal\"</i>.\n\nIn fact it seems more likely that the miniature was painted in 1720, based on its resemblance to the miniature in Stockholm of Peter the Great in the same pose, signed and dated by Mardefeld 1720. Although the page could be an allusion to Abraham Hannibal (also known as Abram or Ibrahim Gannibal) it cannot be a portrait of him, as in 1720 Hannibal was twenty four years old. Mardefeld was appointed ambassador to Russia in December 1719, so the Stockholm miniature was painted soon after his arrival in Russia, probably as a diplomatic gift.  If it was painted from life then Peter the Great is shown aged forty eight.  The V&A miniature is a worked up version of the Stockholm miniature, including additional motifs intended to evoke Peter the Great's military standing - such as his commander's baton and breastplate - and echoing European art, such as the inclusion of a black page, found in many aristocratic portraits in the 17th century.  The Tsar additionally wears French fashionable dress, while his attendant's style of dress is associated with traditional Eastern European attire, specifically the frog-fastening on his coat. The Tsar is also wearing the Russian insignia of St Andrew - an order which he founded - and his breastplate carries the Russian insignia of the double-headed eagle.  The decorative helmet is classical in inspiration, another Western convention indicating ancient lineage and tradition.  The battle scene in the background seems to allude to the Tsar's efforts to modernise Russia, setting Western European ideas, inspired by his travels in Europe against the forces for tradition.  The opposing forces are dressed in different styles, some wearing traditional Cossack hats and also full beards, while others wear fashionable Western three-cornered hats and are clean-shaven.  One of Peter's cultural reforms was to enforce shaving in polite society, an attack on the traditional Russian orthodoxy of wearing long beards.",
