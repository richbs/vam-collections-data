            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in straight stitches.\nThis is part of an unfinished piece.  One trouser panel has been cut into four pieces.  The original length runs from one selvedge to the other and was therefore cut across the width of the cotton fabric. The correct order of the four pieces from the top is: 849C-1875, 849A-1875, 849-1875, 849B-1875. This illustrates how such pieces were laid out and worked: there is no underdrawing and the diagonal lines, which are worked first, are not evenly spaced.  One colour is worked first, and the second is added.  Then the brackets are worked - again, these are not evenly spaced. Then the outlines of the flowers are worked.\nIt is cut top and bottom and there is a narrow line of green stitching down either side.  The embroidery has been cut across the top and is incomplete at the bottom.  Some of the stripes are incomplete and the light green brackets are the only decoration in the lower left hand corner.\nThe pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in pink and green silk. \nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: two small diagonal lozenges form a pair of leaves in orange and light green alternating with pink and light green.  There is a light green bracket between the pairs.\n[2] wider stripe: a larger light green bracket separates a pink pansy-like flower from an orange carnation.\nThreads: light green, pink, orange silk; 2S",
