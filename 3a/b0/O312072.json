The reliefs represent scenes from the life of the Blessed Ambrogio Sansedoni - in this one he is feeding the pilgrims.  The chapel for which they were made was the room in which the illustrious ancestor of the Sansedoni had once lived. \n\nSoldani received his training as a sculptor and medallist in Rome and Paris before being recalled to Florence, where he worked for about 40 years as the Master of the Mint for the Medici Grand-Dukes of Tuscany. The desire to collect the creative processes of the artist in tangible form that had developed, notably in Florence, in the sixteenth century, was still alive. It appears that Soldani gave at least some of his models away, and these two reliefs were given by him to the Sansedoni family as gifts, probably in the frames in which they are still housed.",

Soldani gave both these reliefs to the Sansedoni family at Siena (see Zikos in Vienna 2005, loc.cit.), and probably had them placed within their current frames for the purpose of their display within the palace.\n\nPurchased together with A.1-1963 in 1963.",
