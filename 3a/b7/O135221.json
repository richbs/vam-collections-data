Running a programme of variety acts, with all the major stars of the day appearing, it changed its name to the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1876. The theatre began to produce more conventional plays, but reverted to variety acts and music hall in 1890. Sadly, in 1940 the building was bombed and completely destroyed, and never rebuilt.\n\nThe acts advertised on this playbill include Bella and Bijou, the 'Society Entertainers', a duo that performed musical duets, and \u2018the singing comedian\u2019 Austin Rudd. He made his name with \u2018Bobbing Up and Down Like This\u2019, a song about the adventures of a henpecked husband and his wife Gert at the seaside. It made Rudd a star and proved equally popular in Australia and South Africa, where Rudd went on tour.",
