The structure of these solid chairs meant to range along a wall, is worth notice, and this and the following number may serve as specimens of construction; the back is cut into two tenons at the base, long enough to pass through the seat and find resistance against the back support, a flat piece representing the two legs. The back support again and the front are morticed into the seat, and these three pieces kept tight by small bars, deep enough to be shaped into ogee arches. Thus the chair is composed of the three pieces forming the front and back legs, and the back. These all meet in the seat, which is merely a fourth, cut or sunk into a shallow round or square panel. They are in this instance strengthened and kept thoroughly firm and solid by the cross pieces that join the supports and again connect them more competely with the feat.'
