            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke.\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masakatsu.\n\nPeople, whether real, imaginary or historical, provided a rich source of inspiration for netsuke carvers. This example shows a child hiding behind an oni or demon mask. The child's mischievous nature is reflected in the subject of the mask as in Japanese folklore oni are devious creatures with an ugly appearance capable of causing mischief and misfortune. This netsuke can be appreciated from all angles as even the underside of the piece is carved depicting the frightened face of a hiding child.",
