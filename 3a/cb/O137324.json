More women in Norway still own and wear traditional jewellery than in any other country in Europe.  You can see jewellery like this being worn at weddings or on other social occasions to this day.\n\nSt\u00f8lebelter are belts made of cloth or cloth-covered leather, with metal mounts.  The word 'st\u00f8le' refers to these rectangular mounts.  Some belts were used for daily wear, but belts like this one, with gilded silver plaques mounted on red cloth, were worn by brides on their wedding day.  Married women continued to wear them on festive occasions throughout their life.  They are medieval in origin.  St\u00f8lebelter like this mainly come from central Norway.\n\nThe clasp on this belt is called a maljespenne, as it resembles a row of maljer, or bodice clasps.  The belt was bought for \u00a34 14s at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872.",
