The Totum must be figures 1 to 8 on its several faces, in pen and ink.  The pyramids are supposed to be the travellers who make the tour; each pyramid having 4 counters of the same colour belong to it, which are called markers or servants:  when you find that these are complete, you may begin the game agreeable to the following rules.\n\n1.  Each player must hold a pyramid or traveller, and four counters of the same colour.\n2.  In order to know who begins the game, each player must spin the Totum, and the highest number takes the lead, then the next highest, etc.\n3.  The first player then spins, and if he turns up No. 4, he is to place his pyramid on Hanover, and stay there till it is his turn to spin again.\n 4.  If in the second spinning he turns up No. 3, he is to add that to 4, his former number, and place his pyramid on No. 7 (Carlesroma) and in this manner the game must be continued till the traveller reaches No. 102, which is London, the first city in Europe;  when he wins the game.\n5.  If the last spin does not exactly make up to the No.102, but goes beyond it, he must then go back as many numbers as he exceeds it, an try his fortune again, till one of the players spins the lucky number.\n6.  When a player is obliged to wait one or more turns, he must deposit as many counters as he is directed to wait turns (which never exceed four) and when it is his turn to spin again, instead of spinning, he must take up a counter, and so on till they are all taken up.\nEACH OF THE TOWNS LISTED HAS A SHORT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe engraved label on the slip case shows military trophies, with a royal crown and a scroll of paper with the title.\n\n*Like  A NEW ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL PASTIME (E.5307-1960), the towns and descriptions are shown together with any rewards or penalties, in this case there are only 117 compartments.  Although the basic playing method is the same, there is one major difference and that is the kitty.  To start, each player has a marker, called a traveller, and four counters, which are kept.  Most of the forfeits involve missing turns, but two ask for payment.  The Isle of Man is the harshest,.  There the traveller is shipwrecked and has to leave the game.  The descriptions of the towns, while still creating the illusion of a visit to an interesting place, high light the idea of commerce and trade.  Many manufacturing towns are mentioned, including Worcester for its china and gloves, Manchester and Leeds for their cloths, and Berwick for its salmon fisheries.  This game continued for many years and the rules booklet for this example was printed in 1802.\n\nRules placement: printed separately and placed either side of the playing sheet",
