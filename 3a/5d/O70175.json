As the pieces were made of a mixture of feldspar and starch they could not be thrown on a wheel but were either raised by hand or in a mould.  Pickle jars or martabans, as they were locally known, owing to the fort on the coast of Burma through which they were imported into India, were first copied in Delhi and later at Jaipur, where they were decorated in response to European taste.",

As the pieces were made of a mixture of feldspar and starch they could not be thrown on a wheel but were either raised by hand or in a mould.  Pickle jars or <i>martabans,</i> as they were locally known, owing to the fort on the coast of Burma through which they were imported into India, were first copied in Delhi and later at Jaipur, where they were decorated in response to European taste.
