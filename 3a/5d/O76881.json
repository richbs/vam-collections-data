A band of grooved moulding visually separates the spout from the vessel.  An iron swivel-handle for suspension is attached to the body of the piece via two projecting knops either side of the well. \n\nBetween the grooved moulding and side knops on each side are engraved five-lobed palmettes. Between the side knops and the back two horizontal cartouches with incurving sides enclose epigraphic sections. On the upper flat rim around the well is a border of foliate scrolls terminating either side in a birds head.\nEither side of the spout on the walls a crescent enclosing a foliate scroll is engraved.\nThe swivel handle is composed of a three-sided cradle. The centre of the top bar is bolted to a pierced rectangular section. This in turn is riveted to an arch-shaped handle which moves freely, and swivels.\n\nPatina: olive with bituminous incrustations blackening some areas.",
