It is likely that the 'arch' referred to in the title was 'The Marble Arch'- constructed as the centrepiece of an enlarged courtyard at Buckingham Palace to commemorate the British victories at Trafalgar and Waterloo. By 1829 the costs of this construction project had escalated to nearly half a million pounds. \n\nIt was published in London in August 1829 by S.W.
