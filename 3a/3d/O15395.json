            "public_access_description": "This painted wooden panel is one of a set of four.  It is probably an example of the early work produced by William Morris (1834-1896), Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882) and Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898) while based at premises in Red Lion Square, London.  It is likely that the panels may have been part of a large piece of furniture such as a settle, perhaps even the built-in settle in the drawing room at Red House: William Morris\u2019s home in Bexleyheath, Kent, designed by Philip Webb (1831-1915).\n\nIt is uncertain which of Morris\u2019s circle was responsible for the painting of the panels.  This uncertainty reflects how closely these individuals worked together during the early years of their collaboration. The subject of the panels suggests the seasons.  This particular example is most likely to be Winter.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that the panels were ever intended to be \u2018labelled\u2019 in this way.",
