The fabric was manufactured by the Ascher textile company, and designed by artist Feliks Topolski on commission. Topolski\u2019s semi-abstract cherub design made an ideal print for this fluid garment.\n\nDuring the 1940s the Aschers commissioned leading artists such as Matisse and Henry Moore to design a collection of fabrics to brighten up the dull post-war British wardrobe, and from 1946 Ascher supplied fabrics to the international fashion industry. They opened their own printworks and became known for lively screen printed designs.",
