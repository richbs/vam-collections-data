Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring carries the marks of the Papal States, and was worn in Lazio, in central Italy.  It is typical of central Italy, but similar earrings were also worn in southern Italy and Sicily.  The flat disc at the bottom often had a pendant hung through the hole in the centre.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
