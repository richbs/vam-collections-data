It was a collection of lives of saints written between 1260 and 1275. It's popularity is suggested by the fact that around 900 manuscript copies of the work still survive. It is thought that the book was meant as a collection of stories for use in sermons, rather than as a work of popular literature.\n\nMedieval books had no contents page or index. There was usually a hierarchy of initials marking important divisions in the text. These were at this time added by specialist illuminators and rubricators, in spaces left blank by the scribe.

Goldschmidt.\n\nHistorical significance: Medieval books had no contents page or index and so there was usually a hierarchy of initials marking important divisions in the text. These were at this time added by specialist illuminators and rubricators, in spaces left blank by the scribe. The more important initials might be historiated with a figurative picture (<i>istoire</i> being the term for a story), or decorated, while the lesser initials might be made of coloured letters on coloured or gold grounds or even simply a letter slightly larger than the main body of text and picked out in a contrasting colour such as red or blue.\n\nThe <i>Legenda Aurea</i> (Golden Legend) was one of the most popular works of the thirteenth century. Written between 1260 and 1275, it was a collection of legendary lives of saints. About 900 manuscripts of this work survive. Its repetitious nature is probably explained by the fact that de Voragine meant to write a compendium of saintly lore for sermons and preaching, not the popular entertainment it became. In his history of the Reformation, Diarmaid MacCulloch observed that the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> inadvertently may have helped trigger the Protestant Reformation by arming scepticism about the cult of the saints. \nThe above was taken from Wikipedia.",

For he compiled the legends of the saints in one volume, adding many things from the <i>Historia Tripartita et Scholastica</i>, and from the chronicles of many writers.\"\n\nThe <i>Legenda Aurea</i> (Golden Legend) was one of the most popular works of the thirteenth century.

Its repetitious nature is probably explained by the fact that de Voragine meant to write a compendium of saintly lore for sermons and preaching, not the popular entertainment it became.\n\nThe preface divides the ecclesiastical year into four periods corresponding to the various epochs of the world's history, a time of deviation, of renovation, of reconciliation and of pilgrimage. The book itself, however, falls into five sections: \u2014(a) from Advent to Christmas (cc. 1\u20145); (b) from Christmas to Septuagesima (6-30); (e) from Septuagesima to Easter (31-53); (d) from Easter Day to the octave of Pentecost (54-76); (e) from the octaye of Pentecost to Advent (77-180). The saints' lives are full of fanciful legend, and in not a few cases contain accounts of 13th century miracles wrought at special places, particularly with reference to the Dominicans. The last chapter but one (181), \"De Sancto Pelagio Papa,\" contains a kind of history of the world from the middle of the 6th century; while the last (182) is a somewhat allegorical disquisition, \" De Dedicatione Ecclesiae.\" The work was translated into French by Jean Belet de Vigny in the 14th century and was also one of the earliest printed books, in ca. 1469 and in Lyon in 1473 and many other subsequent editions. \n\nThe above was taken from Wikipedia.",
