Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965\n\n\n<b>Amy Robsart </b>\nFA123 Neg CT18997 \nPanel, mahogany, 27.7 X 23 cm (10 7/8 X 9 1/16 ins) \nInscribed on back as below \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nThe work is inscribed by the artist in paint on the back 'C R Leslie./1833', but is listed under 1836 by Taylor (<u>Leslie</u> II, p230) as painted for John Sheepshanks, and engraved. \nAmy Robsart (1532-60) married Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in 1550; she died in suspicious circumstances in 1560 - suicide or, more likely, murder (by her husband, so he was free to marry the Queen), although a jury returned a verdict of accidental death. Despite the plot of Sir Waiter Scott's <i>Kenilworth</i> revolving around her story, she never achieved the perpetuity of fame through art that Mary Queen of Scots and Lady Jane Grey enjoyed; no relevant subjects were exhibited at the RA in the 1830s, for example. There does not seem to be an extant contemporary portrait of Amy Robsart. \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
