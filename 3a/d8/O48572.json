Sardine tongs were a Victorian refinement for serving the expensive and popular tinned fish. \n\nDining Etiquette\nDining etiquette formed an important part of the Victorian code of polite society. The Manners and Tone of Good Society, first published in 1879, outlined the correct conduct of the dinner party but focused on the complicated and changing use of cutlery. With a few exceptions (such as for eating bread and some fruit) touching food with the fingers was frowned upon. During the Victorian era  diners were presented with an alarming and growing range of specialist utensils for eating particular foods. It was important to be able to recognise items such as lobster picks, sardine tongs and grape scissors, and to know how to use them correctly.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe fish form, which is part of the design, suggests the function. However, some metal trade catalogues show that consumers could choose from a number of decorative patterned tongs described as 'asparagus eaters or sardine servers', which were less specific and could be used for more than one food. Around 1890 Elkington & Co. sold similar tongs for between 3s (15p) and 10s (50p), depending on the type and quantity of decoration.",

Sardine tongs were a Victorian refinement for serving the expensive and popular tinned fish. <br><br>\n\n<b>Dining Etiquette</b><br>\nDining etiquette formed an important part of the Victorian code of polite society. <i>The Manners and Tone of Good Society</i>, first published in 1879, outlined the correct conduct of the dinner party but focused on the complicated and changing use of cutlery. With a few exceptions (such as for eating bread and some fruit) touching food with the fingers was frowned upon. During the Victorian era  diners were presented with an alarming and growing range of specialist utensils for eating particular foods. It was important to be able to recognise items such as lobster picks, sardine tongs and grape scissors, and to know how to use them correctly.<br><br>\n\n<b>Design & Designing</b><br>\nThe fish form, which is part of the design, suggests the function. However, some metal trade catalogues show that consumers could choose from a number of decorative patterned tongs described as 'asparagus eaters or sardine servers', which were less specific and could be used for more than one food. Around 1890 Elkington &Co. sold similar tongs for between 3s (15p) and 10s (50p), depending on the type and quantity of decoration.",
