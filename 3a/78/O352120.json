The technique involved cutting holes in the linen to make a design and then finishing the raw edges with buttonhole stitch.  Using white embroidery thread on a white fabric is a type of needlework known as whitework.  This collar is unusual in the abstract shapes of its embroidered pattern, unlike the typically floral designs of the early 17th century.  \n\nThe band appeared as a new style of neckwear in the 1590s.  It was worn informally in place of the ruff, because it used less fabric and was therefore less expensive.  A band was also much easier to care for and by the 1620s replaced the ruff for all but the most formal occasions.  A band was considered to be \u2018standing\u2019 or \u2018falling\u2019 depending on how it was arranged in relation to the doublet or bodice.  A standing band was heavily starched and held perfectly flat by a wire, bone or card support underneath.  For more informal occasions, a falling band was worn, lightly starched and allowed to drape over the collar of the garment underneath.",
