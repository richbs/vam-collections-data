It is extraordinary to imagine them in the sumptuous Palace of Versailles in the apartments the French princess shared with her other unmarried sisters, perhaps reflected in a mirror behind a pier table or on a maneltpiece.  In the S\u00e8vres factory archives today the original ledger recording her purchase survives,  revealing she paid 420 livres for them in December 1772.  She was a good customer of the factory and even had a vase shape named after her (perhaps because she commissioned it), a pair of which can be seen at Harewood House in West Yorkshire today.  An inkstand with her initials and her father's portrait is in the Wallace Collection and was probably a gift from Louis XV to his favorite daughter in 1756.\n\nThe vases are in the elegant, but rather austere, neo-classical style which is characterised by simple shapes and bold motifs taken from classical architecture and decorative art.  The male and female heads in the medallions are painted 'en grisaille', as the grey tones imitate carved marble reliefs found on roundels on ancient Roman buildings or tombs.  Only three pairs of this model appear to have been made, suggesting it did not find favour with most aristocratic buyers of porcelain, the shape being perhaps too severe.",

This probably refers to 805 and 805A-1882 as they are the only pair in green (or in any colour) known in this size.  Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Bourbon (1732-1800) was the fourth daughter of Louis XV and one of Louis XVI's aunts.\nMarcelle Brunet (see below) first noted the connection to Mme. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and also commented that the concept of four linked medallions is similar to that of the<i> vase ferr\u00e9</i>, first introduced c. 1761-2 whose design has been attributed to Etienne-Maurice Falconnet, director of sculpture at S\u00e8vres from 1757-66.  Both the <i>vase solaire</i> and the <i>vase ferr\u00e9</i> present four framed 'canvases' for decoration 360 degrees around the vase.\n\nThe <i>vase solaire</i> has a more elegant and simple feel than the <i>vase ferr\u00e9</i> however, in keeping with a more pared down neo-classicism of the 1770s.  Both designs take their inspiration from classical models, possibly via armour or other metalwork.",
