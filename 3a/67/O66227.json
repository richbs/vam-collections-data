A raised fillet and flat moulding provide the rim.\n\nThe engraved decoration is dominated by an epigraphic band around the top, enclosed by previously silver-inlaid fillets.  It is divided into four sections by hexagonal cartouches.\n\nThe broad central section of the body is framed top and bottom with a plain ribbon which loops to form four lobed cartouches. These cartouches in turn link to smaller spacing roundels within this broad band.\nThe ground is a pattern of swastika-like motifs.\n\nThe lobed compartments enclose figures of the royal party.  From the left of the beginning of the inscription these are:\n\n1. a woman seated on her heels turned to the left upholding a tambourine.  Two ribbons cascade from her head-dress.\n2.  a cross-legged figure wearing pointed boots,  facing three-quarters left, the left hand resting on the thigh, the right hand raised.\n3.  a dancer bent three-quarters to the right shaking the hanging sleeves of her tunic.\n4.  a musician seated on his heels, turned to the left and playing the flute.\n\nAt the bottom, forty seven lotus buds, formerly silver-inlaid, point downwards to the bowl stem.\n\nPatina: the heavily corroded object is mostly covered with green sulphurous deposits, brown red oxide showing on limited areas. The inlay surviving in the form of silver salt in limited areas.",
