The central part of the cover is edge with a simple double-sided reciprocal trefoil border edged in black with white, light blue and red [border a].\nThis is enclosed by a yellow ground border containing a meandering blue stem and exotic blossoms in red, white, blue and black, then a repeat of border [a], then a red ground border with isolated left-facing, inward pointing  botehs in blue, white and black, and a repeat of border [a]. The outermost border has inward pointing red cypress trees separating lobed arches and  spandrels in two shades of red.
