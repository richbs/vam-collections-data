A desire to eat more elegantly prompted the need for table equipment that could be used only at particular times in the meal or with certain foods. The fruit or dessert fork was designed for use with the last course or dessert, which might consist of fresh or candied fruit. A Victorian etiquette book of 1880 advised, 'In eating pears or apples, they would be peeled and cut into halves and quarters with a fruit knife and fork.'<br><br>\n\n<b>Design & Designing</b><br>\nDessert cutlery had always been more highly decorated than that for the earlier courses, to reflect the status and expense of the dessert. Handles, in particular,  were often more ornate. In the Victorian period fruit forks were commonly sold with fruit knives in boxed sets of a dozen.  The manufacturer Elkington & Co. could charge up to \u00a322 a set in 1885 for richly engraved blades with carved handles and accompanying matching knives.<br><br>",
