This theatre was the first joint venture of Horace Edward Moss (1852-1912) and Frank Thornton, and one of the earliest Moss Empires Variety Theatres, which at its peak comprised thirty-three theatres, the largest chain in the world.  Designed by Oliver and Leeson, the theatre was built to a sumptuous standard, despite the location of the stage above the kitchen of an inn below, which frequently resulted in smells invading the auditorium.\n\nThe Old Gaiety Theatre Newcastle closed when the Empire opened and several acts transferred to the new hall. Moss and Thornton appeared on the stage at the opening ceremony and declared they would cater for Newcastle audiences 'with first class matter, free from any objectionable features'.",
