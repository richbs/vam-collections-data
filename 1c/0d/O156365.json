Glazed stoneware such as this was imported in large quantities from the German Rhineland in the 16th century and often mounted in precious metal. Inexpensive objects of turned wood and stoneware, and more costly glass vessels were often transformed by adding decorated mounts of silver, pewter and gold. The mounts in this case, possibly by Richard Brooke of London, are decorated with standard embossed fruit and strapwork.  They were produced about two or three years after the stoneware.\n\nThis piece is an example of 16th century domestic silver. Such silver was both functional and ornamental. Objects for dining and drinking took elegant forms and were decorated in the latest styles. Beautifully crafted items intended only for display often adopted functional forms such as cups and dishes. Domestic silver was not confined to the most wealthy. Many people owned silver spoons or mounted vessels, items which often became treasured possessions.\n\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
