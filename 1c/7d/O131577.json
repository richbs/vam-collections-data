NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative.\n\nThis grey coloured sample swatch of woven silk has a 'bubble wrap' appearance. This effect called 'Ensuku' or 'salt shrinking' is a time-honoured Japanese technique used to finish crepe silk and other textured fabrics, by soaking them in a neutral pH saline solution to reduce the fibres to the desired density. NUNO adapted this method of applying dye resist patterns to silk, by immersing them in a calcium nitrate solution that attacks the exposed areas, causing them to shrink dramatically while the resist coated areas remain unaffected.",
