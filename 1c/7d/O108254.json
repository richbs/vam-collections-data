The 'Frames wallpaper is an excellent example of how a wallpaper originally designed by artists for a gallery project was subsequently produced commercially. This wallpaper resulted from a collaboration between Chris Taylor and Craig Wood, and is one the designs from their range of interactive wallpapers included in their 'Down on Paper' sample book / artists' book.  Craig Wood has described it as follows: \"Frames wallpaper is to complete or not complete. It plays with the taboo of graffiti and writing on the walls - how you can express yourself at home, creating you own artwork on the walls with no guilt.\" The pattern - of hand-drawn outline frames of various shapes and sizes - is designed to be coloured in or to have photographs, drawings, magazine cuttings etc pasted on. It encourages the purchaser to modify the paper to their taste, or to allow their children to do so. As such it picks up on the idea of customising standard products that is a strong current trend in interiors and in fashion.\n\nThe 'Frames' paper was originally produced with the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham for an off-site educational project in 2002-3 and printed by wallpaper specialists Graham & Brown who went on to produce it commercially. The design has been a great success - it was included in the short list for the Homes & Gardens Classic Design Awards in 2004.",
