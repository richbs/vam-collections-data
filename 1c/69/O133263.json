Rectangular seat, moulded at the front and sides, with an apron at the front carved with a grotesque mask flanked by foliated scrolls. The front legs turned in the form of columns and terminating in bun feet; the back legs plain and square. The two uprights at the back are carved with a foliage pattern and joined by two horizontal bars, carved with rosettes and foliage, which frame a panel carved with symmetrical  foliated scrolls. The cresting formed of a grotesque mask surrounded by scrolls and foliage. The undulating arms carved on the upper sides with a foliage pattern, terminate in ram's heads and have supports turned in the form of columns.\n\nReplacement parts\nIn addition to the parts deemed replacement on acquisition and later by John Hayward (the rear feet tipped, replacement seat, back rails, front stretcher and side rail and apron) it is possible that the front feet must be new and it is not clear that these are separate from the front legs. The upper and lower rails of the back panel are replaced. Hard to explain is the unused lower peg underneath the joint of arm and rear stile, unless the arms and rear stiles were not originally from the same chair, and suggesting that this chair has been assembled from a mix of old parts (including very fine arms) 'restored' together in the 19th or 20th centuries. There appears to have been a previous tenon at the joint of the arm and the back stile which has since been filled. The baluster arm supports may be too late in date for the ram arms, cf Louvre and Marburg chairs illus in Thirion p.144, both 1560 or slightly later.\n\nNote variation in wear (between crest and front rail) and carving eg veining of foliage, scrolls and mask",
