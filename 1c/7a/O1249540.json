In 1972 he moved to North Devon, and began what would become his life\u2019s work in documenting the people and landscape of this region for the Beaford Archive. \nThis photograph highlights the ramshackle nature of many small North Devon farms, in contrast to the clinical architecture of modern factory farming methods. Despite the seeming dilapidation of their farm building shown here, Olive Bennett and her father bred prize-winning Red Devon cows. Olive was often photographed by Ravilious and became a friend, though she thought him deeply eccentric for taking photographs of her and her peers\u2019 daily lives. Ravilious\u2019s skill in composition, both of shape and content, is showcased nicely in this image, contrasting as it does the portrait and interior in one half and the outside scene in the other, and also Olive\u2019s flowery dress juxtaposed with her Wellington boots and the churning mud outside.",
