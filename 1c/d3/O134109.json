He became a pupil of Corot in France and subsequently spent four years working for the Minton porcelain factory. He settled in London in 1870 and was engaged as a tutor to the royal family. \n\nRischgitz was essentially a landscape painter in the tradition inaugurated by Corot and the Realist movement in France. It depicts a group of people harvesting grapes in a sunny day. This painting is a fine example of his oeuvre characterised by a free brushwork, warm palette and subtle light effects. This type of painting was particularly popular in the second half of the 19th century.",

Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape paintings. It is not unlikely that Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist.",
