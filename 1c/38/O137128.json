Deeply influenced by the stage, his unique style was also inspired by erotica, fetishism and the urban scene. All his garments, whether classical or theatrical, display the same rigour of cut and line. The sculptural silhouette and dramatic beaded decoration of this black evening dress lend the garment an almost gothic feel. These features, coupled with the solid dominating colour, are representative of Mugler\u2019s work. In 2004 he stopped designing both couture and ready-to-wear, reducing his production to occasionally creating clothes for the stage.",
