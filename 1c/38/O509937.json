The drawing is squared in black chalk for transferring onto the canvas. This drawing is a fine example of Jouvenet\u2019s artistic practice as he favoured sketches of lone figures rather than studies of the whole composition. Jean Jouvenet (1649-1717) studied under Charles Le Brun who was one of the founder-members of the Acad\u00e9mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1648. Le brun was extremely concerned with the art education, including both theory and technique. Jouvenet followed his master's footpath in this matter and became director of the Acad\u00e9mie at the time of the execution of the present study and finished painting.",

The study of a head in profile on the top right corner is for the attendant bringing a tray on the right hand-side of the same painting. The drawing is squared in black chalk for transferring; this technique was often used as a method to transpose a preparatory study onto the definitive support. \n\nSchnapper notes that Jouvenet seems to work by creating a sketch of the idea, followed by a general composition, subsequently detailed sketches of individual sections and eventually a refined \u201cprojet d\u2019ensemble\u201d. His technique, thus, is one of technical repetition, working on part or whole of an image. This dynamic movement between projects of composition and detailed studies makes Jouvenet unique amongst his contemporaries.\n\nJouvenet made other preparatory drawings for the painting <i>Supper in the house of Simon</i>: two studies for the attendant at the far right is in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Lille (Inv. 3164), and in Alen\u00e7on (Inv. 869-1-13). Another drawing shows the group of guests facing the Christ (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm \u2013 Inv. 2759).\n\nThe painting was originally part of a decorative cycle including <i>Christ Driving the Money-changers from the Temple</i> (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon), the <i>Resurrection of Lazarus</i> and the <i>Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i> (both Louvre, Paris) made for the nave of the benedictine priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in Paris. The cycle was presented to the King Louis XIV in July 1705 when it was almost completed. The King was then so pleased that he ordered that tapestries should be made after the cycle. The tapestries were never achieved but Jouvenet supplied a cartoon after the <i>Supper in the house of Simon</i> to the Gobelins manufactory in 1711 (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Arras).\n\nJouvenet was one of the most important painters of religious works in France in the late 17th century and the early 18th , having painted his most famous religious works between 1695 and 1707. At the time of the <i>Supper in Emmaus</i>, in 1706, Jouvenet had been elected director of the Acad\u00e9mie and was about to became its rector.",
