She is very fond of knitted textiles within the home and attempts to push the boundaries of how these are perceived.  Baylis made 'Bed of Roses' for her final degree show; inspired by the title 'Inside, Outside' it brought together Baylis' fascination of both the outdoors and nature, and the domestic interior.  While 'Bed of Roses' was originally conceived as a product for the bathroom as a very individual bathmat due to its waterproof quality, Baylis has also worked with a lighting company to explore how the knitted  roses could be manufactured as fairy lights.  Baylis has also designed and made garden-inspired place mats, and knitted toparies and a hedge.",
