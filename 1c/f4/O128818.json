He studied at Haarlem Academy of Art, where he became a close friend of Maurits Escher, who has since become famous for his images made up of geometrical puzzles and illusions. Both students benefited from the training they received from their Portuguese tutor, Samuel Jesserum da Merquita. \n\nIn the period up to 1939 Visser made a number of woodcuts, engravings and linocuts.  During the Second World War he was appointed as a war artist when the Dutch government was in exile in London. Afterwards he continued to live in Britain, settling in East Anglia and becoming recognised as a portrait artist.",
