A graduate of Glasgow School of Art, she set up her own company, Squigee, in 1997.\n\nHer designs are characterised by a strong simple graphic, often abstract or semi-abstract organic forms, or simple geometric patterns, and take their inspiration from nature and architecture. Her designs have been used in several of the new boutique hotels such as Malmaison and Hotel du Vin. This example of her wallpaper is representative of the best in contemporary commercial wallpaper design, and is characteristic both of her use of strong simple graphics and her subtle palette of dark and neutral tones (this colourway is called 'Graphite').",
