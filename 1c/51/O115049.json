The individual narrative elements are encircled by ovoid frames that were cast separately and then joined to create a silhouette effect. Cast-iron jewellery was an inexpensive but fashionable novelty for consumers in Europe and America from around 1800 to 1860. Developed in Germany in 1806\u20137 and often worn during mourning, it became the symbol of Prussian patriotism and resistance to Napoleon I. Women donated gold jewellery to their country in exchange for iron inscribed \u2018I gave gold for iron\u2019. \n\nEarly Berlin ironwork was Neo-classical in style using motifs such as palmettes, acanthus leaves and cameos. After 1815 designs were inspired by Gothic art and architecture and by nature. The jewellery quickly gained an international profile. Demand peaked in the 1830s, when Berlin alone had 27 foundries and manufacture spread to France and Austria.",
