As she describes it: 'A web of spin develops to protect Tony Blair and his labour government from being blamed for the mistaken claim that Iraq had WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) \u2013 which justified attacking Iraq without UN support. Blair blames MI5 for the lack of intelligence \u2013 passing the buck to one of the most secretive branches of the state, thus adding to the confusion. A new director, John Scarlett, is appointed to MI5, promising a new \u201ctransparency\u201d, but he is known to be a Blair cronie and hardly one to challenge Blair\u2019s actions in Iraq.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
