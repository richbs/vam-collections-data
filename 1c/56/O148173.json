            "public_access_description": "Rudolph Ackermann (1764\u20131834) was an Anglo-German inventor and publisher. Born in Schneeberg, Saxony, Ackermann worked as a saddler and coach-builder in various German cities before moving to Paris and then London. In 1795 he married and established a printing shop at 96 Strand in London, moving to 101 Strand the following year. From 1817 he printed his popular illustrated magazine, Repository of Arts, published monthly until 1828. Thomas Rowlandson, Augustus Pugin and other distinguished artists of the day were regular contributors. Ackermann also printed literary annuals, such as Forget-Me-Not, and illustrated numerous volumes of topography and travel. His his first major colour-plate book, The Microcosm of London, was published in three volumes from 1808 to 1811 and illustrated with architectural backgrounds by Pugin and Rowlandson.  \n\nVery little is known of the artist, Miss Emma Farhill. She lived in Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, London, and won a silver medal in 'Polite Arts' from the Society of Arts in 1801 for a drawing of peasants in a storm.",
