            "public_access_description": "Shells and shapes inspired by shells were popular in the middle of the eighteenth century as they were seen as a perfect expression of the prevailing rococo fashion of the day.  Indeed the word 'rococo' derives from the French term 'rocailles' used to describe the ornament of shell-incrusted rocks found in fashionable grottoes and other architectural structures.  \n\nAt this time, the taking of snuff (finely-ground and blended tobacco) was considered a very fashionable past-time and the snuff-box became a necessary accessory for any person of taste and refinement.  Tobacco and snuff were expensive and seen as exotic and desirable. Different types of shell-shaped snuff boxes are found in precious metals, enamel and porcelain as the natural form is an ideal shape for a small box with a hinged cover.  At the Capodimonte porcelain factory in Naples boxes of this shape were some of the earliest items made and are described in the records as having small 'fruttiglie de mare' (fruits of the sea), on their covers.\n\nSnuff boxes were often given as gifts between those romanticaly involved, or would-be romantically involved.  This idea is reinforced here by the finely painted interior of the box.  The scene depicts Dido, Queen of Carthage, the tragic heroine from the classical text, Virgil's Aeneid, after her abandonment by the Trojan warrior Aeneas.",
