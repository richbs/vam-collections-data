These belts were usually based on the kind worn by the aristocracy in late medieval and renaissance times.  \n\nThe design of this belt, with cast gilded plaques with scenes from the life of the Virgin linked by a heavy silver panzer chain, is typical of those made in the west of Norway.  The loop on the right side of the belt, as it is worn, was used to carry the house keys, which were the prerogative and symbol of a married woman.\n\nIt carries the marks of Jonas Andersen, a silversmith who worked in Bergen in the mid 17th century.",
