He may also have travelled to Naples, Venice and Bologna. Around 1731 Boucher returned to Paris where he rapidly gained the royal favour and interest from the private collectors. He was a very prolific artist and produced a wide range of artworks from pastoral paintings, porcelain and tapestry designs as well as stage designs influencing deeply the new Rococo movement.\n\nThis grisaille was probably a decorative painting and may have been a coach panel or an overdoor. It depicts putti aloft among clouds embodying three zodiacal signs: Sagittarius, Scorpio and Libra. The design may derive from Boucher\u2019s compositions of putti but was probably made by a close follower.",

In 1725 he was commissioned by Jean de Julienne to undertake engravings after Watteau for the <i>Figures de diff\u00e9rents caract\u00e8res de paysages et d'\u00e9tudes</i>. In 1727 he was in Italy with Carle van Loo and on his return in 1731 he became an <i>agr\u00e9e</i> of the Acad\u00e9mie. Three years later he was called to Beauvais to design tapestries and ultimately became Inspector of the Paris Gobelins factory after Oudry's death in 1755. He was a profilic and popular painter, working for Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. In 1765 he was appointed Director of the Acad\u00e9mie, and <i>Premier Peintre du Roi</i> in succession to Van Loo. \n     Boucher was the most important figure among the second generation of French rococo painters and he exerted considerable influence both in painting and in the decorative arts. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> A Michel, <i>Boucher</i>, 1906; P. de Nolhac, <i>Boucher</i>, 1907.\n\n\nManner of Fran\u00e7ois BOUCHER \n\n43 \nTHREE CUPIDS WITH SIGNS OF THE \nZODIAC: SCORPIO, SAGITTARIUS, LIBRA \n<i>Grisaille on red ground</i> \n<i>Panel</i> \n19\u00be x 23 (50.2 x 58.3) \n4338-1857 \n\nOriginally acquired as 'after Boucher, probably by Martin' (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 176), the connection with Boucher is remote.

Four very similar panel attributed by Pierre Rosenberg to Lucas Auger (1655-1739), were exhibited by the Alan Jacobs Gallery in their Summer Exhibition, 1985, no. 35 (not illus. in the catalogue, since sold).\nThe iconography clearly derives from Boucher's compositions of putti. This panel depicts allegories of three signs of the Zodiac: (from left to right) Sagittarius, Scorpio and Libra in the guise of putti aloft among clouds. \nThere are no zodiac subjects in Boucher's oeuvre but he did a series of allegories of the arts including Music and Astrology (see <i>La peinture d\u00e9corative au XVIIIe si\u00e8cle</i>, 1912, pl. 5 and 6). This type of subject painted in the grisaille technique particularly suited decorative panels such as coach panel but it also may have been an overdoor from a set of allegorical panels.",

            "historical_context_note": "<i>Grisaille</i> is a term applied to monochrome painting carried out mostly in shades of grey. The use of the French word can be traced only to 1625, although grisaille paintings were made earlier. The origin of monochrome figure painting is to be found in Italian wall painting such as Giotto's painted the stone-coloured allegories of the Virtues and Vices, conceived as statues in fictive niches on the walls of the nave in the Arena Chapel in Padua (1303-06). Grisaille paintings typically occupied thematically or formally subordinate areas of compositions. In the large fresco programmes of the 16th-18th centuries grisaille helped convey illusionism. For example, in Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome (1508-12) the grisaille reliefs and caryatids help to thrust the nearby polychrome prophets and sibyls into the beholder's space.",
