Illustrated menus such as this were printed in advance on land with the inside (menu part) left blank, to be printed on board ship. Passengers often kept them as souvenirs. The menus reflect the luxury of cruise liner travel during its heyday. \"Oronsay\" was a new liner, making her maiden voyage in 1951. \n\nIllustrator and designer Dorrit Dekk (1917-1961) designed a number of dinner menus for P&O during the 1950s and 1960s. Originally from Czechoslovakia, Dekk moved to England in 1938 to study advertising design. She designed for companies such as P&O, London Transport, British Rail and the Post Office (GPO), and in 1951 she designed the Sports and Games section of The Festival of Britain. She was also a book illustrator and her work included a series on the Queens of England, written by Ralph Lawrence.",
