            "public_access_description": "Designs (two on one sheet) for a ring, drawn by an anonymous designer in about 1780. The tops of the rings are intended to be made out of enamelled plaques bordered with pearls, and are respectively lettered 'LCME' and 'L' surrounded by 'M's. The designs are possibly for an elite client of the Court of Louis XVI, King of France from 1774 until 1791, at Versailles, Paris.  The designs are from an album of designs which dates from about 1735-1820 and includes snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  The binding is red morocco and the boards are stamped in gilt with the arms, now partly erased, of a member of the Bourbon family, probably Louis-Henri, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1692-1740).\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
