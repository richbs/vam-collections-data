He was billed as \u2018The Greatest Quick-Change Artiste in the World\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nBorn in Liverpool in 1870, Roberts specialised as a \u2018protean actor\u2019, a combination of impressionist, quick-change artist and actor. He worked on the Liverpool stage before coming to London, where he became popular in variety. In Dick Turpin, he played all the characters as they met at the Spaniards Inn - Jacob Cly, Soft Sally, Jerry Binks, Lady Maud Rommander and Dick Turpin. In May 1905 he topped the bill with Dick Turpin at the Grand, Hanley, as well as appearing with it in London and New York. By 1909 he was commanding the considerable fee of \u00a355 a week at the Oxford Music Hall in London.",

Roberts had appeared previously at the Grand, during the week of 11 January 1904.  Roberts was a well-known 'protean actor', or impressionist who performed one-man sketches changing his appearance for different characters. Dick Turpin was one of his standard characters illustrated on a poster in the Public Record Office. It comes from the first of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
