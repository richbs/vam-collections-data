            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a monkey on a base.\n\nIt is highly probable that the development of katabori netsuke in the early 17th century was closely linked to the influence of Chinese seals, which were widely known in Japan at that time. The underside of a seal was carved in relief or intaglio with the Chinese characters that made up an individual\u2019s name. The upper part frequently featured a decorative carving. A seal could easily be converted into a netsuke by adding holes for a cord or by tying a cord to a suitable part of the carving. In such cases, the characters on the base were sometimes removed. From an early date, some netsuke were made in the form of both a seal and a netsuke and served a dual function, although they were often carved only with the characters for \u2018long life\u2019 or \u2018good luck\u2019 rather than with an individual\u2019s name. Yet other netsuke, such as this example, were made in the form of a seal but with no characters on the base. In this case the base is too thin to have been used as a seal.\n\nThe subject and form of this particular netsuke is derived from the Soken kisho, first published in 1781 and the only book of the Edo period (1615-1868) written directly about netsuke. It illustrates some of the more exceptional netsuke known at that time, including the design source of this example.",
