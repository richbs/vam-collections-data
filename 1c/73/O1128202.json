The garment has a full length princess line centre panel made up of bands of lace, embroidered insertion, and self fabric trimmed with feather stitch and tucks; the hem of the panel is finished with a two tier frill of scalloped broderie anglaise to match that used on the sleeves.  The robings running from the neck back to the panel hem are also made to match the sleeve frills.  The skirt is gathered to the bodice and finished with rows of tucks above the hem.  The garment fastens with drawstrings at neck and waist, and also with bound buttons and stitched buttonholes.",

The form of this layette was to last for almost a hundred and fifty years, and the long gown, having been previously associated with rituals such as Christening or Circumcision, became daily wear.  The baby was freed from swaddling, but enveloped in more and heavier garments than previously: binder, nappy, pilch or nappy cover, shirt or vest, two caps, bodice, barracoat (flannel wrapper), petticoats, gown, cape or shawl, bib or pinafore, socks and shoes.  Mass production techniques introduced during the 19th century created increasing consumer choice, and led to the abandoning of much of the exquisite but labour-intensive embroidery and finishing of the garments which had previously characterised infants' clothing.",
