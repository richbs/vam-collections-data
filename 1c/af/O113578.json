            "public_access_description": "This chair is one of the earliest furniture designs by Jasper Morrison (b.1959). He was inspired to design a chair comprised only of structural elements after he saw an antique example with its seat missing. He originally called this piece the Drinking Man's Chair, and the little metal disks at the end of the arms were intended to hold drinking glasses. He renamed it the Thinking Man's Chair. The more sophisticated name was inspired by the slogan 'The Thinking Man's Smoke' that appeared on the packet of pipe cleaners he bought to make a model of the chair. \n\nThe use of tubular steel recalls chairs of the 1920s and 1930s, and Morrison was an admirer of Modernist design of that period. With the early tubular steel furniture, functionalism dictated the structure. With this chair, the structure is more to do with free form. Nor did Modernist designers of the 1920s and 1930s paint their metal chairs in colours like this. Morrison's early prototypes included the dimensions of different steel elements painted onto the chair as a kind of decoration.  The Italian firm of Cappellini made the production versions of the chair, like this one, but omitted the writing.",

            "bibliography": "Jasper Morrison, 'Everything but the walls', Lars Muller publishers, 2002, p.7\n\"For a long time after I noticed an antique chair with its seat missing outside a shop I had the idea to do a chair consisting only of structural elements. Many sketches later I arrived at an approximation of the final shape, which included two small tables on the ends of the arms and an exotic assembly of curved metalwork.  It was to be called 'The Drinking Man's Chair'. On my way back from a tobacconist's shop with a packet of pipe cleaners to make a model with, I noticed the slogan 'The Thinking Man's Smoke' on the packet, which i quickly adapted as a more sophisticated title.  Later on with the prototype in front of me, destined for a show in Japan, I added the dimensions as a kind of surrogate decoration. Zeev Aram exhibited it in London at his showroom, and Guilio Cappellini, seeing it there, contacted me about producing it. That's how I got started with Cappellini.\"",
