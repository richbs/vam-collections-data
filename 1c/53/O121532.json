By the twentieth century the shapes and styles of the traditional dress were changing. One of the adaptations made was to shorten it and tailor it more sharply so that it outlined the contours of the body, allowing freer movement. \n\nThe qipao, or cheongsam as it is also known, became fashionable amongst women, especially those living in urban areas. To some, the qipao was a risqu\u00e9 garment because it exposed female flesh and accentuated the curves of the body. It is often associated with the high life of Shanghai and its glamour, and the style was popularized by cinema and the advertising industry.\n\nThis sleeveless qipao is made from a medium-weight silk with an allover pattern of differently-sized circles. The ground has a black and white swirling pattern and the circles are in red, blue, green, yellow and white. It closes to the side and has a small stand-up collar with a square edge. The neck fastens at the front with a decorative knot and loop button and a similar button closes the dress at the collarbone level. A loop and button in a spiral shape closes the dress under the arm and the remainder of the fastenings are press-studs.",
