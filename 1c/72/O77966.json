Each tier could hold water and each of its six spouts could hold a few cut flowers. Although the idea of making a ceramic pyramid originated in The Netherlands, the shape of such monumental vases was probably derived from a Chinese pagoda.\n\nPeople\nThe arms and motto of John Churchill (1650-1722) as Earl of Marlborough are incorporated in the painted decoration on the base of this object. Churchill held the title of Earl from 1689 until he became the 1st Duke of Marlborough in 1702. The motto 'FIEL PERO DESDICADO' ('Faithful, though unfortunate') is accompanied by symbolic figures of Justice, Faith, Charity and Wisdom.\n\nMary II (1662-1694) introduced the fashion for Dutch delftware to England when she returned from The Netherlands in 1689. Mary herself ordered large amounts of wares from Adrianus Kocx, proprietor of the prestigious 'Greek A' factory in Delft from 1686 to 1701. At the time of her death, she owed him \u00a3122 14s 9d for 'Dutch China or ware'. William III used splendid Delft pieces as royal gifts to his English nobles.\n\nMaterials & Making\nDutch blue and white earthenware imitated the highly fashionable Chinese porcelain that was imported in large quantities.",
