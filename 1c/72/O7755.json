On one side of the body in relief is Britannia holding a victory, with the inscription <font -i>Britannia Triumphant</font> and on the other Hercules slaying the hydra with the legend <font -i>Britons SWtrike Home</font>.  The lower portion of the body and the foot are decorated with a band of acanthus leaves and acorns and the rim has a floral scroll border within ropes.  Round the neck of the cover is surmounted by a lion is a band of laurel wreaths and berries.\n[Vase] The urn-shaped vase has two vertically scrolled, floret-paterai handles applied and mounted against foliate sprays. On the neck of the vase is an applied band of laurel set against a matt ground. On the shoulder is a chased floral scroll pattern. Below the shoulder is a double band of rope-work containing a scrolling band of flowers and foliage against a matt ground. On one side of the vase is an applied, cast and chased figure of Britannia, holding in her extended right hand the figure of Victory bearing a crown of laurel, and in her left hand a palm branch and a shield charged with a British Lion. This is accompanied by the inscription 'BRITANNIA TRIUMPHANT'. On the other side is a figure of a Greek warrior fighting a three-headed serpent. The figure is bearded and muscular. He wears a cloak and a Corinthian helmet and wields a short sword. It is clearly meant to represent Hercules slaying the Lernaean Hydra. It is accompanied by the inscription 'BRITONS STRIKE HOME'. Beneath the figures is an applied band of foliage, alternating oak sprays with water leaves.\n Leslie Southwick, 'The Silver vases awarded by the Patriotic Fund', <font -u>The Silver Society Journal</font>, Winter 1990, pp. 27-49\n[cover (closure)] The engraved cover has a gadrooned rim, surmounted by the figure of a lion in the round stalking an imaginary prey.",

The buffet as a decorative element in the dining room had regained favour in the late 18th century.\n\nPeople\nThe Patriotic Fund, a group of businessmen concerned to reward bravery in the Napoleonic War, held a competition to determine the design of the awards of swords, medals and vases. It was won by John Shaw's design for a vase. He received the top award of 50 guineas, but the artist and sculptor John Flaxman later modified the design for Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, the Royal Goldsmiths who had been commissioned to supply the vases. This vase was made by the silversmiths Benjamin Smith and Digby Scott, who managed Rundell's workshop from 1801 to 1807.\n\nDesign\nThe overall form of the vase was copied from that of the Greek volute krater. Examples of this antique  vessel used for mixing wine and water were well known from illustrations and from the collection of Sir William Hamilton, which was bought and displayed by the British Museum in 1772.  The figure of Britannia on one side of  the vase ultimately derives from ancient Greek images of the goddess Athena, while on the other, the warrior slaying the serpent must be intended to represent the Greek hero Herakles destroying the Hydra. Numerous parallels exist in classical art for both reliefs, and the sophisticated reworking of the iconography suggests that John Flaxman was responsible for the designs. The vases cost between \u015335 and  \u0153651, depending on the size and elaboration of the ornament. The most expensive (\u0153651 5s) was awarded to Admiral Lord Nelson's widow. As this vase was not inscribed it is quite likely that it was never awarded.",
