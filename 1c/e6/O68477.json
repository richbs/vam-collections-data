Some make explicit references to pattern and decoration and in his own writings Rhodes has used terms such as 'weave', 'knot' and 'layering' to describe both the process and the resulting image. \n\nThese drawings also have an obvious analogy to networks and maps. Rhodes is an inveterate traveller, who thinks a great deal about the links between places, and the elliptical process of re-visiting and returning. The titles chosen for this sequence of drawings [see also 'Blink', E.914-2002] relate specifically to the passage of time, to interval, repetition and reiteration - here the drawing comprises only three overlaid loops of colour, suggesting a lapse of time between events/journeys. It may be pertinent that the artist has lived for extended periods in Venice, a city which is peculiarly constructed as an intricate tracery of overlapping loops of water and of streets and bridges; he revisits it regularly and finds it a constant source of solace and of inspiration.",
