It was owned by Samantha (b. 08/01/1978) and her brother when she was seven years old. Amsoft, the company that made the game, was based in Brentwood Essex and was owned by Amstrad. The company published games between 1984 and 1989 for Amstrad's range of 8-bit computers, the Amstrad CPC. The Amstrad colour personal computer was one of three market leading home computers in the 1980s along with the Spectrum ZX and the Commodore 64. Games were purchased in a tape format and were loaded into the in-built tape deck and could take around 20 minutes to load before they could be played.",
