The game has 61 playing spaces illustrating geese, bridges, dice, houses, a pond, a skull, and gold coins. The rules, conveniently printed in the middle of the game give rewards and  penalties. The game also contains moralistic elements. Landing on a goose allows the player to 'double his chance forward', while if a player lands at the ale house, he or she incurs a double penalty of paying one stake and waiting until all the other players have had a turn. Some penalties are even more severe. Landing on death or overshooting the end space means that  the player has to go back to the beginning again.",
