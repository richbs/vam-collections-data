Exhibited 42 works, mostly portraits, at the RA between 1816 and 1845 (when he is supposed to have had a dispute when his pictures were refused) and six subject pictures at the BI 1831-56. Visited Paris in 1814, copying paintings in the Louvre, and lived for many years in Rome, where he copied old masters and attempted fresco painting. He painted copies of Raphael's arabesque decorations and panels in the Vatican Loggia for the V&A which were acquired in 1843. Died Southampton, November 1871.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1872, p75 (obit); <i>The Times</i> 30 May 1958 \n\n<b>Ganymede Feeding the Eagle</b> \n159-1865 Neg GJ5988 \nFresco, 61 x 49.5 cm (24 x 19\u00bd ins) \nGiven by Sir Matthew White Ridley BI 1865 \n\nAccording to an old label (see below), painted in Rome, in the manner of an antique Roman fresco. The Art Journal gave a fuller account quoting an obituary of Evans in the <i>Hampshire Telegraph</i> published late in 1871: \n\nDuring his residence in Rome he experimentally practised fresco-painting, and, on giving up his studio there, presented one of these paintings, which he did not care to take with him, to the attendant who swept out the studio. Many years afterwards, when on a visit to the Kensington Museum, he was astonished to find this identical fresco hanging up there, it having been presented by the executors of a wealthy connoisseur as a genuine piece of antique fresco-painting from a tomb in the neighbourhood of Rome. He examined his original sketch of the subject [presumably 36-1870 p89], made a special journey to London, convinced Mr Redgrave, the Director-General for Art, that the fresco was really his work, and not an antique, and the picture now hangs at the foot of one of the staircases in the Kensington Museum, with its real history attached to it. \n\nThe most famous modem depiction of the god Jupiter and his youthful companion and cup-bearer Ganymede is also a fresco, painted by Anton Mengs in 1758-9 in imitation of antique Herculanaeum wall-painting and intended to deceive his friend, the connoisseur Winckelmann. Evans, however, seems to base the pose of Ganymede on Michelangelo's famous marble sculpture of 'Bacchus' (Bargello, Florence). He depicts] up iter in the traditional guise of an eagle. \n\nThe old label reads: \n\nGanymede feeding the Eagle. /Fresco, painted at Rome, by Richard Evans, in the manner of the antique Roman frescoes./Presented by Sir M W Ridley, Bart, MP, with relation to the durability of modem fresco painting./This work was purchased in 1836, by the late Sir MW Ridley, Bart, from Capranesi of Rome,/together with another fresco, now in the British Museum, which is a true work of antiquity./Capranesi stated that they were taken from a tomb in the Via-Appia./This fresco was however subsequently recognized by Mr R Evans, as his own work.\n \nSir Matthew Ridley (1807-77) gave two fresco paintings to the British Museum in 1865. Of the first, the head and torso of a man, the 1933 catalogue states: 'This fragment is said to have come from the \"Baths of Titus\" (ie the Golden House of Nero). It is much repainted and the style and accessories are not antique in feeling'. Of the other, a flute-player, the catalogue records: \n\nThis fragment is said to have been found in a columbarium on the Via Appia in 1823. The whole surface is so completely covered with modern paint that no trace of ancient work is visible; and in view of the exceptionally large scale, and the sentimental pose, it is very probable that the whole figure is a 19th century fabrication, and not merely a heavily restored original (A P Hinks <i>Catalogue of the Greek Etruscan and Roman Paintings and Mosaics in the British Museum</i> 1933, p62, nos 91 and 92, repr figs 69, 70). \n\nIt seems likely that the latter painting is also the work of Richard Evans, as there are similarities in style and mood to the present work. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1872, p75\"",
