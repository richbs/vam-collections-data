The cover is of laminated white paper, the front printed with a coloured illustration (signed LRS) of a blonde child wearing a pair of green and white checked knickers, who is seated by a blue vase full of sprays of a pink-flowered shrub and gazing at a blue butterfly hovering over the flowers; the back cover carries the firm's trade mark printed in blue.  The pages are of white laminated paper printed in black, with black and white line illustrations of the goods, which include baby clothes, cots, layette baskets, children's hats, cot bedding, toiletries, and sanitary towels and accessories.   Pages 15 to 20 are perforated, and can be removed: 16 to 19 show the sanitary goods, which would not necessarily have been stocked by all Cook's customers, and 20 shows details of prices.",
