It was made by Patrick Caulfield in 1972 for the knitwear label Ritva which was established in 1966 by Mike and Ritva Ross. Caulfield was one of several friends and acquaintances whom they approached to design limited \u2019artist's edition\u2018 sweaters in the early seventies. Others included David Hockney and Allen Jones.\n\nCaulfield referred to his 1972 design as the \u2019Manly Sweater\u2018. An ironic take on 1950s\u2019 masculinity, the sweater had various leather patches on the elbows and arms. The drawing depicts the details of the pipe and bird emblems intended for the breast pocket of the sweater. Another design for the sweater is in the collection (Museum no. E.413-2005).\n\nThe sweater was eventually produced in two colours: white and green. Each had a unique label signed by the artist. In 2000, the V&A acquired one of the 25 or so sweaters made to Caulfield's design. The sweater and the drawings together comprise a useful document of fashion history, uniting first designs and finished article.",
