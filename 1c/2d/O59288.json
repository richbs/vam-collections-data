Specialised dining utensils became essential at a time when touching food was frowned upon except in a few instances, such as eating bread rolls, cheese and some fruit. It would, however, have been impolite to serve yourself from the bread basket or to pass bread without the bread fork.\n\nFood & Drink\nBread was a staple food for rich and poor alike. Bread and cheese formed one of the most common midday meals for working men and women. The same foods, served more elegantly in cheese dishes, butter dishes, bread baskets and platters were offered at society dinners between the puddings and jellies and the dessert. Bread and butter were important components of other meals and as refreshment at social events such as afternoon tea, luncheons and supper parties.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBread forks have a short handle and are generally three-pronged, in a trident style, with curved outer tines (prongs). As this example demonstrates, they can be highly ornate with silver, ivory or mother-of-pearl handles. In the 1890s they could be purchased individually for between 3s (15p) and 25s (\u00a31.25) or in a boxed set with a bread knife for up to \u00a31 10s (\u00a31.50), depending on the materials and design.",

The successful development and marketing of electroplate as a cheaper substitute for silver must be credited to George Richard Elkington (1800-65) and his cousin and partner Henry Elkington (c.1810-52).  The commercial use of earlier experiments with electormetallurgy began with the patent taken out by the Elkingtons in 1840.  The cousins were not inventors as such but innovators who, by applying the process to an industry, revolutionised the silver and plating trades all over the world.  Licences to make the new products were sold widely in England and abroad.  Within 10 years, electroplate had won respectability and acceptance, even in high society and the art world.  It was displayed prominently on the Elkington stand at the Great Exhibition of 1881.",
