Visited Low Countries 1827, Italy 1834-5. Settled in London 1838. Early subjects mainly landscapes and coastal scenes, then portraits, finally scenes from English and Italian history. Died Chelsea, London, 29 August 1847. His two brothers, George (1791-1862) and David (1803-74), were also artists. \n\nLIT:<u> Art Union </u>1847, p353 (obit); M H Grant <u>Old English Landscape Painters</u> vol 8, 1961, pp705-7 \n\n\n<b>Gil Blas Introducing Himself to Laura </b>\nFA181 Neg V1939 \nCanvas, 91.4 X 67.8 cm (36 X 26\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 1840 \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1840 as 'Gil Blas Introduces Himself to Laura as His Master Don Mattias de Silva', with the following quotation appended to the title in the catalogue: \n\n'I threw myself in a transport at the feet of my nymph; and the better to imitate the beaus, pressed her in a petulant manner to make me happy. She seemed a little moved by my entreaties, but thought it was too soon to yield; therefore, pushing me gently from her, 'Hold', said she, 'you are too forward, and have the air of a libertine; I am afraid you are no better than a downright rake'. \n\nThe subject is from book 3 chapter 5 of the picaresque romance<u> Gil Blas</u> by Alain le Sage, published 1715-35 and translated into English by Tobias Smollett in 1749. \nThe<u>Art Union</u> obituarist in 1847 thought the exhibited works of 1840 'call for little notice: they were scarcely of sufficient importance to increase or even uphold the well-earned fame of the artist; though one of them, \"Gil Blas introducing himself to Laura\", found its way into the collection of Mr Sheepshanks'. <u>The Art Union</u> had been hardly more complimentary in 1840; with the 'Titian in his Study': 'Two well composed and highly finished works, but of scarcely sufficient importance to increase or even uphold the well earned fame of the artist. He is one to whom we look for some great undertaking that shall be honourable to the country and the arts'. The<u> Athenaeum</u> critic wrote: \n\nThe false Don Mathias de Silva drops on his knees, with a delicious air of high-life-below-stairs gallantry, while his nymph keeps him off with her fan, in a manner copied from the best models, which is calculated to attract rather than repel further advances.. both gentleman and lady wearing a whimsical air of make-believe tenderness, thoroughly accordant with the spirit of the wittiest but most heartless of all novels ... But there is a disproportion in the girl's figure, not merely, as in the case of Mr Knight's 'Melody', between itself and the canvas, but in its several parts; her head is too large, too heavily set upon her shoulders, and, were all as it should be, the clumsiness, which would befit another serving woman - Moliere's Nicole, for instance, enhancing the effect of the convulsions of stupid laughter, with which she regards a George Dandin when he parades before her in all the trappings of nobility - is misplaced when a subtle, keen-witted, saucy Spanish girl is the subject. Mr Simson too, has not wholly freed himself from that inkiness of tone \nin his shadows, which gives his colouring a disagreeable harshness and chillness of effect. \n\nA sketch for the painting was exhibited at the RSA in 1847 (321). \n\nEXH: RA 1840 (404);<i> Victorian Narrative Paintings</i> V&A Circulation exhibition 1961 \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum </u>30 May 1840, p435; <u>Art Union</u> 1840, p76, 1847, p353 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>The Scotsman</u>, 18 September, 1847\nOrbituary on the artist, states that this painting was bought directly from Simson by John Sheepshanks in 1839 for 100 guineas.\nVictoria and Albert Museum <u>Charles Dickens: An exhibition to celebrate the centenary of his death</u> London: HMSO, 1970.
