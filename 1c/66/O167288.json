Specialised kilns were set up in north and south China, often close to building sites. The tiles were mass-produced and then hand-finished with finer decorative details.\n\nThis figure, shaped as a lion, was part of an elaborate architectural decoration placed on the top ridge of a roof, probably a Buddhist temple. A vase or another Buddhist symbol was originally fitted into the draped vase on the animal's back. The lion is a popular animal in Buddhist iconography, and it is often depicted as the vehicle of Manjusri, Bodhisattva of Wisdom.",
