Kate Greenaway is known for her drawings and watercolour illustrations of quaint children in bonnets, sailor suits and pinafore dresses. She drew from life and made the clothes worn by her models.  Her career took off around 1877 when Edmund Evans, a well known printer of children's books, risked printing large numbers of a book of her verses and illustrations. Despite being sold at six shillings instead of sixpence, Under the Window still sold out at Christmas in 1878. Under the Window and The Birthday Book established a following for Kate Greenaway almanacs and calendars for the next 20 years. As with Beatrix Potter, the enthusiasm for her characters was exploited through the sale of dolls, wallpaper, fabrics, christening sets and clothes.",
