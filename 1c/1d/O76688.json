They have a lace fastening at the centre back of the heel with a tongue. The eyelet holes are hand worked. The lace trimming around the top is arranged in a gathered frill with the made up ribbon bow attached at the front. This made be an addition to the original design to match it to the dress. The 'sock' is of cotton. The sole is of beige kid with an impressed design of a gold cornucopia of flowers under the instep and a flower on the centre of the sole, possibly covering the 'sole-stamp'. The boots are machine stitched. There are woollen laces but it is not certain that these are original.",

They have lacing at the back and are trimmed at the top with bobbin lace and ribbons.\n\nFrivolous boots of silk and silk satin, some with high heels, were imported into England from France in the 1860s and 1870s. These French styles were also imitated by English shoemakers.  The French influence was due to the stylish Empress Eugenie who had married the French emperor, Napoleon III, in 1853. She was probably responsible for the introduction of the shorter skirt which led to a greater emphasis on stockings and shoes. \n\nAdditionally, by about 1860 chemical aniline dyes were widely available. Many of the colours they provided were rather gaudy, such as this bright red.",
