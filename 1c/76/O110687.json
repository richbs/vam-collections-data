Ideas were also transmitted by terracotta models, plaquettes and engravings, as well as by decorative objects for which sculptors had provided designs.The Nuremberg sculptor Peter Fl\u00f6tner was one of the most versatile artists and designers of the German Renaissance. His virtuosity as a sculptor is evident from his plaquettes in lead, bronze and Solnhofen limestone. Fl\u00f6tner produced several series of plaquettes, among them The Virtues, Eminent Women of Classical Antiquity and The Seven Gods of the Planets. The frequency with which goldsmiths and other craftsmen copied his reliefs is an indication of their popularity.",
