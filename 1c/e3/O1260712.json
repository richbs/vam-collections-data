            "public_access_description": "Grenadian born photographer Raphael Albert (1935-2009) was committed to celebrating the growing black population in Britain. Whilst living in Hammersmith, West London he began to organise and photograph a host of black beauty pageants from the 1960s to the 1980s, mostly targeted at women from the British Caribbean community. \n\nPrizes for winning contestants often included music records. The woman on the corner of the makeshift stage displays the Jimmy Cliff record \u2018The Harder They Come\u2019 released in 1972, which accompanied the Jamaican crime film of the same name starring Cliff. Both the film and the music it featured helped to popularise reggae music in Britain, showing the mainstream success of Caribbean culture.    \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired seven of Albert\u2019s photographs documenting beauty pageants and the British Caribbean community in London as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
