The original drawing was created at the University of Toledo, Ohio, in 1967. \n\nEschbach was born in 1940, in Toledo. He studied at the University and was employed there for many years. His artworks were included in the Computer Art exhibition at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, 1967,  and in Cybernetic Serendipity, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, 1968.  A version of the Boxes image was exhibited at the Tendencies 4 exhibition in Zagreb in 1969.\n\nBoxes is reproduced in the book published to accompany the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition, which also includes the following description:\n\n\"The corner of each rectangle was generated by random numbers. The X dimension of the box was determined as 1.09 times the X co-ordinate. This produces a design which has squares on the diagonal and rectangles on each side as you move away from the diagonal. The design was made on an IBM 1620 with an IBM 1627 plotter, and was programmed in Fortran\" (p.94)",
