From about the1880s, if a child needed a warm outer garment, the knitted jumper (and slightly later the cardigan) were available.  Children's jumpers were stocked by some shops but were often made at home. Patterns could be readily bought and were published free in popular periodicals, or copiable if a neighbour had one.\n  \nKnitted clothing also had the advantage of a certain amount of elasticity to accommodate a child's growth, and was thrifty.  If need be a jumper could be unravelled and knitted up again in a larger size, with a contrasting welt and cuffs of some other yarn, or in stripes using up several old garments.",
