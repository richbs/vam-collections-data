On the cover of the folio (now missing) that contained the group was an inscription, so Luther Hooper said in his typescript catalogue, reading 'Pattern book of Liddiard & Co. Circa 1718'.  Most of the designs in this group are inscribed 'L & Co.' with a number, all in ink.\n\nIt is clear that many of the drawings in this group are by James Leman.  Ten of them bear his signature, in some cases followed by the word 'fecit' which means 'made'; while a further half dozen or so have had his signature cut out.  This particular design has had Leman's signature cut out. We do not know why the signature has sometimes been cut out but the typical flourishes with which he signed his name are still visible.",
