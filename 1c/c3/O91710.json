This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread. According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass. The bowls of silver chalices are usually gilded inside, to emphasize the precious nature of their contents and to protect the metal.\n\nThe contrast of cut-card work (pierced sheet silver additions), chased architectural borders and gadrooning (borders of convex ribs) with plain surfaces makes this chalice a handsome example of the austere but elegant R\u00e9gence style. The arms of Louis I, Prince of Monaco, are engraved inside the bowl. He probably commissioned it for his embassy to the Holy See in Rome on behalf of Louis XIV in 1698. A chalice is listed in a 1701 inventory of the belongings that returned with him to Monaco. The engraving of Golgotha (where Christ was crucified) indicates the front of the chalice.",
