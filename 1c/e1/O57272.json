He may be descended from the family of Robins who held the manor of Matson. He published a Prospect of Bath in 1757 and A View of the Baths and Pump Room in 1764. His son Thomas Robins the Younger was a drawing master.\n\nBetween 1747 and 1770, Robins produced a series of drawings and paintings of English country houses and, in particular, their gardens. His surviving drawings and paintings epitomise English rococo taste. Robins was either specially attracted to rococo gardens, or had a reputation for the delineation of such gardens in the circles of cognoscenti of the rococo. \n\nRobins and his work are of significant interest both topographically and aesthetically. His pictures of rococo gardens, with their vistas and ornamental buildings, are of great historical importance because they immortalise a fashion whose exemplars have disappeared. Robins, who was in many respects an 'amateur' painter, never succumbed to conventional facility and his views retain the charm and freshness of a personal discovery.",
