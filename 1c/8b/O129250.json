Dranger designed the Media Chair as a flexible and adaptable hub for different activities, such as listening to music, reading, watching television, or conversing.  Thus, the chair is fitted with a reading light, a bag for papers or remote controls, and a foldaway writing table complete with drink stand. It even came with a detachable ashtray (not visible), an indicator of the changed norms of behaviour since this chair was new. Had he designed the chair a decade or so later, no doubt Dranger would also have incorporated a computer keyboard and wiring for internet access. This was a prescient design that responded to lifestyle changes in a fast moving world.",
