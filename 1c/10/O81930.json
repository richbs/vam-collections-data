Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>78 A Lady Carew</b>\n<b>1655-60</b> \nD92 \n\n<b>Oval 59 x 48 mm</b> \n\nFeatures firmly hatched in brown and sanguine, with a little blue-grey in the shadow and touches of gouache in the highlights, on a thick creamy carnation ground; hair washed and hatched in browns; the dress in transparent lake, hatched and modelled in darker colours; the cloak in opaque grey and white; background a landscape washed and hatched in gouache; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Multiple small losses with old retouches; marginal abrasions; some fading in the flesh; mainly sound. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> In gold, centre left: <i>SC</i> (interlaced) (see E in Appendix 2). <b>Inscribed</b> on the back, in graphite: <i>92</i>. A label packed in the frame is inscribed in ink: <i>50 Gs / bought / at Wellenborough / House. the seat / of the late Lord / Sussex - in / april 18[0?6?] 1</i> and written across, possibly by a different hand: <i>Cooper's / Wife / by Cooper</i>; and in graphite: <i>48</i>. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century copper-gilt rim of V-section holding a convex glass in a rebate at the front; the back closed by a toothed copper strip. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> According to the label (above), the Earls of Sussex. Their main seat was at Easton Maudit in Northamptonshire, not at Welling borough (also Northamptonshire) nor at Wellingsborough (Leicestershire). Henry Yelverton, 3rd Earl of Sussex, was born on 7 July 1728 and died on 22 April 1799, when the earldom became extinct. Between 1801 and 1843 the sixth son of George III was known as the Duke of Sussex, and the earldom was subsequently revived in 1874 in favour of Victoria's third son, Prince Arthur. This history makes the reading of the date in the inscription preferably 1801 rather than 1861. There is no record, however, of a Wellenborough House sale of the effects of the 3rd Earl (who was, incidentally, succeeded by his grandson, the gay dandy Lord Grey de Ruthyn). Acquired by Alexander Dyce, presumably from the retail trade, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1869. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Redgrave 1874, p. 8 (said to be of the Painter's Wife, but more probably of Lady Carew of Antony');WilliamsonI904, vol. I, p. 72 'not Cooper's wife'); Holmes 1906, repro. facing p. 295, no. 3 (with a mistaken caption); <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 8 (\u2018a copy' and said to be \u2018on ivory'); Foster 1914-16, vol. Il, p. 16 (as a copy on ivory of the Carew Pole original); Long 1930, p. 13 (\u2018an old copy' and nature of support corrected); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nA version of the portrait in the possession of Sir Richard Carew Pole, Bart. (1) The background to the left and the treatment of the hair against it, together with the unhatched state of the cloud background and the generally beautiful quality, should suggest that this is at least the beginning of an autograph replica rather than a miserable copy by another and later hand, as once believed by the Museum. Technically, the work falls solidly within the range of Cooper's practice, as it can be seen in other unfinished miniatures such as those in the present catalogue or the great series in the Royal Collection. Like other work either deliberately retained by Cooper in his studio to provide a pattern for further versions, or simply never finished by him, this miniature may have been 'tidied up' and provided with a signature after Cooper's death. But there seems to be very little such intervention in this instance, and the miniature stands as one of the most beautiful, curiously hieratic, images of women produced by Cooper in the late 16S0s. In terms of visual idiom its best point of comparison is the Elizabeth, Mrs Claypole (Cat. No. 74). \n\nThe question of the sitter's identity raises more legitimate questions. The family provenance of the finished version provides fair evidence that the sitter was one of the Carew ladies. In the Cooper exhibition (2) she was called firmly <i>Lady Carew, wife of Sir John Carew (died 1660)</i>, and the <i>Sir John Carew</i> (3) was said to be an image of the Regicide. The Regicide, however, was plain John Carew, eldest son of Sir Richard Carew of Antony (created Baronet in 1641) by his second wife Grace (born Rolle) whom he married in 1621. Plain John Carew passed the years 1653-60 mostly in confinement or compulsory exile in Cornwall, returning to Westminster in 1659 (to be fined for non-attendance at Parliament) and in 1660 for his trial and execution. He does not seem to have married. \n\nSir Richard's son by his first marriage was Alexander (plain John's elder halfbrother), who succeeded his father in 1642/3 and was executed in 1644. He was succeeded by his son, John Carew (1635-1692), the 3rd Baronet ofAntony, who may well be the sitter for the miniature shown in the Cooper exhibition, his age being exactly right for the date of the portrait. The 3rd Baronet had two wives: Sarah, born Hungerford (married 'before 1664', d.1671), and Elizabeth, born Norton. Sarah is therefore the likely sitter. But as a caution, it should be noted that the <i>Sir John</i> and <i>Lady Carew</i> miniatures do not constitute a pair and that there is no real reason to suppose that the Lady necessarily belonged with the Baronet at all. \nAs to the iconography of the Regicide, the standard image is of him in a group surrounding Cromwell, <i>The Regicides executed in 1660</i>, by an anonymous engraver, the frontispiece of a pamphlet <i>Rebels no Saints</i> (1660). As with all such images, it is nearly useless for establishing likeness. Another portrait is referred to in E Evans, <i>Catalogue of a Collection of Engraved Portraits</i> (n.d.), no. 1825, as a quarto, with date of death given as 1650. \n\nThe miniature, <i>Sir John Carew</i>, was also exhibited and identified as the Regicide in the exhibition <i>The Age of Charles II</i>. (4) The error is repeated in Davies (5) and compounded by the statement that the V&A has a version of the Sir John. The confusion seems originally to have been Foster's (6) where Sir John is said to be in the V&A. \n\nI Repro.
