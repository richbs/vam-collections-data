Small box shaped examples can also be used to carry communion to the sick. This Portuguese silver-gilt example from 1540 is decorated with the figure of a bird on the cover, known as the Pelican in her Piety. According to legend, when the pelican could not find food for her young, she plucked her breast and fed them with her own blood. The pelican\u2019s self sacrifice became a symbol of Christ\u2019s sacrifice for humanity and is often found on objects associated with the mass as well as in jewellery.\n\nThe Old Testament scenes around the sides of the pyx show events which foreshadow the life of Christ. For example, the sacrifice of Isaac by his father Abraham echoes the sacrifice of Christ on the cross.",

This iconography would have been clearly understood in the past but it may be less familiar to modern eyes. \n\nThough often decorative, the symbols used on religious metalwork also refer to the function and significance of the objects. The contemplation of religious motifs can draw   believers into a deeper understanding of their faith. Complex theological themes can be represented in a visual form. A chalice, for example, might be adorned with the tools used in the Crucifixion (the 'Instruments of the Passion') to direct the viewer's mind towards Christ's sacrifice and his death on the cross.\n\nThe use of images has caused controversy throughout Christian history. While supporters held that imagery glorified God and helped believers understand their faith better, critics attacked its use as superstition and idolatry.\n\nSaints\nChristians venerate saints as men and women who, through the holiness of their lives, became especially close to God. The saints include martyrs who suffered and died for their faith as well as great teachers and preachers. Their lives provide an example and inspiration for the faithful. Roman Catholics also believe that saints can intercede on their behalf with God. In Christian iconography, saints are usually depicted with a distinctive object or 'attribute' associated with their martyrdom or works. For example, St Bartholomew, who was skinned alive, holds a flaying knife, and St George is shown with a dragon.",
