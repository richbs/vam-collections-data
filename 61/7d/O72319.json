In 1856 the Indian Amateurs Photographic Album became the first publication to use a series of such photographs to depict the \u2018Costume and Characters of Western India\u2019. Individuals were shown in costumes or with objects identifying their caste or trade group. The pictures illustrated racial differences as well as regional variations in dress. This group of photographs was probably part of a set of \u2018forty-five photographs of native heads\u2019, which was displayed at the London International Exhibition in 1871.",
