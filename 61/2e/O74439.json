It was used to cool wine glasses by hanging them by their feet from the notched edge into iced water. Monteiths became fashionable in the last quarter of the 17th century and some examples such as this one have a detachable rim and can also be used as a punch bowl. \n\nThe design around the sides of the bowl shows a racing scene appropriate for its use as a race prize. It was won by Edward Chute at the Basingstoke Races on the date inscribed - October 2nd,1688. Horse racing had begun under the Tudors in the first half of the sixteenth century at Chester (1511) and York (1530) but it did not become a nationwide sport until the 1680s. As racing was principally supported by the wealthy,  prizes were often valuable and often consisted of silver cups and plate.",

However, that struggle reduced the family's fortune considerably and the 6th Lord Sandys was forced to sell the house in 1653 and retreat to his other home at Mottisfont Abbey.  \n\nThe Vyne was bought by Chaloner Chute a wealthy barrister who later became a Member of Parliament and Speaker of the House.  He carried out various alterations to the house before his death in 1659. His grandson, Edward Chute (1658-1722) married in 1686 Katherine, daughter of Sir Anthony Keck, Commissioner of the Great Seal, and widow of Ferdinand Tracy. He was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1699 and known as a staunch supporter of the House of Hanover.",
