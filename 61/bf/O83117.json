Weber\u2019s chiselled models are sexy yet innocent, sculptural but relaxed, and create an image of clean-cut, all-American athleticism. It is the human factor in Weber\u2019s fashion images which is dominant, rather than the clothing; and his choice of models defines his style as much as his carefully controlled lighting.",
