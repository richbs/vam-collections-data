Designed with an archway with its flanking walls, and through the arch is seen a tall tree laden with white roses with confronting tigers beside the trunk and parroquets and nightingales amid the branches. The side walls are each divided into four rectangular compartments painted with flowering stems around a peacock, or a cypress tree or a vase of flowers. The pendentives of the arch are filled with peacocks amid white flowering stems. Running round the whole is a border of alternative large and small rosettes and leaves, and a debased kind of battlementing. The curtain is backed with a block-printed cotton door-curtain with a lobed arch beneath which is a cypress tree, peacocks and tigers on a mound on a white ground covered with undulating floral stems. On three sides is a fivefold border of wavy floral stems and small floral motives.",
