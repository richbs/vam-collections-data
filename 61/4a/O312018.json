It is based on a similar type of lamp, which was probably made in Brescia in the 16th century.\nThe lamp is in the form of an ewer with a projecting spout, the body decorated with vertical ribs, the shoulder with acanthus leaves and the cover with dolphins radiating from the centre. The handle takes on the form of a monster.\nThe object is from the Salting bequest. George Salting (b. 1836; d. 1909) - an Australian, who settled in England - was a prolific collector in a number of areas, including Chinese and Japanese ceramics and European art. By 1874 his collection had outgrown his residence in St. James's Street, prompting him to lend items to the South Kensington Museum. After his death in 1909, the majority of this astonishing collection passed to the V&A, where it was shown in its own galleries.",
