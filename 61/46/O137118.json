M. Queen Elizabeth since 1960 and the Queen Mother from 1993 until her death in 2002.\n\nThe brassiere first appeared in the 1910s. By the 1950s it was an essential undergarment along with the girdle, but as the girdle gradually disappeared, the bra and pants set became ubiquitous. Rigby and Peller are known for classic designs that are both decorative and practical.",
