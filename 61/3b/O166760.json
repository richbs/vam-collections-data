There is a copy in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. It formerly carried the signature of William Henry Hunt, which was cut off before the drawing entered the Museum. Pignatti (1969) (who agrees with Constable\u2019s dating, about 1755-57) publishes a drawing in a Zurich collection (pl. 54) which shows eight actors on a stage and was probably drawn on the same occasion, the five actors on the right being almost the same as in our drawing, with Arlecchino on the right and Mezzetino in the middle.\nExhibition catalogue\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design & Department of Paintings Accessions 1934</u> London: Published under the Authority of the Board of Education, 1935\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n<b>CANALETTO, Antonio (1697-1798).</b>\nA theatrical performance on the piazza di San Marco, Venice.\n     <i>Pen and ink and wash.</i>     (8 3/16 x 12 1/2)                                                                E. 3792-1934.\n                                                            Bequeathed by Edith, Lady Powell. \n     <i>Note.</i>-This drawing is from the collections of Archdeacon Charles Par Burney, his daughter, Mrs. Rosetta d'Arblay Wood and her younger daughter, Edith mary Burke Wood (Lady powell).

A similar drawing, apparently an early 19th century copy, is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.\n\nHistorical significance: Giovanni Antonio Canal, called Canaletto began his career by assisting his father Bernardo Canal (1664?-1744) in producing stage scenery. He accompanied his father to Rome in 1719-20. It was in Rome that he began to paint topographical views. Following his return to Venice in 1720 he seems to have stopped painting scenery completely in favour of producing topographical paintings. Following the example of Luca Carlevarijs, the first main exponent of Venetian <i>veduta</i> or view paintings, Canaletto began to produce more accurate views of Venice following his return. Canaletto's works appealed specifically to foreign visitors to the city and one of his key patrons was Consul Joseph Smith (c.1674-1770). From the 1740s Canaletto began to produce <i>Capricci</i>, which combine fanciful architecture and landscapes. In 1746 he travelled to England where he painted views of London and country houses for a number of English patrons. He remained almost entirely in England until 1755 when he returned to Venice. He was elected a member of the Venice Academy in 1763.\n\nCanaletto produced his drawings on two standard sizes of paper, measuring approximately 27 x 38 cm and 19 x 27 cm. This drawing measures 20.7 x 30.8 making it close to the smaller of these two standard sizes. The fine calligraphic handling of pen and ink dates this drawing to Canaletto's return to Venice from England (about 1755-7). The drawing is close to one in a private collection in Zurich which shows eight actors on the stage. The group of five actors on the right of the stage in the Zurich drawing, with the figure of Arlecchino on the right and Mezzetino in the middle, is close to those in E.3792-1934, suggesting that both were drawn on the same occasion. Curled lines are used to represent the figures gathered to watch the performance. Applications of wash bring form to the drawing, conveying the fall of shadow on the scene. As with a number of Canaletto's highly finished drawings in pen, ink and wash, this work has a thick margin ruled around the edge of the view. Such drawings were popular souvenirs for the grand tourist.",
