The plaquette was also copied by the pottery manufacturer, Palissy, or a follower of his who makes use of the design in the middle of a bowl.  The composition has been alteredto adopt the oval to circular form and, in particular, a very detailed sharply receding mountainous landscape with walled towns and ruins has been added.  \nTS: the enamelled band and etching are very typical of Gross.",
