This design was made for the pantomime, Jack and the Beanstalk, at the London Palladium, 18 December 1973. The production was directed by Albert J. Knight. Mark Wynter played Jack Durden.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of pantomime costume design of the second half of the 20th century and of the work of a designer who specialised in pantomime and variety design.  It is also an example of a costume design for a principal boy and illustrates a feature of pantomime of the 20th century: the employment of stars of popular music, entertainment and television in leading roles, rather than established actors.",
