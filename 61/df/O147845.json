            "public_access_description": "Hilda Gertrude Cowham (1873-1964) painted landscapes and domestic scenes and illustrated a number of children's books. Educated at Wimbledon School of Art, Lambeth School of Art and at the Royal College of Art, Cowham was one of the first women to contribute illustrations to Punch. She was also a regular contributor to The Graphic and The Sketch, designed posters for the Underground Group from 1913 to 1914, and produced designs with Mabel Lucie Attwell for Shelley China from 1924. \n\nThis drawing is the design for page 1 of Cowham's children's book, Peter Pickle and his dog Fido: the diary of a week of scrapes, pictured in colours by Hilda Cowham and published in London by David Nutt in 1906. The boy's adventures include taking a baby skating, hunting for ghosts and eloping with a girl from a party.",
