On the foreedge a narrow chamber encloses two tablets connected to the parent volume by nylon cord threaded through holes in the tablets and secured around wooden pegs. These tablets are also marked with cyphers and alphanumeric characters.\n\nWhen the volume is opened further compartments are exposed which contain two scrolls covered with calligraphic text. A third encloses a further codex attached to its parent by means of a hinge.",

The entirety of the work is covered in numbers and letters childishly scrawled in pencil, and often semi-carved into the wood. The interior of the work also contains similar markings scored into paint or written in ink, ink drawings and diagrams, and torn, collaged pieces of paper with hand-written or typed lists of letters and numbers.\n\nThe work is fragile and cumbersome to handle, and various panels, hinged doors, codices and scrolls are contained within it, often in places not immediately obvious to the eye. The work has an obsessive, talismanic quality which has resonances with outsider art.\n\nThe artist describes her intention as a \"mixture of word magic, a strange mind geometry and a secret formal and esoteric architecture holding it all together\"\n\nSigned and dated 27/11/90 by the artist.",
