A hand, often so stylised that its origin is barely recognisable, was the most important Muslim amulet in North Africa and was also used in Syria.  It was adopted by Christians and Jews living in the same regions.  \n\nThe Hebrew inscription \u2018Shaddai\u2019, picked out in applied twisted wire, shows that this amulet was made for Jewish use.  Sephardi Jewish women in the Ottoman Empire used hand amulets with this inscription to protect their newborn children against all kinds of evil.  They pinned them to the baby\u2019s clothing, or hung them round its neck.  The Sephardic name for these hand-shaped amulets, \u2018Xamsika\u2019, is probably derived from the Arabic name hamsa, meaning five, which was the generic name for hand-shaped amulets.",
