His work later became much more figurative. This drawing, a study for a print (see Circ.91-1974), relates quite closely to pieces in wood he was making  in the early 1970s which took the form of crates and similar constructions. In some of these pieces Williams seems to be working with a cross-over from two to three dimensions, using the idea of a shadow as a solid part of the sculpture which at the same time remains flat. In this drawing the 'sculpture' only reveals itself  to be carved, three-dimensional representations of the letters forming the word SCULPTURE  through the fallen letters at the ends of each stand of columns. This suggests a playful approach to questions of spatial relationships in both two- and three-dimensional work.",
