A lot of Melland's work from this period, be it prints or paintings, shows the influence of artists such as Van Gogh or Matisse.  The subject matter is domestic and seemingly trivial but one could argue that the artist has chosen to focus more on how she has captured the scene rather than what is actually in it.",
