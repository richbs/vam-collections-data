It shows a rider carrying a reliquary riding a camel shown in profile. The head of the camel is missing as is that of the rider, but the outlines can still be discerned.  The camel has shaggy hair down the front of its neck and is caparisoned with a rosette on its left shoulder. The rider is wearing an <i>antariya</i> with a frilly edge and an <i>uttariya</i> flowing out behind him from his shoulder.  There are two accompanying figures; that on the left is now only blocked out in outline between the rider and the camels' neck.  The other figure is a warrior (his head is also missing) holding a lance. He is dressed in armour with a skirt of rectangular plaques in two tiers above his antariya worn in <i>kancha</i> style tucked up between his legs<i>.</i>\n      There is a fixing pinhole under the rear part of the camel's belly.",
