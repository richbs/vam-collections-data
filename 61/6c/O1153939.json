Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nSyd the Platypus is one of three Olympic mascots designed by Matthew Hattan for the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000. Together, Syd, Olly and Millie represent earth, air and water. Syd, the platypus represents the environment and captures the vigour and energy of Australia and its people. Olly, a kookaburra epitomises the Olympic spirit of generosity and Millie an echidna is a techno-whiz and information guru with all the facts and figures at his fingertips for the new millennium.",
