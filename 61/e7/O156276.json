There is a narrow border along the top with a thick black line on 4 sides enclosing a row of red or yellow downward pointing blossoms linked by a green line along the top and divided by a light blue line forming an arch around each blossom.  There is a border along the bottom which continues part of the way up each side and enclosed by a thick black line: white ground with outward pointing red flowers alternating with a spray of 3 grey and orange flowers.  \nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  There are thick black diagonal lines. \n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark red ground with linked pairs of arrowheads segmented and outlined with black and filled with blue, pink, red, light green, light blue and pale grey.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] black ground with downward pointing diamond shaped geometric arrangements of a stem and branches with green leaves and red or pink and white buds.  The colours alternate so that one has a pink and white centre and red outer buds and vice versa.\n[b] Green ground with downward pointing geometric arrangements of a straight stem and either a central red flower and 5 pink flowers or vice versa.\nIn the lower left hand corner the triangular space has been filled with horizontal lines and part of a diagonal toothed pattern in red and green.  In the same space in the upper right hand corner, part of the ground has been worked in pink instead of red.\n\nThere is evidence along the upper edge of small tufts of purple and black silk.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; black, dark red, light blue, dark blue, light green, yellow, mauve, orange, dark orange, pink, dark brown, white, dark pink, dark green.",
