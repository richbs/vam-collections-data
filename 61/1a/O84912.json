At eighteen Leno became a champion clog dancer andwas engaged by George Conquest to appear in pantomime at the Surrey Theatre.  In 1888 Leno went to Drury Lane and became one of its most successful pantomime dames in the history of the theatre, returning for many years as Sister Anne, the Widow Twankey, Cinderella's stepmother, and many other parts.  He continued to appear in music hall, and after he appeared at Sandringham in 1902 for King Edward VII was dubbed 'the King's Jester'.\n\nDan Leno's great popularity resulted in the production of various souvenirs including this jug and an ink-well shaped like Leno as Sister Anne (S.14-2001).",
