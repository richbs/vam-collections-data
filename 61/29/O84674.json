Its exact use is uncertain, but it is likely to have been made for eating porridge, or soup, or perhaps for drinking. Medieval diners drank from cups or shallow bowls, often with lids. These were often made of precious metal or costly glass to demonstrate the wealth of the host and to honour the guests. Some included semi-precious stones. Large cups with lids were used for communal ritual drinking at feasts. These were occasionally inscribed with mottoes or a prayer, echoing the grace that was said at the end of a meal. The Studley Bowl, which may have belonged to a child, is decorated with the letters of the alphabet.",
