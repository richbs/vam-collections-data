The panelled back consists of a small rectangular, one-piece panel set horizontally above a large upright rectangular panel consisting of two vertically-grained boards. The panels, and the back uprights and mid rail (on their front faces) are inlaid with floral scrollwork and birds, in holly(?), cherry(?), bog-oak(?) and probably other stained woods.  The back is surmounted by a voluted cresting carved with acanthus, and at each side is a 'ear-piece' with similar decoration. The front and side rails (with applied moulding) are inlaid with a band of brown and black diamonds. Below the seat, the 'knees' of both front legs are inlaid on the front and sides with a flower.\n\nConstruction\nJoined and pegged, with full-height back uprights (repaired at the feet), and mid- and lower rails. The one-piece cresting is mortised onto the back uprights, onto which are nailed or pegged the carved 'ears'. The sloping, carved arms are tenoned into the back uprights, and mortised onto turned and fluted prolongations of the front legs.  The legs are joined below by four plain stretchers.  The seat consists of 3 boards (laterally-grained) nailed into rebates in the side rails.\n\nApparent modifications\nBoth back legs rebuilt (the bottom 18cm) creating splayed back feet.\nSeat boards replaced.\nSide and back stretchers replaced.\nLarge shaped metal bracket screwed behind the crest, supporting breaks.\nMouldings to seat rails added possibly.\nIt seems likely that some inlay has been replaced.",

            "public_access_description": "The basic design of a joined armchair with panel-back appeared in the 16th century, but developed many regional variants during the 17th century. The incorporation of inlay decoration, as seen on this chair, was first fashionable around 1580-1610, but seems to have become particularly popular some decades later in the Dales area of Yorkshire, where the cloth industry thrived around Leeds, Bradford and Halifax. Features of this chair which suggest a Yorkshire origin are the characteristic undulating arm, and the double-scrolled pediment cresting which continue the crest design but are attached separately to the back uprights. The decoration of flowers, leaves and birds is inlaid, whereby contrasting motifs sawn from thin sheets of wood are inset and glued into recesses chiselled into the oak ground. This chair underwent fairly heavy restoration before it came to the Museum, probably while it was in the collection of Charles H. Marshall of East Retford, a notable collector of early British furniture.",

The back is surmounted by a voluted cresting carved with acanthus, and at each side is a 'ear-piece' with similar decoration. The arms slope downwards and are supported on prolongations of the front legs, which, with the supports, are turned and fluted. The legs are joined below by four plain stretchers. The framing below the seat is inlaid with a band of lozenges, and the upper parts or each of the front legs with floral sprigs. Late 16th or early 17th century.
