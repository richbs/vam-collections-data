Reference, as seen in much of his previous work, is also made to the faceting seen on many Korean Li Dynasty ceramics, also the source for his long-standing use of <i>kohiki</i> slip / glaze. Most recently Yoshida has been using black burnished earthenware rather than <i>kohiki</i> stoneware for this type of work. He has also stopped giving his pieces mouths. In departing from producing vessels with clearly defined tops and bottoms, he has made a radical step into a more purely sculptural exploration of faceted forms.",
