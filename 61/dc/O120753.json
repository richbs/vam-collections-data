Stars of the day were regularly commemorated in earthenware figurines such as this, made in Staffordshire.\n\nVan Amburgh, three-quarters Dutch and one quarter Cherokee Indian, was born in America and made his name there with the Titus Menagerie before coming to Britain in 1838 and attracting considerable attention by his Drury Lane performance.  It entranced Queen Victoria so much that she attended three performances in two weeks and wrote about it in her diaries. The Duke of Wellington commissioned Edwin Landseer, the sculptor of Trafalgar Square's lions, to paint his portrait, and numerous engravings of him appeared performing various dramatic episodes with his beasts such as The Brute Tamer of Pompeii. The manufacturers of this figurine would have copied an engraving for this image, and a similar image features on a jug produced in Staffordshire at about the same time.",
