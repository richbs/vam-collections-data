The borders of the exterior and of the central medallion on the top of the snuffbox incorporate shaded, three-dimensional bumps indicating the position of cut precious stones perhaps intended to be diamonds.  The design was drawn by an anonymous designer in about 1760-1775 possibly for an elite client from the Court of Louis XV, King of France, from 1715 to 1774, at Versailles, Paris. \n\nThe design is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
