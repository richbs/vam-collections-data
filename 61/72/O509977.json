His style is marked by a great clarity in the composition, delineated with sharp lines and shaded with a pale wash, as noticed by the great 17th-century collector Pierre-Jean Mariette who owns several works by Delaune. It has been suggested that his drawings were originally made for submission to patrons, therefore executed on vellum and characterised by a sharp line and a delicate pale wash.\n\nTrained as a goldsmith, Delaune supplied many fashionable designs for tableware and this present ornamental centrepiece may be a design for a salt-cellar. A similar figure of a crouching satyr appears as a decorative element in a design by Delaune for a circular tazza bowl in the Louvre (Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Ecole fran\u00e7aise, vol. V, No. 3545).\n\nThe present work shows the influence of the School of Fontainebleau yet rendered in Delaune\u2019s own style. Comparative drawings can be found in the Royal collection, Windsor Castle (design for a cup, pen and bistre wash on vellum, 18.8 x 10.1 cm \u2013 Inv. No. 13052) while another design of the same characteristic in the V&A collection (see 2302). Analogous drawings on vellum are in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris (in a folio album, Inv. No. B.2.R\u00e9serve) where they are catalogued as by an anonymous hand of the school of Fontainebleau.",
