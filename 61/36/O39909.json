He studied in Paris, then settled in Brussels.\nIn 1845 he started engraving medals depicting the exterior and interior of monuments with a great attention to detail, something which hasn't previously been attempted. The first series was a group of ten medals depicting famous Belgian churches. Then he made a series of medals representing important monuments of Europe, like cathedrals, churches and mosques as well as other civic Belgian buildings including for example all Belgian prisons and some town halls.  By 1872 unfortunately due to his portrayals in such fine small-scale detail he had almost lost his eye sight and had to stop producing medals.",
