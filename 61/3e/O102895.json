Consani is known to have been a forger from the fact that he forged a tabernacle in the style of Civitali which he sold to the Museo Nationale, Lucca. The relief is markedly inferior in quality to any known work by Civitali. It is difficult to make sense of the composition, and the function of the relief is impossible to determine. The motif of the clasped hands appears to have been copied from a medal of Vespasian. It appears likely that the relief is a deliberate forgery by Consani: a crude pastiche of the style of Civitali, compounded of elements adapted from the tomb of Piero da Noceto or the Altar of St. Regulus.\nBy: A.F.R. 21/07/1977",
