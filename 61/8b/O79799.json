The polyhedral end, made from a cube with the corners cut off, is often found on bracelets and anklets as well as earrings, and is one of the most distinctive aspects of the jewellery worn on the southern edges of the Sahara, from the Red Sea to the Atlantic.\n\nThese were described as \u2018Modern Egyptian\u2019 when they were acquired by the Museum in 1904, and probably come from the extreme south of the country or the Sudan.  The cotton cord which links them together, originally red according to the acquisitions register, is a very rare survival, and shows how they would have been worn.",
