A fifth figure, in the act of pushing Christ and kicking him with his right foot, is now missing: all that remain are his two bare feet (one on the ground, the other on Christ's robe behind his knee), and his two hands on Christ's back.The gilding and colour are largely original and in excellent condition, although the right ankle of the figure at the front right has broken away as a result of worm-infestation. The relief is made up of two pieces of wood joined together front to back  before carving: the join runs behind the figures of  Christ and that on the right. The back of the relief is only roughly blocked out; three square-sectioned wooden dowels (one now broken) once served to hold the relief in\nposition against its background. On the underside are a number of square-sectioned nail holes.",

The main Crucifixion scene would have been in the middle, and this scene would have stood to the left of  it. It shows Christ crowned with thorns and carrying the Cross over his left shoulder. He is surrounded by four figures who are tormenting him. A fifth figure, who was originally shown pushing Christ and kicking him with his right foot, is now missing. Only his two bare feet remain. \nThe gilding and colour are largely original and in excellent condition. However,  the figure at the front right has lost its right ankle because of  woodworm damage.",
