It was made by LJN toys, a company set up to exploit merchandising opportunities among television, film and pop stars. In 1984, Michael Jackson's album Thriller had become the best selling album in the world, going on to sell over 110 million copies to date. Michael Jackson-related merchandise sold through the roof, and all sorts of products bearing his image were created, including this series of dolls.\n\nThis particular doll features Jackson's costume from the American Music Awards of 1984; a red military style jacket with gold braiding, gold sash and red seam on his black trousers. He also comes with a glitter glove and socks, and his own plastic display stand. Other costumes were manufactured and could be bought separately for the series including costumes from the Thriller, Beat It and Billie Jean videos, and the 1984 Grammies and Motown 25 event.",
