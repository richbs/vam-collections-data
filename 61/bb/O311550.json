French involvement in the transatlantic trade continued to grow over the following century, but in 1791 there was a massive slave revolt in Saint-Domingue, one of the most profitable colonies. On 1 January 1804, the territory became Haiti, the first black republic.\n\nThis decorative bronze figure was made in France in the 1660s, during the reign of Louis XIV, whose chief minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, was the architect of French colonial policy. The figure is probably one of a pair made to embellish a clock or a piece of furniture. Its pose - on one knee, with the wrists manacled together - clearly identifies the figure as a slave.",
