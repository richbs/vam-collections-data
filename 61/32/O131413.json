They were also regular exhibitors at the Royal Academy, Society of British Artists and the British Institution.\n\nIn subject matter and composition, 1019-1886 shows the influence of Alexander Nasmyth, Patrick Nasmyth\u2019s father, who may have tutored Wilson in Edinburgh; see Alexander Naxmyth\u2019s Landscape with Cottage, signed and dated 1828 (Cat. No. 20, Alexander Nasmyth and his Family: an Exhibition, Monks Hall Museum, 1973).
