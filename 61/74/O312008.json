The pestle was clearly made for the mortar; the diameter of the two ends vary very slightly, and it is likely that both were used for grinding. Mortars played an integral part in everyday life. Wherever there was a need to grind a substance, there would be a mortar and pestle. The most obvious application is in the context of medicine and pharmacy, but they were also essential pieces of equipment in the household, where they were used not only to prepare food, but also simple medicines and cosmetics. Similarly they would be found in the studios of artists and craftsmen, as well as the laboratory of the alchemist. Although the grape vine had alchemical associations, it was a commonly used motif and does not necessarily have any particular significance in this instance.",
