Triangular cover of cream satin backed with canvas and embroidered with silver and silver-gilt threads and with silks and chenille threads in shades of green, yellow, pink, cream, brown, blue, white and red in long and short, satin and stem stitches with French knots and laid and couched work. Part of the metal thread embroidery are slightly padded. The cover is lined with blue silk which replaces an earlier lining of darker blue silk. The edges are trimmed with a cream silk braid, and with occasional touches of red, green and black silk. For three-quarters of the left-hand edge and round the lower left-hand corner the braid has been replaced.\n\nThe cover is irregularly shaped having two straight edges at the bottom and the right-hand side, and one long curved edge on the left. The design, which consists of a series of large isolated motifs, is arranged to fit within the triangular shape. In a straight line down the right-hand side are a large rayed sun with an embroidered face, a round tower flanked by an over-sized tulip tree, a rose bush, and a silver eight-pointed star. In the centre of the bottom edge is a Cyprus tree standing on a flowery mound. Along the curve of the left-hand edge are a large bunch of tulips, roses and periwinkles, a walled Italian town standing on a flowery mound, a bunch of carnations and other flowers, a bird standing on the flowering stump of a tree, and another large bunch of tulips, roses and carnations. The remaining spaces are filled with sprigs of flowers and butterflies worked on a smaller scale.",
