His right hand is raised in abhayamudra.  His head is turned  towards a monk approaching him from the left, and carrying a seat with turned legs.  The monk is followed by a second one, with  a jug in his hands.- we may assume that this is preparations for the Buddha's First Sermon in the Deer Park of Sarnath. On the Buddha's left stands Vajrapani holding a thunderbolt in his right hand, and clasping the hilt of his sword with his raised left hand. \nThe scene on the left shows sermon of the Buddha in the midst of his monks and other listeners. The Buddha is seated in abhayamudra on a high cushion-covered socle, the front part is damaged.  One can recognize the two gazelles in the relief which depicts the Buddha's First Sermon.  On the right and on the left  a branch of the Bodhi treegrows out of the background.  In the foreground, at each side of the Buddha, on low bases two monks seat in meditation.  Between the two, in the background the upper half of the body of third monk : thus five monks are represented who traditionally listened to his First Sermon.",
