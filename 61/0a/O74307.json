The inscription on this one, only partially legible on the upper edge, may indicate that it was designed to be used in the Palace of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City in Beijing. \n\nAnother series of rugs of a similar size and technique, each with a four- or five-character inscription assigning it to a particular hall of the imperial domain, is known outside China. It has been suggested that it dates to the reign of the Qianlong emperor (ruled 1736-1795). Another source has claimed that this group of rugs was made in the Street of the Embroiderers in Beijing in the 20th century, in which case an imperial connection seems unlikely.",
