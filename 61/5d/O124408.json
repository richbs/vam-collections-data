Around the body of the neck and junction runs a stepped band, cast in two sections and applied.  The upper step of the band is ribbed, the lower is decorated with anthemion ornament.  From the lower step rise the two handles, which curve upwards and are decorated at the base with a bunch of palm leaves.  The centre of the handle is also decorated with a bunch of laurel leaves, opposed and bound at their junction by a beaded ring.  Beneath the rim of the neck are applied two moulded girdles:  the band between them is set with eight flowers, cut and applied.  The rim itself is everted and decorated with aterleaves, under a ribbed edge.  The lower part of the body is encircled by a girdle cast and applied, which is decorated with a wreath of laurel interrupted by six rosettes.  To the back of the body is applied a relief of a Bacchic youth, nude except for a lion skin cloak, playing the triangle with a horn suspended from his shoulder.  To the front, above the lion mask spiggot, is applied a relief of a Bacchante, the upper part of her body, nude, dancing and playing the sistrum.  The stem of the spiggot is encircled by a band of leaves in relief:  the removable tap is surmounted by a crescent shaped handle of ebony.  The stem is held by a bunch of palm leaves and fits into a rosette, cast and applied.  To the barrel of the tap are applied two quatrefoils, one on either side.  In the base of the body is a dopmed recess, for the flames of the detachable burner, which is spool shaped and fits into a triangular base.  The burner is decorated with water-leaf round the moulded edge and laurel round the moulded base, and is encircled round the upper neck with a rope girdle.  It is fitted with a separately made wick-holder.  The body is supported by three terms in the form of female sphinxes with outspread wings resting on a lion leg.  The junction of the body and leg is effected by a motif of palm and acanthus foliage.  The foot is decorated on its moulded upper edge with palm leaves.  The flat lid is surmounted by an acorn-shaped ebony knob.",

The firm of  Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot was one of the most important and influential Parisian silversmiths at the beginning of the 19th century. Skilful practitioners of the neo-classical style, Odiot were patronised by the aristocracy of Europe. J.B. C. Odiot's son, Charles Nicolas studied English technique and style at Garrards and took over the family business in 1827. Tea drinking after dinner became fashionable in the early 19th century, even in France. In 1827, Domestic Economy and Cookery for Rich and Poor  reported that  \" In France, now, the tea-table is partially introduced to accommodate the English, which serves to show off their nice cakes and bon bons\u2026\"",

This is part of a composite tea service, made up from pieces marked for Jean-Baptiste (master 1785) and his son Charles-Nicolas Odiot (mark in use from 1826). Probably made up during the Restoration\n\nHistorical significance: The Odiot workshop was one of the largest, most prestigious in Paris, supplying the court and aristocracy. It was quite usual to make up sets of tea, coffee or other services from stock. Designs and casting patterns were kept and re-used as necessary.\n\nThe bowl is characteristic of Odiot's production and the so-called \"Empire\" style, popular in France in the early 19th century. The use of classical motifs and figures applied to plain surfaces, and for pouring vessels, spouts ending in animal's heads are typical. It was considered the epitome of French stylishness in England. The French craft, on the other hand, looked to England for technical developments; Charles-Nicolas spent some time working as a modeller for Garrards in London",
