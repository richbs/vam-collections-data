In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nIn common with his architectural photographs, Jones has chosen to photograph this rock face from a slightly oblique angle. It also demonstrates his interest in light: sunlight falls across the centre of the image, selectively lighting those diagonally sloping layers of rock.",
