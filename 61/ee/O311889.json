The series is illustrating the history of British Art. The medals, which were specially commissioned, were issued annually to members of the Art-Union.\nThe sitter Benjamin West (1738-1820) was a historical painter and born of Quaker  parents in Pennsylvania. He was largely self-taught and at the age of sixteen painted 'Death of Socrates'. On his way home from Italy, where he had been studying, he was persuaded to settle in London and George III became his patron for over forty years. He became president of the Royal Academy in 1792 and remained so until his death.\nThe reverse of the medal is taken from West's The Death of Wolfe at Quebec.",
