Beyond at the top of the painting there is a landscape of various buildings surrounded by trees, one of which juts up into the central space between  two panels of poetic text.\n   The painting has narrow outlines in pale turquoise and orange within an inner border which  is decorated in gold with a foliated scroll on a dark blue ground outlined in white between gold lines. The outer line is broader with a ruled blue line at its outer margin. The main border is of an ivory colour and decorated with an alternate line of  stylised lilies and irises painted in gold and blue to mimic marbled paper.  These floral motifs  in certain cases are painted over the outer gold edging of the inner border, but were painted before the outer blue rules line was added.  The margins of the page have strips of buff-coloured paper with white outlines stuck to them A pinkish-buff strip of paper has been added to the inner margin of the page as a gutter.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
