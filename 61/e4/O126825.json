A standing shepherd pipes \non the right while a woman seated on \nthe leaf rests the back of her hand on a  \nsheaf of wheat. In the middle ground \nanother shepherd stands with his crook \nsurrounded by his flock, while a flaming \nsunset fills the horizon. The composition \nis framed by the branches of a palm and\napple tree joined to form a Gothic arch \n(see cat.9a). The subject, celebrating \nreligion and fecundity with prominent \nmale and female figures, has affinities \nwith Palmer\u2019s composition showing the \nharvest moon (cat.9f).\u2019",
