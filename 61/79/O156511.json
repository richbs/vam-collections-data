The Edict had provided religious tolerance for Huguenots (Protestants) living in Catholic France. M\u00e9tayer and his family moved to Amsterdam, where he established himself as a goldsmith and became a citizen in 1730. \n\nThis box is chased with a scene from the Old Testament, of Rebecca at the well. Rebecca offers water to Abraham's servant and his camels. She is subsequently chosen to be the bride of Abraham's son, Isaac.  The chasing may be by Louis M\u00e9tayer's brother, Philippe, a leading chaser.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
