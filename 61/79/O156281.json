Selvedge down the left hand side. A narrow band of cotton has been sewn along the edges except for the left hand side. There is a border along the bottom: complex pattern with blossoms pointing to the lower right.  One is red and one is red with blue, green and yellow stripes.  These are separated by one of two arrangements, a green star-like flower surrounded by blue flowers or a blue star-like flower surrounded by green flowers.  There is a narrow border above and below and extending part way up the sides: touching red hexagons on a blue and red ground with green and yellow diagonal stripes either side.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and blue.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: yellow blossom next to a pink blossom alternating with a multi-coloured blossom.  These change direction, sometimes facing down and sometimes to the right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] small diamond-shaped blue flower sometimes pointing up and sometimes down, surrounded by small pink flowers.\n[b] Almost solid pink flower edged with green, pointing down, on an angled chevron stem with 5 small green flowers around the top.  In the next section there is a circle of green flowers and in the next section a segmented flower pointing to the right on an angled chevron stem with a pair of blue and yellow flowers at its base.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; green, blue, dark blue, yellow, red, cream, pink, light pink, mauve, light green, light blue.",
