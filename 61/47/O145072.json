The back is centred by an open rectangular splat, projecting above the top rail and framing a carved Prince of Wales plume sprouting from a fluted tapering 'plinth'. The two outer flutes are three-dimensional, the two inner flutes inlaid with satinwood(?). ADD DESCRIPTION OF REEDING, BLOCKINGS ETC.\n\nThe seat rails, in stained beech(?), are tenoned to the front legs and back stiles, and the frame is strengthened by four open braces, of mahogany, keyed to the rails. The back rail is veneered in mahogany, the front and side rails unveneered (so have clearly always been stuffed over, as now). The front legs, projecting above the seat, are each presumably tenoned to the diagonally-grained arm-support, which in turn may be tenoned to the arm-rest -- or, since the grain is diagonal, these may be joined here by loose tenons or loose dowels. The arm-rest is probably tenoned to the back stiles. \nIn the back-frame the bottom rail is tenoned to the stiles, which in turn are tenoned to the top rail; the three uprights in the splat are probably half-lapped to the top and bottom rails from the front. \nThe Prince-of-Wales feathers are carved in the solid, out of the top rail and central spur of the splat.\nAll the upholstery materials are 20th-century, seemingly c. 1950--80 (so perhaps dating from shortly before the chair went on loan to Preston Hall in 1968).",
