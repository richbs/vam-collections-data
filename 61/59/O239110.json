The sheet is inscribed in pencil at the back <i>Brighton Fishing boat with net</i>. This inscription appears to have been written when the Museum number was put on the back. There is no indication of its origin but no reason to doubt its accuracy, as the top drawing on No. 273a shows a similar scene in a comparable technique, and independent reasons have been given for believing that the latter was drawn at Brighton. The resemblance of No. 275 to No. 273 and the possibility that No. 273 may have come from the same sketch-book justify a dating of c.1824.\n\n\nNos. 256, 257, 259, 260, 261 and 262 all come from the same skecth-book, measuring approximately 181x262 mm. (about 7 1/8 x 10 1/4 ins.) and used by Constable both on his summer visit tyo Salisbury and Gilingham and his autum visit to Coleorton. The height of the pages tapers from 178mm. at the outer edge to 181 mm. at the hinge edge. Nos. 273 an 274, and possibly also Nos. 275-278, come from the same sketch-book, and show that he used it at Brighton, probably on his first visit in 1824; for their possible connection with a projected group of engravings, see also the note following No. 284.\n\nGraham Reynolds\"",
