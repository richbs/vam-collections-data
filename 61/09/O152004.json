The aim was to teach local children the basic traditional methods of weaving and dyeing, and revive the art of tapestry weaving which had formerly flourished in Egypt, particularly in the Byzantine period. 'Ali Salim, who made this tapestry, joined the Wissa Wassef school soon after its foundation at the age of 12. He went on to become one of its most famous weavers.\n\nWissa Wassef did not tell his pupils what to weave. Instead, he encouraged them to take inspiration from the surrounding countryside or from village life. He also forbade them from making preliminary drawings, so even a large and detailed scene like this one was built up directly on the loom.",
