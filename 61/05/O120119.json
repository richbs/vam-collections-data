It has been suggested that the central figure of the painting is Maharaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur (ruled 1707-24), but it is just as likely to be the ruler of a much smaller domain in the region. At this time, the fashion for portraiture had spread beyond the Jodhpur court to the outlying districts, and many minor nobles and land-owners had their portraits painted, either on horse-back or with their nobles, as here.",
