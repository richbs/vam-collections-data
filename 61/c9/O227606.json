The trophy included heads of game shot by Landseer and was illustrated as the frontispiece for <u>The Graphic</u>, November 8, 1873, with a description on page 431. Part of this description includes a transcript of a letter of thanks from Landseer in 1855 for the gift but it is not yet clear whether Ward was the original donor.",
