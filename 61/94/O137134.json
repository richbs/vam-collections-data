The piece strikes a harmonious balance between contrasts; polished smooth surfaces and chased detail, asymmetry and uniform shapes. The focus on function can be seen through practical details; the raised edge serving to contain the food and the lack of crevices facilitating cleaning. The lapis lazuli finial injects a natural splendour to the piece reminiscent of Art Nouveau work. The piece is an elegant fusion of beauty and practicality.",
