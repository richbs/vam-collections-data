Claudet was one of the pioneers of the process: he found an 'accelerating agent' (bromine and chloride of iodine) which speeded up exposures considerably. The sitter, Andrewe Pritchard, was probably a business associate of Claudet's. Pritchard was also an inventor and the proprietor of an emporium selling scientific instruments in Ludgate Circus, London. He was famous for making jewel lenses. Claudet's portrait shows the scientific inventor as a romantic modern figure.",
