On a ribbed tabby ground of white silk is brocaded a meandering green stem bearing small flowers in purple, blue, white, scarlet, brown-red, pink, lilac, black, brown, yellow and cream silks, and also silver thread fil\u00e9 and fris\u00e9. The stem bears a large silver leaf of silver strip caught with fancy bindings, which backs a spray of berries in black and two shades of pink. This leaf with berries occurs also in between the meanders of the central stem. There is a selvedge on the left side of the silk, although missing on the right.\n\nSewn onto a surround of black silk with a small repeating pattern of self-colour fruits or buds made by the weft flush bound in a fancy twill on a satin ground. To this, along two sides, have been applied flower heads formed with a different pattern of silk for each petal.",
