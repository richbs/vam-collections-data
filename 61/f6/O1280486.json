The diary entries included verbal descriptions of things seen, both handwritten and typed, and visual pages comprising drawings, photographs and photo-collage. Breakwell had already started to publish some of the diaries in modest small press editions when in 1983, while working on a fellowship at the Norwich School of Art, he got friendly with the printing department there and saw an opportunity to publish an edition that would do justice to the diary pages visually. The process used was photo-silkscreen using a limited range of colours. Breakwell chose diary pages that would fit this colour range, in order to produce prints that would approximate the richness of the original pages. The 10 diary pages, part verbal, part visual, have a typically voyeuristic quality and provide an intriguing slice of the mundane interspersed with elements of fantasy.",
