This adds to its importance and will be acquired by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department.  It would be very effective to exhibit the dress and design together as they don't often exist in tandem.\n\nThe dress is also important in a social history context.  It was worn by Anne Hughes (n\u00e9e Anne Stephen) at her marriage to Mr Allan Hughes on 24th April 1964.  Mrs Hughes recently died which is why her husband has decided to donate.  He also has some excellent photographs of the wedding which he would be happy for us to duplicate for exhibition purposes",
