She had studied art and  design at Redhill School of Art in 1933 and then  Chelsea College of Art from 1934 until 1937. She then  opened her own textile printing workshop in partnership with Anne Morgan until she joined the WRNS in 1943. In  1938 the Department of Textiles and Dress of the  Victoria and Albert Museum acquired four examples of  printed fabrics made by these designers, museum  numbers: Circ.152, 153, 155, 156, 157-1938. After her  war service she taught part time at Camberwell from  1947 until 1978, concentrating latterly on block  printing. Between 1947 and 1952 she also taught part  time at Guildford. Karin Warming's folders and  scrapbooks are particularly interesting as they show  how she derived ideas for stylised and abstract designs from natural forms, from architectural forms and from  photographs of all kinds of objects, finding  inspiration in the underlying patterns inherent in  everyday things. She experimented with unorthodox  methods of pattern making, which included using  resists, impressions from natural objects and random  effects from colour mixing.",
