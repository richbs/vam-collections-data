The prints used the newly available technique of colour lithography to record scenes from the popular 1851 Exhibition. This particular scene shows the Tunisian exhibit, Tunisia being one of few African countries represented at the Exhibition. Exhibits were selected by the bey, Mushir Basha, and included a Bedouin tent. The wealth of material displayed and the charisma of the exhibitors, Hamda Elmkadden and his assistant Saido Belais, ensured that the exhibit proved \u2018one of the most remarkable features\u2019 of the Exhibition.\n\nFollowing the Exhibition, a government grant was awarded to a committee headed by Henry Cole to purchase items from the Exhibition to form the basis of a Museum of Manufactures (later the V&A). These were selected on the basis of the extent to which they exemplified \u2018some right principle of construction or of ornament, or some feat of workmanship\u2019. Thirteen textiles items were chosen from the Tunisian exhibit for \u2018exhibiting the good taste, and true principles which are found even in the humblest works of the Arab tribes\u2019.",

[Exhibition catalogue]\n'Following the success of the 1851 International Exhibition of Arts and Manufactures, Dickinson Bros issued a series of coloured views, 'from originals painted for HRH Prince Albert'. In depicting the different sections, artist Joseph Nash inserted 'appropriate' human figures in keeping with Albert's hope of promoting peace and cooperation 'not only between individuals but between the nations of the earth' (Auerbach, 161).  \u2026 The Tunisian exhibit, selected by the bey, Mushir Basha, and including a Bedouin tent, proved 'one of the most remarkable features' of the Exhibition. Tunis 2 shows visitors chatting to exhibitor Hamda Elmkadden and his assistant Saido Belais. With 'his picturesque costume, loud talk in Arabic and energetic gestures', the latter attracted much attention; 'he appears in the accompanying view, squatting, as was his custom, on one of the counters'.
