            "history_note": "Historical Significance: Francesco Zuccarelli started his career as an engraver and draughtsman, studying in Florence and Rome. After the move to Venice in his thirties, he devoted himself to landscape painting. This new interest led to an important friendship with the Welsh painter Richard Wilson, with whom Zuccarelli exchanged paintings. Zuccarelli\u2019s style is less precise and topographical than Canaletto\u2019s and he is also far away from the stormy temperament of Marco Ricci. Zuccarelli\u2019s landscapes are idealised and lyrical, based on the Italian countryside. The subject-matter is often hard to define, and it remains secondary to the sentiment of the pictures.\n\nAlthough Zuccarelli received considerable support from the local Venetian nobility, his most important patron was certainly Joseph Smith, the English consul in Venice and an enthusiastic collector of contemporary art. This relationship led to many projects, including paintings for the decoration of Smith\u2019s villa. In 1746 the consul commissioned Zuccarelli and Antonio Visentini to paint a series of 11 English <i>Palladian</i> buildings in imaginative settings. Visentini drew on engravings to depict the buildings he has never seen, whereas Zuccarelli provided the generalised landscapes. The series is an important document of the English enthusiasm for Italian art at the time. \n\nSmith\u2019s interest in Zuccarelli led him to travel to England, where he achieved considerable success. Unusually for his time, Zuccarelli produced landscapes for the market rather than for individual patrons.  This strategy proved effective and Zuccarelli\u2019s reputation rose enough for King George III to commission the Finding of Moses (1768; ?exh. RA 1773; Windsor Castle, Berks, Royal Col.). He became the founding member of the Royal Academy, where he exhibited landscapes. \n\nThe prestige he gained in England led Zuccarelli to the post of the director of the Venetian Academy. Hugely popular during his lifetime, he died in 1788 in Florence. At that time his art went somewhat out of fashion, criticised for the frivolity and extravagance of his Arcadian fantasies. \n\nThis drawing depicts a seated, female nude, partially covered by drapery. There is no indication of background, landscape or attributes, which would help identify the figure or place it in a narrative context. The drawing is very finished. The play of light on the body is carefully captured and the drapery is depicted in detail. A figure with similar features is depicted in another drawing by Zuccarelli (E.1476-1914). Here the pose is different and the handling seems more crisp and clear. Zuccarelli put more attention to the play of light and shade in E. 1661-1914.\n\nBoth drawings were mounted in the album belonging to Richard Norris, entitled Sketches Taken in Italy 1769. The collection contained drawings of buildings, ornaments and sculptures by Norris and other artists, such as Giuseppe Manocchi (c. 1732-82).\n\nSome of Zuccarelli\u2019s drawings are genre scenes with figures, some of them related to paintings. This drawing has not been related to any painting and may have been a finished work.",
