The pattern is divided into two zones and probably formed the lower part of a woman's trouser leg.  The upper zone has a small lozenge lattice with an additional 'W' shaped form at each junction, all in yellow.  The lozenge compartments are each filled with a 5-petalled 'clover' flower originally in a bright coral pink, yellow and green leaves and pink roots. This zones ends with a narrow chevron band in green and yellow, which introduced a 6.5 cm section of a different pattern.  This consists of  green diagonal stripes edged in yellow in between which is a 3 cm dark grey diagonal stripe bearing floral motifs in at least two variations:\n[1] a pink rose and bud form with greenish yellow leaves\n[2] a floral spray of blue or white 5-petalled flowers with yellowish green leaves.\nThere is a narrow length sewn on to the left hand side without exact matching of the pattern, but it clearly shows that the zone of lozenge pattern finished with at least 1.5 cm of unpatterned satin.  This and the diagonal pattern are what relate closely to the most common design on trousers.\nThe pattern begins and ends 0.5 cm from the selvedge.\nThere is evidence of pink silk sewing thread.",
