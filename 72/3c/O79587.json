The circular form at the centre is an image of a mushroom spore print (made by leaving a mushroom, gill-side down, on damp paper overnight, so that the spores fall out and leave an imprint on the paper). The lines radiating from the centre seem abstract, but looked at more closely it becomes apparent that they are lines of handwriting, listing the Latin names of fungi, and facts about them. The image as a whole, with the lines radiating out from the centre, resembles the underside of a mushroom cap. \n\nDrury is inspired by nature and the environment and works in a variety of ways. Apart from prints such as Poison Pie, his artistic output includes performance art and three-dimensional installations in the landscape.",
