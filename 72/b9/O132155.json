Before 1800</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 260-261, cat. no. 323.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nAndrea SCHIAVONE (Andrea Meldolla) (active c. 1540; d. 1563) \nItalian (Venetian) School \nHe came to Venice from Dalmatia c. 1540. Said to have been a pupil of Bonifazio de' Pitati, he was also influenced by Parmigianino, by Titian and by the early Tintoretto. In 1556-60 he executed some of the paintings in the Library of the Palazzo Reale, Venice. \n\nAscribed to Andrea SCHIAVONE \n\n323\nTHE EMBARKATION OF A QUEEN \nCanvas \n9 x 23 1/8 (22.8 x 59.7) including a strip 3/4 in. (2 cm.) wide added at the top and \u00bd in. (1.3 cm.) at the bottom \nTownshend Bequest \n1361-1869 \n\nThe traditional attribution to Schiavone (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 186) remains acceptable, though the greater part of Schiavone's accepted work is less broad in treatment. Comparable sketchiness is to be found, for example, in the <i>Diana and Callisto</i>, Amiens Museum (exh. Le 16e. si\u00e8cle europ\u00e9en, Paris, Petit Palais, 1965-66, no. 255) and in the <i>Woman taken in Adultery</i>, E. Schapiro Collection (exh. <i>European art 1520-1600</i>, Manchester, 1965, no. 214). A similar composition by Schiavone is the <i>Christ walking on the Waters</i>, Pushkin Museum, Moscow (<i>Art in America</i>, xxi, 1933, p.129). The broad treatment, tall, curving figures with small heads and stressed diagonals appear in a group of paintings formerly attributed to Schiavone but now thought to be early works of Tintoretto (c. 1545). This group includes six cassone panels in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (R. Palluchini, <i>La giovanezza di Tintoretto</i>, 1950, pls. 101-06; D. von Hadeln, 'Tintoretto als Cassone-Maler' in <i>Zeitschrift f\u00fcr bildende Kunst</i>, N. F., xxxiii, 1922, p. 27 ff.); <i>Esther before Ahasuerus</i> in the collection of Count Seilern (<i>Italian paintings and drawings at 56 Princes Gate</i>, 1959, no. 76, pls. xxiv-vi); and the <i>Parable of the Rich Man's Feast</i>, formerly Cook Collection no. 71 (exh. Colnaghi, 1959, no. 7 as Tintoretto; Berenson, <i>Venetian painters</i>, i, 1957, p. 161, no. 171 as Schiavone). This is not to suggest that 1361-1869 is by the same hand, but only to point to Tintoretto as the probable originator of this style. \nThe subject of the picture is not clear. It could be the <i>Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba</i>, but this usually includes a greater number of people and much baggage. Cleopatra, who is often shown embarking or disembarking, is another alternative, but it has not been possible to find very close parallels. \n\nCondition. Cleaned in 1959, when it was found that strips had been added to the original canvas at the top and bottom. The worn areas on the figure on the left and on the sea and sky were filled and retouched. \nProv. The Rev. C. H. Townshend; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868.\nAna Debenedetti, 'A recently identified painting by Tintoretto in the Victoria and Albert Museum', <u>The Burlington Magazine</u>, No. 1318, vol.

It is thanks to the high quality of the typically broken brushwork, and a palette of cool greys offset by white, ochre and carmine that it was identified as an authentic work by Tintoretto. In addition, research into the artist\u2019s work revealed that the V&amp;A painting belongs to a group of three showing the same group of figures with the recurring female at the centre of the composition. \n\nUntil then the subject matter could not be determined, and was described as \u2018The Embarkation of a Queen\u2019. Comparison with the other two paintings showed that the\nV&amp;A picture depicts the embarkation of St Helena to the Holy Land. It is followed by the discovery of the True Cross (Hyde collection, Glenn Falls, New York) and the testing of the True Cross (Art Institute, Chicago). The cycle clearly illustrates the legend of St Helena and the Holy Cross. Helena was the mother of Constantine, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity. She is said to have found the actual cross on which Christ had been crucified. \n\nThe canvas support was unusual for such small paintings. They might have been overdoors, or part of frieze, in a private house or church.",
