Patterned with alternating rows of small green pines with yellow centres. The borders are composed of alternating rose pink carnations and yellow flowers, with a green centre linked by their stems that form an arcaded pattern, and edged with black interwoven with small yellow gold leaf shapes. A portion of the ends of the shawl, now used to face the lapels, has a design of large rounded motifs filled with a close pattern of pinks linked by their foliage and narrow black stripes. The body of the waistcoat is made from the main ground of the shawl. The woven borders are stitched around the edges, and the sides of the ends with borders and fringe attached face back the lapels.\n\nThe waistcoat is just over waist-length, square cut, double-breasted, and cut to allow the lapels to fall open. There are plain welted bands stitched at pocket level but no pockets have been inserted and it is double-breasted. There are 24 small round buttons covered with material from the body of the shawl. The back is made from white linen.",

An attractive feature is the fringed ends of the shawl, which have been incorporated into the edge of the revers (lapels). Revers, or the \u2018reverse\u2019 of the coat or waistcoat front, appear in men\u2019s fashionable dress during the 1780s. One of the innovations of this new style was to wear the revers of a brightly decorated waistcoat over that of the coat. This fashion was eventually assimilated into men\u2019s evening dress and can be seen in the silk lapels found on all formal tail coats and dinner jackets.",
