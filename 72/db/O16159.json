According to information supplied verbally by the artist, the container is made up of a number of curved sections, two of which project upwards to form the supports for the handle.  The slightly recessed base is surrounded by a narrow border.  Three circumferential feet of rounded outline, one placed halfway between the points below the two handle-supports, the other two at equal intervals.  The slightly angled sides of the basically cylindrical container are relieved by two raised bands built up in pure lacquer, one just above the feet and the other about three-quarters of the way up.  The handle-supports continue the angle and curve of the container and are joined inside, just below their tops, by a curved handle of rectangular cross section.  \nTwenty-one blades of <i>tokusa</i> grass in thickish gold <i>hiramakie</i> rise from the lower band on one side of the container, at different angles, some crossing over others, and two of them project beyond the upper band on the back four further blades (2 crossing) on the right eleven blades (2 crossing).  Seventeen similar <i>tokusa</i> blades project from one side of the lid and four of them continue on to the other half of the lid.  Scratched mark on base Mutsu.",
