The extant back left leg of a chair, it is carved to represent the leg of a lion, set on a drum. Its form, as well as traces of blue paint found on it, indicate that the chair may have belonged to someone with royal status. Royal chairs found in New Kingdom (c. 1550 BC -1070 BC) tombs, such as the resplendent examples found in the Tomb of Tutankhamun, who was Pharaoh from 1336 BC-1324 BC, display similar lion-shaped legs set on drums, and were often elaborately painted and embellished with materials such as gold sheet, coloured stones, or ivory.\n\nBy the time of the New Kingdom, the quality of Egyptian furniture was renowned throughout the ancient world and was often sent as gifts to rulers of neighbouring countries. Furniture discovered in the Tomb of Tutankhamun show the outstanding design and construction achieved by the carpenters of the period. By then, carpenters were no longer squatting on their workshop floors, but sat on three-legged stools and worked at specially designed benches, which helped them hold and cut their work. They used a wide range of tools, including try squares, straight edges, cubit rods, and mitre-cutting aids, as well as adzes, axes, bow-drills, chisels, mallets, sandstone rubbers, and copper pull-saws. The principal woods used for furniture were native timbers such as acacia, sycamore fig, tamarisk and sidder. Woods such as cedar, cypress and juniper were imported from Syria, and ebony, or African blackwood, came from countries to the south. \n\nFrom early on, Egyptian carpenters understood the physical properties of timber and the concept of joinery. They constructed wooden elements into one of three forms\u2014 the box, the frame, and the stool, exploiting two principles: a timber's strength is along the grain and not across it, and the shrinkage of timber is negligible along the grain. With the introduction of copper woodworking tools, New Kingdom carpenters were able to carve and cut sophisticated joints in wood, which had been previously impossible to achieve. We see the use of the mortise and tenon, butt, lap or rebated butt, halving, bridle, dovetail, mitre, coopered and scarf joints. \n\nThis chair leg clearly exhibits the high quality of New Kingdom joinery. The exposed mortise and tenon joint shows the remains of the pegged seat rail clasping the tenon.",

This furniture was a combination of specifically designed funerary objects, often of an inferior quality, and better quality household items that were often modified for the tomb upon the death of the individual with additions such as inscriptions of religious text.",
