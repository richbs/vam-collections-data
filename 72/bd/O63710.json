The inscription implies that he gave the mask to Cyril Beaumont in 1926, which was the last time the ballet was performed by the Company in London, although it was performed elsewhere in 1927.  \nThe mask came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: Beaumont acquired a number of props and costume parts from various dancers, usually appropriately identified and inscribed.  The custom of giving parts of a costume as souvenirs has a long history and there is the legend that Nijinsky's dresser would sell petals from his Spectre de la rose costume to his fans.  Beaumont's collection included such small props and costume accessories as fans, masks and scarves and must have caused the Wardrobe a small headache as these items disappeared.",
