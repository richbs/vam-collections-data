Sydney was killed at the battle of Zutphen in 1586 and as John Hunnynge is said to have died in the same year, it may be that he perished there as well."

They all show military men, armed and very richly dressed, often with a depiction of a battle in the background.\n\nPeople\nThis may be a portrait of Captain John Hunnynge (1557-1586), one of the brave men the Queen sent out  to The Netherlands in 1585, under the incompetent leadership of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.  The English  forces were allies of the Dutch in their bitter struggle against their oppressive Spanish rulers.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nHunnynge's splendid outfit includes an unusual cap, which has on the front the spines of a porcupine. Other commanders in portraits of this period wear this kind of cap. It may be significant that the badge of Sir Philip Sydney, who also took part in the campaign, was the porcupine, symbolising obstinate defence. A full-length portrait of the naval commander Sir Francis Drake in the National Portrait Gallery, London, also includes a soft cap with porcupine quills on the front. Sydney was killed in The Netherlands  in 1586, at the battle of Zutphen. Since John Hunnynge died in the same year, it may be that he perished there as well.",
