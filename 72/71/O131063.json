So it was a family obligation to ensure that the grave of every deceased relative was furnished according to its means; not just food and wine, but also offerings of perfume. The wealthy would provide these offerings in flasks (unguentaria) made of silver or alabaster. With the arrival of glassblowing, poorer citizens now could offer similar items in glass.\n\nThere was also an extensive market for unguentaria in life as well as death; Roman society was fastidious about personal hygiene and appearance. And during the mid-1st century A.D., as glassworkers continued to adapt their skills, their wares steadily ousted their pottery counterparts from the marketplace. The forms of unguentaria steadily multiplied over the years-in particular, necks often were extended, to slow the evaporation of perfumed oils-as did their decoration, following stylistic trends of the glassworking industry overall.\n\nIn the mid 4th century A.D., the establishment of Constantinople as the new administrative heart of the Roman World resulted in many social and economic changes. But the Roman desire for perfumery and cosmetics remained a constant, and each time there was a change in shape among the gold and silver perfume bottles (unguentaria) of the wealthy, it soon was mimicked in glass.",
