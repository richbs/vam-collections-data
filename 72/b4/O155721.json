They are often decorated with animals, including birds and hares, amongst sprays of oak leaves with dots and stars in the background. They are painted in thick blue pigment called in Italian 'zaffera a rilievo' (relief-blue), a type of decoration used in Tuscany, particularly in the Florentine area ( but also in other regions) from the last third of the 14th century. \nThis jar was probably made in the same workshop responsible for the series of drug-jars made for the pharmacy of the main hospital in Florence, Santa Maria Nuova. These were traditionally attributed to the workshop of Giunta di Tugio, but new archival evidence suggests that more than one workshop supplied the hospital with ceramics; Maso and Miniato di Domenico could have equally produced these jars, as they are named as suppliers.  \nAlthough this particular jar does not belong to the same set, it is still possible that it was used as a drug-jar, as it bears scratch marks on the base made after the firing indicating its weight.",
