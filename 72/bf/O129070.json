He is best known for his designs for prints and printed books, although later in life he focussed increasingly on paintings. \n\nThis print is from Hokusai's ground-breaking series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, the first to exist exclusively of large-format prints of landscapes. It also made plentiful use of Prussian blue, a pigment which had only recently been introduced to Japan and was both expensive and rare. \n\nIn this print, Mount Fuji is seen in the far distance, beyond a large tree. Both tree and mountain dwarf a group of travellers, some of whom are trying to measure the circumference of the giant tree.",
