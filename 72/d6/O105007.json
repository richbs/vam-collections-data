Snuff is powdered tobacco fermented in salt, ground and scented and flavoured with spices such as cinnamon, cloves, lavender and bergamot. Snuff taking became popular in England with the Great Plague (1664-1665) as people thought it had valuable antiseptic properties. It was mainly a male habit, although Catherine de Medici started the fashion for snuff at the French court.\n\nThis snuff box has engraved and chased decoration of lovers but the most explicit image has been defaced. The inscriptions continue the amorous theme. They read \u2018jadore qui me brule\u2019 (\u2018I worship the one who sets me on fire\u2019) on the front, \u2018with permission madam\u2019 on the inside lid and \u2018of this snuff I shal nere have enough\u2019. This type of oval snuff box first appeared in the 1680s.",
