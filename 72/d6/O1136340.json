She wrote the majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913.  The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.  \n\nBefore her marriage in 1913, Potter would accompany her family to Scotland, Wales or the Lake District for holidays.  From 1903 one of Potter's favourite haunts was Gwaynynog in Denbigh, the old rambling home of her uncle and aunt, Fred and Harriet Burton.  The house features in her unfinished story of two bats, Flittermouse and Fluttermouse, who live 'amongst the dusty rafters'.  The garden at Gwaynynog inspired another unpublished story, 'Llewellyn's Well', written about 1911, and also the setting of one of Potter's best-loved published tales, The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies. On her first visit to Gwaynynog in 1903 Potter described the garden in her journal as 'the prettiest kind of garden, where bright old fashioned flowers grow amongst the currant bushes'.  She visited Gwaynynog again in March 1909 while working on her illustrations of the Flopsy Bunnies.  As respite from the business of writing and illustrating books, Potter would often escape the house to sketch the landscape around Gwaynynog, 'rich, undulating country, woods and pastures, all up and down ... not definitely fine landscape but beautiful in detail.'  This sketch dates from what was probably her last visit to Denbighshire before her marriage in October 1913.",
