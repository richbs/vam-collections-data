Egyptian women in the first millennium commonly wore hairnets made in this type of weave.\n\nWilliam Flinders Petrie, the father of English Egyptology, excavated at Hawara in 1888 and 1889, where he discovered cemeteries that had been used from the Ptolemaic period until at least the sixth century AD.",
