            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nMiniature painting in England was predominantly a portrait art.  But from the late 1620s Peter Oliver (possibly born in 1594, died 1647) also painted subject pictures in miniature. These are called 'Histories in limning' (limning was the traditional word for miniature) in Edward Norgate's treatise on miniature painting, entitled Miniatura; or, The Art of Limning . Norgate (born in the 1580s, died 1650)  was a contemporary of Oliver.\n\nPeople\nAs Norgate explained in his treatise, such subject miniatures were unknown in England until 'of late years it pleased a most excellent King to command...some of his own pieces, of Titian...to be translated into English limning, which indeed were admirably performed by his Servant, Mr Peter Oliver'. Charles I (ruled 1625-1649)  was a great connoisseur and collector. He had a magnificent collection of oil paintings.  His command to have them copied in miniature reflects the value he placed on both his collection and miniature painting, a highly prized and exquisite watercolour art.\n\nOwnership & Use\nCharles I (1625-1649) employed the Dutch wax-modeller  Abraham van der Doort  (born around 1575-1580, died 1640)  to look after his collection of paintings. This copy by Oliver after a painting by Titian (born around 1485, died 1576) was a highly prized object and stored as such.  Van der Doort recorded  for Charles that it was 'kept in your new cabinet room within your cupboards...at Whitehall'. Here, it was one of ten miniatures kept in 'double shutting cases with locks and keys and glasses over them'.  Titian's original oil painting, of which this is a copy, is now lost. But the miniature matches the description of the Titian in the inventory of Charles I's collection.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe miniature depicts the New Testament story of the Flight into Egypt. Joseph is warned in a dream that King Herod is seeking the infant Jesus to kill him. So he flees with Mary and Jesus to safety in Egypt.",

(4) Vertue also records at Mr Halstead's sale in May 1726 'a limning in a [rectangle of 5 x 8 in] or there/about St. Joseph the Virgin & Child a sleep a copy after\u2026Holbein.  Very neatly finished, P.Olivier Fe. 1628.'

(6)  Van der Doort's description of the original Titian corresponds closely with the copy: \n \n<i>In the Second & middle Privie Lodginge Roome\u2026Done by Tichian 15 Item the Picture of our Ladie & Christ with = Joseph leaning with his right hand upon a = hill whereby a Landskipp painted where afar of one is catching a young horse in the ffeilds conteyning .3. intire figures halfe Soe bigge as the life.  In a Carved guilded woodden frame.</i> \n \nThe size is given as 2ft 11 in x 5ft 6 om., i.e., about 89 x 167 cm. (7) \n \nVariants of the composition exist: \n \n1 The closest in subject is the small panel at Longleat (8) which differs from the miniature, however, in many details such as the position of Joseph's head, the posture of the Child and the landscape and background.  This version is now regarded as the <i>editio princeps</i> of the subject and is dated c. 1515. (9) According to Wethey, this panel had been in the collection of Rudlof II at Prague.  Van der Doort is thought to have served Rudlof before entering the service of Prince Henry in 1612, so he should have known both of these autograph versions of the picture. \n2 Closer in size but not in the subject  to the Charles I original is the school work in Contini-Bonacossi Collection. (10) Wethey, (11) referring to its 'blurred uncertain brushwork', dismissed it as an enlarged replica of the Longleat picture, but by the time he was composing the Addenda to volume I in 1975 (12) was prepared to hazard that it 'resembles the miniature and therefore must have belonged to the English monarch'.  It is not, however, sufficiently close to the miniature to justify this conclusion. \n \n1 Van der Doort, Windsor MS; Millar 1958-60, p. 102. \n2 Sold to Embry 21 May 1650 for \u00a350; Millar, 'The Inventories and Valuations of the King's Goods, 1649-51', <i>Walpole Society</i>, XLIII, 1970-2, p. 256, no. 16. \n3 Personal communication. \n4 Transcribed in Vertue IV, pp. 89 ff. \n5 Vertue II, p. 13.\n6 Long 1923, pp. 88-9.\n7 Van der Doort, Ashmole MS; Millar 1958-60, pp. 16-17. \n8 46.3 x 61.5 cm; seen by Jonathan Mayne at the Burlington House Exhibition, <i>Holbein and Other Masters</i>, 1950-1, no. 218. \n9 Wethey 1969-75, vol.
