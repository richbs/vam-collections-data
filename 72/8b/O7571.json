            "physical_description": "[Puppet] Jointed marionette puppet of wood, metal, plaster and cloth with wood and metal control and multicoloured strings.\nThe puppet itself has a carved head and dowel stick neck.  It is painted pink with blue eyes highlighted with black and white, black stroke eyebrows, rosy cheeks and a closed, smiling mouth.  The hair is blond nylon mohair glued to the head. The torso is made of two part, upper/chest and lower/hips.  The legs and arms are each made of two pieces of dowel painted pink; the legs are thicker than the arms.  The hands are made of moulded pink plaster and the feet of moulded plaster painted metallic grey.  The head, body and arms are joined by steel eyelet screws, while the legs are jointed at the hips, knees and ankles by steel plates, nailed into each part.  The strings are knotted to various parts of the body - two black ones to the head by steel eyelets painted pink on either side; two reds ones, to the hands; two blue ones just above the knees and a yellow one to the back of the body.  The strings are tied to the wooden control, two bars of wood linked together by a large metal clip which will allow the bars to twist out to form a +.  The red ones are tied to an eyelet covered with a red plastic dome, the blue ones to two eyelets covered with a blue plastic dome and the yellow likewise attached to an eyelet covered by a yellow plastic dome.  At the top of the bars is a large black metal hook which can be used to hang the puppet up.\nThe puppet is dressed as a fairy in white rayon with the skirt covered with white nylon net and decorated with coloured sequins.  Attached to the back are wings of white felt, also decorated with sequins.\n[Box] Window box leeve of yellow cardboard printed in colours to show the maker's details and illustrations of a rnge of figures made by the company.  The window is cellophane.\n[Box] Box of yellow cardboard which has been constructed and folded in a way to produce an inner lining to each side.  The outside is printed in colours to show the maker's trademark and details, one illustration and three sets of instructions.  One set is TO TAKE PUPPET OUT OF BOX, the second is TO PUT PUPPET BACK IN BOX and the third, printed on the bottom together with an illustration, is TO MAKE THE PUPPET WALK.\n[Insert] White cardboard, foled and shaped to hold the puppet.  At one end a circle has been cut out to support the puppet's head and allow the control and strings to be placed underneath.\n[Instructions sheet] Instructions sheet for the control of a puppet, white glossy paper printed in black.  As well as the instructions and accompanying drawings, there is an illustration entitled Scene from \"Little Red Riding Hood\", a membership form for the PELPUP Club and a letter about it signed PELPOP and a letter about working the puppets signed Bob Pelham.",
