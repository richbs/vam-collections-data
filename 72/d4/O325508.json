A bag like this continued in use with traditional dress in several areas of northern Europe, most notably Scotland, where the 'sporran' is one of the most conspicuous elements of a man's traditional costume, and is still part of ceremonial dress for many Scottish regiments.\n\nIn all other areas it was worn only by women, usually suspended from a matching decorative belt hook, as here.  Norwegian purse mounts were often made of brass, rather than the silver which was used for all their other jewellery.  Silver purse mounts are usually from the Netherlands.  This purse-mount was described as 17th century Norwegian, when it was given to the Museum in 1919, but it is more likely to date from the early 19th century.",
