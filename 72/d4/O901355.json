E. Bentley Jr. <i>Blake Books </i>1977\nLit: <i>William Blake</i>, Martin Butlin, Tate Gallery, London, 1978.\n\n<i>Jerusalem</i>, a poem written and illustrated by William Blake, was printed by the artist from plates he had prepared himself.  The complete work, some one hundred pages long, is important in the history of English literature and book production, while at the same time each page is technically a print.  That Blake thought of them in this light is suggested by the inclusion of 'Detached specimens of an original illuminated poem Jerusalem' in the exhibition of the Associated Painters in Watercolours in 1812.  <i>Jerusalem</i> is a complex work expressing Blake's religious philosophical ideas in terms of his personal mythology and containing references to The Bible, to London and to people Blake knew. Jerusalem is the emanation, or female counterpart, of Albion, and archetype for mankind and England.  The significance of the two figures on this plate is open to question but they are thought possibly to represent the daughters of Albion.\nThis work was the last in a series of illuminated books Blake published from 1789 onwards.  On the reverse of this sheet is a hand-coloured version of what became Plate 9 of the final work.  There are six contemporary copies, or part copies of Jerusalem in existence and of these, only one, in the Paul Mellon Collection, is complete and hand-coloured throughout.\nBlake was a non-conformist in matters of technique.  He is known for grinding his own colours at a time when prepared watercolours had become the norm and in 1795 he made a series of prints, known only in a couple of impressions each, by offprinting from a painted flat surface and working up the results with a pen and watercolour.  He left no record of the technique used in printing his illuminated books but it is now generally accepted that they are relief etchings, with the text and illustrations being transferred onto the plate in reverse (so that the hand-written text would print the right way round) in an acid-resistant medium.<sup>1</sup>  The blank areas would be bitten with acid, and the parts of the plate left standing proud, inked as in any relief print.  This is the main technique used to produce the lettering and line of illustration, printed in blue. \nBlake, who was assisted by his wife, never coloured two copies of a work in the same manner.  Writers on Blake have accepted the hand-colouring on this sheet as being by Blake himself.  The non-naturalistic subject is enhanced with non-naturalistic colouring. One cannot explain away the impact of this image by dissecting the colouring but it is worth noting such things, as the discreet touch of green by the swan-figure's beak, the outlining of the lover figure in thick granular pigment, the playfulness of the little red fish and the perfect intermingling of smoke grey and blue in a cloud that swirls behind most of the text. \nBlake transformed each page he hand-coloured into a unique work of art.  While still being in the strictest sense a hand-coloured print, this example is diametrically opposed to the products of the cosy publisher-dominated world of most pre-twentieth century hand-colouring, carried out by professional colourists and aiming at uniformity between copies of the same image.\n\n1.
