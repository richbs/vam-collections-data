The object of the game is to confine the Fox to a corner, so that he cannot move out.  The Geese march forward on the straight lines, not on the diagonals; and whenever a Goose is on a spot next to the fox, the latter can take him, as in Draughts, by leaping over him, forward or sideways on the straight lines, but the Geese are not allowed to move back.  In order to pin the Fox in a corner, the Geese must go forward one after another in such a way as to fill up all the spots behind, so as to leave the Fox no spot into which he can jump.  When the number of Geese is reduced to six, it is impossible for them to confine the Fox, but, properly played, the Geese must win.\n\nThere are other wiays of playing this game, as by placing the fox on another spot and altering the arrangement of the Geese.  The game may be played so as to make the Fox take all the Geese without being himself taken or confined to any particular square.  In the latter case, the Fox chooses his own square at starting.  If played on a draught board, the best position for the Geese- which may be represented by eight white draughts men-is on the two upper rows of squares 1-8, and for the Fox which may be represented by a king, square 11.  If properly moved on the diagonal lines, the Fox must be driven towards the left corner and pinned in square 29.\n\nRules placement: under the game",
