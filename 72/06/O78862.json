Bibles, though more common than other types of books, were treated with particular reverence. This made their bindings especially important.  Embroidered bookbindings were more common than those made of tapestry, but rarely survive. Tapestry was more hardwearing.\n\nMaterials & Making \nThe Bible is printed with the line  'The Holy Bible imprinted at London by Robert Barker, 1614 '. It shows precisely the style and workmanship of professional tapestry-weaving used on small highly-valued objects at this period. Expensive materials have been used - silk and metal thread. Tapestry cushion covers and large wallhangings were made largely of wool.",
