The stiff cotton is ideal to hold the angular details and keep the line of the straight skirt. Until the mid 1950s the alternative to this shape was the silhouette with a similar neat corsage and small waist, but with a full, bouffant skirt.\n\nThis dress was worn by Lady Alexandra Dacre of Glanton. It forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. This Collection was brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
