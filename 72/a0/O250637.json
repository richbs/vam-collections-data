She released two poisonous snakes into the infants room, but he strangled them using his superhuman strength.\n\nHercules (Greek name is Heracles) is one of the most important heroes in Greek mythology. He was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, a Theban princess. He is regarded as the embodiment of physical strength and courage.",
