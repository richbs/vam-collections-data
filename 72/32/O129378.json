This silk playbill was printed in London for a Benefit performance in April 1819 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, by Command of the Duke of Sussex, and in the presence of the Dukes of Kent and Sussex. Since the Haymarket Theatre was only licensed for its usual repertoire in the summer, the theatre often housed Benefit Performances when it was closed.\n\nThe entertainment was light, comprising a comedy, comic songs, and a farce. The purpose of the evening was serious however, raising funds for a Philanthropic Institution in London's Titchfield Street which provided 'temporary relief to the Distressed', many of whom were in 'the last stages of Wretchedness'. Before Britain developed its welfare state provisions in the 1940s, poor relief and the establishment and running of hospitals were in the hands of philanthropic benefactors. The black border may have been a mark of respect for those who lost their lives. \n\nThe playbill indicates that it was a long evening, with a six-thirty start and cheaper admission after eight-thirty, and lists the names and addresses of thirty-two gentlemen from whom tickets could be bought. Since the silk version would probably only have been printed for the performance itself, it is likely to have been a re-print of the paper version used as advance advertising.",
