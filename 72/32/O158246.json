He was an artist of great versatility: a watercolourist, etcher and engraver, and designer of wallpapers, tapestries and other textiles, metal furniture, stained glass and sgraffito decoration for churches and chapels. He was also a remarkable self-taught archaeologist.\n\nHis first publication, 'The Itchen Valley' was a collection of etchings that came out in 1881, and he continued to publish illustrated books throughout his life. Many, like this print of Winchester College, are topographical in subject. His feeling for line was evident throughout his oeuvre, although he virtually abandoned the medium of etching after the mid-1890s in favour of other forms of graphic expression.",
