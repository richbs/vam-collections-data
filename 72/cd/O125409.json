Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n\n<b>Tethered Rams</b> \nFA95 Neg GA1187 \nPanel, 45.7 X 58.4 cm (18 X 23 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1839 as 'Tethered Rams - Scene in Scotland'. The <u>Art Union</u> critic thought it 'a fine picture of a peculiar character; with little of what the general observer will consider interesting; but of large value as a work of art. It is elaborately finished - as if the artist had determined to do his best'. Waagen described it as 'well composed, and of beautiful tone in the landscape; but the treatment too broad and slight'. On the other hand, \nRedgrave admired the handling: \n\nThe fullest truth of a woolly texture is obtained by simply, with a full brush, applying the more solid pigment into that which has already been laid on as a ground, with a large admixture of the painter's vehicle; days might be spent endeavouring to arrive at a result which the painter has achieved at once'. \n\nRedgrave's comments are indicative of the admiration Landseer's sheer technique inspired in contemporary critics and artists. \n\nHague, following Stephens, states that the work is a study for 'The Drovers' Departure' exhibited at the RA in 1835 (see p139). This may well be incorrect; the resemblance to any part of the latter's composition is not close, and the present work was exhibited four years after. Hague also comments that the work is a 'good example of the more finished technique Landseer adopted at this time, in contrast to the freer brushwork of his earlier work. His eyesight was failing by 1850 however, so the period of high finish was short'. Hague adds that the high finish 'was probably encouraged by Prince Albert who admired the German Nazarene painters', whose influence also formed part of the background to the precise handling of the PreRaphaelites in the late 1840s. \n\nA pen and ink sketch was sold at Christie's 17 March 1873 (101), bought Vokins \u00a333 12s; it later belonged to Capt W H F Palmer, and was exhibited at the RA 1874 commemorative exhibition (30).\n\nEXH: \tRA 1839 (145); <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (862, lent by Sheepshanks); <i>Landseer and His Worl</i> Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield, 1972 (67) \n\nENGR: John Burnet 1845 (repr in<u> Stephens</u>, p52); Charles J Tomkins 1881, as pl 94 of <i>Works of Sir Edwin Landseer</i> RA (first series 1881-93) \n\nLIT: <u>Art Union</u> 1839, p68; G Waagen <u>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</u> 1854, Il, p306; T Gautier <u>Les Beaux Arts en Europe</u> 1855, p77; <u>Art Journal</u> 1856, p79;<u> Stephens,</u> p52; <u>Dafforne</u>, p19; Mann I, p30; <u>Graves</u> no 264; Redgrave <u>(Cent)</u> p383; J Manson <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1902, pp99-100; J Hague <u>Landseer and His World</u> Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield, 1972, p65-6; <u>Lennie</u>, pp55, 83, 95\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nRichard Ormond, <u>Monarch of the Glen: Landseer in the Highlands</u>.
