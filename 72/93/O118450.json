Each side of the arms except the underside, and each side of the stiles, but the inside, is carved with like designs.  The back is fitted with six twisted balusters, and on each side of these, half a baluster attached to the side of each stile.   The arms terminate in scrolls and rest on barley-sugar twist supports such as constitute the legs and stretchers.  The legs and stretchers join into a rectangular block, carved in the manner of the rest of the chair, which rests immediately above the chair's cup feet.",

This idea was supported by the rigid, rectilinear forms of the furniture, which looked antiquated to 18th century eyes; the use of twist-turning, which was believed to be typical of Elizabethan furniture; the bizarre, intricate carving, which often included mythic beasts and figures; and the colour, black, which was commonly associated with furniture of great antiquity. \n\nFor Horace Walpole, who appears to have been responsible for this attribution, notions about the age of such furniture based on its physical attributes were confirmed by the existence of examples in houses with Tudor associations.\n\nBy the early 19th century Walpole\u2019s views that carved ebony furniture of this type was both English and of early date had become firmly established.  In actual fact this type of ebony furniture was made in South India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies in the late 17th and 18th centuries.",
