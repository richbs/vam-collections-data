Sander trained at the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte during the mid-1930s and was heavily influenced by the International Modernism that was prevalent in Vienna and Germany at this time. She returned to Germany to set up practice designing textiles and wallpapers as well as furniture and room schemes. Her interest in surface pattern is seen here in the light floral repeat pattern on the matching lampshades and bedcover, which stand out against the plain walls. The stark, straight lines of hate wardrobe and dressing table are balanced by the rounded forms of the lamps and sleigh bed. Her practical, space-saving techniques can be seen in the shelves which are neatly fitted into the end on the wardrobe, so avoiding the clutter of extra furniture. Sander emigrated to Britain in 1936 but, denied a work permit, was unable to continue her career.\"",
