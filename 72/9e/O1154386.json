An Earl, his family, friends and servants are shipwrecked on a desert island. The Earl is a man of liberal social views; his butler, Crichton, a firm believer in the status quo. But as the most practical of the castaways Crichton finds himself in charge and by Act III, set two years after the shipwreck, he has assumed authority.\n\nWhen the play was revived at the Royalty Theatre in 1920 the women's Act III costumes were designed by Claude Shepperson (1867-1921), an artist and book illustrator who was better known for his black and white line drawings than as a costume designer. Shepperson created some amusing outfits which showed that the characters has become acclimatised to their surroundings. Tweeny, the 'between maid' who would assist the cook and the housemaid back in England, still wears the skirt from her maid's uniform but has flowers in her hair and a swathe of large green leaves across her shoulder.",
