In 1856 he appointed Charles Thurston Thompson as \u2018Official Museum Photographer\u2019 and the \u2018first museum photographic service\u2019 came into being.\n\nPhotographs such as these were originally collected by the National Art Library as part of a programme to record works of art, architecture and design in the interest of public education, these photographs were valued as records and as source material for students of architecture and design.  As well as being crucial records of the history of the V&amp;A, and an important element within the National Art Library's visual encyclopaedia, these photographs are also significant artefacts in the history of the art of photography.",
