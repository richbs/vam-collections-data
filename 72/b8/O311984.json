This plaquette celebrates the return of the regions of Alsace and Lorraine which had been annexed by the German Empire in 1871 and were only returned to France under the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty, signed 28 June 1919. The images of a young girl from Alsace and Strabourg Cathedral are present in medals by other French artists commissioned by the Paris Mint. Prud'homme's personal style was criticised by the French writer and collector, Classens, as simply repeating old formulas, but in the plaquettes for Alsace and Lorraine a freer approach is acknowledged.",
