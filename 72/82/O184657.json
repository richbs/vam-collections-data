Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Sicily, but its design, of a filigree top with a plaque in the centre, and pendant strips of gold, is more common in central Italy, in places like the Abruzzi and Molise.  The mix of red sheet and yellow filigree gold is typical of all kinds of jewellery from southern Italy.  \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.  At the top of the wire there is a small loop, through which the wearer threaded a ribbon, to help relieve the strain on the ear-lobe.",
