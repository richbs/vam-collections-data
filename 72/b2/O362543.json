Full length with a closely fitting bodice and Princess line with a straight cut front. At the back it is gored and slightly trained. The neck is high and there is a turn down collar. The sleeves are full length, medium wide and straight. From neck to hip it fastens with concealed hooks and eyes, and large buttons stitched to the face form a false fastening. From knee to hem, the garment is roughly fastened together with stitching. There are pockets towards the back and there is a deep tuck at knee level. The garment is machine stitched and the workmanship suggests either amateur or cheap professional work.",
