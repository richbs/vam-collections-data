London: Oxford University Press, 1946-49. Vol 1: London and Middlesex, Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire. p.187.\n'Of all the counties close to the metropolis, Hertfordshire is the least exploited, the least publicized, the quietest.  For this reason, its recording was considered less urgent, and was effected less fully, than its neighbours'.\n\nThe two main threats to its peace are the colony of cinematic studios near Elstree and the Great Cambridge Road.  Elstree, which falls well within the boundaries of a good map of London, was past its best - some way past - before the film magnates found it.  The Cambridge Road, on the other hand, following the Roman Ermine Street, runs through the length of the county and traverses some of its pleasantest scenery, and along or beside it most of the recording was done - at Ware, Wadesmill, High Cross, Much Hadham, Standon, Puckeridge, Braughing, and Westmill.  The ribbon development that so obstinately results from the widening of arterial ways is not yet here so pronounced as on some of the other main routes radiating from London; but there is always the marked tendency for highway villages, once separate and removed, to approach, merge, and lose their individuality.  Sometimes, after the construction of a by-pass, a few old villages will drop (the hectic days behind them) back into cruising speed, while others are rudely accelerated, knocked up, beaten up in their stead.  They never know what a year may bring.'",
