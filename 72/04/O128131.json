Organised by four Scottish art schools, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, its collection of foreign and British embroidery was available to domestic science and training colleges, women's institutions and schools, as well as art schools.  By 1939, the Scheme had acquired some 900 embroideries but the outbreak of WWII closed the Scheme and the collection was retained by the four original art schools.  Glasgow School of Art was instrumental in re-starting the scheme late in 1944 and the NDS was gradually expanded to encompass other art schools in the United Kingdom where embroidery was taught.  The NDS was disbanded in 1961 when funding was withdrawn, although it was recognised that the Scheme had achieved its aims.  Its collection was divided and distributed to various organisations including the Embroiderers Guild, The National Museum of Scotland and the V&A. \n\nElizabeth Geddes trained at Reading University of Art as a book illustrator and wood engraver, before studying hand and machine embroidery.  She did freelance work for the NDS as creative assistant to Iris Hills, 'Expert in Charge'.",
