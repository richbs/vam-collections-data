Other small-scale domestic items produced by the firm included umbrella stands and caskets.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe design for this fruit dish was first produced about 1820 by the distinguished German architect and designer Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841) for the Prussian Royal Foundry. It uses the same frieze of hippocamps and mermen that appears on the iron balustrade for the Schlossbr\u00fccke in Berlin (1819-24).\n\nDesign & Manufacture\nSchinkel designed several types of fruit dishes and garden furniture reusing elements of his designs in a variety of wares.  Coalbrookdale seems to have pirated several of his designs and to have copied other works made by the Berlin foundry, which  reputedly produced the finest cast iron in Europe. The slightly blurred quality of the casting suggests that a mould was taken from an original die, and a casting then produced. This design was still being manufactured in 1877, and featured in the Coalbrookdale catalogue that year.  The fruit dish has been covered with a gold wash to make it more attractive.",

The original was designed in the 1820s for the Berlin Royal Iron Foundry by the German architect and designer, Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841).  Schinkel designed a number of domestic items for the three Royal iron foundries including several openwork dishes, but Coalbrookdale appear only to have reproduced two of them, this example and a slightly smaller pattern with nerieds and sea monsters (see Berlin exhibition catalogue 406).  The slightly blurred quality of the casting suggests that the mould was taken from an existing plate.  The dishes are described in an article in the <u>Art Union</u> in 1846 (with no mention of their Berlin origins) and can be found in the Coalbrookdale catalogue of 1877, but do not appear thereafter, indicating that the Victorian taste for such objects was relatively short lived.",
