His work dominated the poster hoardings of Britain between the two world wars, and his advertisements, book illustrations and theatre designs were ubiquitous and highly influential. \n\nAt the beginning of his career, Kauffer regarded himself as a painter, rather than a graphic designer, and he continued to paint throughout his career.  This landscape was probably painted in Aix-en-Provence, where in April 1936 Kauffer went 'on a painting expedition'; during the trip he visited Aldous Huxley and painted his garden. (Mark Haworth-Booth and G. Twemlow, <u>E. McKnight Kauffer: a designer and his public</u>, London: V&A, 2005, p. 78.) This is one of a group of four oil paintings by McKnight Kauffer purchased by the museum in 1980.",
