(<i>see also</i> below).\n\n<b>Description.</b>--A catalogue of useful and fancy articles in bronze and ormolu.   10 in. by 13 in., 70 plates.   Neither date nor water mark.   In original grey boards with leather back.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--Inkstands, candlesticks, vases, bottles in metal supports, thermometers, wax boxes, and the like as indicated below.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--On the front is a label :  Lustre, Candelabras, Lamps, Inkstands, Flower vases, Paper Weights in Bronze or Or-Molu.\n   This list, of 70 plates, was printed by E. Lucas, 70 Mount Street, Birmingham.   It is endorsed inside \" M. &amp; P. G., 1104, 10 per cent.,\" and \" Book 307.\"   The engraving is decidedly good, dimensions are furnished in some cases, but all the prices are written in ink.   It opens with inkstands drawn about half size, as far as can be judged.   As affording some idea of values, No. 299, a two-well stand about 14-in. long, with a portrait bust of Shakespeare, is priced as 33<i><sup>s</sup></i>. 9<i><sup>d</sup></i>.  Some of the simpler patterns were supplied in as many as ten sizes.   The inkwells were glass, probably of excellent quality, for the lustre had come into vogue when this book was published.   Candlesticks were priced with and without drops, and thereby we get some idea of the cost of these ornaments.   No. 1350, candlesticks 12\u00bc in. high on a square base, are priced \" 55<i><sup>s</sup></i>. pr. with glass, 34<sup><i>s</i></sup>. without.\"   A guinea paid for eight drops on each candlestick, 32 glass pieces in all.   The finishes of the goods in the case of a pair of vases for flowers are specified as \" Lac. 9<i><sup>d</sup></i>., rich gold colr., also bronz.\"   Candle lamps about 12 in. or 14. in. high, with as far as can be ascertained, a spring in the column and a metal shade, cost from 12<sup><i>s</i></sup>. 6<sup><i>d</i></sup>. to 20<sup><i>s</i></sup>., according to design.
