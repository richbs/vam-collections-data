Executed by the female students of the Porcelain Class at South Kensington, under the direction of Francis Wollaston Thomas Moody (1824-86), the designer of the casket made to hold Prince Albert's season ticket to the Great Exhibition (Exhibition no. 32), this tile portrait may possibly have been intended for insertion in one of the galleries being built in the Museum at this time. The South Kensington Porcelain Class, which was supplied with blanks by Minton & Co., painted the Minton tiles which decorate the Grill Room, or Poynter Room, as it is now called after its designer, Sir Edward James Poynter (1836-1919) in the V&A. Porcelain classes, where porcelain blanks were painted with glaze decoration, became very popular for middle and upper class women during this period, and the trend continued into the early twentieth century."
