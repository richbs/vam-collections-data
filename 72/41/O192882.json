It was found in Bratislava on the same evening as Civic Forum, the 19th of November 1989, by Slovak actor Milan Kna\u017eko, performer J\u00e1n Budaj and sociologist Fedor G\u00e1l.  The VPN movement was active from 1989 until the 5th of March 1991 when it split off into the Movement for Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) with Vladim\u00edr Meciar as its political leader and the Civic Democratic Union (OD\u00da-VPN) led by Fedor G\u00e1l. The HZDS won the elections in 1992. The Civic Democratic Union (OD\u00da-VPN) dissolved in November 1992 after losing public support. \n\nSlovak designer Karol Rosm\u00e1ny created the VPN logo as a hand-painted initial letter \u2018V\u2019 in the Slovak national tricolour (blue, red and white). It recalls \u2018velvet revolution\u2019 graffiti\npainted quickly on city walls and hung on banners from shop windows. The letter \u2018V\u2019 is a well-known symbol for \u2018Victory\u2019 and was often appeared as a hand gesture during the mass demonstrations in November 1989. \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
