It is an excellent example of how illuminating goldsmiths' marks can be, when trying to find out more about the history of a piece of silver. \n\nWhen this candlestick was first acquired by the Museum in 1926, the Toulouse town mark struck inside the foot (TOL/Y with a fleur-de-lys above) was identified as that for 1684-87. This was later revised to 1693-94 (a similar looking mark), since the candlestick bears two duty (tax) marks (L in the centre of four crowns, and M beneath a fleur-de-lys between two stars) that were not registered until 26 June 1688. These duty marks also tell us that the candlestick was made in 1693 not 1694 because the Toulouse goldsmiths' guild replaced them with new marks in September 1693. The maker's mark (G/BAR/RAV over the dove of the Holy Ghost) stands for Guillaume Barrau (1661-1706), who became a master goldsmith in Toulouse in 1685.",
