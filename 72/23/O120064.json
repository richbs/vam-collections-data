Both mark different stages in the development of the composition of arguably the artist's most important work, the Rape of the Sabines in the Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence.  The present piece is made up of only two surviving figures, a male supporting a female in the air.  A composition such as this could not be executed in marble as the bulk of the weight of the piece would necessarily be high up and could not be supported at the ankles of the male figure in marble.  It is therefore most likely that this group was the sketch-model for Giambologna's bronze version, which would have the tensile strength to support the composition.  Examples of the bronze version survive in the Kunsthistorischesmuseum in Vienna and the Museo Nationale di Capodimonte, Naples and are known to have been cast for Ottavio Farnese in 1579.  The deterioration and many losses to this group mean that it is possible that a third figure was present at the base of the group, or was inserted at a later date.",
