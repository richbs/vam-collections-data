He became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1783.\n\nThis work is a typical example of Netherlandish decorative paintings, which developed at the end of the 18th century under the influence of the French Rococo. It shows a company of putti playing with flowers and imitates classical low-relief in trompe-l\u2019oeil. This painting was probably used as an overdoor decoration.",

In the same year he moved to Paris, where he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale (1783) and court painter to the Prince du Cond\u00e9 and to Louis XVI.  During this period he returned frequently to Flanders, where he was engaged in buying pictures for the Comte D' Angiviller in 1785-86. He joined the side of the Revolutionaries in c. 1789, was allowed a studio in the Louvre and in 1795, commanded a battalion of the Parisian National Guard. Nevertheless, in 1814 he assured the Prince du Cond\u00e9 that he had been a royalist all the time. In 1808 he returned to Tournai, where he became a teacher at the Academy. \nHe painted mainly decorative grisailles in imitation of classical sculpture, and also miniatures imitating cameos. His decorations still exist at the Chateaux of Compi\u00e8gne (1785), Rambouillet (1786-87) and Fontainebleau (1786). Several of his portraits, including that of William Beckford, were engraved. \nThe Museum also has a drawing of a Sacrifice by Sauvage (D.376-1887) and a miniature in the style of Sauvage (Dept. of Metalwork, 216-1878). \n\nAscribed to Piat Joseph SAUVAGE \n321\nCUPIDS PLAYING \nOil on canvas; grisaille in imitation of marble bas relief \n36 x 54 (91.4 x 137) \nE.1098-1911 \n\nThe attribution to Sauvage dates from 1928. It is typical of Sauvage's technique, but, as his name has become a blanket term covering all such grisaille imitations of reliefs, from which the truly autograph work is difficult to distinguish, it is perhaps wiser not to indulge in over-positive attributions without supporting evidence of some kind, such as we have in the case of the <i>Sale of Cupids</i> (9120-1863; no. 320). \nThere is another version of the composition by Sauvage in the La Rochelle Museum (exh. <i>The age of Neo-classicism</i>, Council of Europe, London, R. A., 1972, no. 234).\n\nProv. Collection Henry James King, who gave it to the Museum in 1911. \nLit. V. & A. Museum, <i>Review of Principal Acquisitions</i>, 1911, p, 25.\nV. & A.

His compositions often draw from classical low-reliefs or contemporary sculptures however the precise model of this painting, if any, has not been identified. \nE.1098-1911 shows a company of putti playing with flowers, on the far left a putto is turning a brazier upside down and was probably placed over a door. This type of composition is typical of the Netherlandish decorative paintings from the late 18th century, which developed under the influence of French Rococo. Often called <i>witjes</i> in reference to the leading figure in this category, Jacob de Wit (1695-1754), these pieces usually show small figures placed in a mythological and allegorical context. \nSauvage, who was a Flemish painter, probably drew from these compositions to develop his own successful style in France. Comparable grisaille can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York: <i>Infant Bacchanal</i>, 1780s (Inv. 07.225.314b) and in the Philadelphia Museum of Art: <i>Putti leading a Goat by a Chain of Flowers</i> (Inv. 1942-90-2) and <i>Putti Playing with Birds</i> (Inv. 1942-90-1). The museum holds two similar grisaille by another representative exponent of this genre: Hendrik Willem Schweickhardt (see 559-1882 and 560-1882).",

            "historical_context_note": "<i>Grisaille</i> is a term applied to monochrome painting carried out mostly in shades of grey. The use of the French word can be traced only to 1625, although grisaille painting was done in preceding centuries. The origin of monochrome figure painting is to be found in Italian wall painting such as Giotto's painted the stone-coloured allegories of the Virtues and Vices, conceived as statues facing each other in fictive niches on the walls of the nave in the Arena Chapel in Padua (1303-06). The allegories, subordinated by their stone quality to the coloured (and therefore more lifelike) figures in the scenes from the History of Salvation, have nonetheless the highest degree of reality within the picture programme because of their illusionist presentation. \nGrisaille painting increasingly appeared in thematically or formally subordinated areas, however the explicit imitation of stone continued to play an important role. In the large fresco programmes of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries grisaille helped to spread illusionism to painting in colour. Michelangelo's polychrome prophets and sibyls (1508-12) on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome for example are placed between grisaille figures appearing like reliefs or caryatids on pilasters and are thrust by them into the beholder's space. The case is similar with Annibale Carracci's frescoes (1597-1600) of the Galleria of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome or Paolo Veronese's wall paintings (1561-2) in the Villa Barbaro in Maser.",
