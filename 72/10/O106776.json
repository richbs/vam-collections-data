It dates from the 1750s, when the style was fashionable. Bread baskets were handed round the table, so the decoration and armorials (an engraved coat of arms on this example) were highly visible and important. \n\nThe maker, Samuel Herbert, specialised in pierced work, which you can see on this example. He used it both on baskets and epergnes (table centrepieces).",
