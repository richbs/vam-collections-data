It is probably for the border of a petticoat to a woman's open gown or for the border of the gown itself.  Women wore gowns that were open in front to reveal the petticoat.  This design is for the embroidery along the border above the bottom hem of a petticoat, and also for such a border on the gown itself. The design repeated so that this pattern continued around the border.  The rose buds were likely to have been scattered over the rest of the petticoat or gown. The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. \n\nThe names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy.  This design is inscribed  'Miss Pelham (Stanmer)'  who was Miss Emily Pelham.  She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Pelham, 1st Earl of Chichester (Pelham of Stanmer). She gave her sister's (Lady Middleton's) pattern, another design of from this group, to a family friend, Miss Holroyd. Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.",

He did not specialise in collecting textiles although he owned some examples.  He was in contact with the Museum 1920s-1970 offering to sell objects from his collection.  Johnes did not provide the Museum with information about the history of ownership of the designs. \n\n*Mr B.W. Robinson, former Keeper of the Far Eastern Department, V&A, in a letter to Mr Ayres, Assistant- Keeper in the same Department, V&A Regsitry, nominal file, (MA/1/J479). \n\n**Johnes, Raymond. <u>Japanese Art</u> London: Spring Books, 1961.",

            "production_note": "The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  Miss Pelham whose name is inscribed on this design was such an aristocratic client. These clients had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Miss Pelham was Miss Emily Pelham.  She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Pelham, 1st Earl of Chichester (Pelham of Stanmer) and Frances and Lucy Pelham's sister. Emily is not listed in Burkes Peerage, possibly because she was a younger daughter and perhaps she did not get married. It is, however, clear that Emily was Lucy's sister (Maria Josepha Holroyd's stepmother) from the evidence of the Hon. Miss Holroyd's letters, for example, 'To my great satisfaction and pleasure, Emily got unexpected leave to accompany Milady (her sister) to Town.' 6  Emily Pelham is indexed as 'Lucy, Lady Sheffield's sister)' in Jane Adeane's publication of Maria Josepha Holroyd's letters.",
