It continued in Karsavina\u2019s repertoire being seen at the Winter Gardens, Bournemouth in 1921, on Karsavina\u2019s British regional tour in 1922 and again at the London Coliseum in 1922 and 1925. Karsavina also wore this costume for her appearance (presumably dancing this Polka) in the film Old Wives Tales in a scene in a Parisian caf\u00e9 in 1921.\n\nAccounts of Karsavina performance and this costume effect on stage appears in a number of publications. At the London Coliseum this costume was seen against a stage strikingly decorated at the back with \u2018luminous blue curtains, with one straight pillar of dark shade in the centre\u2019. Karsavina Dances. Lovat Fraser\u2019s Last Designs. A Paradox of Pleasure, Observer 17 July 1921 p.5. \n\nCostume described by Frank Rutter in Art in Movement. The Last Designs of Lovat Fraser, The Sunday Times 17 July 1921 p.4 as a \u2018yellow Dolly Vardon\u2019.\n\nPopp\u0153a Vanda in her unpublished essay on Karsavina in Rachel Cameron collection described this as Karsavina\u2019s \u2018most popular solo\u2019 and went on:\u2018Claude Lovat Fraser designed a costume which fitted both the music and the dance perfectly. In a flame coloured dress with a bustle, pink tights, black shoes, a queer little flat plate of a hat poised insecurely on the side of her head and her hair done in bunches of little ringlets bobbed round her face, Karsavina danced the polka\u2026.it was utterly unlike anything else she did. It was an adorable little dance, all clean sharp movements, perhaps slightly puppet-like; but it was a real person playing puppet\u2026and the whole was pervaded by a dignified pertness.\u2019\n\nThe Music for this solo was suggested to Karsavina by music critic Edwin Evans as she wrote in \u2018Partner Problems\u2019, Dancing Times April 1967 pp364, 365, 367: \u2018It was called because Friday was the day when the composers regularly met at the club founded by a musical patron and editor. A new composition had to be written for the day of this reunion. I often wondered whether this composite effort had been written on the same principle as the game of consequences.\u2019",
