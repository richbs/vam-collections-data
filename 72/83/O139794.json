The neck opening has been filled with bands of coarse net re-embroidered with gilt and cream silk. The gown has been slightly shaped by having the fullness brought in at the shoulders and stitched in a pleat.

She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style. While most of the clothes of hers held by the Museum are from the 1920s, the collection also includes a group of 1910s clothes mainly by Paul Poiret, who was a personal friend of Emilie Grigsby. This tea gown by Callot Soeurs was said at time of acquisition to have possibly been made from a North African robe.",
