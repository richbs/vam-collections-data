Each woodcut image is only about 7.5cm high but the compositions are monumental with figure groups in expansive interiors and landscape settings. Altdorfer drew the compositions four to a woodblock to help ensure evenness of printing across the set. The compositions were copied in altarpieces and miniature paintings by other artists. They were never copied as woodcuts, a testament to the technical accomplishment required to make small woodcuts of such as high pictorial standard.\n\nSets of small woodcuts were sometimes pasted into books as illustrations. However, these woodcuts are thought likely to have been made with a collector\u2019s market in mind. This is underlined by their relatively high survival rate.",
