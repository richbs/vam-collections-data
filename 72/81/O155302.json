She wrote the majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913.  The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.  \n\nAs well as an accomplished story-teller, Beatrix Potter was also a keen nature artist.  Her menagerie of childhood pets included rabbits, frogs, squirrels, mice and hedgehogs. Later, when illustrating her series of Peter Rabbit books, she would always sketch her fictional characters from live models. Ducks appear in several of Beatrix Potter's tales, in particular The Tale of Tom Kitten (1907) and The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck (1908).  She sketched the ducks in Putney, London, when preparing illustrations for The Tale of Tom Kitten in the summer of 1907.  However, it is likely that these studies of a duck's head were drawn at Hill Top; Beatrix Potter produced several studies of ducks and sheep in chalk and charcoal on brown paper.",
