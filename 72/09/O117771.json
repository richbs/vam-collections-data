The back also bears a rough pencil sketch (not reproduced amongst the plates), apparently of a dog followed by a man, and is inscribed by the artist in pencil <i>Dedham August 1st 1831</i>. It is also inscribed in ink with the serial number 21, and in pencil 'Rose' and M.L.C. [Maria Louisa Constable].\n\nConstable had taken his daughters to stay with his family in Suffolk, returning to London on 4 July (P. Leslie, p. 30), and it appears that this drawing was made when he went to fetch them back (Beckett, I, p. 264).\u201d\nR. B.
