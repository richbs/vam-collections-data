On 11 May 1857 soliders from Meerut entered the palace by Lahore gate and destroyed some of the architecture with gunpowder. For a short time after, Lahori gate and Delhi gate were renamed 'Victoria' and 'Alexandra'. Today tourists enter the palace from the main Lahori gate.",

Beato's war photographs of India range from portraits of commanding officers to vast Indian landscapes and derelict forts and palaces.",

Beato is most recognised as a war photographer where his travel from Europe provided the opportunity to record military war in India after the Mutiny of 1857, the opium wars in China in 1860 and Japan in 1862. Beato later died in Burma, ca  1908-1909.",
