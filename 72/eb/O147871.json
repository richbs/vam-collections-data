Hills in the background, a stormy sky, a peasant on a donkey in the foreground. \nInscribed in ink, verso (possibly in the hand of the artist's son, A. H. Palmer): \"Traveling (sic) in the Holy Land, By Samuel Palmer\". \nThe attribution rests upon 'authentication' by (1) Mr Carlos Peacock; and, perhaps more seriously (2) by the Print Room at the Ashmolean Museum, where Mr David Brown subjected it to searching scrutiny, commenting upon various idiosyncrasies of style and dating it perhaps at around 1835 - a period when Palmer had abandoned his earlier, more 'mannered' 'Shoreham' style (in favour of a more 'conventional' style); and when 'Biblical' scenes were becoming fashionable (cf. Finden's Landscape Illustrations of The Bible). While, therefore, it has no pretensions to particular quality, there seems no point in rejecting, any longer the probability that the artist was Samuel Palmer as seems to be the opinion of others more qualified to judge its true 'merits'. The fact that Palmer is not known to have visited Palestine is irrelevant; nor did many others who at that time did (or copied) such scenes.'",

Heathcote-Williams, c.1967-68'. \n\nText taken from label attached to mount: \n'The attribution [to Samuel Palmer] rests upon 'authentication' by (1) Mr Carlos Peacock; and, perhaps more seriously (2) by the Print Room at the Ashmolean Museum, where Mr David Brown subjected it to searching scrutiny, commenting upon various idiosyncrasies of style and dating it perhaps at around 1835 - a period when Palmer had abandoned his earlier, more 'mannered' 'Shoreham' style (in favour of a more 'conventional' style); and when 'Biblical' scenes were becoming fashionable (cf. Finden's Landscape Illustrations of The Bible). While, therefore, it has no pretensions to particular quality, there seems no point in rejecting, any longer the probability that the artist was Samuel Palmer as seems to be the opinion of others more qualified to judge its true 'merits'. The fact that Palmer is not known to have visited Palestine is irrelevant; nor did many others who at that time did (or copied) such scenes.'",
