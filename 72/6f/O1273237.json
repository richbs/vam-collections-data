It shows L\u00e8onide Massine as the Hussar with probably the Street Dancer although the cutting suggests the ruffles are on the exterior rather than under the skirt can-can-style.\n\n\nThe first version of Le Beau Danube by Massine was created for Comte Etienne de Beaumont's Soiree de Paris in May 1924 but it was substantially revised for the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo and first performed at Monte Carlo in Spring 1933  The costumes were designed by Comte Etienne de Beaumont after Constantin Guys. Le Beau Danube was a popular character ballet set in the Prater, Vienna, in which Massine conjured up life in the 1860s almost entirely through dance\n\nShadow puppeteer, Lotte Reiniger (1899-1981) created silhouettes of De Basil\u2019s Ballets Russes for illustrations in periodicals and as souvenirs sold through the book dealer Ifan Kyrle Fletcher..",
