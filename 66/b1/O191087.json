            "public_access_description": "This is one of the campaign posters issued by the CDU (Christian Democratic Union, running for office as part of the Alliance for Germany), for the first and only free parliamentary elections ('Volkskammerwahl') in East Germany (GDR-German Democratic Republic) on 18th March 1990. The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe Alliance for Germany was an opposition coalition formed on 5th February 1990 in then West-Berlin to stand for the 'Volkskammer' (People's Chamber) election. It got the majority of the seats and thus formed the interim-government until reunification, with Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as Minister President.\n\nThe CDU, DSU (German Social Union) and DA (Democratic Awakening) were part of the Alliance. The political aims (reunification of Germany and reconstitution of the federal states) were mainly determined from the West German side of the CDU. The then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared at many election campaign activities for East German CDU.\n\nThe visualization of the political message in this poster already carries elements of western election campaigns. The picture shows a detail of a perfectly renovated fa\u00e7ade with an architectural pediment and the coat of arms of the Saxon city of Leipzig accompanied by the words: 'Leipzig zuliebe', meaning 'for Leipzig's sake'.\n\nMany of the cities in the GDR presented a sad and desperate sight, with grey and desolate houses and the natural environment was in a pitiable condition. This poster depicts a reality which would be achieved by voting for the CDU - this at least is the promise. At a later point Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke of 'prosperous landscapes' in relation to the expected development in the newly-formed German states. Today we know that it will take somewhat longer to realise these ambitions.",
