He has used only red enamel, but still manages to convey all the drama of the battle with a furious duel between two cavalrymen amid billowing gunpowder smoke.  \n\nThe decorator was copying a print from a group produced by the publisher Jeremias Wolff in Augsburg, commemorating the Wars of the Spanish Succession.  The prints show large-scale battles but include many encounters of this kind.  They would no doubt have belonged to the patron who commissioned Preissler to decorate special items for himself or possibly as a gift for an important personage.",
