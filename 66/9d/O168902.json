Designs for Esher Place, Surrey, show plans and exterior elevations of the house, designs for the interiors and plans and elevations for the garden, park and outbuildings, ca. 1730-1735. By the time Henry Pelham purchased Esher Place in 1729 all that remained of the original structure was Waynflete's Tower, built ca. 1475 by Bishop Waynflete as the gatehouse to the Episcopal Palace. When William Kent was commissioned to enlarge the house and redesign the grounds, it seems that Pelham originally considered a classical villa overlooking the Tower in the Park. However this scheme was abandoned in favour of altering and adding to the Tower itself.",
