This particularly elaborate version of a simple and functional piece of furniture formed part of the furnishings, made in about 1760, of Spencer House, London, the town house of the Earls of Spencer. Other inlaid pieces in this style include two bedside cupboards and a wardrobe, which have been at Althorp, Northamptonshire, since about 1920. The London firm of Gordon & Taitt supplied much of the upholstery, but the maker of the inlaid furniture remains unknown.\n\nMaterials and Making\nThis wash table  is made of mahogany. The inlay on the table top consists of boxwood on a ground of padouk (a kind of rose-wood from Burma).\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe table is set on four legs, surmounted with capitals modelled on those placed above the caryatids (sculpted female figures) on the Erechtheum, a temple in Athens which stood to the north of the Parthenon. James Stuart (1713-1788), the table's designer, made use of an illustration from The Antiquities of Athens (London, 1762: pl. XXXVIII), a book he wrote in collaboration with Nicholas Revett (1720-1804), the first detailed survey of ancient Greek architecture written in English.\n\nPeople\nStuart designed this table for the bedchamber of Georgiana, Countess Spencer (died in 1814), at Spencer House, London.  In A Six Weeks Tour through the Southern Counties of England and Wales(1770), Arthur Young referred to Spencer House's 'beds and tables very finely carved and inlaid'.",
