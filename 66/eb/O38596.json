The body of the cradle consists of  a framework of two horizontally parallel ash poles with a third planed into a stretcher, connected by  four curved transverse slats (probably of elmwood).  The headboard and footboard  panels, and the rockers, are all made from offcuts of wood and fastened into the corner posts with wooden pegs; the rockers are also anchored to the stretcher with a simple peg joint at each end.  The corner posts, which are slightly lower on the footboard, have been whittled into a tapering shape with a cubed finial.  Because of its rack-like construction, the cradle could have been hung from the wall when not in use;  inverted, it could also make an improvised seat for children, both points consistent with cottage use.",
