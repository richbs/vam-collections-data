This page illustrates the story of Kume Sennin (Kume, the 'man of the mountains' - or immortal sage).   Kume Sennin lived an ascetic life in the mountains near Kumedera, a Buddhist temple, and had developed the ability to feed on air and to fly through it.  One day when floating through the air he saw a young woman washing her clothes in the river and revealing her bare legs.  Mesemerised by the sight his lustful thoughts destroyed the power which kept him aloft.  It is as a result of this act (which clouds his otherwise pure thoughts) that the sennin fells from grace and lost his supernatural powers.",
