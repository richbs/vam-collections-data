London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Anna Atkins   British   1797-1871\n'Festuca Ovina' (fescue grass; sheep's grass)   1854\nCyanotype (blueprint)\n351 X 248 mm   Mus. no. Ph 380-1981   Purchase</i>\n\nThe cyanotype, or blueprint, process was invented by the astronomer and scientist Sir John Herschel, whose many contributions to the early development of photography included the discovery in 1819 that sodium thiosulphate (or hyposulphite as it was then known) was a solvent for silver salts - a fact which later was to make possible the 'fixing' of photographs to make them permanent - and to this day thiosuphates are still used for this purpose.  In 1842 Sir John found that paper impregnated with iron salts was light sensitive, prussian blue being formed in the paper.  At the time, the cyanotype process was little used, except for printing 'photograms', like this example.  From the 1880s it was used for copying engineering and architectural drawings, for which it was well suited, since it gave best results from an original of high contrast.  In this application, the process continued into recent times, when it was superseded by diazo, and more recently, electrostatic copying.  For some years, especially in the 1890s and 1900s, it was used by amateurs for proofing snapshot negatives, but the low contrast of the process often gave rather muddied results, and the strong blue colour was not suitable for many subjects. \nAnna Atkins was the daughter of the zoologist John George Children F.R.S., who was present at both of the meetings of the Royal Society at which Fox Talbot outlined his new process of 'photogenic drawing' in February 1839.  The family received calotype specimens from Talbot in 1841 and was associated also with Sir John Herschel.  The major practitioner to make use of the cyanotype in the early period was Anna Atkins.  She was a skilled scientific draughtsman (contributing the drawings of shells for her father's translation of Lamarck's <i>Genera of Shells </i>1823) and botanist.  Cyanotype proved to be the ideal method of recording specimens from her extensive herbarium.  Her best-known work, <i>British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions </i>was privately issued in installments beginning in October 1843 and its author wrote in the introduction: 'the difficulty of making accurate drawings of objects as minute as many of the Algae and Conferva, has induced me to avail myself of Sir John Herschel's beautiful process of Cyanotype, to obtain impressions of the plants themselves, which I have much pleasure in offering to my botanical friends'.  The series was completed in 1854.  The present plate is from an album of British and Foreign Flowering Plants and Ferns presented by Anna Atkins to 'A.D.', a member of the family of the pioneer photographer Henry Dixon, in 1854.  The specimen was laid on the sensitised sheet and exposed to sunlight for a few minutes.  This produced a faint image which was brought out to a rich blue and made permanent simply by washing the paper in plain water.\n",
