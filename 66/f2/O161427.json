The Sacred Monogram (\u2018IHS\u2019) is an abbreviation of the Greek spelling of the name \u2018Jesus\u2019. Devotion to the name of Jesus Christ can be traced back to the early centuries of Christianity. It became a widespread popular devotion in the fifteenth century after it was popularised by Saint Bernardino, who died in 1444 and was canonised in 1450. Saint Bernardino was a hugely influential Italian Franciscan friar and preacher. He encouraged the public attending his sermons to adore the name of Christ by holding up a representation of the Sacred Monogram. Within a short period of time, the Sacred Monogram began to appear on painted panels, tapestries, woodwork and on ceramics.\n\nBelow the Sacred Monogram on this dish is a heart. This heart signifies another popular devotion, that of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ. This devotional practice first appeared in the Middle Ages but became widespread in the 17th century after the revelations of Margaret Mary Alacoque, a nun in the French order of the Visitation of Holy Mary. In the 1670s, Margaret Mary experienced revelations in which Christ appeared to her bearing his heart and proclaiming his love of humanity.\n\nThe dish may have been displayed in a domestic room, where it would have served as a reminder of the divine love of Jesus Christ and valued for its decorative qualities",
