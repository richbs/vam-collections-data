Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. She moved to New York during the Second World War and later returned to Paris, where this photograph was taken. Bing's earlier modernist style of stark angles and geometric shapes is still evident, but has been altered by the sense of isolation she felt when living in New York.  'Photography is a youthful art' Bing remarked, 'As I got older, I was at a greater remove which manifested itself at a greater optical remove'. The effect of war and the atom bomb also led to Bing capturing more impersonal, distanced perspectives of the city.\n\nBing had been commissioned to take photographs of the Eiffel Tower for Monde illustr\u00e9 in 1931. Twenty-one years later she returns to the subject, treating it as an abstract frame for her stark and nostalgic cityscape.",
