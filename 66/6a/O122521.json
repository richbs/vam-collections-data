Indigenous Korean clays are dark in colour and rich in iron oxide, which fires to a deep chocolate brown. White slip was added to coat the brown clay and lighten the colour of the pots. When the pot was dry, the slip could be scraped away to reveal a pattern traced into the clay. Humorous and symbolic drawings were sometimes incised through the slip to reveal the clay beneath.  Finally, a simple ash glaze would be applied thinly, giving the pot a pale jade green or soft grey blue tinge.\n\nIn this jar, Yi uses the slip in a spontaneous and fluid way, drawing naive representations of birds through the slip with his fingers. At the same time, the traditional ingredients of Punchong are unchanged: dark clay, white slip, and an ash glaze.",
