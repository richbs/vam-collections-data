Three-quarter female figure standing with head turned to left and left arm flexed, wearing a low necked bodice with v-front set with horizontal rows of pointed frills and short frilled cap sleeves; the crinoline skirt is open at the front revealing horizontal rows of similar frills with a two tier overskirt edged in blue; in each lower front corner of the top skirt is a red circle, white surround and edged in blue.  On the hands are white gloves; around the left wrist is tied a narrow blue ribbon with tails and on the right wrist is a bold gold bracelet with central oval.  The fair hair is dressed in mid-19th century style with an elaborate blue flower headdress fixed to the back, which cascades onto the shoulder.  The skin is flesh tinted.  Around the figure is drawn a pencil frame.  Inscribed: CARNAVAL DE / SHOUMANN / \"Mme Nijinska / PAPILLON  and BAKST.  Pencil and watercolour.",

The ballet took the titles of the Commedia dell'arte characters indicated on Schumann's score and set them in the context of a 19th century ball as a comment upon human relationships.  Papillon, the role created by Bronislava Nijinska, was the social butterfly, pursued by the love-lorn Pierrot, and the frills, fluttering ribbons on the wrist and headdress, combined with the never-ceasing choreography, suggested the vivacity and frivolity of the character.  The whole character of the ballet was of lightning-fast movements, flirtation and coquetry which contrasted with the chaste hooped costumes of the women, which signalled 'don't touch'.",
