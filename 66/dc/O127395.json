His work may be described as Symbolist and has much in common with that of figures such as Odilon Redon and Gustave Dor\u00e9, although Hieronymus Bosch, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Francisco de Goya have also been cited as possible influences. \n\nBrandel\u2019s imagery often includes architecture fantastically interpreted, with exaggerated and highly improbable structures, scale and perspective. Elsewhere he creates similarly disturbing landscapes. These fantasies are frequently inhabited by men, women and animals engaged in strange or ritualistic behaviour, but sometimes the spaces are eerily empty, as in this view of a Polish cemetery, where crosses rise out of a copse isolated amid empty fields.",
