His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nTchaikovsky\u2019s The Queen of Spades (1890) was presented for the first time at the Royal Opera House by the Covent Garden Opera Trust on 21 December 1950.   Messel had worked on the film version a year earlier.  He produced colourful and extravagant sets and costumes which contributed to the eerie and fantastic atmosphere of the opera, about a Countess who has sold her soul to the devil for the secret of winning at cards.\n\nMessel used fabric and layers to make to the Countess, played by Edith Coates, (1908-1983) look old and shrivelled.   Stanley Hall made an extremely large wig to make her head look small, and gave her a large false nose so that the rest of her facial features receded.   He emphasised bones, muscles and sinews with purple shading on her face, neck and bosom.",

Presented by the Covent Garden Opera at the Royal Opera House, London on 21 December, 1950.  It was directed by Michael Benthall and featured Edgar Evans as Herman and Jess Walters as Yeletsky.  It was revived  at the Royal Opera House, London, in 1956.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: This was the first time that <i>The Queen of Spades</i> had been presented at Covent Garden, and the first time since 1915 it had been presented in London.  Messel also designed costumes and sets for a film version of the tale in 1949.",
