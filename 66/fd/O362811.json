Dark green silk forms the main part of the cap, a band going across the head, both sides are steeply angled along their back edge. The front edge is trimmed with a black and white tablet-woven band, a narrow black band with red applique and small embroidered motifs and a fine yellow, black and red applique band. A black silk cord is held in place with white stitches. Dark red silk forms a large zigzag along this panel with small snowflake-like motifs in white, yellow, dark red, light blue or black. Bands of red and black applique and the black and white cord decoraste a seam between this panel and those forming the back of the cap. These have been pieced and some pieces come from a similar panel to that at the front. The very back piece is undecorated green silk twill. There is a globular metal button at one end and two black cotton tapes from the sides.  The cap is lined with two European printed cottons:\n[1] at the front and through which some of the zigzag embroidery has been worked, red ground with red roses, green l;eaves with curving bands filled with red and green ovals and groups of three yellow botehs;\n[2] at the back, pieced, striped cotton.
