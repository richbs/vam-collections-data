It shows a series of scenes from a production of &lt;i&gt;The New Clown &lt;/i&gt;by H.M. Paull, with Mr. James Welch in the title role and Miss Alexander as Maud. The first London performances of the play appear to have been in circa 1901. The following year the production toured to America with a new cast. \n\nThe sketch is not dated, but has been signed by the artist F.V.Poole in the bottom right hand corner. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
