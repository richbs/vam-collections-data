It is a brocaded silk which makes use of polychrome silk and real silver thread to create the pattern on a dark green ground. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was laborious work for the weaver.\n\nThis is probably a French silk because its width conforms to the regulations laid down for the silk weavers of Tours in the late 17th century and subsequently adopted by the guild of silk weavers (Grande Fabrique) in Lyon. Such regulations attempted to control the composition and quality of all products.  \n\nThe style of motif corresponds to the early 1730s when designers were gradually developing more naturalistic motifs which were often combined with fantastical elements. The Lyonnais designer Courtois was credited with attempting to create three-dimensional effects in the 1720s, and in the following decade Jean Revel (1684\u20141751) found a method of dovetailing colours which took these attempts further.",
