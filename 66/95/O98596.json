The enamel panels include the symbols of the saints Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Known as the Evangelists, they were the authors of the Gospels in the New Testament of the Bible. The ivory panel at the centre depicts the paschal lamb associated with the Easter festival. The two figures are of St John the Evangelist and the Virgin Mary.\n  \nRobert Edgar Stone (1903-1990) was an important British silversmith. He made this cross in 1927, the year after he was awarded a scholarship to study at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. He went on to pursue a distinguished career working for major London silversmithing firms.",

Koop, the head of dept. of metalwork, he would report to me on it, although I fear it is very unlikely that we should be able to contemplate its purchase.\n\nYours faithfully,\n(Signed) Eric Maclagan\nDirector & Secretary",

Ashbee, initiated a decisive shift towards fine craftsmanship in church silver. This led to a sharp fall in the standing of commercial manufacturers but provided a steady source of work for many designer-silversmiths that has lasted into the present day. This revival of craftsmanship came out of the Arts and Crafts movement, one of the greatest social and artistic forces of the age. Favouring small studio workshops and simplicity of form, the movement set the pattern for church silver throughout the 20th century, whether for major cathedral commissions or for parish churches.
