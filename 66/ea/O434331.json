The artist has used no perspective, setting all the figures against a flat background. The sky and the ground are represented by several childish lines, these are curvilinear above and straight below.\n\nGeorge Keyt (1901\u20131993) was born in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and educated at Trinity College (Kandy), an elite colonial school in the British public school tradition. From a very early stage, the ancient hill capital and its Buddhist temples came to exercise a powerful and lasting influence on him, providing an artistic stimulus to his work. This interest spurred the young painter to reject the Western cultural values he had been brought up with and to explore Hindu mythology. This drawing, which depicts the mythical scene of  'The Repentant Gopi', reflects such fascination. The myth recounts how the young Krishna, by playing his flute in the forest, calls all the cowgirls (gopis), who all slip away from their husbands. After six months of erotic adventures, the disillusioned cowgirls return home and repent before their husbands.",

            "historical_context_note": "George Keyt (1901\u20131993) was born in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and educated at Trinity College in Kandy, an elite colonial institution modelled after the British schooling system. As child of Indo-Dutch origins, Keyt practiced drawing, developing a keen interest in art history, Indian and Western literature. The ancient hill capital of Malwatte Vihareand with its Buddhist temples came to exercise a powerful and lasting influence on his artistic and literary output. Increasingly, the artist became greatly drawn towards Sri Lankan Buddhist philosophy, leading him to champion the Buddhist revival cause. This interest spurred the young painter to reject the Western cultural values he had been brought up with and explore both Hindu mythology and Indian literary works. \n\nBy studying Buddhist and Hindu philosophies, Keyt developed closer links to the indigenous culture and Indian way of life. Towards the end of his career, the artist assimilated Western elements into his visual vocabulary such as Picasso\u2019s cubism and Henri Matisse\u2019s painterly flatness to paint Hindu mythological figures. During the 1930s, the artist met the Indian polymath Rabindranath Tagore in Ceylon. This meeting left a lasting impression on the artist who renewed his commitment to revitalize Indian art and culture. \n\nKeyt is also considered to be one of the most influential Sri Lankan poets. His most notable literary contribution was the translation of the Gita Govinda into English and Sinhalese. Moreover the artist illustrated both works with elegant drawings. Keyt has been exhibited internationally. His work can be found in various museums and galleries abroad, as well as in private collections around the world.",
