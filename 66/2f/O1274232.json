The print, entitled The Oil Ship (a reference to J.M.W.Turner\u2019s The Slave Ship now in Boston Museum), depicts a pastiche of a newspaper seller's notice for the Evening Standard with the headline: \u201cPainting of Deepwater Horizon Explosion Wins Turner Prize.\u201d Atkinson has over many years utilised the medium of oil and acrylic to parody newspapers throughout the world from Pravda to the New York Times and The Village Voice and The Guardian. The V&A has several of his prints parodying newspaper front pages.\n \nConrad Atkinson said: \u201cI admire the Tate, with which Sir Nicholas Serota has done much to reassert the importance of contemporary art. He has been a colleague of mine over many years and we have shared the same interests. The Tate has three of my large, major works and its curators rarely put a foot wrong artistically. I understand the financial pressures on the Tate but I wanted to make this work The Oil Ship to reinforce the concerns of many in the art world of the dangers of becoming the butlers and handmaidens of multinational corporations. The last work of mine acquired by the Tate was \u201cASBESTOS: the Lungs of Capitalism\u201d - the asbestos industry would clearly not have supported its purchase or display.\u201d",
