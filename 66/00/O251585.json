Her work has kept pace with current investigations of location, identity and cross cultural understandings, and involves an innovative and sustained engagement with traditional jewellery and metalwork techniques.\n\nBlyfield's work has rich intellectual layers and explores many aspects of Australian flora as well as aspects of Australian history, including encounters with Aboriginal culture, the early settlement of the city of Adelaide and migration.  She also incorporates metalwork traditions for all over the world that she has learnt through various mentors, through independent study and experimentation and investigations in European museum collections.\n\nThe jewellery and objects Julie Blyfield has produced over the last twenty years are absolutely contemporary and fresh, while carrying resonant echoes from the past.  Through its sensitive making, her work strongly asserts the importance of respect for time, place and belonging, combined with a finely tuned mixture of restraint and playfulness.\n\nJulie Blyfield is widely respected maker, not only throughout Australia but increasingly across Europe as well.",
