The lobed form added strength and could easily be press-moulded. Instead of separate curved legs, however, a practical flanged base was used. By the late 18th century the Neo-classical boat-shaped or squat, round, urn-shaped tureen, modelled on Sheffield plate, had become more or less standardised, often with crisply enamelled borders. Nevertheless, a demand for the old Rococo curves remained, particularly in the growing creamware export market from the Staffordshire and Yorkshire factories to The Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Russia.",
