He marks the sum of the cards, which remain face-up; this is his score, which should be as low as possible.\nNow it is the turn of the next player and so on.\nAfter each turn of all players, the first player plays again in the same way and adds his score with the previous one; the game finishes, when one player surpasses the total score of 45.
