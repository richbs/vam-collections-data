The small holes punched around its edge suggest that it was attached to something, possibly to headwear, a sword or to a state stool. The strip appears to have been broken off; damage which may have occurred on its removal.\n\nFollowing Asante efforts to protect a coastal trading outlet, British forces invaded the state capital Kumasi on 4 February 1874. The Asantehene, Kofi Karikari, fled leaving behind much precious regalia which was captured and later sold at auction at Garrard\u2019s, the London crown jewellers. The Museum\u2019s accession registers record the purchase of this and twelve other items of Asante gold and silverware from Garrard\u2019s on 5 June 1874.",

Following Major-General Sir Garnet Wolseley's invasion of Kumasi (capital of the then independent state of Asante, Ghana) on 4 February 1874, the palace of the Asantehene was ransacked and the Asante forced to pay a war indemnity of 50,000 ounces of gold. On return to the UK, some of this gold was auctioned by Garrard's, the London's Crown jewellers, which is almost certainly how the V&A acquired these pieces. Records of the auction were lost during the Second World War.",
