            "public_access_description": "Before the advent of central heating, warmth was provided by open fires, braziers or solid-fuel stoves in the main living rooms of a house. To maintain a fire all day demands a certain level of skill - knowing when to add more fuel, when to poke the fire and when to leave it alone - and a range of specialist tools. Bellows like these were designed to add oxygen to a smouldering fire, encouraging it to burn more fiercely.\n\nThe decoration on these bellows suggests that they formed part of the fittings of a fashionable 'Chinese'-style interior. The scene, depicting two men in loose robes and long moustaches holding a parasol and a cymbal, probably derives from prints imported from China. Artists selected elements from a variety of design sources resulting in 'chinoiserie', a hybrid style influenced by, but not reproducing, works of art from East Asia. The rather disjointed composition of this scene, incorporating outsized vases of flowers and a disembodied building, reflects this pick-and-mix approach.\n\nThe straw marquetry technique used on these bellows was popular in France between about 1780 and 1830.  The straw was split and flattened, then glued into place on thin paper on which the design had been drawn. This was then glued to a wooden carcase, which was usually covered first with a thicker paper. The maker could divide the straw into two, four or more strips, depending on the fineness needed for the design. Colour could be added to the surface with various varnishes, which also enhanced the glossy appearance of the marquetry. Straw marquetry was most suitable for small objects like these bellows but occasionally larger pieces of furniture were decorated in this way. Because straw work is very fragile, it is rare for pieces to survive in good condition.",
