Beyond that, however, it owes little to precedent, whether in form or ornament. It springs from nature. Texture and contrast are key features. The angular handle, which abstracts a thorned branch, meets a delicately pierced and intricately engraved blade. The finely delineated thorned twiglets and the gilt leaves of the bramble, with their realistic veins, set off the high polish and from of the handle. The decorative nature of the blade recalls the sensitivity of the Arts and Crafts Movement to natural form and stylisation.",
