Most of the photographs in it are printed on platinum paper, which was introduced in 1879. Such a photograph was expensive to produce and enjoyed for its delicate tonal gradations and matt surface.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis family photograph album contains single and group portraits and depictions of sports and pastimes that would have amused family, friends and visitors. It is a personal keepsake and document of a wealthy family of the 1890s. Many Victorian and Edwardian family photograph albums such as these were acquired by the V&A in the 1950s and 60s to show examples of the dress of that period.\n\n",
