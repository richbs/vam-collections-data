Actor-manager John Rich moved from his theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields which he had been regularly selling out with his pantomime performances. He had lately had an even greater triumph with a musical play, The Beggar's Opera by John Gay.\n\nThe scene shows a carriage arriving in Covent Garden, with a procession moving towards the newly opened Theatre Royal. In the carriage is John Rich, dressed as the performing dog that appeared in his version of Perseus and Andromeda. Rich was famous for playing the character of Harlequin in his productions, which combined classical subjects with pantomime to popular effect. Hogarth\u2019s low opinion of the quality of Rich\u2019s shows is indicated in this depiction of him as a dalmatian. John Gay follows, carried by a porter, while the crowd shouts 'Rich for ever'. The poem below the print criticises other followers in the parade, actors from the 18th century popular stage including James Quin.",
