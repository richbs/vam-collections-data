In this instance, Derges placed a sheet of photographic paper onto a metal surface with a quantity of Carborundum powder on the top of the paper.  The metal plate was vibrated with a sound frequency and the sand reacted to the vibrations by settling into the shape that you can see in the light areas of the print.  Once the photographic paper had been exposed with a flash light, the powder was removed and the print developed to reveal the incredible and unpredictable pattern that the powder and vibrations had created.",
