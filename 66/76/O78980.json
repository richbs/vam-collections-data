They were inferior in status to the chair, and courtiers or senior officials would have avoided sitting on them. Those who did would have used cushions where possible for greater comfort.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe seat of the bench is made of a long piece of oak, probably cut by two sawyers, one standing above the log and the other below, in a pit. The grooves along the edges would have been made with  a gouge or a scraper. The legs are partly turned and their tops form square tenons, which slot into mortises on the underside of the bench. The long stretcher and frieze below the seat were probably added between about 1890 and 1910.\n\nTime \nBy about 1600, English furniture was often decorated with classical features derived from engravings by continental designers such as Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527-?1606) and Sebastiano Serlio (1475-1554). Centuries later, in the years leading up to the First World War, dealers and collectors often had their own ideas as to what this sort of furniture should look like. Sometimes new elements were added, in a style that was considered authentic, to  make the object more saleable.",
