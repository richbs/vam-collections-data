More generally, although Japanese images were popular, the genuine artefact or image was often misinterpreted or adopted at several removes from the original. The design of this transfer-printed pattern includes an owl, a bird not immediately associated with Japan.  However, the asymmetrical arrangement was generally recognised as in Japanese taste.  The design name, as marked in the reverse of the plate, is 'Andalusia'.  The irrelevance of name to pattern was  common in Victorian ceramics; indeed, relevance was extremely uncommon.\n\nPeople\nBrown-Westhead, Moore & Co. operated at the Cauldon Place works, Hanley, establised in about 1802 by Job Ridgway. By the 1870s the company was one of the largest in the area,  with over 1000 employees.  It made a wide variety of table and toilet wares in earthenware and porcelain, and ornamental Parian, eggshell porcelain and majolica wares, and it supplied both the British and Russian Royal families.",
