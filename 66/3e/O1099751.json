Phillips was a wealthy man and was buried within St Paul's, Covent Garden, 16 September 1713, his wife having evidently predeceased him. Probably for that reason, he left everything to his brother Samuel, who had lived with him 'for many years'. Samuel was independently wealthy, a mercer, and a widower when he died towards the end of January 1721/2. The combined fortunes of the brothers descended therefore to Samuel's daughters Temperance, Margaret, Anne and Martha. Neither wife - William's nor Samuel's - was mentioned in the wills, and no marriage records have come to light. Mrs Pru Phillips could therefore have been the wife of either brother, but was perhaps marginally more likely to have been the wife of William, since Samuel would probably have already been a widower when he became a neighbour of the Rosses. In addition, the date of the miniature is significantly close to the date at which William arrived in Henrietta Street.
