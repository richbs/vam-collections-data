They were not always the plain gold bands which have now become standard, and various different shapes survived, particularly with traditional dress, up to the early 20th century.  Their use varied from place to place.  In many regions the betrothal was a more important and binding ceremony than the wedding itself, and the betrothal ring was a clear record of this, particularly in Germany.  \n\nThis ring was described as Scandinavian when it was given to the Museum in 1904, but it is more likely to come from the north coast region of Frisia, on the border between the Netherlands and Germany.",
