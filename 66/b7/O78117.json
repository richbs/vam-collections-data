He published translations from Horace and Ovid, and throughout his life wrote poems and essays. Prior was a collector of paintings and prints.\n\nPeople\nKneller was born in L\u00fcbeck, Germany. He studied mathematics and military fortification at Leyden University about 1662, and was then apprenticed in Amsterdam to the painters Ferdinand Bol and Rembrandt. He travelled to Italy, particularly Rome and Venice. He settled in England in 1676, and by 1678 had secured royal patronage. Kneller was appointed in 1688 as Principal Painter to William III and was knighted in 1692. Kneller became a leading fashionable portrait painter. He inherited the leading and fashionable position of Lely as a prolific exponent of the baroque portrait in England.  His famous series of 36 by 28 inch half-length portraits (Kit-cat portraits), named after the Kit-cat Club, whose members were the sitters, decisively influenced the course of 18th-century English portraiture.  He was also renowned for the series of portraits of ladies at the royal court, the Hampton Court 'Beauties' 1690-1691.",
