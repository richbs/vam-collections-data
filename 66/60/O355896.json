            "public_access_description": "This hat was said to have been worn 'for many years' by a Welsh cottager in the village of Llechryd, Ceredigion. Its date of manufacture is not known, though the style is typical of the middle years of the nineteenth-century. The velvet band, richly-decorated with its floral stem pattern, is actually quite reminiscent of the style of the burgeoning Arts and Crafts movement, which began in the 1860s. It is similar in form to the hat worn by Isembard Kingdom Brunel in Robert Howlett's famous 1857 portrait, though the eminent engineer's lacked a decorative band.\n\nThe alleged creation of this hat in Paris is appropriate, since the first known depiction of what we know as a top hat was French. The 1796 painting by Charles Vernet, Un Incroyable, depicts a dandy holding an item of black headgear with a high spreading crown and wide curling brim; in other words a recognisable top hat. The top hat, with a few stylistic alterations, remained the dominant form of headwear for the next hundred years.\n\nTop hats were the symbol of the emergent middle-class in industrial Victorian Britain. The questionable use of a relatively large amount of rich  material on such an uncomfortable style of hat was expressive of an attitude to expressive luxury long-adopted by the aristocracy, whom the new industrialists longed to rub shoulders with.",
