E.350-352, E.353-356-1989), acquired by the Department of Prints, Drawings and Paintings (now Word & Image) to strengthen the holdings of 20th century commercial graphics and for display in 'The Art of Selling Songs: 1690-1990' a display focusing on graphic design in the music business, held in the museum in 1990. 23 Envelope  were one of the most admired graphic design companies working in  the 1980s. The record publishers 4AD employed them almost exclusively throughout the 1980s. \n\nThe founder of  4AD, Ivo Watts-Russell, devised the concept of  This Mortal Coil, a title under which musicians who were signed to 4AD and some who were not,  recorded together in various permutations, giving those who took part greater creative freedom  than they would have working more conventionally within their own band  The idea led to innovative cover versions of Ivo's own songs.",
