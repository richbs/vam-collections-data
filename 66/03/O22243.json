In Korea, the tiger is considered the most powerful of evil-repelling animals, while magpies are traditionally viewed as the bearers of good news. This subject matter was thus not only visually appealing, but was also thought to provide protection and attract good fortune for the forthcoming year.\n\nThe humour of this particular painting is characteristic of the genre. Two magpies chatter to each other on the bough of a pine tree. A tiger, frustrated by their noise but powerless to stop it, glares up at them from below.",
