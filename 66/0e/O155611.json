These colours and the two threads of metal thread frame the complete corner units.  From remaining sides a globular, long necked vase worked alternately in white or metal thread pulled thread, bearing 3 flowering stems in yellow or white with red centres in straight stitch, point inwards to the small central octagonal on a metal thread pulled work, edged with coral red and green. Small floral motifs in straight stitch in red or white with green stems and leaves decorated the remaining space.\nThis central area is then framed with a wide composite border of:\n[a] a needlewoven narrow zigzag band\n[b] a row of 8-pointed stars/flowerheads in straight stitch with a straight stitch coloured flower stem in each corner\n[c] as [a]\n[d] a wide band of pulled thread hexagons with the remaining triangular spaces decorated with a floral stem in red, green and yellow.\n[e] as [a]\n[f] as [b] with the coloured flower stem in each corner\n[g] as [a].\nA line of faded coral red stem stitch and 2 threads of metal thread finishes the border.\nThe three raw edges are rolled and secured with buttonhole stitch.\n\nLinen [?] thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white, light green, yellow, faded coral red silk; 2S\nMetal Thread: silver strip close S-wound on white silk core.",
