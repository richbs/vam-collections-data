A leading member (along with Graham Sutherland) of the generation of etchers trained at Goldsmith's College and influenced by F.L.M Griggs, his most highly regarded early works included landscapes informed by the spirit of Samuel Palmer's Shoreham period and intensely characterised portrait studies. In later years Drury continued to explore the themes of mystic or symbolic landscape in a more contemporary style and made occasional portraits.\n\nThis print, 'Head of Negro', made in 1925 was submitted as Drury's Diploma Work for election to the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers.",
