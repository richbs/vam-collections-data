One may see something of Art Nouveau in the disposition of the tail of this amazing creature, but it is a resemblance forced at least in part by the craftsman\u2019s necessity to fashion a handle from the body of an animal. The piece it self mirrors Elson\u2019s innate artistry and aesthetically original turn of mind, which finds no obvious precedence in stylistic history. The deep black surface, with its striking contrast to the polished parts, presents a beautiful surface property of silver that has rarely, if ever, been exploited so successfully before. This rich black creature seems to slither across the table; it has a life of its own.",
