Toadstones were especially popular in the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods.\nA 'toadstone' is actually the fossilised tooth of a fish called 'Lepidotes'. Also known as 'crapaudine' or 'crappot' it is a brown or orangeish substance believed to come from a toad's head. It was highly valued and reputed to protect the wearer against kidney diseases, to cure the bite of venomous creatures and to detect poison. It was also thought to protect pregnant women from fairies and demons and to prevent their child being exchanged for a changeling. When set in a ring it would give off heat in the presence of a poison. This was described by Fenton in 1569 \"Being used in rings they give forewarning of venom\". The use of toadstones is well attested in literature.",
