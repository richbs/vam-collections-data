Designed by Colen Campbell in the Palladian style, Pembroke had it refurbished in the late 1750s. While most of the exterior refurbishment was by another architect, Chambers contributed to the interiors, including the Saloon and a number of other rooms. Pembroke House was demolished in the 1930s. The Saloon and three other rooms are preserved in the Ministry of Defence offices built on the site. \n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",

Designed by Colen Campbell in the Palladian style, Pembroke had it refurbished in the late 1750s. While most of the exterior refurbishment was by another architect, Chambers contributed to the interiors, including the Saloon and a number of other rooms. Pembroke House was demolished in the 1930s. The Saloon and three other rooms are preserved in the Ministry of Defence offices built on the site.",
