Arai is an acknowledged leader in the field of experimental weaving technology, combining traditional and futuristic, often with unexpected qualities. He worked closely with the fashion designer Issey Miyake in the 1980s. \n\nThis piece is a multi-textured monochrome patchwork quilt, in which threads of different weights and tensions create a pucker and warp effect. It is a successful combination of synthetic and natural materials, with elasticity and soft textures. The fabric is a simple plain weave with a variation in the individual squares deriving from the subtly different personalities of the yarns used.",
