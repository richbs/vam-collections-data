Harold married Phoebe McCleish in 1906. She was from an artistic family and already a noted ceramic figure modeller by the time of their marriage. They set up a business partnership and worked together on many projects. The business became one of the most important design partnerships of the early and mid twentieth century. In 1915 - inspired by a visit to the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition in Cologne the previous year - he founded with Ambrose Heal, C H St John Hornby, (of W H Smith &amp; Son), Ernest Jackson, W.B.Dalton (head of the Camberwell School of Arts) and others including Frank Pick (of London Transport), the Design and Industries Association (DIA), which had the vision to foster public awareness of excellence in design. Their aim was 'to improve the quality and fitness of goods on sale to the general public' and their slogan was 'fitness for use'.",
