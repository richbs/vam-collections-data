One of the birds is clearly discernible but the other one is obscured by encrustations on the stone.  Each spiral measures a regular 5cm, and the space between each group is evenly laid out - an indication that the pattern was very carefully executed.  No ridge in the hole.\nAn important piece for its size and pattern.  It is slightly larger than the bi in the Freer Gallery with similar pattern (nr.17.79) which measures 31.8cm.  The pattern is found along the slightly concave outer rims, made up of short, repeated incised lines.",
