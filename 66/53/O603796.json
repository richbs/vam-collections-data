            "bibliography": "The abbey was established in 1150 by white-clad Premonstratensian canons from Alnwick Priory in Northumberland. They were invited by Hugh de Moreville to settle in this idyllic spot in wooded seclusion beside the River Tweed in Scotland. Dryburgh Abbey never quite aspired to the heights of wealth and influence achieved by its neighbours at Kelso, Jedburgh and Melrose, and on the whole the monastic life here was lived out quietly. However, war did occasionally visit the secluded spot, most famously in 1322, when Edward II\u2019s retreating army, on hearing the abbey\u2019s bells ringing in the distance, approached and set fire to the place. The Protestant Reformation effectively ended Dryburgh Abbey\u2019s days, and by 1584 just two brethren remained alive. In the 18th century, the ivy-clad ruin attracted the attention of David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan. The chief founder of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1780, Buchan purchased Dryburgh House and set about creating a charming landscape, in which the ancient abbey figured prominently. When he died in 1829, he was laid to rest in its sacristy. Three years later, on 26 September 1832, Buchan\u2019s close friend, Sir Walter Scott, antiquarian and novelist, was buried in the north transept (which he called \u2018St Mary\u2019s Aisle\u2019). A third great Scot, Field-Marshal Earl Haig, was interred beside Scott in 1928.",
