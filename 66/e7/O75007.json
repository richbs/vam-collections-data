            "public_access_description": "This miniature painting is one of a group of 17th-century unfinished miniatures on tablets of vellum originally interleaved into the blank pages of a leather-bound book traditionally called \u2018Samuel Cooper's Pocket Book\u2019. This book was acquired by the V&A in 1892, when all the works were believed to be by Samuel Cooper. It is now agreed that four are by Cooper and the other ten, except one, are by Susannah Penelope Rosse. These are self-portraits and portraits of family and neighbours. Like most artists, Cooper left a number of unfinished miniatures in his studio when he died. These were eagerly sought after by art collectors such as King Charles II and the Florentine Cosimo III, who admired the direct, graphic quality of these works by such an internationally renowned artist. It is possible that this \u2018Pocket Book\u2019 actually belonged to Susannah Rosse and her husband, Michael Rosse, a wealthy jeweller. Susannah Rosse was the daughter of Cooper's fellow miniaturist, Richard Gibson, and she grew up in London only a few streets from Cooper\u2019s house. She admired Cooper's work, and the sale of Michael Rosse's collection of art in 1723, over 20 years after Susannah's death, included original works by Cooper and also acknowledged copies of Cooper by Mrs Rosse. Examples such as this, one of Cooper's unfinished works, would have allowed Susannah Rosse to study closely Cooper's technique.",

No. 88 [South Kensington 1862, no. 2531 (the set as Cooper); BFAC 1889, p. 133, case XLI, nos 1-15 (Cooper);  V&amp;A 1983, unnumbered]; and by itself, New Haven etc. 1981-2, no. 48. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> As for Cat.

The Cooper image of Catherine, one of the 'Windsor sketches', is held to dispose of this conclusively as a likeness. \n\nThe sitter nevertheless wears the Braganza curls, and the date is therefore after Catherine's arrival in England, 13 May 1662, and probably before 1665. If not Catherine herself, the sitter is likely to have been one of the household.\u201d\n",
