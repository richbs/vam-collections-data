The eyes are orange and black glass. The nose is stitched with gold coloured thread with a black thread outline down the sides that continues to form the mouth. The mouth is further defined by dark stitches underneath. There are small dark spots on the mohair cloth around the mouth and eyes giving this lion its juvenile appearance. There are gut whiskers pierced through the snout. Each of the four feet has three claws stitched in black thread. There are no paw pads. There is an internal voicebox that no longer works. There is a small metal button and the remains of a label in the left ear.",
