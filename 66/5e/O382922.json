In his journal, he gave a detailed description of an Icelandic lady's wedding dress, 'one of the richest in the island [which he] had the good fortune to bring safe to England'. The V&A Museum bought an Icelandic wedding dress on 18 March 1869 from a 'Dr. Hooker'. Although not identified further, Dr Hooker most likely was Joseph D. Hooker, the distinguished naturalist and eldest son of William Hooker.  The 'Hooker' costume, which consists of several separate garments, is in the general style of Icelandic festive costumes from the late 18th century.  It is, however, extremely rich in decoration as well as in silver jewellery.  It is the oldest known more or less complete Icelandic woman's costume in existence.\n\nThis headband was given to the museum by the same Dr Hooker in 1872, and can probably be identified with an ornate fillet, koffur, of gilt silver worn with the head-dress, described by Hooker as worked with filigree and carrying the initials of the wearer in front surmounted by a crown set with stones.  If so, it may have formed part of the costume worn by Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir at her wedding in 1761.",
