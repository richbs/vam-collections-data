During the Second World War, Medlam was married in her ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Services) uniform. She made her own trousseau of undergarments and night dresses. As a knowledgeable needlewoman, Medlam designed knitted lace and sold the items she made through Selfridges in the years following the war. She also sold patterns to the thread manufacturers J&P Coates as well as to numerous women's magazines. Medlam's archive of working designs for knitted lace were acquired by the Glasgow School of Art.",
