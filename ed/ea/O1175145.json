It shows a full length image of a woman in a costume loosely inspired by Russian 'folk dress'. She is dressed in a sleeveless dull gold dress decorated with spiralling motifs in a darker gold, a vertical central panel of black motifs and with a band of black fur about the hem. Over this she wears a sleeveless black bodice lined with green and with a stiff skirt that flares out around her hips. She holds a gold chain with two large black tassels at either end in her white gloved hands. On her head she wears a tall, triangular shaped, upstanding hat, trimmed with tassels at its base and decorated with alternating bands of gold, black, and white patterned with narrow gold spirals. The design is signed Comelli and dated 1921. \n\nThe borders of design are bound in a transparent gauze which is pinned in place. A scrap of gold and black lame is pinned to this gauze (at the front of the design) with a further strip of velour bound below. A hand drawn chart detailing the measurements of the actress for whom the costume was intended is pinned to the rear. Also bound beneath the gauze at the rear of the design is a folded scrap of ruled paper on which a detail of the folds in the skirt has been drawn in pencil.",

The story follows Sybil, a singer from Paris, who arrives in Russia and meets an officer, Petrov who falls in love with her. There follows a case of mistaken identity in which Sybil is thought to be the wife of the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke goes along with this deception and his wife pretends to be Sybil. The Grand Duchess then becomes attracted to Petrov and the Grand Duke tries to attack him. After much confusion everyone's true identity is revealed and the play ends happily.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s.
