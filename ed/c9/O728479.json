            "public_access_description": "This woodcut comes from a series of fifteen by Albrecht D\u00fcrer illustrating the Apocalypse of Saint John and published in 1498. The four riders illustrate the opening of the first four seals, signalling the end of humankind by Conquest, Discord, Famine and Death. D\u00fcrer has added dramatic energy to traditionally static representations of the opening of the first four seals, which are usually shown separately. \n\nHere, the blockcutter\u2019s extraordinary skill has produced an illusion of depth using line alone. Horizontal parallel lines create a dramatic dark backdrop against which the foreground figures stand out. The energy of the scene comes from the delicate curling lines defining much of the detail in the foreground figures and clouds.\n\nIt was usual for artists like D\u00fcrer to employ specialist blockcutters to cut blocks to their designs. D\u00fcrer would have drawn the image onto the block for the blockcutters to follow. These woodcuts outstrip the quality of other woodcuts of the time, leading to suggestions that D\u00fcrer may have cut the blocks himself but D\u00fcrer's training as a goldsmith and painter would have taught him engraving and design skills, not woodcutting. As he published the book himself, he is likely to have supervised the cutting, ensuring that they were close to his intentions. \n\nThis page is from a book version published in 1498 in German. D\u00fcrer controlled all aspects of publication, borrowing the font for the text from his godfather, publisher Anton Koberger. He also issued a Latin edition for the international market. A reissue in 1511 was set to Latin verses with two other large woodcut series, the Life of the Virgin and the Large Passion. The images were also sold separately without text.",

Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.\n 5 When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, \"Come!\" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.  6 Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, \"A quart of wheat for a day's wages, and three quarts of barley for a day's wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!\"\n 7 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, \"Come!\"  8 I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.\"",
