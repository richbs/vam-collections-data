The back of the drawing itself bears no such inscription, but the outline of the drawing on the front has been traced over on the back in pencil and slightly elaborated.  This tracing was made by the artist to facilitate the use of the drawing in painting \u2018The Valley Farm\u2019; the seated figure of the countrywoman in the boat in the exhibited version is based upon it (that is, in reverse to the position on the <i>recto</i>), but is given older features.  \nThe title on the back, \u2018Suffolk Child\u2019, was perhaps the name by which the drawing was known to Constable\u2019s family.\u201d",
