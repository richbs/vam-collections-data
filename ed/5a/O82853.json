She was obviously concerned to capture a cross-section of the Russian population by representing as many different social and architectural types as possible. Little is known about the photographer herself; but it is likely that she was a highly educated daughter of a consul-general in Odessa, able to pursue photography as a hobby. She also wrote about Russian peasant crafts and artwork and published several books about Western painters.",
