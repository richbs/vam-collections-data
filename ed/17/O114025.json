            "public_access_description": "The wallpaper company Sanderson & Sons was founded in 1860. The company began as an importer of French wallpapers, and in due course began to distribute English wallpapers too. It did not begin to manufacture its own papers until Arthur Sanderson acquired premises for printing in Chiswick, West London, in 1879. This wallpaper border comes from a log book containing 53 specimens of wallpaper borders and corners, and probably represents the products of various companies for which Sanderson & Sons were then acting as agents.\n\nThis border is typical of the richly-coloured and elaborate designs, popular in the mid-19th century, which were pastiches of historical styles; this pattern combines classical motifs with the gilding and  trompe l'oeil moulding characteristic of the Victorian interpretations of Renaissance decoration.",
