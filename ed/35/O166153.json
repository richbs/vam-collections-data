Traditionally, they would have turned to base metals, such as bronze, iron and steel. Now, with the continuous search for the 'new', they sought out a wider repertoire of metals and also innovative techniques to create colour through patina. Silver was oxidised, aluminium anodised and painted. \n\nIn the space industry experiments with new materials led to the development of metals such as titanium and niobium. Their iridescent colours, achieved through heat or electrical currents, soon attracted the attention of jewellery designers.\n\nIvy Ross was trained at the Syracuse University, School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York. She has shown in her jewellery the versatility of non-precious materials, such as Colorcore, Formica and Titanium. The style is often graphic or  achieves a textile quality, as with this brooch. Some pieces are even designed alongside an item of clothing.",
