The sprig is composed of berries and foliage in two different qualities of gilded silver thread (flat - <i>lame</i>, and wound round a beige-coloured silk core - <i>fil\u00e9</i>). the edge is wavy, not quite scalloped. The pattern displays a very economical use of metal, there being very little floating across the reverse side. XRF analysis confirms the metal thread is predominantly silver, with small amounts of copper and gold.",

Diderot\u2019s Encyclopaedia in 1772 described these uses succinctly in its definition of ribbon: \u2018a flat, narrow and thin fabric, used to tie, edge or ornament, for garments as well as furnishings\u2019. Ribbons were subject to changes in fashion, just as wide silks were. \n\nRibbons could be bought at fairs, from travelling pedlars or from the high class retailers of major cities such as Paris (e.g. the marchands merciers of the Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 which is still the city's  luxury quarter today). These retailers stocked large quantities of ribbons of all sorts - from the simplest to the most elaborate - to sell to their customers, French ribbons being complemented by Dutch, Flemish, German and Swiss goods.",

It will form a most excellent sequel to the early textiles obtained from Dr Bock' (Art referee report, 47257, 8 December 1870).",

Saint-Chamond and Saint-Etienne in the St\u00e9phanois, some 40-50 kilometres south of Lyon, gradually became the main centres of the production of the most fashionable and complex silk ribbons, such as this. \n\nIn France, ribbons were generally between 3 and 22 cm wide, guild regulations stipulating they had to be less than 40cm in width, in other words at least 10cm narrower than a dress silk. The engine loom (m\u00e9tier \u00e0 la barre), first used in 1604 in Leiden, was only adopted in France from 1736 and officially promoted by the French government from 1769.  It allowed the production of eight or more ribbons at the same time on the same loom, but was only suited to the weaving of simpler ribbons initially. It began to be used in Saint-Chamond and Saint-Etienne from 1750.",
