The one shown here, in blue damask, appears to be a section of a garment showing presumably a side seam with a gore insertion.\n\nThe pattern of the silk consist of a palmette or lotus design with the stylized Chinese character shou, meaning 'longevity'. However, the pattern might have been misunderstood by the tailor as it is utilised 'upside-down' as well as in correct reading orientation. This might suggest that at least the tailoring was done in a context where the reading of Chinese characters was irrelevant.\n\nHowever, patterned silk was a luxiorus commodity and every spare inch would have been utilised, as can be seen in the gore where two small pieces been stitched together with no apparent consideration to the motifs.",
