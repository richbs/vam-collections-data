It is made by an unknown artist in the middle of the 16th century.\n\nSatyrs are the spirits living in woods and hills and are bestial in their behaviour and desires. They have features of animals, either of the horse or the goat. Satyrs are usually young and have Pan's goat details (in contrast to the rather old Sileni with horse ears). They were the attendants of Bacchus. They were lazy and lecherous and spent their time drinking and chasing nymphs. In medieval and Rennaissance allegory they represent the evil or rather \u2018Lust\u2019 and may be labelled \u2018Luxuria\u2019 or \u2018Libido\u2019.",
