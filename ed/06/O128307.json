Apprenticed to a bookbinder, then worked as a portrait and miniature painter, encouraged by George Clint ARA, whom he met 1834. Joined the Clipstone Street Society 1839. Exhibited 45 works, mostly portraits, at the RA between 1834 and 1872, three at the BI 1846-49, and 154 at the SBA 1837-79, of which he was elected Member in 1842. Best known for his poetic and rustic subjects, and particularly his 'fancy' portraits based on the style of Sir Thomas Lawrence. Submitted paintings to the RA from Edinburgh in 1843 and 1845, and apparently visited Denmark around 1845. Died Lewisham, London, 10 January 1879. His studio sale was at Christie's 15 March 1879.
