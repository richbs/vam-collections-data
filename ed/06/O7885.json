The lively design with imagery from nature is typical  of the Rococo style in Britain in the 1760s.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWe do not know for sure who designed or made this stand, but it is very similar to a published design by the carver Thomas Johnson. Dolphins were a popular feature at the time.  Johnson might have based his design on an engraving of a candlestand by Fran\u00e7ois Cuvilli\u00e9s (1695-1768), the Flanders-born designer who for many years worked for the Bavarian Court in Munich. Thomas Chippendale later used a similar design in the third edition of his book The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director of 1762.\n\nPlace\nGeorge, 1st Baron Lyttelton (1709-1793) bought the candlestands for Hagley Hall, Worcestershire, his country house built between 1754 and 1760.  The stand was one of a set of four which stood either side of pier tables in the gallery, a long room with windows overlooking the park.  The other furniture in that room - the girandoles, or wall-lights, and the mirror- and picture-frames - were also carved with rustic and natural imagery.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe stand is made of carved pine, painted to match the frames in the room in mahogany brown and a contrasting grey-white.  The branches are iron, with candlestick nozzles of gilt brass.",

            "history_note": "Made after a design by Thomas Johnson (born in London, 1714, died there in about 1778). The candlestand was commissioned by George, 1st Lord Lyttelton (1709-73) for Hagley Hall, Worcestershire, his Palladian mansion built between 1754 and 1760. Hagley Hall's severely restrained Palladian exterior bore little relation to the interiors which were decorated with Rococo plasterwork and fashionably furnished in a variety of styles. The Gallery was supplied with candlestands, girandoles and pier glasses elaborately carved with rustic and natural imagery. This candlestand is one of a set of four supplied to flank the pier tables in the gallery. They remained at Hagley until 1950 when the candlestands and girandoles were sold at Sotheby's to pay for death duties. One candlestand was bought by Temple Newsam House, Leeds; the other two were bought by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, USA, together with the girandoles.\n\nHistorical significance: With the lightness and delicacy of its outline, its asymmetry and naturalistic motifs, the stand represents the Rococo style of the mid 18th century at its most exuberant. \nThe overall form of the stand relates so clsoely to a design by Thomas Johnson (plate 13 in a book of designs without a title page, 1758, V&A Museum No. E.3731-1903) that it can be safely attributed to his workshop at 'The Golden Boy', in Grafton Street, Soho, London.\n\nJohnson drew freely on the work of other designers for his motifs: the dolphins may derive from an engraving of a candlestand by Fran\u00e7ois Cuvilli\u00e9s (1695-1768). In turn, Thomas Chippendale appears to have adapted Johnson's design in the third edition of <font -u>'The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director'</font>, 1762, PL.CXLV.",
