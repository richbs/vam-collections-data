Since lacquer had no natural equivalent in the West, Japanese lacquerware was always much in demand. This resulted in objects being cut up and reused when sections became damaged or when fashion changed. Although lacquerwork for the Japanese home market rarely depicted detailed figures, men and women dressed in kimono are often found on export products designed to appeal to Westerners.\n\nTime\nJapanese lacquerware was first shipped to Europe during the late 16th century and was quite unlike anything seen before. It was much admired and was imported in large quantities throughout the 17th century. Most European country houses and palaces possessed examples of Japanese export lacquer.\n\nPlaces\nHigh quality export lacquer was made to special order in Kyoto, Japan's former imperial capital. It was then transported to Deshima, a small island in Nagasaki harbour, for shipment abroad by Dutch merchants.",
