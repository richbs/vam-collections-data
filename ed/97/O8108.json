Both of these elements invade the space of the \u2018canvas' mounted on the easel. The primary focus of this canvas is a representation of a weather-boarded hut in which hangs a canoe. There is a watery area of light blue textured glass around the hut. A bearded man walks past the canoe. Above, etched against a deep blue band, three male canoeists paddle upwards. Four further small scenes appear as though affixed with tape or paper clips towards the bottom and right hand side of the easel's canvas, the upper right hand corner of which is represented as torn away. These four scenes appear to have been photo-mechanically reproduced, probably screen-printed, from found photographs and printed drawings. They depict a deep sea diver, a man in front of a large block if ice (?), red indians attempting to trap an animal (?) and a diagram which includes a human body. All the elements of the \u2018canvas' appear within the upper panel; the lower panel is largely taken up by the legs of the easel and their shadows.",

            "history_note": "These panels were made while the artist was a graduate student at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. They were designed for a sash-window in the student-faculty lounge in the College Administration Building (Treadwell Hall). The panels appear to have been installed only temporarily and by 1980 the artist was looking to sell them along with a number of others made at that time.\n\nHistorical significance: The artist described in a letter of 26 July 1980 [V&A Registry: Posner nominal file] to Michael Archer, Deputy Keeper of Ceramics at the V&A, how he chose to borrow his imagery from Rene Magritte. \"However\", he wrote, \"where Magritte metaphorically used the canvas as a window and a portrait, I was interested in extending the glass canvas both literally and figuratively as a portrait and window.\"\n\n\"\u2018Paddle you own canoe', along with references to \u2018diving into one's psyche' (top right on easel), and \u2018paddling against the current', \u2018taking the path of least resistence' (top center panel', etc. are all old Horatio Alger euphemisms which reappeared in my dreams and conversations during that fall of 1975.\"\n\n\"It was also at about this time that my wife Susan, (a most talented artist in her own right), and I began the process of separating after seven years of marriage.\"\n\n\"And so, Paddle Your Own Canoe, with its mirror-reflecting borders, fresnel lensed edges, and diffraction grating peek-holes, was in a (somewhat melodramatic) sense a Rorschach canvas in which I attempted to reconcile my bigamous nature. Except rather than the respondant being of Flesh and Blood, the \u2018other woman' was in fact the very work I was doing. And am still doing, at a pace that leaves time for little else.\"\n\nAppended to this is a page from a magazine with advertisements on both sides. One of these advertises Miss Worth \"the vivacious fragrance for the \u201880s\" implying that the cutting comes from a magazine of around 1980. The other, \"How I learned to paddle my own canoe\", advertises Lil-lets tampons. The implication is that Posner did not entitle this work Paddle Your Own Canoe until around 1980 when he was seeking to sell it. In Otto Rigan's <font -i>New Glass</font> published in 1976 (see references) the work is referred to simply as the Treadwell Hall Window.\n\nThe Lil-lets advertisement has a photograph of a semi-naked woman punting a canoe in a pseudo-jungle setting. The text reads: \"How I learned to paddle my own canoe. I wanted to go my own way. Wear what I wanted, do what I wanted, when I wanted. Now I've found the tampons that let me. ... Now I paddle my own canoe.\"",
