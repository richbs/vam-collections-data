As may be deduced from the pencil inscription, this drawing was sent to Pugin's old friend Talbut Bury, to be engraved and distributed to seek support for his design. Pugin's chapel, apart from the antechapel, was taken down and rebuilt by Dunn and Hanson in 1887, but the rebuilding closely followed Pugin's design and incorporated much of his stained glass. The stone screen has also survived.",
