Ltd., Hanley (the first limited liability company in the  Staffordshire potteries, formerly Charles Meigh &amp; Son.) producing  striking designs for transfer printed decoration onto earthenware. This  jug is from a dinner service with three different patterns designed by  Dresser and registered by the Company in 1884. The patterns were  called 'Persian', 'Shanghai' and 'Hampden'. Dresser\u2019s interest in and  commitment to commercial design meant that he actively sought  opportunities, like this, to design for inexpensive mass production. This  jug would probably have been used in a comparatively modest home,  although one with some artistic aspirations. It may also have served as  everyday ware in a home where more expensive bone china was kept  'for best'. In 1886 the Company became the Old Hall Porcelain Works Ltd and this design may have remained in production until 1902 when the factory closed.",
