Consequently the Emperor was forced to flee to his retreat on mount Yoshino and Kiyotaka was ordered to commit suicide. After the latter\u2019s death his ghost began to haunt the Emperor. Masashige\u2019s daughter-in-law, Iga no Tsubone, who was known for her strong character, confronted the ghost of the man who had caused her father-in-law\u2019s suicide and managed to drive him off.",
