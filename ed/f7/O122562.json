His style of work was most similar to his brother S. R. Percy, with whom he went to live after their father's death in 1855.  The two brothers travelled together to Scotland in the 1850's and both were influenced by the areas they visited.  Both brothers also had a love of the Snowdonia area of North Wales.  \n\nAlfred Walter's landscapes often incorporated scenes of seasonal outdoor life, including autumn and harvest scenes.  This particular example shows the herding of sheep in the Welsh hills and includes the sense of bleakness and unpleasant weather which was characteristic of so much of his work.",
