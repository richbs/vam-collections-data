In 1505 Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino (ruled 1482-1508), commissioned Raphael, who was born in Urbino, to produce the painting. According to tradition, the Duke wanted it as a present for Henry VII of England (ruled 1485-1509).  Henry had made him a member of the Order of the Garter, the highest order of English knighthood. By the time the print was made, in 1627, the painting had passed from the English Royal Collection to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630). This print is dedicated to him.\n\nSubject Depicted\nSt George was a legendary warrior saint and martyr who lived in the Near East at the end of the 3rd century AD. He is said to have slain a dragon outside the walls of a city in order to rescue the king's daughter, who was being offered as a sacrifice. This story originally symbolised the triumph of Christianity over paganism and the conversion of a heathen city, personified by the princess, to the true faith. George was made patron saint of England in 1222. He became patron saint of the Order of the Garter in the 14th century.",
