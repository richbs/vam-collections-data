Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This example is a three-dimensional carving in the form of Fujin and Raijin, the Gods of Wind and Thunder. These gods entered the repertoire of popular Japanese mythology from at least the 14th century. The God of Wind is usually portrayed with a bag of wind, while the God of Thunder is shown with one or more drums with which to make the noise of a thunderstorm. \n\nBoth wood and ivory were traditionally the most widely used materials for making netsuke. This netsuke was carved from ivory, which was then stained and coloured. \nFrom the 18th century onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed with the artist\u2019s name. This example is signed Shogetsu.",
