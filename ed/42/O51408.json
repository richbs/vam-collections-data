Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century.  Many troupes were family concerns which travelled round the country long before the advent of film or television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment including melodramas, dramas,  pantomimes, minstrel shows and music hall.  In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became considerably elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is a figure from the Italian knockabout comedy called Commedia dell'Arte, probably a Dottore or doctor, or used as a noble father.  The Dottore figure may have been used in the Harlequinade, along with Harlequin, Columbine, Clown and Pantaloon, but could also have been used as a stock character in plays.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, an expert puppet carver, manipulator and puppet historian, whose widow sold them to the Museum after his death in 1998.",

It is possible, however, to distinguish distinct types, and therefore groups, made by different makers, due to the type of carving.  The carver of this object has been distinguished as Maker C because of the attention given to the carving of the ears.",
