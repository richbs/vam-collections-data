Born Antonio Esteve Rdenas (1936-2004), Antonio started dancing as a boy, having seen dancers on the streets dancing to barrel organ music. He was spotted at the age of 15 by the Spanish dancer Pilar Lopez who took him into her company. His good looks helped to launch his career, and after a decade with Lopez he formed his own company in 1963 touring extensively and popularising flamenco outside Spain.\n\nAlbert Houthuesen (1903-1979) was born in Amsterdam but came to London with his mother in 1912 after the death of his father. After attending  the Royal College of Art, he became a teacher and subsequently a full-time artist. His work covered a wide range of subjects and mediums but he always loved the theatre, dance and clowns, and was particularly excited by Spanish dancers, including Juanito Garcia and Ana Nevada who feature in the sketchbook also presented to the Museum. This was the last lithograph Houthuesen executed since a stroke shortly afterwards triggered an eventually fatal 9-year illness.",
