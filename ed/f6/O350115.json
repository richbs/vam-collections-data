A ladder leans against the cross on the left, and the crown of thorns is placed over the cross; above is the cartouche faintly inscribed INRI, and two nails on the cross-beam are visible. The stigmata are visible on Christ's left hand and foot. Behind is the walled city of Jerusalem. On the rocky ground are three small trees or shrubs, perhaps an acanthus, an oak and an artichoke.  Broken into three pieces and the two repaired breaks are visible. The lower left corner of the relief is missing, and only fragments remain of the integral border. The Virgin's left arm is lost, as is Christ's right arm and his right leg.",

There are four known other versions of this relief, and this suggests that a workshop, probably specialising in alabaster, was producing a number of similar pieces relatively cheaply. It is known that certainly during the 15th century Spanish alabasters were being exported to Germany. A precise attribution is not possible, but like the others this relief probably dates from around 1530, although it is reminiscent of a slightly earlier style; it is likely to have been made in Castile.",
