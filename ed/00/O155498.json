The colour of this relief is a vivid orange, as opposed to the neutral-coloured pastiglia reliefs by Caldecott of around the same date. There are other versions of this relief, for example the metal version exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876.\n\nRandolph Caldecott (1846-1886) was a British artist and illustrator. He first worked as a bank clerk in Whitchurch and Manchester while attending evening classes at the Manchester School of Art. In 1872 he moved to London and studied briefly at the Slade School of Fine Art. He did a lot of book illustrations and was one of the first to avoid the then so popular black-and-white effects. He also worked in watercolours and oil drawings. Caldecott drew his images amidst the vernacular architecture and landscapes of his childhood with a vivid sense of humour. His representation of animals was especially spirited. Apparently even Van Gogh and Gauguin were admirers of his work. Caldecott is commemorated in a memorial by Alfred Gilbert at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London.",
