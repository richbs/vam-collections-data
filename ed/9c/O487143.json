By using hiramaki-e (low sprinkled picture) the plants and auspicious motifs on the box have been separated from the rich detailing of the nashiji (pear-skin ground) background. \nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their work. This example is signed Shunsho (1610-1682). Shunsho was the son of Yamamoto Toshimasa. He lived in Kyoto and Edo and was famous for his calligraphy, poetry and lacquer ware. Beginning as an amateur his work became renowned for its skill, especially for the togidashi-e (polished out picture) lacquer. Shunsho formed the Shunsho family of lacquer masters.",
