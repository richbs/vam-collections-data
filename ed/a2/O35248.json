The shows are performed behind lit screens with the puppeteer or dalang operating the puppets, to the accompaniment of an orchestra, or gamelan.\n\nEarly plays were inspired by stories in Hindu epics such as The Mahabharata and The Ramayana, but after the late 15th century, Islamic and Arabic sources were incorporated into the repertoire.  The good characters are recognisable by their elongated features and pointed noses, whilst the evil characters have round eyes, bulbous noses and protruding teeth.  Even today Javanese puppet shows are imbued with mystical associations and often form part of marriage, birth and thanksgiving ceremonies.",
