This design for Sherrin, leader of the actors, is an example of how a costume can give an audience hints as to character, emotion and plot.  The way in which the drawing sinks into the background, the whitened hands, hints of silver, all hint that the character is not altogether what he seems and that supernatural forces are at work.  The strips of fabric attached to the design are samples of the chosen materials from which the costume will be made.  \nAlthough theatre designs are often considered works of art and are sought after by museums and private collectors, their artistic worth or decorative qualities are secondary to whether they 'work' on stage.  The success of a costume design cannot be judged until it is translated into fabric, texture and decoration by the costume makers and seen as part of the whole stage picture.  Some designers are very knowledgeable about costume making and produce very detailed designs, with notes on fabrics and making techniques, others create an 'atmospheric' drawing, which gives the feeling of the costume, and they then either work closely with the costume maker to realise their concept or have trusted makers who know their work and can create the effects they have in mind.",
