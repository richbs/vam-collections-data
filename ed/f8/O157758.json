The subject matter of dwarfs is after drawings by Baccio di Bianco (1604-54) and from etchings by Jacques Callot (1592/3-1635). Di Bianco worked for the Medicis designing objects in diverse media and organising spectacles. Callot's book 'Various figures of Dwarfs', published in 1616, shows a sixteenth-century travelling troupe of performing dwarfs who were at the court of Grand Duke Cosimo II.\n\nThis table and its pair were in the collection of  Alfred de Rothschild (1842-1918) and were housed in the glass-doomed saloon of Halton House, Buckinghamshire. He was one of the greatest collectors of his era.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
