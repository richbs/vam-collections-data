On the lid is the depiction of a bust of a man in armour on a socle surrounded by trophies and cannon against a shell background. Because so much ivory was carved in Dieppe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this may be French, although it is difficult to state this with any certainty. Ivory combs, together with mirror cases, boxes and gravoirs for parting the hair, formed an essential part of the trousse de toilette or \u00e9tui (dressing case) of the typical wealthy lady or gentleman in the period. The two leading cities for ivory carving were Paris and Dieppe. Luxury items, such as combs were often made in Paris, especially during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During the seventeenth century Dieppe became increasingly significant for small-scale sculpture in ivory, perhaps because it was a port.",
