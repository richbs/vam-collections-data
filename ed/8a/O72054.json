He is most often linked with the Surrealists, and in this print a link can be seen in the influence of automatic drawing, a process of free association in which artists like Joan Mir\u00f3, Max Ernst and Masson were interested, prompted by the practices of psychoanalysis. The romantic embrace of the figures is heightened by the use of hand-made paper in which flowers and ferns have been embedded. In the 1950s Masson became interested in Oriental art and Zen Buddhism, and the use of hand-made paper ties in with this. The arts of calligraphy and scroll painting have also been an influence in this print.",
