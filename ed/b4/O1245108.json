The Grants started their company in the 1960s and worked with it all over Britain and Europe.\n\nThe bodies of the marionettes were sculpted by Frances Grant from obeche, a tropical type of wood well-known for its lack of splinters or resin, while the  faces, hands and feet were sculpted by her using epoxy resin. Peter Grant dressed all the figures, using a wide range of fabrics and techniques for their costumes and their props.",
