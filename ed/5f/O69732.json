He holds onto the arm of the cross with his left hand, and turns towards Christ, his feet curiously pointing in opposite directions. The body of Christ is lowered into the arms of the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea, who wraps him in a cloth. He stands on the left of the cross, wearing a hat with a turned-up, divided brim, and a long gown with a purse hanging from a rope round his waist. An unusually small bearded figure, wearing a hat with a turned-up brim and a long gown and a tippet, presumably representing Nicodemus, stands in the bottom right corner of the panel, removing the nail from Christ's feet with pincers held in his left hand and holding Christ's leg with his right hand. The veiled figure of the Virgin stands on the left of the panel, her hands clasped to her breast, looking towards the centre of the panel. Two wedges may been driven into the ground at the foot of the cross to hold it steady.\n\nThe top of the panel is missing. The ladder and Nicodemus' pincers are damaged. Slight traces of green paint, now darkened, and spots of red remain on the panel. There are three holes drilled into the back of the panel, filled with lead. The bottom has been chipped away. The back of the panel is marked VI, perhaps indicating the panel's position in the altarpiece.",

Notes on some English Alabaster Carvings. <font -u>Antiquaries Journal</font -u>. I, 1921, pp. 223-4, pl.VIII.\nThe dead body of Christ is being lowered by the left arm by a small beardless figure. Hildburgh suggests this figure, being beardless, represents St. John the Evangelist. This, however, is incorrect. The figure of St. John was almost certainly standing behind the Virgin, on the top left of the panel. (Cheetham, <font -u>English Medieval Alabasters</font -u>, 1984)\n\nHildburgh discusses the smallness of the figure of Nicodemus, but his theories appear too elaborate. In most other English alabaster panels of the subject Nicodemus is also shown on a smaller scale than the more important figures on the panel and kneeling.
