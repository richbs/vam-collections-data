His company produced high-quality furniture, including some key masterpieces, but Chippendale's outstanding skill was in design. His pattern-book The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director went through three editions in the 1750s and 60s and inspired trade catalogues and pattern-books from fellow designers. Usually produced by architects, a large, elegant pattern-book was an ambitious project for a craftsman at this time. The Director showed the full range of furniture available in the eighteenth century, and the range of styles that were fashionable. Chippendale created a trademark fusion of rococo style with Chinese and gothic elements, which was the basis of 'English' rococo. His style influenced furniture design in contemporary Europe and colonial America, and had a marked Victorian revival in England. The Director designs were the main source for Chippendale's high reputation until his furniture was first identified in 1906.",

Chippendale</i>. Inscribed with title, \ndimensions of bookcase, P1 111 and Darly  \nSculp \nPen and ink and wash on laid paper. \n31.7 x 14.1 cm \nVAM D.699-1906 \n \nThe drawing was engraved for Chippendale \nby Matthew Darly (worked c. 1750-1778). \nThe publication of engraved plates of designs \nfor furniture and fittings played an increas- \ningly important role in furniture production \nfrom the 1740s. The first edition of the  \n<i>Director</i> was published in 1754, and of all the \nmany pattern books published, it was and has \nremained the most popular, influential and \ncomprehensive. It was, moreover, the first to \nbe devoted solely to furniture, and to provide a \ncomplete range of designs in the \u2018Chippendale \nstyle\u2019 from which patrons could make  \nselections and through which craftsmen could \nfind guidance and inspiration for their work. A \nsecond edition followed in 1755, and a third in \n1762, the latter marked by certain omissions \nand additions which reflected minor changes \nin taste over the period.\u201d",
