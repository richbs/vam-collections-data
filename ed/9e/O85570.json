They appeared in their \u2018great vocal scena \"Jack Shepherd, or The Burglary at the Grange\"\u2019. This was an operatic sketch based on the life of the 18th-century highwayman Jack Sheppard. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. A review noted,\n\nA delightful little operatic sketch, with appropriate scenic effects, it was admirably given, and the singing of both artistes, who have voices of great richness and power, and who introduced various topical illusions into their songs, were heartily appreciated.\n\nSydney Verno and Albert Voyce first appeared on the halls in the 1890s as \u2018The Fin-de-Cycle Bicyclists\u2019 and \u2018The Singing Cyclists\u2019. After Sydney\u2019s death in 1897, Barney Stuart replaced him. By 1905 the duo was working as \u2018sketch vocalists\u2019 instead of a cycling act. They advertised themselves at the Canterbury, Collins\u2019 and the Royal in April 1906 as \u2018popular singing comedians\u2019. They were never big stars, and were earning \u00a325 a week in 1912. At this time the stars Neil Kenyon and G. H. Elliott were earning \u00a375 and \u00a3100 a week respectively.",

Verno & Voyce (Sydney Verno and his brother Albert Voyce), first appear on the halls in the 1890s as a cycling duo, billed as 'The Fin-de-Cycle Bicyclists' and 'The Singing Cyclists'.  After Sydney Verno died in 1897 he was replaced by Barney Stuart, after which the act appears to have changed. They are described as 'sketch vocalists' in the album of caricatures, but advertised themselves in 'The Performer' in April 1906 as 'popular singing comedians'. They were never a bill-topping act, but records from 1912 show they earned \u00a325 a week in one music hall when bigger names like Neil Kenyon earned \u00a375, and G.H. Elliott earned \u00a3100. This comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
