His personal photographs of British Caribbean community life in Hackney came to form the series Growing Up Black.  \n\nA central part of community life photographed by Morris is the church. Shiloh Pentecostal Church on Ashwin Street in Dalston was, Morris said, \u2018the first church owned by the local black community. It was custom for young and old to dress in their best clothes for the Sunday services.\u2019 The church services documented by Morris convey the major role religion played in the lives of many British Caribbean people. The church is also shown as a space where new communities and traditions were forged. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Dennis Morris as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives.  The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
