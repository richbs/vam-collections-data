The great hall was the usual setting for such displays, since it was here that the medieval lord feasted with his household and guests. These eye-catching decorations not only advertised his wealth, but also proclaimed his lineage and social alliances.\n\nPlace\nThis is one of a series of coats of arms relating the Beaupr\u00e9 family history. It is thought to have been commissioned by Sir Robert Bell for Beaupr\u00e9 Hall, the family's ancestral home near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Bell married Dorothy, the sole heiress of the Beaupr\u00e9 line, in 1559 and succeeded to the Beaupr\u00e9 estate following the death of Dorothy's father, Edmund, in 1567. The windows seem to date from the completion of a new great hall in around 1570, but were later moved and cut down to fit narrower lights.\n\nPeople\nThis shield shows the arms of Thomas Beaupr\u00e9 (died 1471), the great-grandson of John Beaupr\u00e9 (whose arms are depicted in another panel from this group, museum no. C.62-1946), following his marriage around 1434 to Margaret, daughter of John Meeres of Houghton in Lincolnshire.\n\nHeraldry\nThough a man's arms were 'impaled' with those of his wife for the duration of the marriage, only his arms were traditionally passed on to children of the union. A woman's arms were only permanently incorporated into the family's heraldry if she was the sole heiress of her line. For this reason, the diagonal blue bands of Beaupr\u00e9 are quartered with the horizontal gold and blue bands of St-Omer, of which family Thomas's great-grandmother was the last member.",
