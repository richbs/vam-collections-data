There is a figure beneath each one,  standing in front of the architraves of doorways with  decoration of a now unclear design.The arches are pointed and bear an inner fillet from which depend pairs of rounded motifs. The arches terminate in scrolled volutes from which hang cone-shaped fruits.  The figure in the left hand arch is possibly a female wearing a knee-length tunic over an <i>antariya</i> with an <i>uttariya</i> flung over her left shoulder which she holds in her left hand, while holding up a bunch of lowers in her right hand.  She is looking across to the male figure in the adjacent arch, who also turns his head towards her.  He is standing with his left arm resting on his hip with the other one holding an object which may be another bunch of flowers.  He is dressed in an<i> antariya</i> with an <i>uttariya</i> looped across his body and draped over his left shoulder.",
