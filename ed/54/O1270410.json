The suit has long sleeves which are very full at the shoulder and a high round upright pleated cotton collar. Two crescent shaped rolls of padding have been used to add shaping at the proper right and proper left shoulders of the suit, one sits at the top interior edge of the sleeveheads, the other being positioned inside the top edge of the sleeve itself. \n\nThe suit fastens right over left with a series of 4 industrial strength press studs at the proper left shoulder and 3 large hooks at the collar. A zip has been added at the proper left side seam, but this appears to be a later modification.\n\nThe upper part of the suit fits fairly closely to the body, whilst the base flares out from the waist to extend into full \u2018shorts\u2019 which reach to a point slightly above the knee. The interior of these \u2018shorts\u2019 is faced with six parallel bands of pleated \u2018frills\u2019 of stiff cream lined. The same cream linen has been used to line the interior of the upper part of the suit. \n\nThe front and rear of the suit are decorated with a meandering pattern of grapes and vine leaves. The base pattern appears to have been painted or drawn onto the surface of the fabric, this has then been outlined with beading. The grapes are a vivid magenta outlined with sequins and decorated with cut glass beads in the same tone. Their leaves are edged in gold glass bugle [?] beads with highlights in green ink and decorated with additional cut glass gold beads.",

He first appeared under it at the Oxford Music-Hall on 13 April 1895 when his early act consisted of sketches in which he mimicked music-hall stars of the day, using clip-on paper costumes to allow as many as forty-two changes in one act. He went on to develop various sketches based on middle-class leisure pursuits such as fishing, golfing and gardening which he performed with a small company.",
