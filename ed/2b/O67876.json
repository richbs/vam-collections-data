            "public_access_description": "The cake basket, otherwise known as a  bread basket or fruit basket, was a particularly popular item of tableware in the 18th century. One Sheffield plating firm, Watson & Bradbury, in their pattern book for 1788-1815, listed 148 different patterns for this type of object alone. These baskets were usually circular, boat shaped or oval, like this one, which is pierced and chased with bands of rosettes and floral scrolls and beaded edges.  \n\nThe traditional silversmith's technique for executing pierced work was with a fretsaw and proved quite unsuitable for Sheffield plate, as the teeth of the saw ripped the silver surface, tearing it away from the copper core and leaving a jagged edge. The solution adopted to overcome this was to use a fly punch. This consisted of a large screw, secured in a frame, which had a large cross bar at the top with weights at either end.  This machine works on the same principle as an early printing press, serving to translate a horizontal movement into a vertical downward thrust. The lower end drove a hardened steel cutting tool, shaped to the pattern required, directly through the surface of the metal in one operation causing the uppermost silver skin to be dragged over the copper core and so at the same time concealing it.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s. The introduction of Sheffield plate revolutionised the plating industry for it offered an effective, relatively cheap, supremely versatile and durable plating technique which could convincingly imitate the surface appearance of solid silver.",
