However, the patent details inscribed on the base reveal that the design was registered in 1916, three years before the Bauhaus existed. It was an engineer's solution to the problem of storing teapots in mass catering establishments. The spouts and handles on conventional teapots were vulnerable, and liable to be broken in crowded hotel pantries.\n\nThe design was registered by Robert Johnson of Leicester. In his patent application he specified that the teapot could be made in either ceramic or metal. His main intention was to produce a practical design. But when the Birmingham retail silversmith Napper & Davenport produced the teapot in silver it acquired an aesthetic importance that Johnson never envisaged. In the late 1920s the Cube Teapot Company was established in Leicester and produced a highly successful version in ceramic.",

However, the patent details inscribed on the base reveal that the design was registered by Robert Johnson of Leicester in 1916, three years before the Bauhaus even existed.  It was an engineer's solution to the problem of storing teapots in mass catering establishments where vulnerable spouts and handles on conventional teapots were liable to be broken in crowded hotel pantries.  Johnson's patent application broadly specified the material; the teapot could be either made in ceramic or metal.  His original intention was for a practical design.  Its production in silver by the Birmingham retail silversmith, Napper & Davenport gave it an aesthetic importance that the original patentee never initially intended.  In the late 1920s, a company was established in Leicester called the Cube Teapot Company which produced a highly successful version in ceramic.",
