The dress has all the hallmarks of her impeccable clothes - the cut is precise; the finish is immaculate, and the decoration is minimal, but appropriate. The dress consists of four flared panels with eight deep godets (triangular insertions giving fullness at the hem). It has a high neck with a small, top-stitched pointed collar which fastens at the back with a row of seven small buttons and loops. The seams, cuffs and belt are also top-stitched and the blackness of the dress is relieved by the silver winged buckle. Jersey is a particularly difficult material to handle and sew but Jean Muir's meticulous attention to every minute detail ensures that the completed garment is perfect.\n\nGiven by Miss Jean Muir\nT.127&A-1983"
