She bought them at the sale of his collection at his house, 34 Grove End Road, St. John's Wood, in 1913.\n\nChairs with this sort of inlaid decoration, often incorporating a name and a date, were made in the Vierl\u00e4nde district, just to the south-east of Hamburg in Prussia (modern Germany) from the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century.  The traditional form would be difficult to date without the inclusion of a date in the decoration. This often commemorated a family event.",
