His arms are embossed on the chalice calyx, and plaques depicting saints with associations particular  to him and to his diocese are applied to the foot (Guti\u00e9rrez Ba\u00f1os: 1999, p. 233). The altar cruet set which accompanied this chalice survives today in Palencia Cathedral, but the altar bell has disappeared. The chalice was bought by the American collector Walter Leo Hildburgh in San Sebasti\u00e1n in 1923.\n\nThe goldsmith, Andr\u00e9s Francisco Espetillo, was born in Madrid. His father is described in documents as a master-maker of tortoiseshell boxes who also worked as a silversmith. The family moved to Valladolid while Andr\u00e9s Francisco was still a child. There he trained as a goldsmith, and was one of the main figures responsible for introducing fashionable rococo styles to the nearby provincial town of Palencia. Andr\u00e9s Francisco eventually settled in Palencia in 1754, and carried out important commissions for the Cathedral authorities. He died in 1779.\n\nThe design of the chalice reflects eighteenth-century fashions for the sinuous, asymmetric designs characteristic of the style known as rococo. However, the principal interest of this piece lies in the fact that both the goldsmith and his patron are known, and that the context in which the chalice was used can be traced in documents in the archive of Palencia Cathedral.",
