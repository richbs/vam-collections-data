It was 120 feet in diameter with four steel prefabricated lattice masts, each in two sections, with 40 quarter poles painted red and yellow.  The deep blue canvas top had 8 sections, 4 quarters and 4 middles, with red and yellow trimmings.  The yellow and red PVC side wallings were 13 feet high with 120 side poles painted red.",
