The first image, (on the left hand side of the illustration), shows the moment when 'Sapho meets Gaussin at the Ball', the second image, (on the right hand side), shows the moment when Gaussin discovers Fanny with Joseph. \n\nThere have been several adaptations of &lt;i&gt;Sapho&lt;/i&gt;, inspired by the novel of the same name by Alphonse Daudet (1840-1897). These include an 1885 play by Daudet and Adolphe Belotand, a pi\u00e8ce lyrique for which the music was composed by Jules Massenet (1842-1912) to a French libretto by Henri Cain (1857-1937)and Arthur Bern\u00e8deby (1871-1937), (first performed on 27 November 1897 by the Op\u00e9ra Comique at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique on the Place du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris), and a 1900 American play by Clyde Fitch (1865-1909). \n\nThe illustration is not dated or signed but annotation on the rear indicates that it was drawn by the artist F.V.Poole. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",

He was also the Managing Director of The Illustrated London News from the late 1870s until 1900 and became the proprietor of a number of additional publications including The Sketch and The English Illustrated Magazine. \n\nThe Illustrated London News was the world's first illustrated weekly newspaper. Founded by Sir William Ingram\u2019s father, Herbert Ingram, in 1842 the first edition was sold on 14th May 1842 at a cost of sixpence per copy. Building from an original circulation of 26,000 to in excess of 300,000 at its peak, The Illustrated London News remained in print until 2003 and commissioned illustrations from many of the leading artists of the late nineteenth century. Photographs were used alongside illustrations from the late 19th century onwards but illustrations were a major feature of paper until after the end of the First World War.",
