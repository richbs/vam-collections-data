It is lithographed to show a white horse galloping with orange and blue trim and the jockey is black and white. The whole is mounted on a four wheeled frame containing the clockwork mechanism wound by a separate key on the left left. It is an erratic movement and can be raced against another (see B138-1994). *The mark could be that of Ferdinand Imhof of Berlin; however; the use of Bavaria suggests a different maker; probably Arnold of Nuremberg; founded 1906 by Karl Arnold. The casting of the metal is very fine.",
