It was acquired by Sir Arthur Capell-Brooke, who travelled extensively in Sweden, Norway, 'Finmark' and Lapland during 1820. The tankard was later owned by the celebrated collector John Jones, who bequeathed it to the V&A in 1882.\u2019\nCatalogue of Scandinavian and Baltic Silver, RW Lightbown, V&A, 1975, p169: \u2018A letter from Messrs Nixon and Rhodes of 390 Oxford Street, dated 13 February 1860, says that the tankard was purchased by them \u201cat the sale of the effects of the late Sir Arthur de Cape Broke (sic) Bt of Oakley Hall - Nr Kettering Northamptonshire\u201d . Sir Arthur de Capell Brooke (1791-1858) ... travelled in Scandinavia in 1820. Neither his \u2018Travels through Sweden, Norway and Finmark to the North Pole in the Summer of 1820\u2019, 1823, nor his \u2018Winter in Lapland and Sweden\u2019, 1827, contains any reference to the tankard. ...\nLars Torbiornsson (b. 26 March 1719; d. 3 March 1786), the son of Torbiorn Rasmussen and Katerina Ramberg, was born at Solberga. He was Speaker of the Peasants\u2019 House from 1755 until 1778.\nQueen Louisa Ulrica of Prussia (d. 1782) was the wife of King Adolphus Frederick (b. 1710, reigned 1751-71) whom she married in 1744. It is a reasonable assumption that, if the tradition of presentation is a true one, she gave Torbiornsson the tankard at some date between 1755 and his death in 1778. Bribery and corruption were endemic in Swedish politics of the day.\nObviously the tankard was not made for the Queen, though it is an exceptionally heavy and splendid piece. The Terminus Post Quem for its manufacture is 1727 the date of the coin of Frederick and Ulrica Eleonora set significantly in the centre of the lid. A Terminus Ante Quem is provided by the inscription dated 1735 on the escutcheon on the handle... a year letter system was introcuded in Arboga on 3 July 1733; the absence of a year letter on the tankard should mean that it was made before that date. On acquisition it was dated around 1770: this was subsequently changed to a date around 1720. The design is of standard Swedish Late Baroque type.\u2019",
