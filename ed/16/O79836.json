They were traded throughout the Balkans, and were highly esteemed.  Although the clasp appears to be made of gilded silver it is in fact copper, thickly plated first with silver, and then gold.  This technique was very common in the Balkans in the 19th century.  \n\nIt was acquired in Cairo but it is more likely that it was made in the Balkans or Anatolia, where such clasps were the most important item in a woman\u2019s dowry.  The women who owned them sewed them onto cloth belts which they made themselves, usually richly embroidered.",
