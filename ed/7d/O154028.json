            "physical_description": "A panel of moulded leather for upholstery or wall decoration, now in three sections, showing an intermediate stage in the decoration of such panels.  The panel shows, overall, two and a half repeats of a formal Louis XIV revival design, centreing on a shaped cartouche in strapwork.  The cartouche has straight sides, but shows a double curve at top and bottom, forming a point.  The centre of the cartouche is set with a pedestal, with moulded, trellised decoration, supporting a fan-shaped motif, flanked by two birds, with their heads turned to the edge of the panel. The spandrels outside the cartouche are set with formal motifs of acanthus foliage and the sides of the cartouche are flanked with half a shaped cartouche on each side.  If the panels were placed edge to edge with others of this pattern these would form narrow, serpentine cartouches between the main ones. The ground of the panel is decorated with small flower and foliage motifs in relief, against a background that is painted in dark green.  The edges of the frame of the main cartouche and the edges of some other motifs are decorated in varnished foil, giving the effect of gilding. The painting took place after the foil work and traces of paint are visible on foiled areas\n[Leather panel] This section shows shows approximately half (the upper half) of the repeat of the pattern. The panel does not extend much beyond the moulded area.  The lower edge is cleanly knife cut. There is a straight crack across the panel approximately 20 cm from the top, perhaps indicating an early fold.  Some higher elements of the design are foiled and varnished to give the appearance of gilding.  The outer ground is painted dark green, the inner ground a paler blue-green\n[Leather panel] This section shows one repeat of the design. On the side edges the leather extends beyond the moulded decoration, with a plain border varying from 1-3 cm.  The lower edge has been cleanly cut with a knife.  On the back of the panel a join of skins is visible as a diagonal line approximately 31 cm above the lower edge (measured at the centre of the panel).  The skins are joined by overlapping and glueing, after the edges have been skived.  Some higher elements of the design have been foiled and varnished to appear gilded, the outer area is painted a dark green and the inner a paler blue-green\n[Leather panel] This section shows just over one repeat of the design, with a small extra area at the bottom of the panel, approximately 8.5 cm high. It is only slightly large than the moulded area but shows no knife cuts. There is a straight crack across the panel approximately 26 cm from the top, perhaps caused by folding of the panel. On the back the join of skins is visible approximately 25 cm up from the lower edge.  This is disguised on the face of the panel by paint and varnished foil. The skins are joined by glueing, after the edges have been skived.  Some of the higher elements of the design are foiled and varnished to give the appearance of gilding.  The outer ground is painted dark green, the inner a lighter blue-green.",
