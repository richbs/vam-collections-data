The upper right hand holds the flaming wheel (cakra) for protection, between the the first two fingers; the upper left, the conch (shanka) for salvation, also between the first two fingers; the lower right, a lotus bud, (padma) for creation; the lower left, the mace (gada) for destruction. There is a lightly engraved srivasta symbol of the god's consort, Sri Devi, above the right breast. The figure wears a cylindrical coronet (kirita makuta), elaborately jewelled. Behind the head there is a flower-like siras cakra (disc for hanging garlands) with jewelled pendants. The lower garment, striped and ornamented, is worn with girdle and sash, the former with a lion-clasp and beaded cords extending in front; the latter with short but stiffly projecting ends at the hips (knotted rather than tied in the usual bow). Other details include makara-kundala ear pendants; keyura armlets, waist-band, anklets, and padasaras on the feet.  The figure is cast in one piece with lotus pedestal and a square base, the latter with projecting tenons for the support of an arched-surround (torana), now missing. The presence of encrusted carbonate matter in the crevices indicates a period of earth-burial.",

            "public_access_description": "This small processional image shows Vishnu seated in royal ease (\u2018lalitasana\u2019) on a double-lotus throne. His upper hands hold the flaming wheel (\u2018cakra\u2019) and conch (\u2018sangka\u2019), while his lower ones hold the mace (\u2018gada\u2019) and lotus stem and bud (\u2018padma\u2019). The lotus is a feature of iconography of the Pallava period (about 300-888 AD) and was soon displaced by the hand gesture invoking protection of the devotee (\u2018abhaya-mudra\u2019). \n\nThe lightly engraved \u2018srivatsa\u2019 mark on Visnu\u2019s chest is a symbol of the natural elements and of the presence of his consort, Laksmi. He wears a cylindrical crown (\u2018kirita-mukuta\u2019) and elaborate ear-ornaments (\u2018kundala\u2019) with \u2018makara\u2019 design. He is richly bejewelled, with strings of pearls draping his shoulders and elaborate arm-bands. \n\nThe flower-like disc (\u2018sirascakra\u2019) on the back of the head is probably a residual nimbus, now used for hanging garlands and jewelled pendants. The waist-cloth is secured with belt with a' kirttimukh' ('face of glory) clasp and sash. The base has cast projections to secure a framing arch (\u2018prabha\u2019), now missing.\n\nThe devotional poetry of the Tamil poet-saints makes it clear that processional images were widely used in the Pallava period. However, few have survived the centuries of use and the ravages of hostile invasions. Prior to conservation the surface of this sculpture was encrusted with carbonate material, which confirms a period of earth-burial. The sculpture was probably buried to escape looting during the Muslim occupation in the early 14th century.",
