            "historical_context_note": "This painting was originally given to Guido Reni, and then reattributed to the Dutch school as it appears closer to Frans Hals (c. 1580-1666) and the Haarlem school. The technique however, of tempera on tile, is typical of Florence where many examples of paintings on tile can be found from Andrea del Sarto, to Vasari and Giovanni da san Giovanni among others. \n\nMore specifically the painting was executed on a particular type of tile called \u2018gronda\u2019 in Italian, on the external side on the tile; the edges on the back are still visible. The dimensions of the tile (55 x 38 x 2 cm) are also characteristic of the \u2018gronda\u2019 type. The painting was made with pigments grounded with lime (\u2018calce\u2019). \n\nIt is most likely that the painting was executed in Florence by a foreign artist who became interested in the technique. To judge on the stylistic characteristics, the painting may have been executed by one of the many Netherlandish artists present in Italy in the late 17th century. \n\nThe unusual technique may explain why this work entered the collection.",
