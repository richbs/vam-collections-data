            "public_access_description": "Pantomime was popular in Australia and New Zealand in the early 20th century and J.C. Williamson Ltd. was the most important production company producing theatre there, frequently importing British stars.  This contract is for Nora Delany (d.1977) to appear as Principal Boy for a salary of \u00a3150 a week on tour in Australia and New Zealand in 1921 and 1922. Nora Delany had made her career in England in music hall and revue as well as in pantomime as a Principal Boy. She was married to Sir William Maxwell by 1921, but the marriage was dissolved before 1937 when she married the theatrical impresario Prince Littler.\n\nThe name of the pantomime is not specified, probably because that was not yet decided when the contract was signed in January 1921, but we know that Nora Delany played Robin Hood in Babes in the Wood. A newspaper review of the final dress rehearsal at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne, 24 December 1921, mentions the vivid colours of the production, and that Nora Delany wore about a dozen costumes, the first being a white satin tunic with silver braid, a green brocaded velvet cape and a 'jaunty green turban'. The pantomime toured Australia until April 1922 when it was at His Majesty's Theatre, Brisbane, moving to New Zealand by May 1922.\n\nThe contract specifies that Nora Delany would travel first class, and her maid second class, and that they should be ready to sail by steamship to Australia on or about 22 October 1921. It states that the engagement could be extended, as long as she was back in the UK in time to rehearse for pantomime in 1922, and gives the rules and regulations concerning her engagement, including the rules that she must not enter or exit the stage at any time apart from that settled at rehearsal, that she must wear the correct costume and not alter her part or disobey the directions of the Stage Manager or Musical Director.",
