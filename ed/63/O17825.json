He especially admired Blake\u2019s visionary approach and his lack of respect for conventional watercolour techniques.\n\nThis watercolour has a magical, powerful and dreamlike quality. Palmer painted it during his \u2018Shoreham Period\u2019. He stayed in Shoreham, a village in the English county of Kent, from 1826 until about 1834.",

Cat. no. 66, p. 139, illus.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n\u201866 \n<i>In a Shoreham Garden</i>, c.1829  \n \nIndian ink with watercolour and \nGouache on prepared board, 27.9 x 22.2 cm \n(11 x 8 \u00be in) \n \nLit: V&A 1926, 62; Grigson 78; Lister 103 \n \nLondon, Victoria and Albert Museum,  \n32-1926  \n \nA.H  Palmer was the first to describe this  \nas a \u2018companion to <i>\u2019The Magic Apple Tree\u2019</i>  \n(V&A 1926), and the two have come to  \nbe regarded as the summit of Palmer\u2019s  \nachievement, his most individual contri- \nbutions to the history of English art. Like  \nits companion, <i>In a Shoreham Garden</i> was  \n\u2018shown to scarcely anyone\u2019 (A.H. Palmer  \nto F.L. Griggs, 27 June 1926, Ashmolean  \nMuseum) and presumably kept in  \nPalmer\u2019s special Shoreham portfolio.  \nThe two drawings are, however, very  \ndifferent in style, technique and effect,  \nalthough the aim in both was to celebrate  \nthe \u2018excess [that] is the essential vivifying  \nspirit, vital spark, embalming spice\u2026 \nof the finest art\u2019. \n \nThe drawing is dominated by an apple  \ntree in full bloom, growing at the edge of  \na garden path. Framed by its branches,  \nat the end of the path stands a graceful  \nfemale figure in profile, wearing a  \nflowing red dress, and gazing away to the  \nright. Apart from the edge of a wooden  \nbuilding in the foreground, everywhere  \nelse is a profusion of blossoms and leaves,  \nboth within and beyond the garden. Tall  \ntrees reach into the sky at the right and  \nleft, and even the sky is punctuated by  \npink and white apple blossoms exploding  \nlike fireworks on the ends of their  \nbranches. \n \nThe idea for the drawing may have  \ncome to Palmer in his own garden at  \nWater House, from which he painted the  \nbridge across the Darent (cat. 44) and  \npossibly the <i>Pastoral with a Horse Chestnut  \nTree</i> (cat. 70). Alternatively, it may have  \nbeen another garden at Shoreham,  \nattached to one of his own properties or  \nelsewhere. It is unlikely, however, to  \nhave been that of Mr Groombridge, who  \nseems to have grown fruit commercially  \nin an orchard. The technique of the  \ndrawing is similar to that of the <i>Pear Tree  \nin a Walled Garden</i>, though on a slightly  \ndifferent support. The outlines of the  \nleaves and blossom are drawn in thick  \nblack Indian ink, both under and over  \nthe body colours \u2013 green, white, pink and  \negg-yolk yellow \u2013 applied with varying  \ntouches, from tiny dots to broad shading.  \nThe white body colour is so thickly  \napplied that at one point a large blob  \nhas come away, almost as though the  \nblossom has exploded.\u2019",
