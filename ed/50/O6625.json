This was transferred to rue de Metz in 1921, with workers from the Daum Fr\u00e8res glassworks, while at Trois maisons a glass kiln was built, the Verrerie d'Art.  Between 1926 and 1933, when the business closed, Delatte, with decorator Paul Maheux, supplied the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ligier-Richier with a wide variety of decorative and lighting glass.
