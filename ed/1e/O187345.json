An iconic symbol recognizable across the globe, it represents the Rolling Stones as anti-establishment, sticking their tongue out to the world, while giving them a corporate identity. This artwork is painted on art-board, overlaid with a semi-opaque drawing cell carrying the detail and causing the background to appear grey. The red colour would be added during the production process, as can be seen in the digital print produced from this artwork in 2007, S.6121-2009.\n\nMick Jagger, singer with The Rolling Stones, had seen Pasche's designs at the 1970 Royal College of Art final degree show. After later meeting to discuss ideas, Jagger showed Pasche an image of the Hindu goddess Kali. Pasche, honing in on the goddess's protruding tongue, was inspired to create his famous logo (S.6120 & 6121-2009), which captured perfectly the impudence of the band, and the prominence and sensuality of Jagger's mouth.",
