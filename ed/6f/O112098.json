Sansom, Watch & Clock Maker, 2 Montpelier Street, Brompton Road, SW'. This was the retailer and also perhaps the maker of the clock case. Sansom's shop was near the Museum and supplied several clocks for office use. The clock also bears paper labels indicating that it was used in the Museum Superintendent's room at one time. This and other selected items of museum furniture have been taken into the permanent collections as illustrations of the kind of plain, good quality furnishings supplied for public offices during the reign of Queen Victoria.",

            "history_note": "Found in Ian Blatchford's Office, Directorate, in 2004. Accessioned because evidently an early piece of museum furnishing and interesting because of the marks and labels.Other Museum clocks have the name 'Sansom' but no other that we know of have the name 'Slark'.  The 1866 London Post Office Directory lists a watchmaker named William Slark at 70 Brompton Road, SW.  This is near to the premises of C. Sansom, Watch and Clock Maker, at 2 Montpelier Street, Brompton Road.  Sansom might have made the clock case or simply retailed the clock. Both premises were near the South Kensington Museum.  Another clock in the collection, W.3.2004, bear a Sansom label with the additional line:'Clock Makers to the Department of Science and the South Kensington Museum'.\nCharles Sansom appears in the 1866 London Post Office Directory as 'watchmaker, 63 Great Portland Street'. in the 1902 Directory he is listed as still at 2 Montpelier Street. Slark is not listed.",
