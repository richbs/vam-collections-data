In the late 1960s, they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nTomorrow were a 1960s psychedelic rock band. Despite critical acclaim and support from DJ John Peel who featured them on his \"Perfumed Garden\" radio show, the band was not a great success in commercial terms. They were among the first psychedelic bands in England along with Pink Floyd and Soft Machine. My White Bicycle was one of only two records they released, although they were well known on the London scene.",
