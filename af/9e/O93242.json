The figure subjects are usually taken from mythology and are similar to those on textiles, but occasionally biblical scenes occur. The carvings were probably used in the decoration of wooden caskets.\n\nTriton is a sea-god. He was usually thought to be the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea and Amphritete, the goddess of the sea. A daughter, Pallas, was attributed to him. Usually he is represented with a human upper body and a tail of a fish.\n\nThe Nereids in Greek mythology are 50 sea nymphs, the daughters of Nereus and Doris.",
