The chest consists of 6 boards, the front, back, lid and bottom grained side to side, the sides grained vertically (the standard pattern for boarded chests), with the boards nailed, apparently using handmade iron nails. One notable feature is the the front and back boards (apparently riven) taper towards the lower edge, to a thickness of 4-5mm. Both sides are cut out with an ogee arch between the feet.\n\nThe lid, with moulded front and back edges, and nulled ends, is held on two staple hinges, apparently original. The lock (of late medieval pattern but apparently c1900) appears to be a replacement. Inside, at the right side, is a lidded til with integral hinges, the lid (and probably the bottom) of beech, the front of oak.",
