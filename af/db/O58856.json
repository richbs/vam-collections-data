            "history_note": "The print depicts the opening scene of Leonide Massine's ballet Les Femmes de bonne humeur (The Good Humoured Ladies), designed by Leon Bakst to music by Scarlatti, produced by the Diaghilev Ballets Russes in 1917.  On the balcony is The Marquise Silvestra, preparing for Carnival, with her maid Mariuccia mimicking her in the background; at this point in the synopsis, a Beggar enters in brown rags, but the figure here may represent a musician from later in the ballet.  The print is an enlarged version of the frontispiece to The Good Humoured Ladies, Impressions of the Russian Ballet 1918, Number Two.  \n\nBy the mid 1920s, there was an increasing interest in the Diaghilev Ballet and material relating to dance in general.  Beaumont had already produced a series of booklets on individual Diaghilev Ballets under the series title Impressions of the Russian Ballet and a number of wooden cut-out Diaghilev dancers in their famous roles.  He now decided to produce a series of hand coloured prints of typical scenes from the Diaghilev Ballet repertory.   He kept no records of when he began publishing the prints nor how many were produced, although he reckoned about twenty, mostly the work of Adrian Allinson, Ethelbert White and Randolf Schwabe who had also worked on Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets and the wooden figures, and Eileen Mayo.  \nIn all these works, Beaumont strove to capture the exact moments of the ballet as well as artists' interpretations.  It is likely that the design of each print followed the painstaking search for accuracy that had characterised the creation of the illustrations for Impressions of the Russian Ballet series, described in Bookseller at the Ballet, choosing the significant moment, watching the ballet night after night to check details of the poses and grouping (not easy when the stage was full of individual dancers and movement), going backstage to sketch scenery and borrow costumes.    \nMost of the hand-colouring for Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets was the work of Beaumont and his wife, Alice, and it is possible that both were also involved in colouring the prints, although eventually other artists were employed on both projects.\n\nHistorical significance: Les Femmes de bonne humeur was Massine's third ballet and an undisputed masterpiece.  As a comedy of manners, it marked a new departure for the Diaghilev Ballets Russes, and, being based on Goldoni's play Le Donne di Buon Umore and using music by Scarlatti, it  was at once a tribute to Italy, where it was premiered in 1917, and an indication of Diaghilev's increasing break with Russia and his 'Europeanisation' in turning to European sources as inspiration for his company's repertory.",
