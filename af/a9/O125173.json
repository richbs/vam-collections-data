It was presented as part of the 1970 Winter Couture collection, which was inspired by Indian art and culture. This coat was named \"Rajputana\" after a  former group of princely states in north-western India and featured in colour in the November 1970 issue of Vogue magazine. After being made up, the plain cream wool coat was hand-painted with vibrant floral motifs inspired by Indian art in the Victoria & Albert Museum's collections. Cawley co-designed the motifs with Andrew Whittle, a student at the RCA Illustration School, and the actual painting was done by Whittle.\n\nThis coat was worn by Sara Donaldson-Hudson for her registry-office wedding to Nicholas Haydon on 23 April 1971. Sara\u2019s mother, Dorothy, was a dedicated follower of fashion who did not want her daughter to wear white to marry a divorc\u00e9. Between them, they chose this colourful coat, which was worn with a bright orange shift dress and orange satin knee boots which matched the coat lining.",
