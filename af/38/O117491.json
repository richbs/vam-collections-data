By the time of his death he led his profession, was a household name and a great star on both sides of the Atlantic. At his death, flags throughout Great Britain flew at half mast; the pillars of the Lyceum Theatre were hung with black cr\u00eape, and every London cab-driver tied a black bow on their whip. His coffin was carried to Westminster Abbey through streets lined with silent crowds of over 40000 people. The following day 4000 people crowded into the Abbey where his ashes were buried. \n\nCr\u00eape handkerchiefs like this were imported from Japan in the late 19th century, already printed with a floral or figurative border.  British printers then used them for a variety of souvenirs, as well as theatre programmes, and the firm who printed this specialised in souvenir handkerchief printing.  Irving's photograph features on this with a summary of his career and the last words he spoke on stage in Bradford - 'Into thy hands, oh Lord'.",
