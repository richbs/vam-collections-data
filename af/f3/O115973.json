In the early years of the Twentieth Century his factory-produced jewellery in silver and enamel, often set with glass stones, brought the style of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the lines of Art Nouveau to the mass market. He was particularly influenced by Liberty's Cymric range of jewellery, and his work shared with them the appearance of being hand-made despite being produced mechanically. Having started out on a very small scale - a workshop where he employed two men in 1861, the company expanded steadily through the late Nineteenth Century. In 1905 it moved to a purpose-built factory in Halifax, and at its height employed in excess of 350 people.",
