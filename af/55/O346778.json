It was purchased at public auction by Mr. Jones at the sale of the effects of the late Mr. Henry Hope; being described as made of white veined marble; the price was not large, about fifty pounds, for which it was obtained.  There is no memorandum whether the fact that the vase is S\u00e8vres porcelain was known by Mr. Jones at the time of the sale, but at any rate he very soon discovered it, and an offer of many hundred pounds, made within a week or two afterwards, was refused.'\nBrunet, Marcelle and Pr\u00e9aud, Tamara. S\u00e8vres Des origines \u00e0 nos jours. Fribourg, Switzerland: Office du Livre, 1978. 164 p., 120, ill.\nBrunet refers to an undated drawing at S\u00e8vres and to moulds in the factory inventory dated 1.1.1762 in order to identify this shape as 'Vase Choiseul'.  Although blue ground examples have been found listed in the factory records, no trace of this example imitating marble has been discovered.  It appears to be unique.",
