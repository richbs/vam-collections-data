The designer, Johann Hrdlicka, was a professor at the Central Lace School in Vienna, and his work had been a highlight of the Austrian Arts and Crafts section of the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900. It was reported that 'Museums competed with beautiful women to acquire the delicate airy lace'. \n\nAlthough the execution of this lace is not fine enough to suggest that it was actually made in the Central Lace School, it seems very likely to have been made at the time, following or inspired by one of Hrdlicka\u2019s designs.",
