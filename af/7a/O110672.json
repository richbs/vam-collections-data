They could be rough or detailed, large or small, and were made in clay, terracotta, wood and wax. This is a sketch model for a larger wooden figure commissioned for the church of the Jesuits in Mannheim. The finished sculpture was intended for a side altar dedicated to St Francis Borgia and also designed by Egell. The model represents an early stage in the evolution of the design, which was never realised as Egell died shortly afterwards.",
