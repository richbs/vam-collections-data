There is an elaborate border on four sides between two bands of needle weaving. Each side has three cartouches of openwork with large squares of pulled thread with added diagonals [a]. There is a series of fine, small-scale decorative bands worked in straight stitches around the two pointed ends of the cartouches. Two triangles are formed where these meet and these are worked in stepped triangles to form a pattern of lozenges. The four corner units are like a three pointed leaf in pulled thread work in which a series of large squares have added diagonals [a]. There is an embroidered 'stem' from the corner leading into a central lozenge with a square mesh infill. Midway along each side there is a narrow cypress tree shape in [a] and to either side a broader version, also in [a]. Both motifs are edged with embroidery with a series of bands edged with reciprocal trefoils around the squat shapes and stepped triangles forming lozenges around the upper edge of the cypress. Satin stitch stars are scattered on the field. In the centre is a square of [a] with an octagonal border of needle weaving, embroidery and pulled thread. Around this is a pointed octagon of [a] and then a decorative border of needle weaving alternating with embroidered stars.",
