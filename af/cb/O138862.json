            "public_access_description": "This cartoon appeared in the Evening Standard on 7 August 2003, and is artist Marf's take on the current news story. As she describes it: 'The Hutton Inquiry has been set up to examine the circumstances of the death of Government scientist Dr David Kelly, who committed suicide on July 17. His death came after he was exposed for suggesting in off-the-record interviews with BBC journalists that the Government had exaggerated the case for invading Iraq... The BBC itself becomes the subject of the news. Andrew Gilligan, by now a household name, is the reporter who broke the story on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, claiming that Number 10 had \u201csexed up\u201d Saddam\u2019s capacity to strike foreign countries with WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) \u201cwithin forty-five minutes\u201d, when, it transpires, there was clearly no such capacity.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
