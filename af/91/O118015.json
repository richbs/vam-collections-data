There were very few crosses worn in Norway between the late sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, apart from the crucifixes traditionally worn by bridegrooms on their wedding day, and the tiny pendent Maltese crosses hung from other kinds of jewellery.  In Sweden crosses are much more common, but they are very different in design.  \n\nThis cross may have come from outside the Scandinavian area, or it may have formed part of some other kind of jewellery, such as a chain or belt.  The little pendants, which are common in Nordic jewellery of all kinds, may have been added.",
