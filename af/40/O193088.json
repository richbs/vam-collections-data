This poster was disseminated during the 1990 elections when The Free Exchange Party won one seat in the Chamber of Deputies. The name of the Party was inspired by a well-known comedy by the Romanian writer I.L. Caragiale, whose portrait appears on the poster within the Party logo. The headline of the poster 'Everyone votes for a smile and a flower' is a satirical reference to the spirit of the play. After 1996, when the electoral law changed and each party was required to have at least 10,000 members to be eligible to stand for Parliament, The Free Exchange Party was disbanded. The elections in 1990 were the first democratic elections in Romania following the overthrow of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.",
