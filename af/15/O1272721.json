The work is also named at the end as the <i>Trailokya dipi</i>, which is more usually applied to the<i> Sangrahani Sutra</i> of Jinabhadragani Kshamashramana, the earliest work of this class. The work is accompanied by an interlinear text in smaller devanagari script, which is possibly the commentary of Devabhadra. This manuscript is written on 56 oblong folios of paper of which two folios (10a and 12a) are not numbered, the last numbered folio being 54. The outer folios are of double thickness and decorated with a central ogee medallion and floral motifs on their outer faces. The copy is undated but appears to have been written and illustrated in Western India during the 18th century. This folio (16) verso is illustrated with diagrams of the positions of celestial bodies.",
