While the present terracotta may be connected with this commission, it should be noted that Vasari describes the marble as having more than one fish. The children are in any case related closely to Pierino's bronze boys on the perimeter of the basin of the Fountain of Hercules at Castello.\n\nPiero da Vinci (1531-1554) was an Italian sculptor, nephew of Leonardo da Vinci and one of the most gifted Florentien sculptors of the time.\nHis short life was characteriszed by a promising career as sculptor. He began as an apprentice at Baccio Bandinelli's workshop when he was just 12 and was shortly afterwards transferred to the workshop of Niccolo Tribolo. His first works, a series of putti to be dated after 1544 were so similar in style to Tribolo's so to frequently cause misattributions. With Tribolo he also collaborated at the Fountains at Castello.",
