He restricted himself to Vaishnavite (referring to the Hindu god Vishnu) and literary themes, evolving a mannered style in which languid, elongated figures generally appear against simple backgrounds with trees and shrubs. In this scene influences from the paintings at Ajanta and Far Eastern techniques are evident.",

He was one of the early students of Abanindranath Tagore, the leading artist and exponent of the school. \n\nDuring his childhood, Kshitindranath was raised in a rural environment and therefore received no formal education. Unlike most of his school colleagues, Kshitindranath did not reach out to the past or distant lands to increase his personal artistic repertoire but gained most of his knowledge from village plays known as Jatra and Kirtan, devotional hymns performed by indigenous religious communities. Adhering to Abanindranath\u2019s patriotic commitment, Kshitindranath retrieved themes from the Hindu epic past and reworked them in a highly romanticised style. \n\nThe artist\u2019s adoption of the wash technique was later superseded by his choice of tempera. His hazy and suggestive scenes therefore, gave way to clearly articulated spaces. In 1921, Kshitindranath was appointed Principal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta and from 1942-64 he became Principal of the Art Department at Allahabad University. The artist\u2019s work has been exhibited internationally.",
