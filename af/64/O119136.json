Like notes of music, it could act as the point of departure for a parallel psychological or emotional state in the viewer. There is no fixed reading as to what the image may mean.

She determined that a photograph  had to be mounted to be considered for the key set because she knew that for Stieglitz a photograph was not completed until it was mounted and that this was evidence that he was satisfied with the print. Duplicate mounted prints were than dispersed to 13 others museums.\nHowever, there were a number of photographs in Stieglitz\u2019s possession when he died that were not mounted. Some of these were very poor quality prints, and these have now been put into a study collection that will be given to the NGA. Others, however, were quality  good, often excellent prints that had not been spotted, and these are the works that the O\u2019Keeffe Foundation is now dispersing.\nBefore these photographs were sent to any institutions, the O\u2019Keeffe Foundation, wisely, decided that they should be conserved (this was pretty consolidation). And they determined that the photographs should be mounted on boards of similar colour and texture and identical size to the comparable prints in the key set.\nStieglitz was adamant about his mounting: the size, colour, texture, and placement of the photograph on the board were critical issues to him . To be true to the spirit of the gift, you should try, at all costs, to preserve the sizes of Stieglitz\u2019s mounts, even though you will end up with some odd-sized frames.\n(Correspondence Sarah Greenough with Mark Haworth-Booth, June 2003)",
