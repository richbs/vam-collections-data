            "public_access_description": "The decoration is scratched through a surface coating of white slip, laid over the darker clay body of the earthenware. In this manner, the decoration stands out as dark lines on a pale background. The decoration is then highlighted with metallic oxides to produce the green and brownish-yellow colours. Finally, the dish is covered with a transparent lead glaze and then fired again in the kiln. It is at this point that the painted coloured oxides would run in the glaze causing the variegated effect you see here.\n\nIncised slipware was a predominantly northern Italian tradition. The abundant, dark-red local clay was used to optimum decorative advantage, when contrasted with fine white clay which could be obtained from Vicenza. Two notable centres of production were Bologna and Ferrara, where the court demanded wares of the highest quality.\n\nLarge dishes like this were used for bringing food to the table and serving, as well as for display. Contemporary illustrations, show servants carrying large dishes covered by a second dish, which served as a cover to keep the food hot.",
