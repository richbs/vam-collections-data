It was founded in 1953 by two former employees of Murray's Cabaret Club, Helen Archer and her husband, Jimmy O'Brien.  On a tiny stage, barely twelve feet square, they presented some of the most imaginative and inventive floor shows ever seen in London.  The designer for the shows was another former Murray's employee, Ronald Cobb.  Working in conjunction with Helen Archer, he designed and supervised the making of hundreds of costumes which illustrated and symbolised the selected songs and were deliberately designed to be as complex as possible, so that regular clients saw new 'points' each time they visited. This headdress was used in a number called 'If you could read my mind', in an Old Time Movie sequence. Associated production: Director and choreographer: Helen Archer. Eve, London. Performance category: Cabaret.  Cabaret costumes and designs given by Helen and Jimmy O'Brien: S.694:1 to S.736-1996.",
