It received its premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, on 18 May 1917. This drawing was probably made by White when the ballet was first performed in London in 1919. \n\nThe drawings by Ethelbert White were commissioned by the bookseller and publisher Cyril Beaumont and appear to have be intended as possible illustrations for a small book in the Impressions of the Russian Ballet series. Beaumont published twelve volumes documenting eleven ballets between 1918 and 1922.",
