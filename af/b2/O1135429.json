The doll is produced by Mattel, Inc and invented by Ruth Handler, whose own daughter was called Barbara. In recent years, however, Barbie has faced increasing competition from the Bratz range of dolls. This doll was produced in 2003 in Indonesia by Mattel. \n\nThis object was acquired in 2007, donated to the Museum from the BBC, who made a programme on Barbie for their Money Week special. The doll Ken, belongs to the California Girl range of Barbie which was launched to appeal to older girls; those who are getting too old for the fantasy Barbie themes such as Barbie Fairytopia.",
