A milliner also sits at the table and hands her a hat to try on. The milliner's apprentice stands behind her holdind a box. Harriet is being served a glass of wine by a black female servant whose apron is torn. A soldier also sits at the table drinking and smoking a pipe and another sailor sits near to the door in the right corner stroking a young girl on her chin. \n\nThe room is moderately furnished with a bed with curtain and bent curtain rail, carpet, two tables, plain mirror, and chairs. On the wall are two large paintings, one a scene of ruins, another a naval battle. Also on the wall is a printed ballad pinned next to the door-frame with an illustration of a ship below which is the title Man of Fashion and the ballad. Through the open doorway is a landing and window, through which can be seen ships' masts suggesting a ocation near to docks.",
