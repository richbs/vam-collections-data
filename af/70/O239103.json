It is in series with No. 273, and the reasons given in thw note on that drawing help to establish the probability that this also was made at Brighton.\n\nNos. 256, 257, 259, 260, 261 and 262 all come from the same skecth-book, measuring approximately 181x262 mm. (about 7 1/8 x 10 1/4 ins.) and used by Constable both on his summer visit tyo Salisbury and Gilingham and his autum visit to Coleorton. The height of the pages tapers from 178mm. at the outer edge to 181 mm. at the hinge edge. Nos. 273 an 274, and possibly also Nos. 275-278, come from the same sketch-book, and show that he used it at Brighton, probably on his first visit in 1824; for their possible connection with a projected group of engravings, see also the note following No. 284.\n\nNo. 279 may be definitely identified as a scene at Brighton, it follows that the other beach scenes represent places in that neighbourhood and that the drawings were made in 1824 or subsequent years. Similar drawings dated from Brighton on 1and 13 September 1824, and from Worthing on 22 September 1824, were in the collection of Capt. Charles Constable. Constable tells Fisher in his letter of 17 December 1824 that Arrowsmith the French dealer has engaged him to make twelve drawings to be engraved by S. W. Reynolds in London and published in Paris from one of his sketch-books of Brighton. The plates were to be of the same size as the drawings, about 10 or 12 ins. He describes the sketch-book itself- \"This book is larger than my others-and does not contain odds, and ends (I wish it did), but all complete compositions-all of boats, or beach scenes-and there may be about 30 of them\" (<u>Beckett,</u> VI, p. 184). This letter might refer to Nos. 273-277 (and perhaps No. 278 ); alternatively, some of the sketches Nos. 279-284may be connected with Arrowsmith's scheme. As far as is known the engravings were not made (S.: L., pp. 2, 3). \n\nGraham Reynolds\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"",
