Brambilla\u2020, painted by Marziano da Tortona (see reproduction<i> loc cit</i>.);\n(3) 61 cards (17x7 cm), painted by Antonio di Cicognara for Cardinal Ascanio Sforza in 1484, 35 of the cards belonging (in 1903) to Count Colleoni\u2021 (see reproduction <i>loc. cit.</i>) and 26 to the Carrara Gallery, Bergamo (see reproduction, <i>loc. cit.</i>)\n\nSome years, prior to 1915, Colonel Croft Lyons bought in Milan the 4 cards (presumably made for one of the Colleoni family) catalogued above. The Knave of Coins belonging to these cards, being almost identical with the corresponding card in the Sforza pack, the Museum cards may justifiably be attributed to Antonio di Cicognara, to whom might also be attributed 4 cards (13.5 x 7 cm) (Sportsman, Ace of Swords, Pluto's Castle, Fountain)\u00a7 belonging to the Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards, the Pluto's Castle of these cards being of the same design (in reverse) as the corresponding card in the Sforza pack.\n\nPhotographs of cards belonging to the Brambilla and Sforza packs, may be seen in the Library of this Museum.\n______________________________\n\n* Signor Brambilla states that the size of his cards is 18 x 9 cm. (and not 17 x 7 cm, as stated by Count Parravicino).\n\u2020 Exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1914-5\n\u2021 These cards passed into the hands of Mr J. Pierpoint Morgan, who lent them to the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1910 to 1912.\n\u00a7 Shown at the Exhibition of Works of Art belonging to the Livery Companies of the City of London, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1926.'",
