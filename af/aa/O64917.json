The design was executed for a production of George Bernard Shaw's play \"The Philanderer\" performed at the Arts Theatre, April 6th 1944.  The production was produced by Henry Cass.\n\nHistorical significance: This design was executed for a production by the actor/producer Alec Clunes, whose greatest achievement was his direction of eight seasons of plays at the Arts Theatre during a period when money and actors were scarce and scenery hard to get.  He introduced an ambitious and intellectually demanding repertory of unearthed English classics and promoted the staging of foreign plays, as an alternative to the usual West End fare of \"leg shows\" and average drawing room pieces, which earned him the status, according to one critic of \"pocket national theatre\". \nLeela Meinertas, 1990.",
