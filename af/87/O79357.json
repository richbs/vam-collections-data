Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nThis distinctive bracelet (the word suar simply means bracelet in Arabic) formed part of the traditional costume of the Ouled Na\u0457l.  The young women of this tribe traditionally earnt their dowries as \u2018dancers\u2019 in the cities, and this colourful practice fascinated Victorian travellers.  Many 19th-century photos and pictures of Algerian women are of the Ouled Na\u0457l, who may have been the only women whom European men could meet freely.  The whole ensemble of Ouled Na\u0457l jewellery was richer than for most other tribes, but the bracelet was the most important element, and the only piece that was unique to that costume.",
