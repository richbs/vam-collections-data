He made eight more crossings that summer, adding difficulties including crossing blindfold, at night, on stilts, on a bicycle, with his feet tied up in baskets, carrying people on his back, or in a wheelbarrow like this, especially made with a grooved wheel to stay on the rope.  In 1860 he performed several more crossings at Niagara, including one before the Prince of Wales who declined his offer of carrying him across the Falls. Blondin died in London in 1879 at his house in Ealing which he renamed Niagara.\n\nA sale of Blondin's effects in London after his death in 1897 included two wheelbarrows and two bicycles used for his high wire crossings.  One of each is now in the Niagara Falls Museum, having been given by the son of an antique shop owner who discovered them in his cellar in 1959.  This wheelbarrow came from another London sale in 1923, so it is evident that Blondin had several made as essential properties for his act.",

It was purchased by The Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine who transferred it to the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood in about 1982 believing it to be a child's toy, the original label having been lost.  In 1985 its identification was discovered by Georgina Russell of the Wellcome Institute, and the object was transferred from the Museum of Childhood to the Theatre Collections.\n\nTwo of Blondin's bicyles, and two similar wheelbarrows, were bought by a Mr. Miller in a sale of Blondin's effects in 1897, the year of his death.  In 1959 they were found in the cellar of Mr. Miller's antique shop by his son Jack  who offered them to Mr. F.J.G. Blondin who lived in Ealing.  According to a report in <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> 25 August 1959, he was considering offering one to Niagara Museum which contained 'relics of people who had performed feats at the Falls'.
