            "physical_description": "The horse is of composition covered with brown flock marked slightly with black rings. The tail and hooves are not covered and are painted black; the mane is a black stripe on the face and down the neck. Glued to the head and neck are strips of red leathercloth representing the bridle and martingale. On the back are nailed brown leathercloth and green felt representing the saddle and its cloth. The horse's eyes are brown and yellow glass beads; glued on; and the ears are brown flock paper; slightly damaged. The horse is in an outstretched galloping position mounted on the metal frame of the clockwork by two rods with the figure control rod passing through the centre of the body. The figure has a celluloid head representing a boy with blond curly hair - probably made by Rheinische Gummi und Celluloid Fabrik. The hands and feet are moulded composition; with the feet representing black boots. Parts of the rest of the body are composition together with some metal inner supports. The figure is dressed as a Hussar in a red felt tunic and round cap and dark blue twill trousers with white trimmed. The tunic and cap are decorated with grey metallic paper. The cap is also trimmed with black felt and it is nailed to the head. The figure is mounted on the back of the horse supported by a control rod worked by the mechanism. The clockwork mechanism is a simple spring with a built-in key. It is housed in a triangular green metal fitting on two large rear wheels and one\nsmall front wheel. When operated the whole moves forward and the rider moves up and down on the horse's back.",
