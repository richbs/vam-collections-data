It was worn by the nomadic tribes of Central Asia, in the present region of Turkmenistan and parts of northern Iran and Afghanistan.  Although individual pieces rarely date from any earlier than the 19th century, many of the designs and symbols used are much older, often pre-Islamic in origin.  \n\nThese earrings show many of the main characteristics of Turkoman jewellery, with their clean outline of pierced sheet silver, decorated only with applied wire and flat-cut cornelians, and numerous chain pendants ending in lozenges of sheet silver.\n\nThey were acquired in Turkestan in 1884-5, during an Anglo-Russian conference to define the north-west frontier of Afghanistan, and were given to the Museum in 1900.",
