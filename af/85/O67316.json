A bronze depicting Duncan's horses devouring one another, from Macbeth, a marble figure of Titania from A Midsummer Night's Dream, and a marble figure of Jaques from As You Like It are also in the Museum's collections. In early July 1847 Lough opened his studio to exhibit several of his Shakespearian sculptures. According to a report in the Literary Gazette of the exhibition, Puck 'is truly the merriest and most mischievous of sprites. His head is young in form, but old in frolic, and cunning, and archness. That fellow cannot move without a trick; and how he stands, the mushroom Colossus, not of Rhodes, but of a hundred ways to fun and knavery. He is the quintessence of shrewdness and selfish whimsicality. It is a happy performance, and the true representative of all we fancy in our fairy love.'",
