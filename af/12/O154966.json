In 1965 he became Head of its Theatre Design Department, a post which he held until 1972. Koltai has designed sets and costumes for over 250 productions in theatres and opera houses around the world. He began his career designing for the London Opera Club in 1950 and has worked for all the major British theatre, opera and ballet companies. Koltai believes in the importance of finding a theatrical concept and his settings become a metaphor for the work being staged. This does not mean that his designs are always abstract: his 1978 Love's Labour's Lost for the Royal Shakespeare Company took place in a realistic autumnal parkland which captured the elegiac mood of the production. However Koltai is best known for creating settings which have a strong sculptural quality and use contemporary materials. Metals, plastics and reflective surfaces feature in his work. \n\nKoltai dates his interest in reflective material to his designs for the National Theatre's all-male As You Like It in 1967. He interpreted the play as a romantic dream and created a setting which implied the location instead of creating it realistically. The trees in Koltai's white Forest of Arden were made of clear perspex rods with hanging cut-out panels suggesting leafy branches. When lit from above the 'tree trunks' reflected the light and the panels threw dappled patterns on the white stage floor.",
