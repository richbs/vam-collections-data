Her two eldest daughters are shown seated in the family home, one reading and the other sewing. On the wall above the fireplace is an array of framed etchings by Francis Seymour Haden. Haden was the family physician and was also related to the painter James McNeill Whistler. He based a number of etchings on photographs by Hawarden. Above the group of framed pictures is a photograph by Oscar Rejlander, \u2018After Raphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna\u2019. In it, two children re-enact the composition of Raphael\u2019s famous painting of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child, which is now in Dresden.\n\nRejlander wrote an obituary of Hawarden after her death in 1864. His pioneering creative work during the 1850s is likely to have encouraged Hawarden\u2019s own experiments. The photograph documents a domestic moment but also records significant aspects of Hawarden\u2019s artistic environment. Viewed through a stereoscope, this stereograph would have yielded clear and detailed images of the pictures on the wall.",

The Golden Age of British Photography (travelli exhibition), victoria and Albert Museum, 1984-8 \u2022 This photograph provides evidence of the Haden\u00adHawarden association at a crucial early stage in his career as an etcher. [See article cited above for full discussion.] The inclusion of the Rejlander photograph, which was shown at the 1857 Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, is an indication of Lady Hawarden's admiration for him. Rejlander was considered the pre-eminent art photographer; indeed, he had practically invented the genre. In his work, Rejlander--like Lady Hawarden--conflated the categories of portraiture and studies from life. There are similarities between Lady Hawarden's and Rejlander's styles, particularly in the sensitive approach to photographing children. Rejlander was considered the master of composition and of light, two qualities also admired in Lady Hawarden's photographs. However, although Rejlander wrote an appreciate obituary of Lady Hawarden 0. G. Rejlander, 'In Memoriam', British Journal of Photography, 10:38 (27 January 1865)], there is no other documentation of their association, nor any indication of the ways in which they may have influenced each other.However, although Rejlander wrote an appreciate obituary of Lady Hawarden [0.
