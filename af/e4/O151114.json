During the 1850s there was great interest in the type of French faience known as 'Henri Deux' or 'Saint Porchaire'. The intricate decoration, combining painting and inlaid clays, was seen as a technological challenge for Victorian ceramic firms keen to revive tradtional and 'lost' techniques. L\u00e9on Arnoux, Art Director at Minton's, and a designer and chemist, succeeded in reproducing the 'Henri Deux' process in 1858. A group of 'Henri Deux' wares was shown, to great acclaim, at the London International Exhibition of 1862, from which this ewer was purchased by the South Kensington museum (later the V&A). This ewer is a copy of an original French renaissance piece. Very few pieces using this expensive inlaid technique were made.\n\nMany nineteenth-century European designers and craftspeople were greatly inspired by other cultures and historical periods. This ranged from exact copies of existing objects to eclectic designs catering to contemporary taste. Leading commercial manufacturers, such as Minton's, became strongly associated with historicist styles, producing high-quality wares for an international market.",
