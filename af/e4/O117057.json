The bezel is set with a pink sapphire and the shoulders were originally brightly enamelled in red, white and black. \nSapphires and rubies are both varieties of the gem mineral corundum. The rich red colour of rubies is created by the presence of chromium whilst sapphires may be found in a range of colours from colourless natural corundum to yellows, pinks, greens and the most highly prized blues. The term 'ruby' was frequently used to describe a number of red gem stones including garnets, spinels and possibly pink sapphires.\nMany stones had talismanic or magical qualities.  Rubies were believed to protect their wearer from all perils including the loss of land and rank and were valued for this power as well as for their beauty. It is possible that the original owner of this ring believed the stone to be the highly prized ruby rather than a sapphire.",

Raised box bezels were complemented by elaborately chased and enamelled shoulders, the colours chosen to enhance the stone. \nCabochon settings remained in use but developments in stone cutting saw the increasing use of table cuts, especially for diamonds and rubies. \nThe term 'ruby' in the Medieval and Renaissance periods encompassed a number of red stones, including garnets, spinels (known as 'balas' rubies and possibly pink sapphires. Both sapphires and rubies are varieties of the gem mineral corundum, the hardest gemstone after diamond. Sapphire describes any variety of corundum, excluding rubies which take their rich red colour from the presence of chromium. Sapphires may be found in a range of colours ranging from colourless pure corundum to yellows, oranges, pinks, greens and the characteristic blues. Varying amounts and combinations of chromium, titanium and iron cause these colour variations.\nRubies were highly valued in the Renaissance period for their talismanic qualities as well as their colour, which could be improved and flaws disguised by the skilful use of coloured foils behind the stone.",
