The quality of the sand and soil in Thuringia lent itself to the production of high-quality porcelain and the earliest factory in Volkstedt produced a wide variety of wares, including over 90 different types of figurines that they advertised in their calatogue of 1795.\n\nThis was part of the collection of theatrical ceramics of the actor Robert Eddison (1908-1991) but it is unlikely that it represents any specific performer.  It simply appears to be a decorative and charming ornament, and possibly quite revealing in its time since the demurely dressed girl is lifting her skirts to show a pair of shapely ankles.",
