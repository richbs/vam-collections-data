The scrolled elements are collared to each other and to slender vertical bars which terminate in an open circlet. The collars used within each panel are small and neat with a circular cross section., while those attaching the panels to the main frame are crude and roughly clasped, indicating that the panels have been reassembled in their present frame.

Bought by the Duke de Moro, then bought by the Victoria & Albert Museum. in 1896.\n\nA sketch of the screen as it stood in 1872 may be seen in the Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects for 1891, but no representation of it before the collapse of the tower in 1861 has been published.\n\nHistorical significance: The screen is an extremely rare survivor. The destruction of medieval church grilles in England has been almost complete, no examples remain in the Cathedrals of York, Durham ,Chester Peterborough, Ripon, Lichfield, Norwich, Worcester, Hereford, Gloucester, Exeter, Manchester, Bristol, Carlisle nor any of the great abbeys or churches. A fragment shows that St Albans once possessed such a grille-work and the grilles to St Anselm's chapel in Canterbury are survivors of a type. \n\nThis grille is an early type remarkable for an absence of symmetrical arrangement.
