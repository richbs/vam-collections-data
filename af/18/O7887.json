Such mirrors were often hung at the end of a room to reflect the entire of the interior.\n\nTime\nThomas Sheraton's entry for 'mirrors' in his Cabinet Dictionary (1803) describes only convex mirrors , which indicates their enormous popularity at the beginning of the 19th century.  He noted that 'the perspective of the room in which they are suspended presents itself in the surface of the mirror, and produces an agreeable effect'. As a result of this, as well as their 'convenience of holding lights, they are now becoming universally in fashion and are considered both as a useful and ornamental piece of furniture'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBy about 1795 the Ravenhead works at St Helen's, Lancashire, of the British Cast Plate Glass Manufacturers had mastered the technological difficulties of making large convex mirror glass. Convex mirrors had been produced in England previously, but on a much smaller scale for items such as shaving mirrors.",
