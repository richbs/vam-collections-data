Despite its expense, tea became a fashionable and popular drink. It was customary for it to be served by the lady of the house at tea table in the drawing room using an elegant silver or porcelain tea set.\n\nTime\nTea kettles, used to heat the water for infusing or refreshing the tea leaves in the pot, began to become popular in the early 18th century. The arrival of the tea-urn in the 1760s (made in both silver and Sheffield plate) caused a general displacement of the kettle, but it returned to favour with the discovery in the 19th century of camphorine, an odourless and inexpensive fuel compared to spirits of wine formerly used for burners that kept the water in kettles hot.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe body of the kettle is engraved with an unidentified armorial. Engraving on Sheffield plate presented difficulties because the tool could cut through the upper surface of the laminate, exposing the copper core beneath. At first the silver surface was sufficiently thick for an experienced workman to engrave the surface without cutting through to the copper beneath. Then sterling silver discs were soldered or 'let in' to a cut-out section of the Sheffield plate. After about 1800, the plating thickness of the silver surface of Sheffield plate became progressively thinner and another method of letting in was adopted. A piece of pure silver of a very fine gauge was placed over the area to be engraved, the metal was heated to a dull red until the silver section adhered to the surface, whereupon it was hammered and burnished until the silver foil had literally been forced into the plated surface.",
