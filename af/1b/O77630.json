These popular cups were also made in red and brown stoneware as well as soft delftware - a material quite unsuited to hot drinks. But soon tough Chinese porcelain versions became available.\n\nTime\nThe last quarter of the 17th century saw a great flowering of both the arts and the sciences, often combined together in talented individuals such as the prolific artist and engraver Francis Place. His independent discovery of the process of making salt-glazed stoneware in the 1690s, though not used commercially, was a significant achievement.\n\nHistorical Associations\nAfter Francis Place's death, his experimental marbled stoneware capuchine and its box were exhibited at Ralph Thoresby's Museum in Leeds. Established as an interesting curio associated with a famous artist, it was then purchased by Horace Walpole for his collection at Strawberry Hill, and later acquired by Augustus Wollaton Franks (the great Director and benefactor of the British Museum) who donated it in 1869 to the Museum of Practical Geology. In 1901, the Museum of Practical Geology's collections were transferred to the V&A.",
