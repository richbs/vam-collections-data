Despite basic differences of intention between his printmaking and his sculpture, there are similarities too, in the use of curvilinear forms that appear to float in space. It is possible that Gabo may have used small pieces of plastic, cut for a model of a sculpture for the US Rubber Company Building, New York, 1956, as templates for this print. He never editioned his prints; there are 31 known impressions of Opus 6. He preferred to print his relief blocks by hand rather than on a press, thus encouraging accidental effects of tone and texture to occur.",
