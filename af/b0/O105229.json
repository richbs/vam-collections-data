There are several patterned patches where a design of roundels, swastikas, floral trails and other motifs have been created by an open gauze weave. The skirt is double layered with an asymmetric hem. The waistband has two ties, one longer than the other. At one end of the waistband is a sewn-on seal printed in red on a piece of gauze fabric.\n\nThe skirt is made of pastel coloured silk gauze, some of which are patterned. It is entirely made of patchwork pieces sewn together using a Korean technique called <i>gekki</i>, where the pieces are sewn together encasing the ends in a sealed flat seam. On this piece the artist also uses her own new technique, whereby a section of seam extends into loose sewing threads. The stitching was made using a machine.",

The textile artist Chung-Hie Lee, born in 1945, has used patchwork extensively in creating garments. The skirt is made of pastel-coloured silk pieces and its design refers to pre-modern clothing for Korean women. Before the 20th century, indoor wear in Korea consisted of a short jacket combined with a full skirt wrapped around the body and tied below the breasts. Chung-Hie Lee's skirt is assymetrical in design, and produces a contemporary effect while referring to earlier styles of dress.",
