One reprsents the bust of a woman, three-wuarters to left, with halo, wearing a jewelled diadem, necklace and earrings; she holds a floral garland (?) in her right hand.  The other also has the bust of a woman, full-face, with halo, wearing a jewelled diadem and earrings; in her left hand she holds a stalk of wheat.  Each panel has a border of flowers, buds, seed-capsules and leaves of the lotus plant, amid which are swimming fishes.  Outer crested edging.\nThese two figures may possibly symbolse Spring and Summer (cf. the figures of the Seasons on a carved pilaster of Roman Imperial times in the crypt of St. Peter's in Rome.  The influence of Byzantine tradition may be traced in these two panels. the lotus-border seems good evidence of Egyptian origin.",
