These leaves would probably have been used to make wreaths, such as worn for Roman feasts, or simply to trim and decorate costumes or headdresses.  \n\nMessel was always been creative in his use of materials, although here the leaves follow more traditional techniques used in artificial flower making rather than the bolder approach he used for theatre.  In the 1920s, even into the 1950s, flower trims or corsages - sprays of flowers and leaves worn on a coat lapel or the shoulder of an evening dress - were fashionable and Messel probably had stocks of many different materials ready for assembling as required, whether for theatre or for the dresses he often made for costume balls.  \n \nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

However, a viewing of the film confirms that no such leaves appear made up into wreaths or as costume decoration, nor is there any obvious scene in which it might have been used.  They are as likely to be from Messel's general stock, although they are more in the style of fashion accessory than theatrical.   \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs would have been sold or given away during the artist's lifetime).  The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981.  The Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.\n\nHistorical significance: While many completed costumes and accessories survive, various 'parts' used in their making do not, and it is rare to have the evidence of an accessory 'in progress'.",
