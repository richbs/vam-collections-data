It commemorates the Opening of Crystal Palace, Sydenham 1854.\nAfter its removal from Hyde Park, the great glass building was recreated at Sydenham. It was enlarged, divided into courts and a barrel roof added. There was also additionally a concert hall and menageries. The Queen opened the building on 10 June 1854 in the presence of some 40,000 people.\n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe roundel was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
