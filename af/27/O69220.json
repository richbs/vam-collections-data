However, much of the glass designed for religious settings was removed from its original location and dispersed. A great deal was destroyed in the religious conflicts during the period 1500-1700 and, like this piece, only survives in a fragmentary state. \n\nThis example depicts the letter \u2018D\u2019 and probably formed part of an inscription. It is coloured yellow and thus illustrates a technique of decorating glass that developed in the early part of the 14th century. It consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass which, after firing in a kiln, turned yellow and sank into the clear glass. Many panels from that period and for centuries later are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment, as shown here.",
