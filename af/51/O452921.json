It was made in Bidar, in the Deccan, shortly before its acquisition, and is an example of the metal technique thought to have originated in that city and from which it takes its name. Bidri ware describes objects made from a zinc alloy and decorated with silver. The final stage of the manufacturing process involves covering the entire object with a mud paste: when removed shortly afterwards, the dull grey of the alloy has been changed to a matt black but the silver remains unchanged.",
