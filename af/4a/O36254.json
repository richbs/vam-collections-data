The whole is lithographed to represent a white; circus performing type decorated with grey; red and yellow. The back legs and tail support the horse and the mechanism is housed in the body. The front legs and head are separately attached and move when the whole is wound up. The key bar protrudes from the left body. When wound; the horse vibrates slightly and moves in a circle. There is a weight attached to the mechanism which controls the movement and it can be seen at the base of the body. \n*It is not marked; but it is thought to have been made by Arnold of Nuremberg; probably between the wars.
