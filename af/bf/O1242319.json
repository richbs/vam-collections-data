This collection of samples includes 10 different designs (in multiple colourways) plus samples from two non-repeating panel decorations (\u2018Trompe L\u2019Oeil Drape\u2019 and \u2018Union Jack\u2019 ). The patterns include the distinctive \u2018Squiggle\u2019 design, which has become Westwood\u2019s trademark motif, used on pirate shirts, bags, boots etc as well as rugs and wallpaper. Many of the other designs are based on textile patterns and motifs, including lace, tartan, and tweed. The V&A holds many couture fashion items designed by Westwood; the wallpapers complement these holdings, and represent the latest example in a long tradition of Cole & Son working with artists and designers from other fields to produce wallpaper collections.",
