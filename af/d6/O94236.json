The inset has a brown satin tongue surmounted by a large beaded round appliqu\u00e9.\n\nThe 1920s produced the most exciting shoes of the 20th century, with a tremendous variety of cut, colour and ornamentation. During this period, fashion changed rapidly and shoemaking had to follow closely, producing a legion of styles. Most shoes were high-heeled, and some included tongues, such as this example. The prevalence of influences from East Asia in the early 1920s can be seen in the hand-painted bird, clearly inspired by Chinese motifs.",
