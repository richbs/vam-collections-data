            "physical_description": "A squat stemcup on a wide flaring foot, with a flaring rim. The shape resembles that of Tibetan butter lamps.\nThe decoration is in red and yellow painted lacquer on a black base, and consists of simple geometric patterns, rather crudely executed.\nOn the base is a paper hand-written label in Japanese, translated as: China, National Minority/ Lacquer vessel of the Yi Nationality/ Sichuan Province, Daliangshan . Also one seal in red, of professor Nagatoshi  Onishi (see provenance).\nPROVENANCE: Given to Mrs Hutt, Assistant Curator in the Far Eastern Collection specializing in Japanese lacquer, by Professor Nagatoshi Onishi of the lacquer Department, Tokyo University of Fine Arts, in the course of a courier trip to Japan. Professor Onishi had recently acquired the cup in Sichuan province. \nDISCUSSION: The Yi (population 4,850,000 by the 1978 census) are one of the largest 'minority nationalities' of south-west China, with distinctive and still-vigorous cultural traits, including a script for the Yi language. Their distinctive painted lacquer tradition has been much discussed and praised in Chinese literature of the last ten years, part of the larger picture of appropriation of national minority styles and subjects by artists and craft workers of the Han majority in China.\n(cc 27/4/93)",
