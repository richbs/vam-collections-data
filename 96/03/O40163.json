The sitter Samuel Carter Hall was a writer and the editor of the Art Journal.\n\nThere is confusion over the date of birth for Burlowe (d. Rome 1837); Gunnis records a date of 1802, whereas the entry by Brockwell in Thieme-Becker suggests he was born in Dublin in about 1796. Burlowe was the younger brother of the sculptor William Behnes. Henry exhibited under the name of Burlowe to avoid confusion between the two. He exhibited busts at the Royal Academy in 1831 and 1833, and in 1834 travelled to Rome, where he was in demand as a portrait sculptor, until his death from cholera in 1837.",
