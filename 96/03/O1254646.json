Sketch by Valentine Gross dated 17 April 1958.\n\nDiaghilev Ballets Russes Les Sylphides, choreographed by Fokine and decor by Benois was first premiered in Paris at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet on 02 June1909, according to Diaghilev and The Golden Age of The Ballets Russes 1909 - 1929, edited by Jane Pritchard, first published by V&amp;A Publishing in 2010.\n\nThe sketches are part of the Valentine Gross Archive (THM/165), held by the V&amp;A Department of Theatre and Performance. Valentine Gross Archive contains research material and artwork, including sketches, studies, drawings, pastels and illustrations. Only the artwork materials have been catalogued with museum numbers and given item level descriptions found in the Search the Collections webpage. \n\nValentine Gross, a.k.a. Valentine Hugo, was a French art student in Paris in the 1910s. She became a ballet enthusiast, illustrator, researcher and painter. Valentine Gross witnessed annual seasons of Diaghilev Ballets Russes in Paris and made preminary sketches during performances and rehearsals between 1909 and 1914.  She later worked them up into pencil or coloured drawings of various degrees of finish including illustrations and paintings.\n\nSome of the sketches feature in the book Nijinsky on Stage by Richard Buckle, published in London by Studio Vista in 1971.",
