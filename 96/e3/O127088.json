Archer designed the monument himself, but commissioned the figures from Henry Cheere, who was one of the few native-born sculptors working in England at this period.\n\nCheere began his career as an apprentice mason, and had set up his own studio near St. Margaret's Westminster by 1726. Later Louis Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac (1702-1762) worked with him. \n\nSir Henry Cheere (1703-1781) was one of the most successful sculptors in  mid-18th-century Britain, and unlike some of his more eminent sculptor contemporaries, such as John Michael Rysbrack and Louis Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac, he was a native of this country. He specialised in portrait busts and tomb sculpture, and in the latter was particularly adept in the use of coloured marbles. He also employed a light, and yet at the same time highly-finished, style that was typical of the Rococo.",
