A.506-1910), but not sufficiently similar to allow an attribution to this artist. Hermann Mau\u00e9 notes that the initials, 'CWL a K,' denote a member of the family L\u00f6ffelholz von Colberg (Kolberg) in Nuremberg and that 'CW' probably stands for Christoph Wilhelm (1692-1769) who could have owned this medal. A number of members of this family were depicted on medals during the 16th century, and it is possible that the young man depicted in this medal was also a L\u00f6ffelholz. Given the provenance of the work, an attribution to Nuremberg is certainly possible. Yet since this medal is of wood, and would appear on the basis of its style to date from about 1525-30, it would be an exceptional work if from Nuremberg. The leading Nuremberg medalist at that time, Matthes Gebel, used stone for his models, wheras those working in Augsburg, such as Weiditz and Hagenauer, were using wood.\n\nThe function of this medal is also uncertain. It may have been the model for a medal, although no medals after it are known. The holes drilled through the top and bottom suggest it was hung up for display, as a small-scale piece of sculpture in its own right.",
