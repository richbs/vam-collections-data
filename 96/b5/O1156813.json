World War II was still in progress in February 1945 and this featured the 'Stars of the Forces' Joe Graves and Charlie Robins in the 'NAAFI Canteen', with a variety of other performers including 'the ever popular' Arthur Astill & Gwen Fontaine 'in Mimicry and Mirth'. One of their later acts, which they may have performed at Gateshead, was entitled 'Impressions of Country Life' and included mimicry of birds, animals and children. Arthur Astill started his career as 'the Whistling Ploughboy', which was his billing at the Blackpool Palace Theatre on 24 June 1912. \n\nThis hanging card was part of a collection made by Arthur Astill (1887-1962) of advertisements from theatres where he and his wife Gwen Fontaine appeared. It is typical of the format of two-colour printing used in the 1940s to advertise Variety, with the names of the most popular stars literally appearing at the 'top of the bill'. The names of Astill and Fontaine are at the bottom of this bill.",
