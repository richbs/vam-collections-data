Apprenticed in Glasgow to the landscape painter John Knox (1778-1845, pupil of Andrew Nasmyth) c1819-23. Worked successively as a lithographer, a painter of snuff-boxes at Cumnock, in the studio of the engraver William Lazars at Edinburgh 1825, and studied with Sir William Allan at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh. Exhibited regularly at the RSA from 1825, also 100 works at the RA between 1832 and 1881. Painted principally portraits of an official nature. Elected Member of the RSA 1830, President 1876. President of West of Scotland Academy 1866-76. Knighted 1876. Died Edinburgh 17 January 1882.\nLIT: Athenaeum 28 January 1882, p132 (obit); Art }ournal 1882, p63 \n\nPortrait of Andrew Ure, MD, FRS\n421-1869 Neg R1428 \nCanvas, 90.1\u00d7 69.2 cm (35 \u00bd \u00d7 27 \u00bc ins) \nGiven by Mrs Katherine Mackinlay 1869 \nMacnee exhibited a portrait of Andrew Ure at the RSA in 1828 (159), possibly the present work; the sitter would have been about 50 years old. However, he also exhibited a portrait of 'Dr R F Ure, FRS etc' at the RA in \n1849 (17), the initials probably a misprint in the catalogue, and this presumably would have shown the sitter at the age of about 71. This is more likely the present portrait; a stipple and line engraving by C Cook after a photograph of Ure by W H Diamond of about 1850 (repr Walker II, no 1277) shows the sitter with similar grey hair, tie, coat and brocade waistcoat. \nAndrew Ure (1778-1857) was a Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow, famous for establishing a course of popular scientific lectures for working men - probably the first of their kind - and for several publications including his Dictionary of Chemistry (1821). He was elected FRS in 1822, and was a member of other learned Societies; he moved to London in 1830 where he was an analytical and commercial chemist. \nThe fullest published iconography of Ure is in Walker; there is a watercolour by an unknown artist of about 1820 in the NPG. Another portrait, of 1836, by Macnee of Ure was in the possession of Ure's great great-grandson in 1969 (repr Country Life 9 January 1969, p84); the pose is in reverse to that in the present work, and the sitter has dark hair and a different necktie. \nEXH: ?RA 1849 (17) \nLIT: \tR Walker Regency Portraits 1985, I, p515 \n\nRonald Parkinson.\"",
