After each player has drawn once, the Game is to be continued in the same manner, passing the bag round, till some one makes up the exact number 151, who wins the Game.\n7.  If a player go beyond No. 151, he must go as many back as he had exceeded it, and the lottery must continue till some one makes up the exact number.\n8.  If two players arrive at the same number, the one who arrived last must go back to his former number. \n9.  When a player is sent back to any place, he is not to read the description, or attend to the directions in italics, and when sent forward he is only to read the description and stop there till his turn to draw again.\n\nThere follows the EXPLANATION or Description of each of the stops with the additional rules:  Should  the game be considered too long, the Players may read only the words printed in italics..\n\nEdward Wallis was at Skinner Street until 1847 when the premises and business was taken over by J Passmore.\n\nThe details about Queen Victoria are missing from the booklet but there would be the same rules and the player who landed here cleanly would win the game.\n\nRules placement: booklet, E. 1781-1954",
