The complex mechanism is very characteristic of its maker, Charles Gretton. There is also a calendar mechanism, with a date aperture in the dial. The prominent silver mount on the top of the clock is pierced with scrolling foliage and bears the crest and cipher of Charles Bodville Robartes, 2nd Earl of Radnor (1685-1723).  The clock has undergone some restoration.\n\nPeople\nCharles Gretton was one of the best London clockmakers of the early 18th century.  He was apprenticed in 1662, became a member of the Clockmakers Company in 1672 and was Master of the Clockmakers' Company from 1700 to 1733.  He made watches, long-case clocks and bracket clocks, many like this example with complex repeating movements.",
