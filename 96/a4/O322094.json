It was often fitted with five courses of double strings, but the two bass courses on this example are single strings. It was either strummed with a plectrum or played with fingers. Anton Bachmann (1716 - 1800) was one of Berlin's leading makers and repairers of stringed instruments during the eighteenth century. The bell cittern had fallen out of fashion by 1769, the date on the instrument, and so Bachmann may possibly have been the repairer rather than the maker.",
