The ballet traces the events set in train when the sailor, William Targett, returns to his home village with Tulip, a negro girl he has married in a native ceremony; the prejudice they encounter leads to his death and Tulip sends their child away to be brought up in Africa.  \nThe design came to the Museum from Maude Lloyd, who was a close friend of Andr\u00e9e Howard.\n\nHistorical significance: \"The Sailor's Return\" was an example of dance drama, rather than pure ballet, and the second time that Howard had turned to David Garnett's novels as a source, the first being for one of her finest works, \"Lady into Fox\".  The role of Tulip provided Sally Gilmour with one of her finest roles.  \nHoward was one of a very few choreographers who also designed their own ballets.",
