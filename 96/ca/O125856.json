The house by moonlight; inscribed below by the artist in pencil <i> Oct 2d. 1814</i>.  The house in sunlight; inscribed below on left by the artist in pencil <i>3d Oct.</i>.\nPage from a sketch-book, mounted with an envelope in which it appears to have been kept by Miss Isabel Constable.  This page possibly comes from the sketch book No. 132, since the measurements and dates correspond.  If so, it was detached before it was received into the Museum\u2019s collections.\n\nThe house is seen from the drive, that is, from the opposite side to that shown in No. 102.  The back is inscribed in pencil <i>The House in which J.C. was born</i>.  A larger pencil drawing of the house, corresponding to the lower of these two drawings, was Lot 84 in the Gregory Sale, 20 July 1949.  It was inscribed <i>Oct 5. 1814 \u00bd past 8 i morning</i> and the measurements were 7 \u00bd x 11 7/8 ins.",
