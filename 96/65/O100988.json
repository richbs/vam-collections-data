These inscriptions cover almost all the surface, except for a large roundel at each end. The left-hand roundel is outlined with dog-tooth moulding and carved with the letters IHS between 2 flaged arches at top and bottom. The right-hand roundel is similarly outlined and carved with the date 1802 above further inscriptions. On the back, behind the IHS roundel are two small gouged recesses, one about 2 cm square, the other smaller and rectangular.  The board has been fitted with three modern mirror plates for display (2 top, 1 bottom).",

In Iceland, beds were built into the structure of the house, as in many rural communities throughout Europe. Bedboards were loose planks that could be placed across the entrance to the bed to keep bedclothes in place. For this reason, they only needed to be decorated on one face. They were often carved by members of the family, or as a present from a young man to his future wife. During the day, they were hung on the wall, to form part of the decoration of the house. In Iceland, the traditional carved motifs such as the lettering on this bedboard, continued in use until after 1850.  At that time such motifs were given a new lease of life by the Arts and Crafts movement, led by the enthusiasm of the British designer William Morris for Icelandic folk art. The traditional lettering (H\u00f6f\u00f0aletur) on this board has not been translated but may well include prayers for safe rest and a good night's sleep.",
