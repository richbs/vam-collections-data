William Stirling; sold 1953 to the Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nIt was no. 27 at the Blake Exhibition held in 1947 at the Ren\u00e9 Drouin Gallery, Paris and elsewhere.\n\nHistorical significance: Blake worked on various versions of the Last Judgement from 1806 until the end of his life. David Bindman remarks on how, in <i>The Fall of Man</i>, Blake shows a synoptic view of the Fall, with Christ (rather than the Archangel Michael) leading Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden (Bindman, p. 165). God the Father is enthroned in the sphere of Heaven, and at the bottom Hell gapes open, and Sin and Death emerge.\n\nThe Last Judgement is the subject of a companion watercolour of 1806 (<i>A Vision of the Last Judgement</i>, 1806, Pollock House, Glasgow). In this work Adam and Eve appear in contrition before the throne, while the trump-blowing Angels descend to confront the Beast consumed in flames.",
