It shows  the four leading actors, Miss Lena Ashwell as Mrs Dane, Mr Charles Wyndham as Sir Daniel Carteret, Mr Alfred Kendrick as Lionel Carteret (his adopted son) and Miss Mary Moore as Lady Eastney. The play, written by Henry Arthur Jones, focuses on the fate of the beautiful Mrs Dane whose betrothal to the famous judge Sir Daniel Carteret is threatened by scandalous rumours about her past.\n\nHandwritten annotation on a scrap of paper to the right of the image suggests it featured in the Penny Illustrated Paper. This paper, priced 1d per issue, was published on a weekly basis between 12 October 1861 - 28 December 1907.  \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
