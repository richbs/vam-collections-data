The new Queen is crowned (this crown is known as the Imperial State Crown) and seated upon a gilded throne, upholstered in red brocade fabric. She holds her hands together in her lap and looks towards the camera with a calm and hopeful expression. She is dressed in an elaborately embroidered gown and wears a long dark velvet cloak. The cloak is embroidered with golden threads, to form a pattern of intertwining leaves. It is trimmed with a thick white and black fur and fastened with broad, golden braids and knots. The train of the cloak extends in rich folds into the foreground of the image. Prince Philip, stands to one side of the throne. He is dressed in a dark coloured military uniform (of Admiral of the Fleet), decorated with brass buttons, gold embroidery, medals and insignia. The scene is framed by red velvet drapery and carpeting. A curtain reveals a painted backdrop behind it, which depicts the exterior of Westminster Abbey (where the Coronation ceremony had taken place shortly before this sitting).",
