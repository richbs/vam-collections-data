Plates (5) from a set of 9 circular figure scenes emblematic of the glory of Henry II, King of France (prior to Berlin II 4513; prior to R-D 140, 141, 143, 144, 147). \nLettered <u>s</u> inside the round scene. \nEngravings.  20123; 24276; 26447; 29849 B.15; E.2581, E.2582-1913 \n \nOne plate in this set (not in collection) resembles the composition of a coin dated 1562 (R-D. citing Mariette, 142 footnote (1)). \n \nThe issue which is described by R-D has the lettering <u>cum.  pri.  Regis</u> below the exergue outside the composition.  None of the impressions in the Collection have this lettering.  In two cases the plates have been cut (R-D 140, 141, pls. 1 and 2 but in pls. 3, 4 and 5 there is room for the lettering.  As all impressions are very good, an issue prior to R-D has been assumed.
