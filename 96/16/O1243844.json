Brock has been included in the top left hand corner of the image. \nThe painting is not dated but has been signed by the artist, Sydney Higham, in the bottom right hand corner. \n\nThe Brock Company originated in the early eighteenth century. This family run business soon established a reputation for producing innovative fireworks and rose in prominance as a result of the increasing demand for public and private displays. by the nineteenth century the company had expanded and was famous for the staging spectacular displays the set pieces  from which included battle scenes which extended to hundreds of feet. The company kept pace with new developments and the brilliance and colour of the fireworks produced by C.T. Brock were said to defy competition, and huge crowds gathered to watch the displays he staged at The Crystal Palace from 1865.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
