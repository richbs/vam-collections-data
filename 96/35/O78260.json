The printmaker created etched lines by the action of acid on the metal printing plate, but cut engraved ones into the plate with a sharp-pointed tool called a burin. The image has been printed in black. The red colour and white highlights were added afterwards by hand. It is a plate from a volume published in 1770. The volume contains illustrations and descriptions of the Greek vases collected by William Hamilton (1730-1803).\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis print contains images of centaurs, which in ancient Greek mythology were a race of creatures with the head, arms and torso of a man and the lower body and legs of a horse. This print possibly depicts a scene from the tale in which the centaur Eurytion is clubbed to death by Hercules. Eurytion planned to marry a girl who had been Hercules's lover. On the wedding day Hercules arrived, slew Eurytion and his brothers, and carried off the bride.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Hamilton (1730-1803) was an avid collector, as well as a connoisseur and a scientific amateur enthusiast. He collected a wide variety of objects including paintings, gem stones and classical antiquities. He also built up an important collection of Greek vases; the design from one of them is shown in this print.",
