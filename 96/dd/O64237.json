It bore the following history in faded ink: \u2018Found embedded in red clay and dug out during excavations for Sultangange Railway, Bengal, 1862\u2019. \n\nThis head of the Buddha displays a number of conventional auspicious marks (\u2018laksanas\u2019). These include the close-curled hair represented in spirals (\u2018snail-shell\u2019 type), a prominent skull protruberance (\u2018ushnisha\u2019), a forehead mark (\u2018urna\u2019) indicated as a curl of hair, and distended ear lobes. An examination of the back reveals that the head once had a nimbus (\u2018prabha\u2019) and most probably formed part of standing Buddha figure. \n\nExperts are now confident that the sculpture came from Sultanganj, once the site of a major Buddhist monastery and stupa in the early Pala period (about 760-1142 AD). The style of this sculpture belongs to a Sarnath school of the post-Gupta period (320-about 540 AD). However, it already exhibits the highly accomplished skills of the Bihari sculptors who worked the fine-grained shale stone characteristic of sites south of the Ganges. It may be dated to the early Pala period.",

Head of a Buddhist idol supposed to be over two thousand years old'.  The site also yielded the famous bronze standing Buddha now in the Birmingham Museum and a number of related stone sculptures.\n\nAnd see also IS 452-1950 pedestal with kneeling figure also found during excavation for the Sultangange Railway.",

He reported: \"The best I can suggest as name for theis stone is 'a very fine-grained mica-schist'.  It is so fine-grained that the individual minerals are difficult to identify,   On the other hand it contains accessory minerals, such as tourmaline and specks of magnetite surrounded by brown mica, which would make it easy to recognise the stone again either in other pieces of sculpture or in the quarry.",
