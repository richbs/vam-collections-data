            "physical_description": "Panelled oak armchair with inlay panel (holly and bog-oak?)\nThe top rail a single piece (29mm) with 3 carved lunettes, which sits on the rear uprights; now missing an upper cresting (to judge by two empty dowel holes in the top of the top rail); with two applied 'ear' brackets below, carved with stylized leaf ornament.\n\nThe back of the chair consists of two flanking stiles between which are (from top) two horizontal frieze panels above the main, panel of inlay with a superimposed arch. The back stiles (uprights) are carved on the front with an unusual 'sideways' stylized leaf repeating motif. The top frieze panel is carved with leaf and grapes, and has, below, an applied dentil border (1/4 round). Below is a second frieze (or mid-rail) with chevron inlay in dark and light colours.  The main panel consists of inlay work with a vase and flowers in three colours, with an applied arch (leaf and grapes) and pilasters with strapwork ornament; the reverse of the panel (visible from the chair back) is neatly planed, with a wide chamfer. This main panel sits above a lower rail with chevron inlay. \n\nThe seat of two boards (13mm), with edge nulling and a protruding front lip; the front and side seat rails with a running half-chevron inlay, and shaped on their underside (matching the underside of the arms); the rear rail plain. The arms (at a very flat angle) 46mm thick with a distinctive double scroll undercut, and extended mortice where the arm sits onto the front leg; double-pegged into the back upright, and a single peg onto the front leg. The rear legs plain rectangular, the front legs turned, connected by four plain rectangular stretchers (30mm thick), all four feet tipped.\n\nWide grain, straight oak has been used, now covered with a darkish patina.

They were constructed with stout tenon and mortice joints firmly pegged together, but were nonetheless light enough to be moved easily by two people.  Many regional variations are found, for example in the form of arms or crest, and the carved motifs decorating the rails and back. During the 17th century such chairs - furnished with a loose cushion - were probably referred to as a 'great chair', or an 'arm [or armed] chair', and still indicated the relatively high status of the person sitting in it, while others used stools or benches. Chairs of this type, made of oak, have survived in much greater numbers than 17th century chairs with fixed upholstery on beech frames - which were becoming fashionable around 1600.",

Hunn Esq. of 1 Sydney Terrace, Fulham Road, London SW., from whom the Museum purchased various pieces of furniture, ceramic etc, 1920-1939 (RP 23/1950) (RF 23/5957), described as 'split, parts missing, repaired, restored' and by Clifford Smith as 'very good example of a 'Jacobean' chair of about 1630...the carving is of good quality & the chair is further enriched inlaid [sic] work of unusual character on the back'.  Another comment (author unidentified) adds 'This chair is untouched, and a fine specimen'.\n\nIn terms of regional origin, a promiment crest (with ears), and inlay banding are often found in South Yorkshire furniture, usually dated 1650-1720. However, the distinctive Dales amrchair exhibits a double-scrolled pediment crest quite unlike the flat crest rail on this example, and the marked horizontal arms (said to be a sign of an earlier date, DEF, Chair entry) are also unusual. A similar rectangular crest is seen on a relatively unusual chair illustrated (fig. 12) in Anthony Wells-Cole, Oak Furniture in Norfolk 1530-1640 (Regional Furniture, Volume IV 1990), in which county the round-headed arch is also often found. The undulating vine tendril and grape cluster are seen on North Lancashire woodwork in particular, but by no means exclusively. The extent of restoration probably included some replacement inlay, and it is possible that the design of the back no longer reflects the original very closely. An origin in the north eastern counties of England seems possible.\n\nThis chair was on loan to Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery (probably from c. 1951 to 2002) and Buckland Abbey (2002 to 2013).",
