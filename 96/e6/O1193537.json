The garland starts with small buds, gradually growing to full soft blooms. More roses made from satin and chiffon with organza leaves tumble from this romantic ensemble. Fabric flowers are not new but these are unusual. They form an integral part of the garment as if growing from the fabric itself. Francesca Oddi wore this dress at her wedding. Galliano also designed her three bridesmaids' dresses.\n\nJohn Galliano's family was Spanish-Gibralterian. He came to London at the age of six. He studied at St Martins School of Art, graduating in 1983 with a collection based on French Revolution costume which was sold to Browns. He launched his first collection under his own name in 1984.",
