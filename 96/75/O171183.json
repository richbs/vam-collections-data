Like Catholic women elsewhere in southern Europe they often wore elaborate crosses as jewellery.\n\nThe design of this cross is based on 18th century aristocratic jewellery, but the use of garnets and pearls is typical of Italian traditional jewellery of the 19th century. Crosses like this were worn throughout northern and central Italy, often with matching earrings. The original owner would have worn it hung from a ribbon, passed through the hook at the back of the top segment.  \n\nThis cross was bought for \u00a39 4s. as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
