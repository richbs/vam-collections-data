The skirt appears to be made from a translucent, pink gauze-like fabric and is worn under a small, white apron with a decorative pink bow at the base of the bodice. The front lacing bodice is largely black and with a frill/lace trim at the neckline and sleeve ends and a small rose at the centre top. Her hair is very simply dressed with a long pink and gold ribbon and she carries a garland of flowers in her left hand. Fragments of similar garlands are scattered at her feet.",
