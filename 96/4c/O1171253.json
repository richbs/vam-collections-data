Typically in this long thin form, they were filled with rows of repeating patterns worked in coloured silks, sometimes interspersed with figures or floral motifs. Their makers sometimes signed and dated them, as Elizabeth Godden has done here. She has also chosen to mention her parents, as a sign of filial respect.\n\nAlthough much of the decoration on this sampler is typical of the period, with its bands of geometrical decoration and animals, insects and flowers, the depiction of the King and Queen with royal children, and the finely dressed gentleman and lady, is sophisticated, particularly in the use of metal thread and glass beads.",
