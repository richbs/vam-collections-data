The seat and the horizontal board of the tray (which is pivoted on screws and fastens with a curved wire at the sides) and the baseboard are of stained and varnished pine.  The adjustable footrest is of varnished beech, mounted on a metal rod, and has a notched back peg which clips on to the top front stretcher. The legs are hinged halfway down at the front, so the high chair can be folded out and up into a table and chair (with the tray folded back).  The underside of the baseboard becomes the table, and has six painted wooden beads (in red, white, blue, yellow, green and orange respectively) mounted on a metal rod in a beech frame at the back edge.",

Its relatively simple lines and proportions and plain appearance all made it a good candidate for continued production under the UK government's Utility scheme, which was introduced in 1942 to achieve efficient use of materials (such as wood) in short supply during World War Two.  Utility designs aimed at combining economy of production with effective design.",

(Register Packet holds photographic prints of Christopher & David in the chair). The donor states in her letter \"In 1956 we were hard pressed financially.  We had just built our own bungalow and there was no money for furniture.  My husband was an architect with the local authority.  Our home, therefore, was furnished with relatives (sic) unwanted items and things we bought through the small ads. in the local paper.  The furniture for the children was all purchased that way.  We paid \u00a31 for the cot and bought a mattress, \u00a36 for the pram and \u00a31 for the high chair.  A couple of years later we bought the rocking horse (Victorian) for 50 shillings !  I have no recollection of the house from which the high chair came except that it was somewhere in Gloucester...As with the cot and the rocking horse and our family cradle, I had kept the high chair for potential grand children (sic).  However though sturdy and well made it is difficult to keep clean.  Once chewed up food is well and truly rubbed into the wood, the only way to clean it is to take it outside and scrub it!  My daughters in law prefer hygienic plastic.\"",
