            "public_access_description": "This casket (Spanish 'arqueta') for personal possessions was made in an unidentified workshop in the Spanish colony of 'Alto Peru' (the Andean region of modern Bolivia and Peru). The decoration includes mermaids playing the 'charango' (a type of Peruvian guitar), viscachas (a South American rodent) and catfish. The town and maker's marks stamped on the base had originally suggested to scholars that the casket was made in Toledo (the silversmith Antonio P\u00e9rez de Montalto, whose mark appears here, was also assay master there between 1654 and 1685). However, as the ornament on this casket closely resembles other examples on silverware, furnishings and textiles made in the Andean region of colonial Spain, it seems the Spanish marks are a later indication the piece was tested for the quality of its metal.\nAn inscription on the lid reveals its original owner was a woman called Menc\u00eda Tenorio. A lady of the same name is recorded in Seville in 1607, among the servants connected to the household of the future Viceroy of Peru, the Marquis of Montesclaros (ruled 1608-1615).",

            "history_note": "The casket was made in an unidentified workshop in the Spanish colony of 'Alto Peru' (the Andean region of modern Bolivia and Peru). The original owner was a woman called Menc\u00eda Tenorio, who may be the lady of the same name identified as a servant of Don Diego N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Ovando in Seville in 1607. Ovando was chamberlain to the Marquis of Montesclaros, governor of Peru between 1608-1615; Menc\u00eda was part of the retinue who followed the governor and his household to Peru in 1608 (Esteras Mart\u00edn: 2006, p.197). The marks stamped on the underside of the casket show it was sent to Spain at an unspecified date before 1685 and presented at the Toledo assay office for testing. Antonio de Montalto, whose mark appears here, was assay master at Toledo between 1654 and 1685.\nThe Museum purchased the casket in 1879 for \u00a392 'from a convent at Toledo' (<u>Special Loan Exhibition</u>, cat. no. 884).\n\nHistorical significance: The form of this casket (Spanish, 'arqueta') was popular in Spain and Spanish America from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries (cf. for example cat. nos 67 and 133 in <u>The Colonial Andes</u>.) Given the wealth of the Spanish colonial empire during the seventeenth century, these caskets were typically constructed of thick silver plates (as here), rather than of silver plaques nailed to a wooden core (see Esteras Mart\u00edn, cat. entry 133 in <u>The Colonial Andes</u>). The piece is unusual because it is engraved with the name of its owner, Menc\u00eda Tenorio.  Another silver casket of different form but also bearing Menc\u00eda's name and with similar decoration survives in a Peruvian private collection (Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Enrico Poli, Lima: see Esteras Mart\u00edn, 2006, p.196).\nThe town and maker's marks stamped on the base had originally suggested to scholars that the casket was made in Toledo, and English and Spanish writers have argued the source of the unusual iconography lies in Portuguese Sri Lanka (Oman: 1968) or in Islamic Spain (for a summary of the arguments, see Esteras Mart\u00edn: 2004, p.195). The most recent research (Esteras Mart\u00edn: 2006 and Hecht: 2004) places the mermaid and animal motifs in the context of the silversmithing workshops of the Viceroyalty of Peru, in the area known as 'Alto Per\u00fa' (today the Andean region of Bolivia and Peru).",

            "historical_context_note": "Silver caskets of this type generally held personal possessions but could also be used in an ecclesiastical context to store the consecrated bread wafers, or Hosts, essential to the Christian celebration of mass (for an example see <u>The Colonial Andes</u>, cat. no. 133). Esteras Mart\u00edn (2006, p.196) suggests the figures of men playing and losing a ball game depicted on the sides reflect the casket's role as a prize in a wager. The fact the Museum purchased the casket from a religious institution in Toledo in the nineteenth century may imply it was originally brought to Spain by a Spaniard who was entering holy orders (Esteras Mart\u00edn 2006, p.200).",
