The cloud study at the back is too slight to form a clear guide, but has some affinities with the somewhat liquid sky drawing in No. 328 [240-1888] of 1833, and with the skies in some of the later water-colours, such as No. 372 [801-1888] of 1834; but it may have been drawn during Constable's earlier phase of 'skying' around 1821.\u201d",

He gave four lectures on 'The History of Landscape Painting' at the Royal Institution in May and June of this year and his last lecture, at Hampstead, on 25 July. Constable died on 31 March 1837.
