Lower side rails screwed up to caned frame (3 screws in each side).  \n\nTwo small screw-holes on the inside face of each of the front and side rails of the caned frame - what for? - caned seat (front and side rails) perhaps comes, as a seat, from another chair, hence the mismatch in shape.  The screw-holes inside the three rails could relate to its earlier use - possibly for screw-threaded pins to secure a loose cover by.  The turned back stretcher also looks replaced - stretcher joints ?all rejoined.  The front legs are now screwed to the side stretchers from the front.\n\nGhost of a label on back of splat, near the bottom.",
