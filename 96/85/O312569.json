He wears a clock over a plain breastplate and a high folded stock round the neck. The Star of the Order of the Garter appears in the folds of the cloak.\n\nThe bust is carved by John Nost the Younger (1713-1780), who was born into the van Ost (van Nost) family of sculptors, was trained in London by Henry Scheemakers (1670-1748). He travelled to Dublin in 1749, and spent much of his subsequent working life in Ireland. He executed a number of portrait busts and public monuments, including a statue of George III for Dublin City Hall.",
