The fact that this also includes the phrase 'six pence' suggests that this stamp may have been a 'frank'. Though whether this stamp was added before posting the agreement or as a sign of its authenticity is open to question.\n\nFurther questions arise regarding which Thomas Grieve the memorandum refers to as both Thomas Grieve (1799-1882) and his son Thomas Walford Grieve (1841-1882) were working as Set Designers during this period and from 1862 onwards often worked together.",
