            "physical_description": "Vishnu Caturmurtilinga\n\nThis is a sculpture depicting a linga-like pillar with four figures of Vishnu emerging from the shaft, in his four-fold manifestation (<i>caturmurti</i>). The representations of Visnu, three in his supreme form as Para-Vasudeva, and one in his man-lion appearance (Narasimha avatara), are positioned facing the four cardinal directions, so asserting Visnu\u2019s claim as a Universal Sovereign. Visnu in his human form holds in his raised arms an elliptical discus (<i>cakra</i>) and a club (<i>gada</i>); his lower hands are damaged but may be presumed to have held a conch shell (<i>sangka</i>) in one hand, the other gesturing grace to his devotees.\n\nThe apparent linga-form of the pillar, Shiva ultimate symbol, is a reminder that this composition of multiple forms of Vishnu took its inspiration from the Saivite version of this subject. Ultimately it may be traced to the caturmukhalinga, the four-faced linga addorsed with the four faces (aspects) of Shiva, which first made its appearance in the early Kushan period, if not earlier. The appearance of this configuration of Vishnu images on a linga-like form also is a reminder of the remarkable degree of syncretism that occurred in early Nepalese religious imagery, not only within Hinduism, as seen here, but also between Hinduism and Buddhism. The pillar with four directional figures also occurs in Buddhist art, in the <i>caturmukha</i> shrines often to be found in the courtyards of Licchavi-period Nepalese monasteries.  \n\nThe figures of Visnu stand on an octagonal plinth decorated with a Gupta-style foliate design, a reminder that the model for this composition is to be found in the Gupta style of northern India, of which the art of Licchavi-period Nepal was an natural extension.",

Ultimately it may be traced to the <i>caturmukhalinga</i>, the four-faced <i>linga</i> addorsed with the four faces (aspects) of Shiva, which first made its appearance in the early Kushan period, if not earlier. The appearance of this configuration of Vishnu images on a<i> linga</i>-like form also is a reminder of the remarkable degree of syncretism that occurred in early Nepalese religious imagery, not only within Hinduism, as seen here, but also between Hinduism and Buddhism. The pillar with four directional figures also occurs in Buddhist art, in the <i>caturmukha</i> shrines often to be found in the courtyards of Licchavi-period Nepalese monasteries.  \nThe figures of Vishnu stand on an octagonal plinth decorated with a Gupta-style foliate design, a reminder that the model for this composition is to be found in the Gupta style of northern India, of which the art of Licchavi-period Nepal was an natural extension.",
