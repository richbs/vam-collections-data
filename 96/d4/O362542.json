Trimmed with pale blue ribbon edged with black blonde lace. \n\nThe bodice and skirt are joined. The bodice is tightly fitted, made with a low round neck, short tight sleeves and a waist seam which dips to a 'V' at the front and back. It is made from the ground material ruched onto a lining of glazed blue cotton. The skirt is mounted onto a tape waist band, attached to the bodice at the main bodice seams. It consists of one breadth of material in the front and two at the back, and flat pleated to the band, except at the centre back where they are more tightly gathered.\n\nThe bodice is trimmed with bows at the neck, sleeves, centre front and back, and the skirt with bows attached to bands of ruched ground material mounted on tulle at the hip and knee level. There is a similar band at the hem. A double flounce of the disposition pattern is attached at above knee level.\n\nThe dress fastens with bronze metal hooks and eyes. It is stiffened with three bones at the front and two others running the full length of the back opening, which are completely enclosed in white tape.",
