They seem to repeat a pious formula in Arabic, which is commonly used in mosques. The empty space around the cartouches is bordered by vertical bands filled with palmette scrolls. These branch out at top and bottom to fill the space with a decoration of palmettes and elaborate knotwork patterns. These are separated by flower-buds which look a bit like the tulips in Ottoman (Iznik) ceramics. In other forms of Ottoman art, such a combination of scrollwork and flowers are known to conceal the word 'Allah'.\n\nThere are holes at the top and bottom of the egg, perhaps allowing for a bar to be passed through for suspension. At the bottom, the decoration is more tightly packed and darker in colour, whereas the top of the egg seems to have had more wear. There are light incisions all over the egg which suggest that the design was etched on the surface before being carved. The engraved areas are filled in with black ink.\n\nThe old label suggests this was a weight for a hanging lamp, though weight of the egg is not substantial, which perhaps indicates this was not its original use. Another suggestion is that such objects sat in the top of mosque lamps to prevent rodents from climbing down the suspension chains and falling into the lamps, which were wide open at the top. This might explain why the egg has been less worn and is darker on the bottom, though in this case the decoration on this part of the egg would have been invisible. \n\nThe exact date and provenance of the object is difficult to ascertain without further research and comparative study.",

Cutter.\n\nThe original inventory volumes at the Bethnal Green Museum give more information. These say that this egg was acquired together with AP.11-1889, which is still in the collection at Bethnal Green (in the Animal Products section). The two ostrich eggs were given one number, and entered the Museum on 24th Janunary 1889. They were bought for \u00a32 (\u00a31 each, as the Furniture Department registers specify the cost of 94-1889 as \u00a31) from Miss Cutter, of 35 Great Russell Street, WC (a 'W Cutter' of the same address, presumably her brother, also appears in the Bethnal Green Museum registers). On 13th February 1889 one egg was \"transferred to the Art Division\", i.e. South Kensington Museum; it was entered into the Furniture Department the following day, and given its own Museum number.\n\nHistorical significance: Dr Anne Regourd of the University of Leeds is researching ostrich eggs with painted Arabic inscriptions. 94-1889 and AP.11-1889 are so far unusual in her corpus as their decoration is engraved. \n\nA painted ostrich egg has recently been found in the excavations of Quseir al-Qadim, on the Red Sea coast of southern Egypt. It can be dated by its stratigraphy to the Mamluk period (1250-1517), and more specifically to the 15th century. It is fragmentary, but covered with painted Arabic inscriptions. These are not Qur'anic, but all have something to do with death. The context of the find was a graveyard site, so it may have been an object which was buried with someone, or which decorated a tomb or mausoleum. \n\nThis is the theory of Professor Dionisius Agius of the University of Leeds who is publishing this find, with some other comparable pieces (such as a much smaller egg, perhaps from a chicken, in the British Museum which is also painted with Arabic inscriptions).",
