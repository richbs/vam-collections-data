Maclise.\n\nWyon is the name of a telented  family of Designers, Die-engravers and medallists whose period of activity extended from before the middle of the 18th century to almost the end of the 19th century.\nWyon, Leonard Charles (1826-1891) was the eldest son of William Wyon (1795-1851). Educated in art by his father, he became a skilled engraver. When 16 he already had made several medals, and when 24 he succeeded his father with the title of Modeller and Engraver (1851). He made a great contribution to coinage, which he was particularly trained for by his father.\n\nDaniel Maclise (1806-1870) was an Irish painter, who studied at Cork School of Art and the Royal Academy Schools. Initially a portraitist, he made his name as a history painter, and executed monumental compositions in the Palace of Westminster. He also produced caricatures for Fraser's Magazine, and was friendly with Charles Dickens. Maclise visited Paris, Brussels, Italy and Germany, and his later works have a distinct Germanic character.",
