He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nOliver Messel created this mask of Queen Elizabeth I for his exhibition 'Drawings, Maquettes and Masks for the Theatre by Oliver Messel', at the Lef\u00e8vre Gallery in 1933. Messel began his career making masks for the creator of the Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev. It was Messel's work for the London theatre producer, Sir Charles Blake Cochran (1872 - 1951) and his famous theatrical reviews, which were a mixture of satire and songs, that brought Messel to the attention of the public and launched his career in the theatre. Messel continued to make masks and maquettes throughout his career and this example highlights his use of materials and attention to detail.",
