The  Reggio guild of shoemakers commissioned the reliquary  both to honour their patron saint, and for the protection of their community.  Relics attracted pilgrims who said their prayers and made gifts and monetary donations to the Church in which they were held.

They were believed to be imbued with the holiness of the relic they preserved. The faithful believed that by touching a reliquary, they would receive some of this holy quality.\n\nReliquaries were central features of the Medieval Church Treasury. They symbolised the status and authority of the Church. Relics attracted pilgrims who made gifts and monetary donations to the Church in which they were held. Local people also gave in honour of their saint and to gain protection for themselves and their town. Thus relics could often give a sense of identity within the church community. Some reliquaries were used in religious precessions or festivals, which both involved the community and also reinforced the status of the Church.\n\nSt Homobonus (Italian= Omobono) was a 12th century layman who worked in order to support the poor. He was the son of a prosperous tailor and merchant and gave much of his wealth to the less fortunate. Homobonus was a devout Christian. He died in 1197 while attending mass, prostrated at the altar, his body forming the shape of a cross. Pope Innocent III made him a saint two years later.\n\nSt Homobonus is the patron saint of clothworkers and business people as well as the town of Cremona where he lived. The guild of shoemakers in Reggio therefore commissioned this reliquary in honour of their patron saint.",

Some were shaped to represent the saint or various parts of the body such as an armhead, leg or finger (so-called 'speaking image' reliquaries). Others were designed as a monstrance, which placed the relic on view inside a glass cylinder (<i>monstrare</i>= to show).
