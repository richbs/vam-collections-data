Even though the concept had not yet been fully realised, the idea was based on an earlier football game, New Footy, developed in the 1920s.\n\nThe figures, known as \"flats\" were originally cut out from paper. This later developed into a press out format. From 1961 celluloid figures replaced the card versions. The idea of the game was to closely simulate the rules and moves of real football in a table top game with two full teams in coloured stripes, footballs, a pitch in the form of a mat and goal posts. The figures could be moved by flicking them into contact with the ball. The special and patented design of the bases (based on the shape of a rounded button) enabled the figures to remain upright throughout play.",
