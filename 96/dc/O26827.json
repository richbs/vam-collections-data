Seven cards are dealt to 2,3, or 4 players.\n2.   The rest of the pack is placed face down.\n3.  The top card turned face upwards next to the pack thus staring the discard pile.\n4.  Play starts with the player on the dealer's left.  Each player in turn picks up a card from either the discard pile or the pack, examines it and either discards it on the discxard pile or exchanges it for a card already in his hand.\nAs a player collects a set of 3 cards he may, if he wishes, place them face upwards on the table in front of him and score their total.\nAny player, having the fourth card to the set may, in turn, place it in front of himself and score its number.\nThe game ends when one player has disposed of all the cards in his hand, and at that time scores are totalled.\nSCORING\nCards score according to the numbers on them.  House cards score 20.  All cards still in the hand of a player score against him and all cards on the table score for the player who has collected them.  The first player to score 200 (or any greater number chosen by the group of players before play begins) is the winner.",
