The back is made from one width of cotton with a 2.25 inch panel of coarse Torchon bobbin lace inserted on either side. The front is made from two widths of cloth and there are narrow widths under the arms.\n\nThe sleeves are of the dolman type with a triangular gusset under the arm, cut with one narrow length of plain linen underneath and two wide panels, half of each of which is decorated with a geometric cutwork pattern, and embroidered with black cotton in back stitch and with gold sequins. Between the two pieces of cutwork is a 2.5 inch panel of coarse Torchon lace, and decorated with sequins. The sleeves are gathered at the wrist to form long cuffs which are embroidered with black cotton in back and padded tent stitches, gold sequins and a horizontal panel of geometric cutwork. There is an added 2.75 inch frill of Torchon lace. The sleeves and blouse top are gathered into a narrow neck-band which is over sewn with black cotton in cloth stitch. The centre of the front is slit to form a 7 inch neck-opening, fastening with two strings, and one is complete with a bobble of red and yellow wool. A 7.75 inch panel of plain cotton has been attached, possibly at a later date, to the bottom edge.",
