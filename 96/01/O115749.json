NB. small area towards top of inner border on right-hand side by blue flower; several warp threads may have broken and been rejoined; there are loose ends over 1/2\".\n\nWeft: cream wool, white cotton; Z2S; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 18 knots per inch (72 per dm).\n\nPile:  wool; 15 colours: red, light red, orange (faded), yellow, dark green, green, light green, dark blue, blue, purple, light pink, light brown, very light brown, black, cream; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 180 knots per sq. inch (2736 per sq. dm).\n\nSide Finish:  both sides have 2 cords overcast with light brown wool.\n\nEnd finish:  lower  4 cms. maximum plain weave with white cotton weft, the final weft thread a doubly-plied Z cord and the 1.5 cm. twisted warp loops.  Upper: 1 cm. plain weave with yellow cotton weft turned and stitched in place.\n\nDesign:  field:  cream ground with three bands of a pair of red rosettes alternating with two bands of pairs of red-petalled flowers with protruding stamen.  Curving green stems link these flowers to smaller yellow, dark blue and other red ones and to blue leaves.  This area is bounded along the bottom and three-quarters the way up the sides by a dark blue ground border which turns inwards to form a slightly curving pointed niche.  Within this top point of the border, in the two top corners and elsewhere along the border are yellow rosettes - and with other blossoms and green leaves - forming a floral meander.\n\nThe spandrels have a cream ground heavily filled with yellow and blue flowers linked by green stems with slender green leaves.  In each corner is a group of three dark red rosettes and the spandrels meet where a sprig supports a larger variation.\n\nMain border:  green ground with elaborate floral meander bearing principally, light red rosettes and clusters of three white or yellow flowers with blue or dark blue leaves.\n\nOuter border:  light brown ground with hexagonal stylised flowers framed by angular narrow bands linked between the flowers.",
