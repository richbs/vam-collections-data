At the time it had been given extremely unfavourable reviews by the music press, and had not sold widely, although it has since been hailed as a masterpiece. The concert itself has been remembered as a disaster too, recounted in a BBC Radio Scotland documentary about the Apollo: Reed was carried on to the stage, lying on his back for the whole concert and was then carried off stage.\nThe image of Reed on the poster was from a photograph by Mick Rock, photographer of rock stars from the early 1970s onwards. Iconic as an image of Reed, it was originally used for the cover of his most successful album, 1972's Transformer.",
