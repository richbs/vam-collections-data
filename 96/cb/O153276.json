As an Old Testament site it is also of interest to Christians, and Warren's view, with the Dome of the Rock in the centre, was engraved for the Revd John Fleetwood's The Life of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (1854). The watercolour was based on a sketch by the sculptor and draughtsman, Joseph Bonomi (1796-1878), who had visited Jerusalem in 1833. Warren himself apparently never went to Jerusalem, or indeed anywhere in the Near East, despite the preponderance of oriental subjects in his work. He painted many large and elaborate watercolours, often with literary or biblical themes, which, when exhibited at the New Society of Painters in Water-Colours, were acclaimed for their skill and authenticity. He was President of the NWS 1839-73, and was awarded the Belgian honour of Knight of the Order of Leopold.",
