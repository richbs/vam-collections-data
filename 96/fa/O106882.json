Although he felt the inscription had been added in the Renaissance he did not question the association with the Dacian wars and suggests an interesting parallel for the Nike could be found on Trajan's column.  This would appear to be the Nike half way up the column at the connecting point between the two wars in the narration, where her figure appears inscribing the honours of the wars on a shield.  A comparable Nike found in Lullingstone can be found in Henig's PhD thesis on engraved gems.",
