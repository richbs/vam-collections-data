Inscribed with a description of the \nplan \nPencil and pen and ink on tracing paper. \n48 x 48 cm \nVAM E.3170-1980 \n \nThis drawing, one result of Sol LeWitt\u2019s \nresearch into lines and geometric structures, is \na work in its own right not a preliminary study \nbut it is the idea behind it rather than its \nrealization that is important. Of conceptual \nart, the artist has written: \u2018the idea or concept \nis the most important aspect of the work. \nWhen an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it \nmeans that all of the planning and decisions \nare made beforehand and the execution is a \nperfunctory affair. The idea becomes the \nmachine that makes the art. This kind of art is \nnot theoretical or illustrative of theories; it is \nintuitive, it is involved with all types of mental  \nprocesses and it is purposeless. It is usually \nfree from the dependence on the skill of the \nartist who is concerned with conceptual art to \nmake his work mentally interesting to the  \nspectator, and therefore usually he would want \nit to become emotionally dry.\u2019 \n(<i>Sol LeWitt</i>, Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, \n1970, p. 56)\"",
