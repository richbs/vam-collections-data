Its deceptively simple design presents a cat's eyes with silhouettes of dancers for pupils. Instantly recognisable, it also hints at what you will experience in the theatre - the mysteriousness within the eyes peering out of the darkness, and the dancers reflected in them.\n\nCats has been translated into more than 20 languages and ran for 8,949 performances in London, with its final performance on its 21st birthday. It was the world's longest running musical, until Les Mis\u00e9rables surpassed it on October 8, 2006.",
