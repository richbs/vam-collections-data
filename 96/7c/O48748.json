The design was executed for J.M Barrie's play \"Peter Pan\" at the London Coliseum, December 27th, 1971.  The play was directed by Robert Helpmann, music composed by Grant Foster, flying effects by Kirby's Flying Ballet, and presented by Tom Arnold Presentation Ltd.\nThe original production starred Dorothy Tutin as Peter, and was revived again at the Coliseum in 1972, 1973, and 1974.  Maggie Smith played Peter in the last two revivals.\n\nIn December 1975, a new musical version of \"Peter Pan\" was presented at the London Palladium starring Lulu.  This production used the original Coliseum sets and costumes designed by Anthony Holland, although he was not credited in the programme.",
