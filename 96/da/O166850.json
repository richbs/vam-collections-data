Lawrence Hardy was Deputy Speaker for the House of Commons and a Member of Parliament for Ashford, Kent, for 25 years.\n\nHowever, the dress label reads \"Madame Bertinet, 157 Sloane St. SW1, Removed to 14 Chester Sq, Belgravia.\". According to the Westminster Central Reference and also to Kelly's Post Office Directory, Madame Bertinet first moved to Chester Square in 1896, and the wording of the label would place this dress at least 9 years after the associated wedding. Mme Bertinet was not operating in 1887, so could not have made this dress for the marriage with which it is associated.\n\nThe style of the dress, with its rounded neckline, exposing the neck, would have been appropriate for a married woman in her thirties to wear for dinner or informal evening wear. The rich, dark yellow-cream velvet fabric would have been appropriate for this purpose, and the use of gold metal embroidery would have been thought rather unusual for a wedding dress at this time, when pearls, clear stones such as diamonds (or paste equivalents) and silver embroidery would have been more usual.\n\n-Daniel Milford-Cottam",
