L.& S. L\u00f6vinson, a German firm specialising in carved furniture, and Julius Yacoby or Jacoby, who had a furniture business in London, exhibited furniture together at the International Exhibition held in Paris in 1867. On their stand was an example of this chair with additional carving around the arched top. The Art Journal described their furniture at the Exhibition as showing 'proofs of the grace and elegance they introduce into the more ordinary furniture of domestic life'.  It is likely that L\u00f6vinson made this chair, which was retailed in London by Yacoby.",
