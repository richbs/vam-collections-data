Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Kokei. Kokei was a carver who lived and worked at Kuwana, Ise Province and was famed for his pieces in boxwood of animals of the Zodiac during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Many animals carved in netsuke form were often depicted on a rock by using the root end of the boxwood. This netsuke of a toad on a sandal is well formed with the smooth body of the toad contrasting with the rough woven form of the shoe to lend texture and realism to the piece.",
