Most skewers date from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSilver skewers were made in a number of sizes. The larger ones were used with meat joints and the smaller skewers with poultry or game birds. This example may have been made for use with game such as wild duck or pheasant. The skewer was of a tapering form and the plainest examples have only a ring at the top of the long blade. Any variation in style occurred mainly at the ring ends, which protruded from the meat to give a decorative effect. Shell mounts, family crests, reeded or beaded designs were popular forms of ornament. The decoration of this skewer is derived from motifs associated in ancient Greek mythology with Hermes, the messenger of the gods: it has a caduceus (the magic wand traditionally carried by Hermes), around which are entwined two serpents, crowned by a petasus (Hermes' winged hat).\n\nRetailing\nA silver skewer of a similar design to this example was advertised in the Elkington & Co. catalogue of 1885 for 16s (\u015380p).",
