They were largely made to be functional rather than decorative and needed to be cheap, simple and strong enough to withstand constant public use.  Most were based on country chair designs, with turned legs and solid or rush seats, and had several stretchers between the legs for added strength. \n\nThis particular example is a very simple ladder-back chair with a wide top rail and rush seat.  By the second half of the nineteenth century such chairs were probably made in large factory workshops in centres such as High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.  This example was said by the previous owner to have come from St Paul's Cathedral, London.",
