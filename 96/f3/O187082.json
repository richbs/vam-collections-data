The purse is constructed from a diamond-shape with three corners folded towards the middle and stitched.  The fourth corner appears to form a flap but there is no evidence that it was ever folded down.  The main fabric has a white satin ground patterned with an ogival lattice worked in metal thread with a pink line and with a light blue rosette where the lines meet.  Each segment contains a large dark green and metal thread star with metal thread flowers radiating from it.  \nMetal thread: gold strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core.\nThe bias-cut border has a gold ground with a floral meander of mauve flowers, red roses and blue flowers with white blossoms.  The metal thread is gold strip close S-wound on a yellow silk core.\nFacing: black cotton, or is it linen?\nLinings: [1] innermost: bright red silk; [2] uppermost: dark red satin woven with small motifs of green leaves and a round unpatterned flower, slightly pointed at the top.  Woven with metal thread [silver strip open s-wound on a yellow silk core] and with white silk. There is a small 'cloud' motif.",
