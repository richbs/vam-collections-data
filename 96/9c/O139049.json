In 1934 Vogue magazine featured similar hats in an article entitled 'Dinner-Dancing Hats' for autumn to give 'just the right note of elegance when you're dining and dancing'. \n\nThe pointed crown and thick feather brim echoes the shape of a traditional tarboosh hat, historically worn in Egypt and across the Middle East. The tarboosh had a pointed crown and often formed the base around which a turban could be wrapped.\n\nThis hat was designed by  Lucienne Rabat\u00e9 for the House of Reboux. From the 1870s until the 1930s the label of  Caroline Reboux (1837-1927) dominated Parisian millinery fashions. Caroline Reboux began her career as a penniless but talented young milliner. Her work was discovered and promoted by the fashionable Princess Metternich and in turn attracted the custom of the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. After Caroline Reboux's death in 1927, the House of Reboux was run by the milliner  Lucienne Rabat\u00e9.\n\n Reboux was known for her clean, simple style using fabrics such as satin, velvet and felt which were draped or cut with a minimum of added or fussy details. Feathers were a favourite embellishment. In the 1920s Reboux was highly regarded for her cloche style hats, which were often cut and formed on the client's head.",
