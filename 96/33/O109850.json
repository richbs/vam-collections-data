They were often  carved with fantastic monsters and grotesques, like this example which forms part of a set that belonged to the Steno family of Venice, whose emblem, a star, is  emblazoned on the crest. According to John Hungerford Pollen, writing in 1874, the Steno \"house remained furnished in the old way down to modern times\",  but the chairs in this set are almost certainly copies of an untraced earlier example. They were later acquired by Jules Soulages (1803 - 1856), a lawyer from Toulouse, whose collection was bought piecemeal by this museum, after it had been exhibited at Marlborough House between December 1856 and January 1857.",
