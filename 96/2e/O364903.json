            "physical_description": "Tapestry woven in silk. A wooded landscape frames a distance view of a mountain and a lake. Into the lake an inlet runs from the foreground of the tapestry, where rocky ground supports trees and plants to either side and four birds in the centre. There are two herons with buff and pink shaded plumage, one heron has an eel in its beak, and two long-legged birds with blue plumage. A few sparsely flowering plants in pink and blue are on the lower right hand side. Three small birds fly among the trees to the left of the scene.\n\nThe predominant colour is blue. Pink-tan is used for the foliage of one of the trees in the middle distance, echoing the brown and pink tones of birds and trees trunks in the foreground. Yellow and white silk is used to heighten the foliage.\n\nThe border has a bright yellow ground between edges of gadrooning in colours suggesting stone, decorated with scrolling frames, cartouches with antique heads and putti, and with swags and pendants of coloured flowers, all linked by blue ribbons. At the centre top, putti hold blue ribbons threaded through a hollow cartouche within which hangs a pendant of flowers. The ribbons support swags to either side. At the corners are elaborate frames with scrolling outer edges, holding a wreath of flowers, with an inner edge of beading. Inside these, on a pale blue ground with shadows of darker blue are antique heads in cameo. At each centre side are two putti with three dolphins, the space above and below being filled with pendant flowers. The bottom border has been reconstructed with pieces probably taken from another tapestry. About 18 inches with swags at the sides is original, but within that are two small cartouches flanking a central floral pendant, put in upside down.\n\nThe original galloon of the verdure is missing, so there is no factory mark on the tapestry.",
