Central back panel, shoulder seams, set-in small stand-up collar. Pieces added to the sides to form a flare with pronounced curved section over the hips. Long, pointed sleeves; the left one is made from one panel and the right sleeve is pieced at the front shoulder. There is a diamond shaped opening under each arm which extends to the wrist because the sleeves are not seamed. Extra panels have been added at the lower front to create a rectangular flap which fastens left over right.  At the left is a small black cord button and there is a black loop on the side seam at the right.\nThe main fabric has a yellow ground which was originally metal thread [silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core] with white leafy lines forming lobed compartments.  There is a horizontal figure 8 with an inverted triangular compartment above and below. Flowers and leaves are connected by a fine line which creates a sub-design of ogees.\nLining: block printed yellow ground cotton with offset rows of a small red and white blossom with red buds on a green stalk with leaves. This fabric has been used to make two ties, one on the inside of the left side seam and one on the top corner of the right hand flap.",
