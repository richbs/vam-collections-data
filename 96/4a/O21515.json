            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis 'wet' drug jar is of typical form. In this case it was used for dispensing syrup of quinces, which presumably had some soothing or laxative properties. The narrow foot enabled it to be pulled out from a row of jars on the pharmacy shelf. The handle at the back was used to tilt it forward and pour out a measure of the sticky contents. Flanges on the rim and spout enabled paper or parchment covers to be tied on.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe earliest Netherlandish potters to set up delftware (tin-glazed earthenware) manufacture in England aimed specifically at the market for floor tiles and pharmacy jars. Both these types could be painted with cobalt blue and other oxide colours, which was of course essential for labelling pharmacy jars. The  albarello  (a tall jar for dry preparations of drugs, with a slim waist, which could easily be grasped on the shelf) and the footed jar for 'wet' drugs formed the two standard types. They were made continuously in England from the late 16th century. By 1800 delftware had given way to Staffordshire Pearlware. By the 1830s some Derbyshire brown stoneware drug pots were made, with metal lids and impressed names. During the 19th century prepared medicines in labelled glass bottles gradually became available.",
