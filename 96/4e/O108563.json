Its swelling shape shows the influence of the European Baroque style on the Ottoman decorative arts. Most metal coffee pots were made of cheaper materials such as tinned copper. In richer homes, coffee was served to honoured guests in pots like this one, made of precious metals (or imitations of them) and decorated in the latest taste. \n\nThe Ottoman Baroque style developed from the 1740s as artists and designers began to apply non-figurative European motifs to Ottoman forms. It flourished until the 1820s, when new types of European ornament were introduced.",
