The trough has a narrow ridge in the centre and the edges are grooved to hold the metal grater. On the other side is carved landscape with three trees in the background and the nude figure of Venus, seated by the side of a stream with two cupids. Above and below are symmetrical scrollwork designs with a mask and flowers, while at the narrow end is a scallop-shell. The cover is carved in relief with a basket of flowers, leaves and fruit, supported on a scallop-shell between two leafy scrolls.",

On the cover a basket of leaves, flowers and fruit supported on a scallop shell are depicted in relief. Snuff graters such as this were carved in some numbers in Dieppe in the mid-18th century, where there was a tradition of ivory carving, particularly of luxury items. A snuff rasp was used like a nutmeg grater for grating dried tobacco into snuff. A perforated metal section was fixed Inside the ivory cover for grating. Snuff-taking was a popular pastime in France for the wealthy and fashionable; it was thought by some that a regular dose could protect against the plague. The tobacco was grated from a solid tobacco roll known as a 'carotte'. The ivory carving on these rasps is relatively crude, while the subjects depicted, often mythological figures, or exotic ladies, are typical of decorative objects made from a rare and exotic material to be sold as luxury items.",
