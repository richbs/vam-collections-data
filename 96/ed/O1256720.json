            "public_access_description": "Beatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the  majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit  (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.\n\nAn artist himself, Rupert Potter (1832-1914) was probably the single greatest influence on his daughter's  enduring passion for the arts and natural history and on her development as a writer and illustrator. Rupert  took up photography in the 1860s when it was still a relatively new art form and was elected to the  Photographic Society of London in 1869. An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he later contributed to  photographic exhibitions.  Closely observed by Beatrix, Rupert assisted Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896),  a close friend, by photographing backgrounds for paintings and sitters for portraits. Excited by the possibilities  of the new art form, Beatrix too became an avid photographer, inheriting one of her father\u2019s old cameras, 'a  most inconveniently heavy article which he refuses to use, and which has been breaking my back since I took  to that profession' (Journal, Friday 19th April 1895).  Beatrix went on to employ photography in the service of  her own art and, like Millais, she photographed details, particularly in the Lake District landscapes, that she  later incorporated in her imaginative book illustrations.\n\nRupert's favourite subject was Beatrix herself and during the family's extended summer holidays it was her  delight to accompany her father on photographic expeditions.  Rupert photographed his beloved daughter at  home in London and on holidays in Scotland and the Lake District; formal and sombre among family and  friends but relaxed and playful among her pets. Photography was an expensive and  laborious process yet she appears to have endured patiently the elaborate choreography and the camera\u2019s  uncomfortably long exposure. Rupert's prolific legacy of several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial  account of Beatrix\u2019s life from infancy to marriage.",
