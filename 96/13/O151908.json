Millet produced many sketches of this type while staying at Vichy between 1866 and 1868. He would rent a carriage to explore the surrounding countryside, in particular the hilly uplands above Cusset, stopping frequently to make rapid pencil or ink drawings in small sketchbooks. These sketches were later re-worked in the studio when the artist added watercolour. The present work contains varying notations, in pencil, relating to landscape features and colours. This writing is visible beneath the washes of watercolour, further suggesting that the artist added the watercolour some time after he drew his subject.\n\nLandscapes without figures are rare in Millet's work, however, the wildness of this environment is tamed through subtle elements of human presence. For instance, beyond the foliage and a disused quarry, the hills are divided into farmed fields with a small house on the left skyline. These representations of peasant labour were common subjects for Millet, who praised the roles of labourers and illustrated the lowerclass with dignity.\n\nMillet was a founding member of the Barbizon school of painting whose members also included Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Th\u00e9odore Rousseau, and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny. The group advocated a push toward Naturalism and utilized muted tonalities, looseness, and soft rendurings.",
