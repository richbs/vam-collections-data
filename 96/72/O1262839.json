Although he performed all over the British isles, he was best known in East Anglia and the North of England.  He played Dame in pantomime and married Gertrude Orchard, who played Principal Boy. The figures were a gift from his son, along with an archive relating to Will Judge's career, although it contains no reference to him working as a Punch and Judy man.\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King.  Punch originally had a wife called Joan, but by the 19th century she had become Judy.",
