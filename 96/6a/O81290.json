The seat rails are tenoned to the front legs and back stiles, the side rails secured with single small round pegs to the front legs and with square pegs to the back stiles. The back and front rails are not pegged. The back corner joints are reinforced with triangular mahogany blocks fixed with hand-cut(?) nails; the front corner joints with ogee-shaped mahogany blocks just glued in place.\nThe back stiles are tenoned to the top rail, and the splat is joined by a back-level bare-faced tenon to the top rail and by a front-level bare-faced tenon to the back rail. The back rail is shaped as though with a shoe on top, but in one piece.\nThe front legs have ears glued in place and nailed to the front/side rail above; they are chiselled quite fussily on the back face.\n\nThis chair appears to be a 19th-century reproduction, rather than an eighteenth-century piece inspired by Chippendale's design. The wood is extremely clean, and very pale where not stained; and there is very little wear. \nThe back of the chair is also extremely close to the engraving, with every detail of the design replicated.\nOther grounds for suspicion include the use of pegs to secure the side rails but not for the front rail (implying a wish to avoid visible pegs on the front face of the chair, which is not an 18th-century sort of preoccupation); the very small and circular pegs (at the front); and the ogee-shaped front glue-blocks (which are not apparently replacements for earlier blocks). The use of hand-cut nails in the triangular back corner blocks is overtly in the chairs' favour, but not conclusive evidence of an 18th-century date.\nThe chair is also remarkably light (by comparison with, for example, W.67-1940).\n[Drop-in chair-seat] The side rails are tenoned to the front and back rails. It is upholstered with modern webbing, of black jute for the warp and white cotton for the weft and selvage-warp, the weft woven double (because of the modern technique of throwing it from one side).\n*my notes also refer to '8 brown warp-threads'; this and the weave (plain or twill) need checking (LMW, 6/6/2003).\n\nSeat no. IIII is now placed in chair no. V, and vice versa. Seat IIII does not fit properly in chair IIII.",

When the Museum acquired the chair, with three others and a matching armchair, it was believed to have been made in about 1760. However, it is now thought that the chairs were made at least a hundred years later, partly because they show very little sign of wear. They also replicate every detail of Chippendale's design, whereas an 18th-century maker would often copy a design more freely. The five chairs formerly belonged to the theatre designer and furniture historian Percy Macquoid, and were given to the Museum by his widow in 1925. Macquoid was the author of the first major history of English furniture (published 1904--08), but even he made occasional mistakes.",
