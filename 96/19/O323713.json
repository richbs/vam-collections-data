The accompanying jewellery included large spoon-shaped earrings, silver waistcoat buttons, and brass appliqu\u00e9s of cows on their belts and braces, very similar to the one on this clasp.  They also wore oval silver clasps to hold their neck scarves in place, with the two ends tucked through the horizontal bar on the back.  The silver mark '13' shows that this one was made in Germany, possibly in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.  Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd was the major centre for small silver work of all kinds throughout the southern German-speaking region in the 19th century, and was the source of most of the filigree buttons worn with Appenzell Sennen costume in the 18th century.\n\nIt was described as an 18th century dress ornament from Berne when it was acquired for the Museum, in Lausanne, in 1870.",
