After James Gillray\u2019s death 1815, he became the leading political caricaturist of the day. In the 1820s he turned to book illustration, receiving many commissions to provide plates for novels; the success of Dickens's <i>Sketches</i> by Box (1830) was largely due to Cruikshank's designs. In the 1840s his success and reputation declined, especially with the advent of <i>Punch</i> (1841). Many of his later works are concerned with the cause of temperance, and he enjoyed considerable success with his series of prints 'The Bottle' (1847). A prolific maker of prints during a long working life (there is an extensive collection in the V&A), the number of works in oil is small; he exhibited eight at the RA between 1830 and 1867 and 15 at the BI 1833-60, the subjects principally literary and genre. Died London 1 February 1878; a good deal of his studio collection was presented to the V &A by his second wife Eliza. \n\nLIT: G Reid <i>A Descriptive Catalogue of the Works of George Cruikshank</i> 3 vols, 1871; W Bates <i>George Cruikshank</i> 1878; B Jerrold <i>The Life of George Cruikshank</i> new ed 1898; A Cohn <i>George Cruikshank: a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9</i> 1924; <i>The Inimitable George Cruikshank</i> University of Louisville Libraries, Kentucky, USA, exhibition catalogue 1968; W Feaver <i>George Cruikshank</i> V&A exhibition catalogue 1974; H and M Evans <i>The Man Who Drew the Drunkard's Daughter </i>... 1978; M Wynn <i>George Cruikshank: His Life and London</i>1978; G Buchanan-Brown <i>The Book Illustrations of George Cruikshank</i> Newton Abbot 1980\n\nMrs George Cruikshank \nAL8769 \nCardboard, 22.6 x 17.5 cm (8 7/8 x 6 7/8 ins) \nSigned 'George Cruikshank' br \nPresented by Mrs George Cruikshank 1891 \n\nThe artist married his second wife, Eliza Widdison, in 1850. His epitaph in St Paul's Cathedral concludes with lines written by her, dated 9 February 1880: 'This Monument/Is humbly placed within this sacred Fane/By her who loved him best, his widowed wife'. \n\nA portrait of the artist's mother, by an unknown artist, also bequeathed by Mrs George Cruikshank, is also in the V&A collections (366-1891).\"",
