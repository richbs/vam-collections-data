One of these end terminals is covered by a decorative plate of filigree scrolls.

In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nBracelets like this, made from a number of decorative chains arranged side by side to form a flat band and gathered into a solid plaque at each end concealing a pin fastening, were mainly worn by urban women, rather than tribal people.  The earliest had solid metal clasps, but filigree clasps, either applied to sheet metal, like this, or of open filigree, became immensely popular with tourists in the 19th century, and are still being made in the region today.  \n\nThe double pin of the clasp and the pattern of little domes hinged together are both characteristic of bracelets from the Syrian region in the 19th century.",
