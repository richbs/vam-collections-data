At the knee they are trimmed with a panel of bobbin lace insertion re-embroidered with an undulating floral trail in whitework and edged with a lace bordered frill. They are trimmed on the outside of the leg with a white satin ribbon bow. They fasten at the centre back with two linen-covered buttons. They are open at the crotch.\n\nCamisole with a wide triangular neckline lace-edged with ribbon threaded through and below a wide pointed lace yoke embroidered with a whitework floral band. The armholes are edged with lace. The garment is shaped with hem-stitched darts and seams. Below the waist band, hemstitched filled, is a brief flaring band.

She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.",
