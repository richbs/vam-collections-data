A model construction kit, it consisted of perforated metal strips, plates and girders, with wheels, pulleys, gears, shaft collars and axles for mechanisms and motion, with nuts and bolts to connect pieces. It was designed so that the only tools necessary for assembly were a screwdriver and spanners. The name Meccano was patented in 1907, and was manufactured in England until 1980. It was designed to be a constructional and educational toy and is still manufactured today, in France, and since its inception has utilised new technologies as they became available, such as electric motors and lights.\n\nThis particular construction, of an articulated lorry with electric motor and light, controlled by a remote, was designed and made by Peter MacDomnic, in 1978. He was aged 15, and had been suffering from leukaemia for nearly three years. He died a few weeks after completing it.",
