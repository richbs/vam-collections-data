At each stop, they would be required to describe the events happening in the illustration and it is possible that forfeits and rewards would be given depending on each.  It is possible to given forfeits and rewards to each squares and some are more obvious that others such as a fire or ship wreck go backwards or perhaps start again.\n\n*The illustrations are quite unusual - fire, for example, is illustrated by a volcano, a burning farm and a pit explosion, and optics is represented by a giant telescope, a magic lantern show  and the perspective of a tunnel.\n\nRules placement: possibly in booklet",
