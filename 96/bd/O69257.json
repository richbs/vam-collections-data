            "public_access_description": "In contrast to traditional stained glass, which was coloured with metallic oxides when molten, this fragment was decorated using a technique introduced to England in the early part of the 14th century. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in the kiln, the silver compound would turn yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown-black pigment. Since the technique reduced the amount of leading required, it allowed greater freedom of composition.\n\nThis fragment shows the head of Jesus Christ wearing the Crown of Thorns and surrounded by radiating lines. This would have come from a larger image showing a devotional image relating to the Passion of Christ. It may perhaps have been an image of Christ carrying the Cross.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church.
