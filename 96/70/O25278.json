His performance as a bare backed horse rider in the ring of Quinette's circus in Southport drew rave reviews. \"The minature pony, Firefly, ridden by this infant prodigy now leaps fire gates, whilst the rider remains seated upon his back and goes through a difficult performance with the utmost composure.\"\n\n The V&A was given a small collection of medals awarded to Fred Fitzroy and a photograph of him aged about 12 is in the Theatre Museum. The medal itself was mass produced by a manufacturer in Birmingham and then probably commissioned from a local jeweller in Southport. It was specially engraved to present to Fred in recognition of his outstanding performance.",
