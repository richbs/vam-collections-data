The black and white bus artwork, featuring the destinations 'Nowhere' and 'Boredom', is typical of Sex Pistols desire to be seen as being, and representing, angry young men with no purpose. A white on black version of the buses is used on the rear sleeve of the single.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this poster, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
