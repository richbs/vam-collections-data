            "public_access_description": "Lustre pigments were used on glass vessels before they were used on ceramics. Glassmakers in Egypt were using them in the period 700-800, when this piece was made. Here they have been applied as a brown and yellow vine-scroll design on both the inside and outside of the clear glass. This two-colour combination is also found on the earliest lustre-decorated ceramics.\n\nThe technique of lustre decoration on ceramics was first developed in Iraq in the 9th century. The basic technique for both glass and ceramics was the same. A vessel (glazed if ceramic) was made in the normal way. When the piece had cooled, the design was painted on in metallic compounds. The piece was then fired again, this time with a restricted supply of oxygen. In these conditions, the metallic compounds broke down, and a thin deposit of copper or silver was left on the surface of the glaze. When polished, this surface layer reflected the light.",

These 8th or 9th century creations generally feature sketchy figurative or vegetal patterns, and sometimes inscriptions in cursive or kufic calligraphy. By applying pigments to both sides of open-shaped vessels, glassmakers highlighted details or outlines and exploited the transparent glass wall in order to create shading effects. This type of glass decoration was probably developed by Coptic craftsmen who settled in Egypt but it is likely such glass was also made in Syria.",
