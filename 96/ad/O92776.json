Katherine Bateman has attempted to explain the iconography as 'an allegorical statement of man's unending inner struggle, his fight against evil in the human soul', with the centaurs symbolising the two sides of man, those of good and evil, shooting arrows of temptation towards their victims. \nfrom the catalogue for <font -u>English Romanesque Art 1066-1200</font -u>, Hayward Gallery London, 1984.\nThe silver mounts are probably of early 19th century date.\nIt is likely that the present front of the box was originally the back, due to some holes now filled with wood plugs.\n\nHistorical significance: The centaur was commonplace in Romanesque art, both as a representation of Sagittarius and as a symbol of moral struggle. In the latter connection the centaur had often been interpreted as standing for the two sides of man, his lower half connected with the baser animal instincts, the upper with his rational, benign nature.",
