This one was the only one to be published in the Emperor's lifetime. It is a fictional story set to an allegorical poem of the adventures of a knight whilst on a journey to meet his betrothed 'Ehrenreich'. During the journey, he encounters his three enemies Furwittig, Unfalo, and Neidelharta. The tale is a  fictional version of the Emperor's own journey to meet his betrothed Maria von Burgundy (the daughter of Charles the Bold). 'Theuerdank' means 'Knight of Adventurous Thoughts'. \n\nThe book was printed in Augsburg in 1517 in an edition of 40 on parchment and 300 on paper by Hans Schonsperger. It was only distributed after Maximilian's death in 1519. \n\nThe 118 illustrations were contributed by at least three artists, Hans Burgkmair, Leonhard Beck and Hans Sch\u00e4uffelein. The designs were cut by Jost de Negker's large team of block-cutters.",
