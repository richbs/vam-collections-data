The 'fliers' were attached to wires and swung out over the auditorium, where they dropped flowers onto the audience.   \nEven so simple a costume carries clues as to the time in which it was made; the body shape, which is less streamlined than today, colour, fabric and lozenge pattern are all typical of the period and the leg openings are cut straight across, whereas today they would be cut upwards, into the hip, to make the legs look longer.  \nWhereas a costume worn by a star performer or a particularly stunning design might be preserved, theatre costumes of this style and period, worn by a succession of unknown performers, are comparatively rare.  They might go into the theatre stock wardrobe and worn until they fell to pieces, or just thrown out to make room because noone thought they were of any interest.  A few, like this costume, were saved by people who worked in the theatre or their friends.",
