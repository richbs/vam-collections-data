In the foreground the figure stands on a green ground on which grow naturalistically rendered flowering plants.  An additional strip of paper (c.0.5 cm) has been added along the lower edge and painted in an olive green.\n      The man has a moustache and a short beard which is greying along the jaw-line up to close-cropped hair beneath an orange and green turban crossed with a grey and cream striped band.  A cameo with a pendant pearl is attached at the front.  He wears an ivory-coloured <i>jama</i> with orange edgings and lappets under his right arm.  His <i>patka</i> is gold with a half-drop pattern of pink flowers above a mauve band and gold fringe.  He has a punch dagger (<i>katar</i>) thrust through his <i>patka</i> ornamented in chevron bands of green, red and white as is the straight <i>talwar</i> sword in a purple sheath which is hung from his waist.  He also has a rounded black shield with six ornamental bosses hanging from a strap slung round his neck.  His <i>paijama</i> are gold with purple tulip-like flowers worn above a pair of maroon-coloured shoes.\n      The frame is made of plain dark blue paper strips and the ivory-coloured border is decorated with alternate lilies and poppies, lacking the usual outlining and detailing in gold seen in the majority of the similar floral borders in the album.  Moreover, in this border the central petal of the lily flowers points upwards above two pairs of dark green leaves.       The page is edged with strips of  buff-coloured paper.  A strip of beige-coloured woven textile has been stuck over the abraded remains of the inner paper margin to act as a gutter for the binding of the album. The edges of the page have been gilded.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.\n      The sitter has been identified as Abdu'l Hadi (died1647), <i>mir bakhshi</i> to Shah Jahan, a post which oversaw all <i>mansab</i>( rank) awards and intelligence. An Iranian who arrived at court after 1613,  he was a military commander who was given the title Asalat Khan in 1630, becoming <i>mir bakhshi</i> to Shah Jahan, a post which oversaw all <i>mansab</i> (rank) awards and intelligence.  See Stronge, 2002, p.158, in which the author dates the painting to ca.1640-1647, pointing out, however, the archaic style of the painting which relates to the middle of Jahanghir's reign.  Although the flowering plants are in this style, the costume details in the half-drop repeat textile patterns belong to the reign of Shah Jehan.\n      An alternative identification for the sitter is that of Baqir Khan Najm Sani, another Iranian, who achieved office under Jahanghir from 1612 rising from <i>faujdar</i> (commandant) in Multan to governorships of Multan, Agra, Awadh, Orissa, Gujarat, Delhi, Jaunpur and finally of Allahabad where he died in 1637-1638 (AH1047).
