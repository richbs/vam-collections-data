The walnut doors into which the panels are set are now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.\nOn acquisition this group of sketch models was considered especially important as a record of the original working models produced by a sculptor. The plaster cast represent a stage in Steven's method of production: they include figure studies, designs for metalwork and ceilings, details of fireplaces, stoves, fenders, etc.\n\nA sculptor, designer and painter, Alfred Stevens (1817/18-1875) rejected contemporary distinctions between fine art and design. From 1850 to 1857 he was chief designer to Hoole &amp; Co., Sheffield, where he produced award-winning designs for metalwork, majolica, terracotta ornaments and chimney-pieces. Perhaps his two greatest works were the decorations for the dining-room at Dorchester House, London (about 1856), for which he made countless drawings inspired by the Italian High Renaissance style, in particular the work of Michelangelo and the monument to the Duke of Wellington for St Paul's Cathedral, London, which was completed after his death. The two allegorical groups from this monument made a lasting impact on the New Sculpture movement. \nThe influence of the Italian Renaissance is evident in much of Steven's work, and is perhaps best reflected in the Wellington monument.\n\nDorchester House was a stately mansion in Park Lane built in 1853 by Robert Stayner Holford, a wealthy landowner, art collector, and a Member of Parliament. Alfred Stevens designed and executed the fittings for Dorchester House between 1863 and 1865. The mansion was demolished in 1929.",
