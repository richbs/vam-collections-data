This loving cup, however, does not have the handles that allowed the cup to be passed easily from person to person. It was probably intended to be a purely decorative piece.\n\nIt is the work of Harold Stabler (1872-1945), a versatile designer who worked in several different media. As a master silversmith, he reinvigorated several long-neglected techniques. For example he made designs for silver objects engraved and inlaid with ivory and coloured enamels. This cup has a carved, ivory stem and the coloured enamelled decoration that was a feature of Arts and Crafts metalwork. It also combines the traditional silverwork techniques of piercing, chasing and casting.",
