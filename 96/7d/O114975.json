The dress shows 2 false pockets at the front. Three welt seams emphasise each constructional section: the bodice cut under the bust, and the 2 parts of the skirt. The hem of the dress is also welted to give the desired rigidity. \nAndr\u00e9 Courreges was born in France in 1923. After a brief career in engineering, he turned to fashion and joined Balenciaga with whom he worked from 1949 to 1961. From Balenciaga he learned to search for a pure, simple and sharp line. Courreges' clothes were sharp, angular and mathematically designed.",
