It has sometimes been suggested that this was originally a Chinese tea cannister made in around 1680, and that the handle and spout were added in England in about 1750. Physical analysis of the teapot, however, undermines this theory. The analysis from the London assay office carried out in 1984 states that the body and spout are made from silver of the same standard, but the lid is made of a different grade of silver. It seems that the object was made as a teapot in China, and the lid may be a later replacement.",
