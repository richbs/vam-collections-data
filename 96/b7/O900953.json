The dedication is addressed to Richard Jones, the Earl and Viscount of Ranelagh, who, at the time of the dedication, was at the height of his career. Along with his hereditary title, he was a member of the House of Commons and Paymaster General of the Forces. Throughout his career the Viscount was a lover of the arts, and these engravings of de Moelder were doubtless a fine addition to his collection. Nine years after the dedication of de Moelder\u2019s book, the Viscount was dismissed from both his positions after it was discovered that he had stolen upwards of \u00a3900,000 from the crown. In the engraving, the naturalistic and architectural are cleverly combined to produce an effect of elegant and sophisticated design. The resultant effect from the combination of these two elements is similar to that found in Rome\u2019s Trevi Fountain, built a few years after this print was published.",
