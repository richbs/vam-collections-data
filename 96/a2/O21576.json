Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is a ball juggler, who was quite complicated to operate since the balls can be juggled to rest on his feet, hands or head. He would have been a very popular turn in a marionette music hall show, and is wearing his original costume.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, whose widow sold them to The Theatre Museum after his death in 1998.\n\nThis marionette was used as Signor Spaghetti di Sorrento, the Italian Juggler! in the Variety performance preceding the production of <I>The Floating Beacon</I> at the Theatre Museum in April 2004.",

The carver of this object has been distinguished as Maker C from its strongly carved and detailed ears.",
