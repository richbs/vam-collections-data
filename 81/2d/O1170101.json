Dear John, We think you should be sacked because: you have made the Nottingham Playhouse the best English theatre outside London. Beacause: you are a devoted, hardworking, loyal, creative, intelligent man. Because: you will not be bullied. Because: you have consistently filled the theatre for four years. Because: your disgusting taste in ties shows you up to be what we've always suspected. Because: your actors and your staff have every confidence in you. Because: Nottingham people enjoy the plays you present. Because: you failed to put on The Mousetrap, Chou Chin Chow, and The Desert song - thereby not satisfying the taste of ourselves and our good ladies. Because: there were no amateur productions for our children to take part in. But most of all we think you should be sacked because: you brooked no interference from stupid, boring, ugly, puritanical, empty-headed, snobbish, empty-handed oafs like ourselves, who hate your sort of theatre and all its stands for. Yours sincerely, Supporters of the Theatre Truss.",
