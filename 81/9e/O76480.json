The decoration at the edge has been applied and was not part of the original casting. It incorporates masks and gadrooning (convex fluting)  based on silver prototypes.  Silver plates of this design were fashionable in England from the 1730s up to about 1820.  English pewterers took up the design after its introduction by silversmiths. Most  pewter examples were made between 1765 and 1785. They were more expensive than the usual plain rim.\n\nPeople\nGeorge Bacon was a London pewterer who registered his mark in 1746.  Plates of this type were one of his trade specialities. He worked in the Strand.  Like many English pewterers, his marks included a pun on his surname.  They consist of his name and a large wild pig on a wreath.",
