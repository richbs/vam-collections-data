Around the bottom are embroidered mountains, the waves with the ba bao and the li shui.\n\nThe sleeves have evidently been altered with inserts of yellow silk damask with a cloud pattern, and the cuffs and collar are of embroidered blue silk. The cloud and wave design on the cuffs is different from that on the collar, which again is different from that on the robe itself. Also the robe, although well decorated is by no means over-cluttered, with symbols etc.",

The wave and li shui design on the robe is certainly of the mid-18th century style, as is the design of the tall, thin mountain. The clouds are in the style of mid-18th century design, being long and straggling usually with a pointed 'tail'. On this basis it could well have been an 18th century robe with later alterations to the sleeves and probably the collar. Also the robe, although well decorated is by no means over-cluttered, with symbols etc.\n\nIt is difficult to decide whether or not this is a lady's robe, as the sleeves have been altered (the lining coincides with these alterations), but as it is not slit at the front and back, and is embroidered with peaches (only 2 of our male robes have peaches as part of the decoration), it would seem not unreasonable to assume this to be a lady's robe.",

The face of the main front facing dragon is too broad (which may be the result of very bad joining), and faces of the two <i>xinglong</i> are very poorly executed as well, and do not resemble dragon motifs of the Yongzheng period; also, again, these dragon designs do not match the ones adorning the collar trim. \n(Yueh-Siang Chang 22 April 2009)",
