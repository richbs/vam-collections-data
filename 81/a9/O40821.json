Kalagas, pictorial textile hangings, with religious or secular themes were used either as decorative wall hangings, to partition a room or, by the Burmese, on festive occasions to form a screen outside. \n\nThis hanging, made of red baize with appliqu\u00e9 designs of shaped coloured fabrics (partly painted), white gimp braid and silver sequins, illustrates episodes from the popular Ummadanti Jataka (one of the stories recounting the Buddha's former lives). The costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay Court of about 1880.  \n\nBritain's control of Burma extended as the 19th century progressed, and the country was annexed in 1885. The extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the middle of the 19th century.",
