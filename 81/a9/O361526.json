The silk is half a yard wide.  The dress is pieced or patched on the right front of the skirt with a panel of matching blue damask with part of a lace pattern. The skirt is pieced on both sides of the front with two portions of plain light weight blue silk lining. Probably a re-make of an earlier dress.\n\nOpen front with a bodice with darts at the shoulders, hip length stitched robings, an 'English' back and sleeves with plain stitches on cuffs. The skirt is open and the pleats are narrow and stay-stitched. The hem is straight. There is a pocket slit in each side-seam which is seamed.  The bodice is lined with linen and the skirt is lined with plain wool worsted. There are two rows of tapes attached at the bottom of the bodice to fasten. There are 6 breadths of 15.5 inches and one of 12 inches in the skirt giving a total width of 105 inches.",
