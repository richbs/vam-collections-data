Harlequin and Tom Thumb!, or, Merlin The Magician and the Good Fairies of the Court of King Arthur was by all accounts a splendid pantomime, with brilliant set designs supervised by the well-known scene designer William Beverley, and remarkable costumes and the pantomime 'big heads' designed by the artist, sculptor, mask and property maker and costume designer known as Dykwynkyn. 'Big heads' traditionally featured in the opening of pantomimes at this date, and their design was a speciality of Dykwynkyn's. \n\nThe Knights in Tom Thumb appeared in 'The Banqueting Hall in the Palace of King Arthur', the scene in the Harlequinade in which Tom Thumb lived in King Arthur's Court. This design is entitled 'Flemish Bricks and Dutch Metal'.  The Knights with the cockerel on their banner and shield relate to the 'Flemish Bricks' of the title, while that with the kettles on his shield relate to the 'Dutch Metal'.",
