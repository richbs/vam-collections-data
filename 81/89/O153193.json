It has a light brown ground which was originally mauve and has a wide lobed lattice woven in metal thread on cream silk core; each compartment contains a floral spray of one flower and two buds in metal thread on a white silk core.\nWarp: mauve silk, Z-twist\nWeft: mauve silk, Z-twist \nMetal thread: silver strip open S-wound on cream silk and also on white silk.\nThis has been edged on four sides with another woven silk and metal thread fabric, possibly a sash. It is weft-faced with a twill binding  and is made-up from 7 pieces.  It is 5 cm wide and the pattern is incomplete.  It has a 'gold' metal thread ground decorated with a series of niches delineated in  'silver' metal thread.  Each niche contains an indistinct mass of red and mauve blossoms which alternate so that red is at the bottom and mauve at the top in one motif and mauve is at the top and red at the bottom in the next motif.  Down either side these motifs are incomplete because the pattern includes stripes/bands below the niches.  These are a series of narrow red and 'silver' lines either side of a 'silver' band running across the 'gold' ground.\nWarp: red silk\nWeft: red, mauve, blue and dark green silk\nMetal thread: silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk core ['gold'] and around a white silk core ['silver']\nFacing: blue silk satin\nBacking: white ground roller printed with a very, very small  black or dark brown sprig of one flower and a pair of leaves, off-set.",
