It might have been chosen for a woman's gown, a man's waistcoat or a nightgown, worn informally at home. The complexity of its woven structure would have made it expensive, while its bold pattern and distinctive colouring date it to a fairly brief period when such a combination was highly fashionable.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis silk shows what a bold visual effect a brocaded damask could achieve. The designer has set brightly-coloured plant forms against a background of more formal architectural-type motifs whose subtle lines become apparent with the reflection of light. This was a typical juxtaposition of effects in fashionable silks of the early 1700s, which showed a particular exoticism which has been given the name 'bizarre'. This silk shows an English interpretation of the style. Influences included the highly patterned textiles and other decorative objects imported into Europe by the East India companies.\n\nPlace\nThis silk was acquired by the Museum in 1864 as Italian. Its design considered at that time too exotic to be English. But we now know from the signed and dated designs of the master weaver and designer, James Leman, that fabrics like this were woven in Spitalfields, in London.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nAcquired by the Museum in 1864 as Italian, this silk was recognised as English workmanship largely through the study of the English silk industry by Peter Thornton and Natalie Rothstein, whose research on the subject culminated in Silk Designs of the Eighteenth Century in the Collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum (1990). Thornton and Rothstein's work established that throughout the first half of the eighteenth century dress silks designed and woven in Spitalfields were of a quality to rival imported fabrics from France, but with a uniquely English character to their design. The exotic pattern of this example is typical of the taste for the bizarre in textile design in Europe at the beginning of the eighteenth century, though the English interpretation of the bizarre style was less extreme than the French or Italian.\n\nLit.
