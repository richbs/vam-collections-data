After his death, the Empress delayed the birth of her child until she had brought the campaign to a successful conclusion; then Ojin was born, becoming Emperor at his birth. For 69 years however, the Empress acted as Regent, Ojin only assuming the reins of government at her death, A.D.270. The Prime Minister is said to have lived to the age of 283 or 306.",
