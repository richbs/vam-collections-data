In an article of 1867 the playwright T.W. Robertson described him as 'the presiding genius of all theatrical Christmas revels.'\n\nFor his pantomime work Keene used the name Dykwynkyn which he often characteristically signed on an artist's palette on the ground. He was also responsible for designs for a number of other lavish productions of the day, and for these he was billed as Mr. R.W. Keene.",
