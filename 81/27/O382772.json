The throne has robust legs and uprights, with a pierced trellis back; the Virgin's feet rest upon an arcade, and she is seated upon two richly decorated cusions.The Virgin is further identified by the inscription above the throne, 'Mother of God'. Each wing depicts a standing and nimbed bishop saint wearing ecclesiastical vestments and holding in their veiled left hand a Gospel book with a decorated cover. Each figure is identified by their inscriptions. That on the right is one of the Fathers of the Church, St Gregory of Nazianzos, known as St Gregory the Theologian, who gestures to the book with his right hand:  that on the left is another of the Fathers of the Church, St John Chrysostom, who raises his right hand in blessing. \nOn the exterior: Each of the wings is decorated with a ribbed processional cross, at the centre and at the end of each arm is a rosette. Each cross is flanked by the inscription 'Jesus Christ Conquers'. Each wing is later stamped with a shield bearing armorials, possibly those of the Pisani or Riva family of Venice.",
