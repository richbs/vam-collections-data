This game is a computerized version of the popular board game, Scrabble, a word game in which two to four players score points by forming words from individual lettered tiles on a game board marked by a 15x15 grid. Computer Scrabble was published by Virgin Games Ltd, a British video game publisher, for the Amstrad colour personal computer. The computer was one of three market leading home computers in the 1980s along with the Spectrum ZX and the Commodore 64. Virgin Games Ltd was formed in 1981 and became much larger after purchasing the budget label, Mastertronic in 1987. In 1994 it was renamed Virgin Interactive and is now part of the larger Virgin Group.",
