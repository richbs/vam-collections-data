Before the development of modern medicine, fevers, cramps and toothache could be painful and dangerous. Childbirth could kill mother or child.  Many people believed that the supernatural powers embodied in an amulet could promote fertility and good health and offer protection against malign forces or the 'evil eye'.  Although the Catholic Church was opposed to the pagan nature of many amulets, it was powerless to prevent their use.\n\nAmulets gain their power to protect from harm, or attract good fortune, from their colour, pattern or material.  Pieces of material carved to a point, like all sharp or dangerous things, were believed to have the ability to protect against the evil eye.  This amulet, called a cuerno or horn in Spanish, comes from Cordoba in Andalusia.",
