The drawing, which shows a wall of fitted wardrobes and a fireplace, is typical of Mackintosh's simple designs for bedrooms. Mackintosh has written notes along the bottom of the drawing, which describe the different features of the room. Mackintosh was an accomplished painter and this drawing shows his graphic skills and style.\n\nPlace\nThe Hill House was designed for the Glasgow publisher Walter W. Blackie.  Blackie wanted a 'practical house' and Mackintosh designed every detail. He planned the living spaces before he did the exterior elevations.  The outside of the house is derived from the Scottish vernacular but the inside is very innovative.  The L-shaped bedroom was divided into two distinct spaces, one containing the bed and wardrobes and the other, shown in this drawing, also intended to be used as a dayroom by Mrs Blackie.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe wardrobes and door in this design are decorated with squares of leaded glass, which add some colour. The rigid geometric patterns Mackintosh uses in this design were a move away from the stylised naturalistic decoration of his earlier work.",
