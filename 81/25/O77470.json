The obverse shows the bust in profile to the right of the King, wearing armour and a fur-lined mantle, with the abbreviated Latin inscription which can be translated as 'Gustaf III by the Grace of God King of Sweden'. The reverse shows a rectangular sarcophagus surmounted by a crowned vase on which rays from a constellation descend. On the right is the figure of Fame, and behind her symbols of Peace. On the left a naked boy points to the scene of Gustaf's assassination depicted on the front of the sarcophagus.\n\nPeople\nGustaf III was a dominant, indeed autocratic, ruler, whose political actions became increasingly unpopular among the Swedish nobility. A conspiracy to murder him was hatched by a group of aristocrats in 1792. At a fancy dress ball held at the Royal Opera in Stockholm on 16 March 1792, J.J. Anckarstr\u00f6m shot the King in the back. The wound was fatal, and Gustaf died on 29 March.\n\nPeople\nConrad Heinrich K\u00fcchler (active 1763-1821) worked for Matthew Boulton (1728-1807), the Birmingham industrialist and entrepreneur. K\u00fcchler was Belgian by birth, but settled in Britain in about 1790, and worked for Boulton at the Soho Mint until about 1806.",
