There had been a 19th-century craze for Staffordshire earthenware figurines of performers and Agatha Walker's work echoed this tradition. Her figurines, produced as limited editions, were modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 her figurines were exhibited at London's Fine Arts Society.\n\nIt represents Edith Evans (1886-1961) as Mrs. Sullen in George Farquhar's comedy The Beaux' Stratagem, Lyric Theatre Hammersmith, 20 January 1927.  Edith Evans made her first professional stage appearance in 1912 but made her name by her  performance as Millamant in The Way of the World at the Lyric Theatre in 1924. She took leading roles was with the Old Vic for the 1925-1926 season but returned to the Lyric to play Mrs. Sullen in The Beaux' Stratagem.  This was another successful production for Sir Nigel Playfair, the owner of the theatre who had purchased its lease as a derelict building in 1918 and transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",
