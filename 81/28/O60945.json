Padmapani is one of the bodhisattvas,  enlightened beings who voluntarily postpons passing into nirvana in order to help others gain salvation.   The concept of the boddhisattva was developed in the Mahayanist school of Buddhist thought and gained enormous popularity in the Himalayas.  The stillness and serenity of this figure speaks of the state of harmony to which the boddhisattva aspires, while the sensuous contrapposto of Padmapani's sleek, androgynous body ties him to the human world.",

His left is ready to support the stem of the lotus ('padma'), but this is now missing.\n\nNewar craftsmen made this finely jewelled image for Tibetan patrons, probably in Shigatse, southern Tibet, where it was acquired. It exemplifies the long tradition, beginning in the 7th century AD, of Newar craftsmen from the Kathmandu Valley working for Tibetan patrons in Tibet itself.\n\nBodhisattva Padmapani\nNepal\nLate 14th-early 15th century, Malla period\nGilt copper inlaid with precious & semi-precious stones, ht. 93 cm\nV&A IM.239-1922\n\nThe Buddhist lord of compassion, Avalokitesvara, is represented in his popular manifestation as Padmapani, the Lotus Bearer. Padmapani is one of the Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who voluntarily postpone passing into nirvana in order to help others gain salvation. The concept of the Bodhisattva was developed in the Mahayanist school of Buddhist thought and gained enormous popularity in the Himalayas and the greater Asian world. The stillness and serenity of this figure speaks of the state of harmony to which the Bodhisattva aspires, while the flexed and sensuous links him to the human world. The Bodhisattva\u2019s right hand is lowered in the gesture of granting wishes (varadamudra). His left hand is poised to support the stem of the lotus (padma), but this is now missing. The figure is richly adorned with jewellery detailing inset with precious and semi-precious stones. He wears a five-pointed diadem surrounding his elaborate raised hair (jatamukuta) which is surmounted by a small image of the Buddha Amitabha, of whom Avalokitesvara Padmapani is seen as an emanation.\n\nNewar craftsmen made this finely jewelled image for Tibetan patrons, probably in Shigatse, central Tibet, where it was acquired. It exemplifies the long tradition, beginning in the 7th century CE, of Newar craftsmen from the Kathmandu Valley working for Tibetan patrons in Tibet. This masterpiece of Newari metal-casting was acquired by Brigadier-General C.G. Rawlings at Shigatse in 1904, whilst en route to Lhasa as part of the British Younghusband expedition. It is recorded that several members of the expedition acquired examples of \u2018Lamaist\u2019 art in the course of this journey.",
