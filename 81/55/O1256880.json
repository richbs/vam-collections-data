They were both influenced by the hands-on teaching methods of Swiss pedagogue Yohann Pestalozzi. He wanted children to learn by observing, touching, and experimenting with the things around them. At Cheam, Elizabeth and Charles developed a practical curriculum including these \u2018object lessons\u2019.\nThe lessons in this book guide children through increasingly complex observations and deductions. Early lessons include observing the flammable properties of India rubber by 'setting it on fire' and smelling coffee beans and pepper corns. Later, children were expected to develop skills of categorisation and discriminating judgement. \nMayo's books were extremely popular, and object lessons soon entered standard classroom practice, being canonised into the curriculum after the establishment of the School Boards in the 1870s. Unfortunately, in this context the lessons became catechistic and formulaic, and images often replaced the real objects of study.",
