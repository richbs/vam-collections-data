Although the cheongsam is based on the traditional qipao, and in its traditional form, silk was the favoured material used in tailoring. By the twentieth century it had evolved into a modern one-piece form-fitting dress, and other types of fabrics were experimented with. \n\nThis modern cheongsam captures the fashion of the 1960s with its psychedelic print, which is in turn enhanced by the shimmering effect of the velvet. It closes to the side and has a small stand-up collar with a square edge. The neck fastens at the front with a decorative knot and loop button and a similar button closes the dress at the collarbone level. The darts under the bust at the front of the dress are a feature of western tailoring.",
