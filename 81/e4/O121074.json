The room has wooden panelling and two paintings can be seen hanging on the far wall.  To the right of the image two steps lead up to another room off the main bed chamber.  The door is open and two men stand in its shadow.  Behind them can be seen a group of four men kneeling in prayer.  Thirteen paintings are visible on the walls of the chamber and two light fittings with candles hang from the ceiling.",

Everyone in the group had attended the art school run by James Mathew Leigh and other members included: William Frederick Yeames, Philip Hermogenes Calderon, George Dunlop Leslie, Henry Stacy Marks, George Adolphus Storey, and John Evan Hodgson.  With the exception of Leslie, everyone in the Clique specialised in what is now called \u2018historical genre\u2019, paintings set broadly within medieval and Renaissance times featuring historical, domestic, or romantic incident.\n\nThis oil painting of Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658), lord protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland, was exhibited as \u2018Oliver Cromwell The Night Before His Death\u2019 in 1867 at the Royal Academy of Art.  It is based on a passage in the writings of Thomas Carlyle (1795\u20131881), the nineteenth-century author, biographer, and historian.  Solemn subjects such as this were typical of Wynfield\u2019s work.\n\nThe painting was part of an extensive collection of books, pamphlets, manuscripts, prints, drawings, watercolours and oil paintings bequeathed to the V&A  by John Forster (1812-1876) in 1876.",
