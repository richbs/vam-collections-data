The triangular ends of the pen rest are decorated with monsters inspired by the Romanesque art of the 11th century. The seal is engraved with Waterhouse\u2019s intertwined initials. Waterhouse's daughter embroidered the pen wiper as a gift to her father. \n\nWaterhouse was one of the most successful British architects of the 1870s and 80s. His most famous surviving buildings include the Natural History Museum, London and Manchester Town Hall\n\nElizabeth, Waterhouse\u2019s wife, ran the Yattendon Metalworking classes from 1890 to 1914, to train local men and boys to work with brass and copper. The work was highly commended for its design and was sold through the Home Arts and Industries Association annual show and at Liberty\u2019s, London.",
