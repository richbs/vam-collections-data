The whole scene, including the tree stump and soldiers on horseback projecting out from the faint background, has been hammered into relief from a single sheet of silver. Such high relief work combined with delicate chasing required considerable technical skill. The design was usually pricked out on the surface of a flat sheet of silver, then the sheet turned over and the basic pattern hammered out from the back. The detail was worked in from the front using a variety of hammers and punches, with the sheet resting on pitch to hold it steady. The vulnerability of the projecting areas is clear from the great number of repairs to the underside of this plaque. The maker has probably been influenced by the work of the late 17th century Augsburg goldsmith, Johann Andreas Thelot.
