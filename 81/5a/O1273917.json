The shape is tailored with wide pleats and two buttons at the waist.\n\nSheilagh Brown's 1980s womenswear designs were inspired by traditional menswear tailoring, as exemplified by this pair of trousers. Brown's masculine inspiration was, however, contrasted with a feminine sensibility in cut, colour and use of fabric. This was evident from the ensemble acquired for, and displayed in, the 'Club to Catwalk' exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum of which this pair of trousers was part. On display the pair of trousers was teamed together with a frock coat (T.47:1-2013), a black and white floral-printed shirt (T.47:3-2013), a pink shirt (T.47:4-2013), a spotted scarf (T.47:5-2013) and a silver brooch (T.48-2013).",
