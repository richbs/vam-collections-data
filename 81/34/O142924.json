The photograph is thus a record of the work done and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm.  The albumen print is lettered 'F.A.SKIDMORE . COVENTRY AND 24 HUNTERS Rd BIRMINGhm' which gives an indication of the date that the photograph was taken. In 1872 Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company went into liquidation and was taken over by Winfields of Birmingham so this albumen print probably dates from then.  Skidmore made railings for important commissions such as the Albert Memorial, Hyde Park, London and those in St. Mary's Guildhall, Coventry.  Skidmore also produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork like these railings. He worked for some of the leading designers of the Gothic Revival movement, particularly Sir George Gilbert Scott.",

Peter Howell (see References) has some printed designs for railings in his private collection which are from a later date than the ones in Coventry because they are lettered 'BIRMINGHAM' as below. In the 1872 Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company went into liquidation and was taken over by Winfields of Birmingham so it appears that Skidmore was still producing similar railings for more than seven years from 1865 because the pattern book in Coventry Library is lettered with the title that Skidmore's firm used from this earlier date. The page of designs in Peter Howell's collection is lettered 'EXTERIOR RAILING, and GATES. balconies & c.'  and 'F:A:SKIDMORE: COVENTRY and 24 HUNTERS Rd BIRMINGHAM.'",
