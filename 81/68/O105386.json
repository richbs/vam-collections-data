            "public_access_description": "Wrestling became very popular TV entertainment in the 1980s.  It was brought to TV by the WWF, World Wrestling Federation, now known as the WWE , World Wrestling Entertainment.  This new kind of  wrestling came with a circus-like gimmick. It was big and brash with bright colours, noise and hyped up energy.  The wrestlers took on names like Hulk Hogan, The Rock and Jake the Snake.  Matches were promoted by Vincent McMahon and his company Titan Sports Inc.  His company had great success in generating income through advertising, TV deals and from the merchandise.  They sold the rights to companies like Hasbro to make WWF action figures and other accessories that proved to be very popular.  Children could buy their favourite wrestling stars.  The figures were popular with adult collectors too. WWE is still popular today with shows like Raw and Smackdown but no longer has the public intensity it had in the 1980s.",
