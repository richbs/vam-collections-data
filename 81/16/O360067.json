The embroidery appears along the front edges and skirts and around the pockets and pocket flaps. The style is typical of the long waisted fashion of the first half of the 18th century. The buttons and button holes only reach as far as the pockets which determine the waistline and in reality probably reached the hips. All the buttons are missing. The sleeves are without cuffs and fastened at the cuff with one button. \n\nThe cut is also typical of the 18th century. the two fronts and backs are cut as single pieces with  gussets and have two pieces at the arm-hole to make up the sleeves and part of the front armhole. Either not enough material was allowed or there was a later yet contemporary repair.\n\nThe waistcoat is lined with beige twilled wool and the sleeves with fustian.",
