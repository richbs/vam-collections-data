It is described as follows in John Charles Robinson's Report of 6th February, 1865: 'Circular convex shield or buckler a shield of parade, in wood, painted or lacquered - the outer surface enriched with an elaborate battle subject and the interior with conservation subjects of figures in costume of the 16th century, executed and etched on a graffitatura work in grisaille tint on a gold ground, Italian, c. 1550.'\n\nIt was examined by Peter Young of the V & A paintings Conservation and John Mills of the National Gallery in September 1971.\n\nAlthough this parade shield or buckler is unsigned and undated and its original provenance remains unknown, it is lavishly decorated and must have been associated with a prince or nobleman, wishing to show off his pomp and splendour by staging a religious or military parade. Most surviving bucklers are thought to have been made in Florence and Venice, and perhaps the finest examples are Caravaggio's Medusa, listed in the 1631 inventories as being stored with Persian armour in the Medici armouries and now in the Uffizi gallery, or Giovanni Stradano's battle of Scannagallo, dated 1574, in the Odesclchi collections in Rome. Although not of the same callibre as these two, this  shield must have a striking object with a shining green glaze and gilding underneath. The battle scene has not been identified, but the heroism of a solitary kingly warrior taking on ranks of opposing forces no doubt served to draw parallels with the heroism of the prince who commissioned this parade shield.",

Classical subjects, like this unidentified battle, were suitable subjects because they evoked the triumphs of Ancient Roman Generals, with whom these princes tried to identify themselves. On occasions, they served as prizes for victors in jousting tornaments, like one presented by Alessandro dei' Medici, Duke of Tuscany, to Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in 1536.",
