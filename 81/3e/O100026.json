            "public_access_description": "Small low, covered bowls with matching stands like this were  used for serving soups, bouillon and other similar foodstuffs in private apartments at breakfast, through the long hours of the  toilette and to invalids in bed. In France such a tureen would be called an '\u00e9cuelle' and in German it was sometimes called a 'W\u00f6chnerinnterrine' or 'maternity tureen'. However, while they  certainly were used to serve restorative foods to women after childbirth, they were much more widely used by women as well as  by men. Some (but not this one) have covers fitted with feet,  enabling this part to be reversed to serve as a plate for dealing  with meat or marrow bones. They were not made as part of a  dinner service, but were a standard component of toilet services.  Being made for personal use, they were usually finely decorated.  They were made in porcelain, silver and other materials.\n\nThis \u00e9cuelle has been elaborately decorated with a blue lattice ground resembling embroidery, reserved with shaped cartouches painted with vignettes.  Most of these contain cherubs, sometimes called putti or amours, holding different symbols emblematic of a season, an element or a sense.  The decorator has used engravings after the important French rococo artist Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-70) as the source for these designs.  Boucher was very fashionable in court circles.  He had the patronage of Madame de Pompadour, the influential mistress ofthe French King, Louis XV, and was in fact appointed premier peintre du roi in 1765.  The popularity of Boucher's work was partly due to the fact that it was widely disseminated in the form of engravings.  The S\u00e8vres porcelain factory had a large stock of these which were at the disposal of the painters and were often used during the 1750s and 60s to copy or inspire the decoration on more expensive items such as this.",

Currie Bequest.\n\nTrellis grounds of different types were popular in France from the early 1760s onwards and occur in marquetry on furniture, textiles and on porcelain.  See The Getty catalogue by Adrian Sassoon (see below) for a S\u00e8vres<i> cuvette Mahon</i> with a pink and <i>beau bleu</i> trellis ground reserved with Teniers scenes dated 1761 (cat. no. 14) and an <i>\u00e9cuelle</i> decorated by M\u00e9reaud with<i> beau bleu</i> panels overlaid with a gilded trellis,  dated 1764 (cat. no. 16).  See also the Royal Collection French Porcelain catalogue, Vol. III, no. 285 for a writing table dated 1765-80 and cat. no. 258 for a tray and tea service, dated 1780-83.\nA more elaborate version of a blue trellis ground (which may or may not be related) with blue as well as gilded dots and composed of slender petal shapes rather than lines, was used at Chantilly.  At least two types of service wares are known, with floral or animal decoration (see Le Duc below).  Le Duc refers to royal French inventories, dating from 1718-32 which describe rare Japanese porcelains '<i>charg\u00e9es de mosa\u00efques</i>' as the source of this type of decoration which is also found on textiles of the same period.  Japanese porcelain with this type of ground was certainly in the Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 collection at Chantilly.  An oval tray in Chantilly porcelain in the British Museum with this ground and floral reserves, dated 1753, is illustrated, p. 239.  The animal service is dated 1753-1760. A further cup and saucer with floral reserves, dated to c. 1765 is p. 295.   At S\u00e8vres it was used for the service given by Louis XV to the Elector Palatine in 1760.  A similar ground design is also found on Tournai porcelain.",
