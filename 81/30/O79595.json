However, they would have looked best set out on a dining table, which is probably how they were intended to be used. The earliest porcelain figures were made for the dessert course of grand dinners. They gradually replaced sugar paste and wax figures, which had been made since medieval times for royal wedding feasts. Originally intended as expressions of dynastic power and to celebrate political allegiances, by the 16th century allegorical themes had been introduced into these table settings. By the 18th century many were entirely decorative. Meissen in Germany was the first factory to make porcelain figures for the dessert, and Meissen set the sculptural conventions followed by porcelain factories elsewhere.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAll the figures in the group would first have been modelled in wax, possibly by a London sculptor. A set of hollow plaster moulds would have been taken from these wax originals. Several moulds would have been needed for the complete group, since it is complex with much undercutting. A mixture of clay and water would then have been poured into the hollow moulds, and removed and assembled once the clay had dried sufficiently.",
