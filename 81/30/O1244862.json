            "history_note": "This medal was bought from the artist in 2012, when it was shown at the V&A as part of \"The New Medallists\", a display celebrating the first six years of the New Medallist scheme. An initiative run by the British Art Medal Society (BAMS), this scheme is designed to breathe new life into the tradition of the art medal by nurturing a new generation of medallists.\n\nHeidi Hinder (born 1976) graduated from Birmingham City University's School of Jewellery where she was artist-in-residence when she became the 2010/11 New Medallist. Attracted to medals as objects invested with meaning, Hinder places perception at the heart of her practice. Her medals show her interest in optical devices, sciences and literature.\n\nInspired by the eerie quality of the early photography of Warren de la Rue (stereograph glass positive of the moon, Museum no. E.131-1993), this medal was created with materials and techniques taken from jewellery. The field, of etched steel, is protected by an acrylic cover like a medallion in a glass locket, while the rim, made of silver, is hallmarked. Beyond evoking the tradition of the <i>memento mori,</i> the medal has an autobiographic resonance: on either side, the central motif of a skull is based on x-rays of the artist's mother. Holographic, the skulls' features become more or less visible as the object is shifted in the hand, thus lending a spectral character to the object. 'Beyond their medical function, the x-rays are here seen in their pictorial rather than clinical quality, to invoke an emotional response. Thus appropriated, they eloquently express the fear of losing a loved one' (Leavitt Bourne and Vandenbrouck-Przybylski, 2012, p. 50).",
