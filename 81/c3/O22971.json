They knew that the woven silks produced and traded since antiquity in the Middle East had enormous influence on pattern making in Europe, and believed that the Islamic conventions of flat stylized or geometric floral forms would continue to be a never-failing source of ideas in design. This wallpaper pattern, strongly drawn, heavily stylized and densely coloured was intended to counter what Jones regarded as weakly drawn, cheap, semi-realistic and frivolous subjects for wallpapers. The later Islamic tradition of not using animals or people as subjects for decoration, and rarely using un-stylized floral forms, fitted well with Jones's desire for austerity in design.\n\n[Charles Newton, 'British Design at Home', p.51]",
