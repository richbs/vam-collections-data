The drawing is annotated in pencil with sketched additions, measurements, calculations and scale (1/4\" to 1').  It is also watermarked J. Whatman 1819 in the top left hand corner. \n\nThe drawing is not signed but was probably created by James Winston. Although Mr. Samuel Beazley Jr. was the architect for the proposed alterations to the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in the 1820's, this collection indicates that Mr James Winston (born c.1773) played an active role in the proposal alterations. It is unclear in certain items if he actually drew them himself or copied from original ones and added some notes. Appointed as Acting Manager of Drury Lane in 1819 Winston continued to be involved with the theatre until c.1827 and kept unpublished diaries of his time there. Winston Collection",
