Using concrete poetry as a kind of springboard Hou\u00e9dard developed a way of making more purely abstract or pictorial images with the typewriter keys directly onto typing paper. \nThis is one of a number of  prints using more conventional media, such as letterpress or lithography. Some of these appear directly related to his 'typestracts'; others, such as this one, appear more independent, but they all  have a somewhat different visual impact from the typewritten pieces. This is one of six sheets of translucent paper, overlaid, each printed with a different word, in a different position on the page so that they read collectively as a poem; the words show through the paper but progressively faintly as the number of layers increases.",
