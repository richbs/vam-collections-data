            "public_access_description": "Designs (2 on 1 sheet), inscribed with details for the decoration of harp-shaped heads for pins to be worn as a form of jewellery. They were drawn by an anonymous designer. The designs are inscribed with the French Revolutionary calendar date which corresponds to 1799-1800.  They are from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.\n\nThese designs are remarkable in that they show how goldmiths' workshops survived the French Revolution with clients changing from customers who included those from the Court to a different sort.",
