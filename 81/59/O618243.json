Until his visit to Paris in the winter of 1734-5 to see the collection, Ehret had always painted on paper. However the studies he sent to his patron Christoph Trew, the Nuremberg botanist and physician, during his stay at the Jardin Royal des Plantes, were, as Trew noted in his memoir, painted on 'pergament' (vellum). The image was reused by Christoph Jacob Trew for his book Plantae selectae.",
