James Markwick and Robert Markham specialised in clocks and watches for the Turkish market, and a partnership under their joint names was in business in London from about 1725 to 1805.\n\nMechanism & Manufacture\nThe watch's mechanism comprises a going train with fusee and train, a verge escapement, steel balance and spring.  It is fitted with Turkish gradations. It strikes the hours and quarters on a silver bell.\n\nDesign\nLarge watches of this form are known as clock-watches.  Their large size allowed them to be hung from a hook in a room and used as a clock when travelling.  The gilt-metal case is pierced and engraved with foliage.  One of the two outer cases is similarly decorated.  An extra outer case is pierced in openwork with Rococo scrolls and foliage and with panels of shagreen decorated with piqu\u00e9 in gold.\n\nThe Arabic numerals on the dial, the complicated chiming mechanism and multiple elaborately decorated outer cases were deliberately designed to appeal to the taste of Turkish clients for 'exotic' ornamental mechanisms from Europe.",
