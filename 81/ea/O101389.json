The students used social and political grievances to challenge the image projected to the world by their government through the Mexico City Olympic Games. This poster makes the point by turning the links of the Olympic logo into chains, while the short, harsh 'cuts' of the woodcut style create a tortured energy. The 'made in the USA' padlock refers to Diaz Ordaz's political ties to North America.",
