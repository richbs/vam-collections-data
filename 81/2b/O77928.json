This example lacks a handle and has no separate pouring lip, so it may have been intended as a small vase for flowers.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDesigns produced by one factory were frequently copied by another. This was especially the case at the smaller porcelain factories, which employed few if any designers. Chelsea's 'goat-and-bee' jugs, the prototype for this piece, are the earliest dated English porcelains. They were probably designed and modelled by Nicholas Sprimont, the factory manager. Staffordshire potters also reproduced this design in salt-glazed stoneware. \n\nPeople\nThe Vauxhall porcelain factory was run by the partnership of Nicholas Crisp, a merchant and owner of a jewellery shop in the City of London, and John Saunders, a delftware potter. Crisp was also a founder and very active member of the Society of Arts. Until recently their products were attributed to the Liverpool factory of William Ball.",
