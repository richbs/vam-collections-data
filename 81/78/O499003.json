These five canvases were intended as the principal element of  the decoration of the newly created Director's Dining-room, also called the 'Painted Room', which was situated just off the new public Restaurant in the Henry Cole Wing.  It was conceived by Sir Roy Strong, then Director of the V&A,  as a venue for special events, and the room was available to the public using the restaurant at all other times. \n\nThe decoration of the room was carried out during 1985-6 in a fashionable neo-baroque style. The paintings were designed as a series of architectural capricci based on the various styles of English art and incorporating representations of  celebrated objects from the museum collections. \n\nWith the impending re-development of the old restaurant area as the new Sackler Centre for arts education, it was decided that those elements of the 'Painted Room' which could be saved should be preserved as part of the historic fabric of the museum.",
