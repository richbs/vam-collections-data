It was first staged in London at the Princes Theatre on 4 July 1927.\n\nLe Pas d'Acier only received 24 performances (12 each in Paris and London). It was a complex production, and this prevented it from being toured. The final performance was at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt on 20 May 1929. Described as a constructivist ballet in two tableaux, it presented scenes which summarised aspects of Russian life in the early days of the Soviet Union. The first represented 'stories and legends of the countryside', the second 'the mechanism of the factories'.",
