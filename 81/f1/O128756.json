            "history_note": "From the Alhambra, Granada. Apparently such tiles were widely used there, though only a small area now survives. The armorial shields represent an interesting use of a European device by the Nasrid Sultans. These bear the legend in Arabic, 'There is no conqueror but God', a motto adopted by Muhammed ben-el Ahmar ca. 1250. The original tiles of this type date from the 14th century, and are decorated in blue and lustre on a tin glaze. This tile is decorated in the cuenca technique, and dates from the 16th century. It was likely produced as a replacement for earlier tiles, during palace repairs. According to Ray (2000), payments for tiles for the Alhmabra were made to Juan Pulido between 1542-44, and in 1590, Gaspar Hern\u00e1ndez was commissioned to make tiles with the Nasrid inscription. This tile may relate to one or other of these commissions.",
