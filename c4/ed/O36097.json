The skates are a toboggan style with solid bases rather than a single blade. The shape is that of grooves and probably provides a safer and more stable skate for a child to learn on because it is more like a flat board. The skates are of steel and brass with leather strap fixings to attach them to a child's boot. \n1. right \n2. left \n*By the 1860s in the northeast USA; there were many established toy makers working in wood; metal and paper. Some are very well known and documented such as Ives; others less so. These skates; although not strictly toys; fall into the category of these types of makers working very actively at the time to provide a toy or piece of sporting equipment that children would use and enjoy.",
