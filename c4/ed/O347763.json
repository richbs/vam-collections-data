The badge presumably cast made from this model was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1908.\n\nOriginally founded in 1884, the Art Workers' Guild was established as a forum for discussion between designers and artists of different disciplines. Frampton was a member from 1887 onwards, and became Master in 1902.\n\nSir George James Frampton (1860-1928) was an English sculptor, medallist and decorative artist. He worked in an architects office before being apprenticed to a firm of architectural masons. He studied modelling a the London School of Art under W.S. Frith, and in 1881 entered the Royal Academy  Schools, where he won a gold medal and travelling scholarship in 1887. Like Lanteri he was involved in the exterior decoration of the Museum, executing the spandrel reliefs of Truth and Beauty above the Main Entrance.\nFrampton was elected an Associate Member of the Royal Academy in 1894 and exhibited regularly across Europe, contributing to the Munich and Vienna Secession movements.",
