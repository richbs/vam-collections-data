The composition of overlapping shapes resembles abstract paintings of the period.\n\nMcKnight Kauffer is known as a graphic artist and theatre designer. He was born and educated in the USA, where he trained as a painter. He came to England in 1914 and received important commissions for his graphic work.\n\nThe Wilton Royal Carpet Factory was established in the early 18th century. In the 19th century it worked under contract for Morris and Company. During the 1930s the firm commissioned designs for carpets and rugs from a number of leading artists.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nDesigned by the American Edward McKnight Kauffer (see cat. 171), this rug was acquired by the Museum in 1934 as part of the collection assembled by Margaret Bulley for the British Institute of Industrial Art, an organisation in which the V&A's former director Cecil Harcourt Smith played a key role.\nIn the late 1920s and 1930s the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory, in addition to its mechanised production, made hand-knotted carpets to order. These exclusive, signed carpets provided decorative focal points and injected colour into the modish interiors of the period, whose walls and upholsteries were generally in neutral shades. In financially depressed times, the business thus boosted income by attracting clients who could afford custom-designed works.\nA signed gouache by Kauffer in the Wilton archives relates closely to this carpet; the design is stamped with the statement that it \"can be suitably adapted for any size carpet and any desired alterations in colouring or ornament effected.\"\n\nLit.
