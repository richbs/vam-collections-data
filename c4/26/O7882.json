Here the stool is made from beech wood, painted in white and grey to simulate the appearance of marble. Beech wood would have been much easier and less costly to carve than marble, and resulted in a more flexible seat which weighed less and could be moved around without difficulty.\n\nPeople & Places\nCharles Heathcote Tatham (1772-1842), the designer of this stool, arrived in Rome in July 1794. He stayed for two years gathering material for his significant of designs of ancient ornamental architecture.  While in Italy Tatham not only drew and sketched, he also bought a large number of antique fragments for his employer and mentor, Henry Holland (1745-1806) who was architect to the Prince of Wales. These fragments are now in the possession of the Soane Museum, London. Letters from Tatham to Henry Holland, describing this period of his life in Rome, can be examined in the V&A 's Print Room (museum nos. D.1479 to1551-1898).\n\nDesign & Designing\nTatham's book, Etchings of Ancient Ornamental Architecture drawn from the Originals in Rome and other Parts of Italy..., was an immediate success.
