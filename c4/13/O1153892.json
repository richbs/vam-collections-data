Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nWaldi, designed by Otl Aicher was the first official Olympic mascot. He was modelled on a real dog called Cherie von Birkenhof. A Daschund dog was chosen because they are popular in Bavaria but also possess qualities which are indispensable to an athlete: resistance, tenacity and agility. The pastel colours express the gaiety and joy of the Olympic Games.",
