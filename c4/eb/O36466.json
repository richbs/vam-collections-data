A large menuki, the ornamental metal pieces positioned either side of the hilt under the wrapping is in the shape of a buddha.  The sword guard (tsuba) is of iron with basket ground and small sprays in gold wire nunome, a technique in which the surface of the tsuba is cut with a cross hatch pattern and metal is pressed in.  The corresponding set of collar and pommel cap (fuchi-kashira) are of silver and decorated with waves and clouds.\n\nThe scabbard is wooden and is wrapped in bamboo basketwork in brown-beige natural shades.  The chape of the scabbard, the kojiri, is of silver and decorated with the image of a dragon.",
