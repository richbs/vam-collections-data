Reverend Walter Shirley who supplic his place during his absence in London, so I copy in part that you may see how sumptuously that good man fared.  I hope however you will soon be able to live like Mrs Shirley upon mountain and port.  We shall be very glad to hear that you are gaining strength and with our \u2026kindest love\nBelieve me my dear Anne\nYour affectionate cousin\nEsther Sharp\nI have only written you a short letter because as you are weak I must not tire you.\nFamily prayers at 9 in the morning and 9 in the evening first reading a chapter and sing a Hymn, the hymn always I sign standing.  On Saturday evenings the serious people of the place come to my house about 7.  I first sing a hymn then expound a chapter then sing another hymn then pray, and conclude with singing on my knees, 'we \u2026God from etc - dicet' You must eat what is set before you and be thankful.  I get hot rituals but once a week for myself, big on Saturday; but because you are an Honourable man I have ordered two hot joints be to got each week for you, with a pudding each day at noon, some pies and cold ham so that you will fare bravely; much better than your Master with barley head and dry fish.  There is also ale, port, mountain, and a little Madeira to drink, the liquor suits a coronet.  Use what I have just your own.  I make no feats but have all I can, to give all I can.  I have never yet been worth a groat at the years end, nor desire it.  I hoe you will like your expedition; the people are simple hearted, they want \u2026 and not venison[?], and can east their meat without sauce or a french cook.\nThe week day preachings are in the \u2026 at \u00bd past 6, if you can preach in a house, the method is first sing a hymn, then pray, then preach, then sing, then pray again, then conclude with 'Praise God from \u2026.etc'\nThe lord bless you and make your journey prosperous\nYour affectionate servant,\nJB",
