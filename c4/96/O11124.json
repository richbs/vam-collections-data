Minton's, like other manufacturers, made their largest and showiest pieces for such international fairs, to demonstrate their technical capabilities, the skill of their painters and the quality of their design.\n\nPeople\nLudwig (Louis) Hartmann Adalbert Jahn (1839-1911) was born in Thuringia, the centre of German porcelain manufacturing. He moved to Vienna for a short while and then joined Minton's some time before the 1862 exhibition, when his work, including this vase, was shown for the first time.  He specialised in figure subjects after 18th-century painters such as Antoine Watteau and Joshua Reynolds.  He painted to a high degree of finish, in a manner very close to the original easel painting he copied and in a style also used at the Vienna factory, although there is no evidence that he was employed there.  He left Minton to become art director at Brownfield's in 1872, before returning to succeed L\u00e9on Arnoux as art director at Minton's in 1893.  In 1903 he became curator of Hanley Museum, where he remained until his death in 1911.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe paintings that Louis Jahn has copied onto this vase are both by Antoine Watteau:  Le Danse Paysan and Harlequin Jaloux.",
