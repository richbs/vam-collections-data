The top of the clamp is fitted with a pin cushion.\n\nOwnership & Use\nUntil the invention of the sewing machine in the 1850s, all clothes and household linen were hand-sewn and the use of clamps was essential to make the process quicker and more efficient. This decorative example, with animal paws forming the grips of the clamp, was probably intended for domestic use in a female setting, such as a boudoir or sitting room, rather than in a commercial workroom. It may have been a love token since preparations for marriage included substantial amounts of sewing, both for a trousseau and for household linen.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAs they were often given as presents, clamps were made of attractive materials, such as ivory, metal or Tunbridge ware, which were then carved, painted or inlaid with metal foil. Sometimes small engravings were printed or glued onto the surface. Wooden clamps, turned on a lathe like this example, were fitted with pin cushions, containers for needles, bobbin winders, or reels for holding thread.",
