The acanthus flower was a common decorative motif at the time it was made, and illustrates the wide range of classical motifs in the decorative arts that were available to the medieval craftsman.\n\nMuch of the surviving medieval glass was removed from the cathedral in the mid-1800s and replaced with copies. The original panels were stored in various glaziers\u2019 workshops, and eventually sold off to private collectors. This makes it difficult to determine where this panel may have come from.\n\nOver time, some of the original panels from the cathedral have come into museum collections in Britain and in the United States.",
