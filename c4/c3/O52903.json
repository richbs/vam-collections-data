Barometers first appeared in England in about 1660 and were widespread by about 1730. In this example, the dial is fixed to the equator of an armilliary sphere, a skeletal globe made up of rings representing various longitudes and latitudes. Ingenious and unorthodox variations of dials were sometimes used on clocks of this period, but very rarely if ever on barometers. \n\n People \nThe barometer was made by the firm of Benjamin Vulliamy, clockmaker to George III.  The pedestal was probably made by the London firm of Thomas Brownley, who specialised in clock cases.  It was probably decorated by Thomas Bromley, a decorative painter. The biscuit figures are based on models that are likely to have been made by John Deare (1759-1798). He was a sculptor from Liverpool and the youngest Royal Academy gold medallist of his day. From 1785 until his death, Deare enjoyed a very successful career in Rome. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe figures looking at the barometer are the Roman goddess Venus and her son, Cupid. On the wooden pedestal is the goddess Diana, derived from a carved roundel on the Arch of Constantine in Rome.",
