The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe poster depicts a family with the father holding a flag bearing the legend: 'Keine Kapitulation'. There is a word play here. By swapping a letter and inserting one, the slogan changes to 'Kapital Nation'. The text can therefore be translated as  'no capitulation' - no capital nation'.\n\nThe Action Alliance was founded out of the 'United Left' and the 'Carnations' for the elections. The left wing parties were apprehensive of monetary and political union with the West German Federal Republic. The Action Alliance was politically further left than the Citizen's Movements and continued to follow Marxist theories. They claimed that reform could be managed within the GDR and resisted 'annexation' to West Germany. With this attitude the Alliance stood alone against the tide of political opinion in favour of reunification.",
