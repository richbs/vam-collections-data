This plaque is dated 1896, the year after Irving received a Knighthood. The honour was a personal triumph for Irving and a long-overdue recognition by the Establishment of the art of acting since he was the first actor ever to be awarded a Knighthood. \n\nIrving was born in Cornwall and spent fifteen years acting in repertory from 1856 until 1871, when he made his name at the Lyceum Theatre in The Bell. In his years in repertory he played over 600 different roles, and for the next 31 years he starred at the Lyceum, holding audiences spellbound, and setting new standards of production and performance that made his name legendary. His most notable leading lady at the Lyceum was Ellen Terry, with whom his name will always be associated.",
