The design was probably executed for a production of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Candida\" performed on a Continental tour in 1946-7, and at the Piccadilly Theatre, March 27th 1947.  The production was directed by Peter Powell, and the cast included Jack Hawkins as Rev. James Mavor-Morell, and Fay Compton as Candida.\n\nHistorical significance: This design was probably executed for a production commissioned by the actor/producer Alec Clunes, whose greatest achievement was his direction of eight seasons of plays at the Arts Theatre during a period when money and actors were scarce and scenery hard to get.  He introduced an ambitious and intellectually demanding repertory of unearthed English classics and promoted the staging of foreign plays, as an alternative to the usual West End fare of \"leg shows\" and average drawing room pieces, which earned him the status, according to one critic of \"pocket national theatre\".  He also put on a series of Shaw revivals, including \"Candida\" which was toured by the Arts Theatre under the auspices of the British Council in 1946, and which then went into the Piccadilly Theatre in 1947 with Jack Hawkins and Fay Compton in the leading roles.\n\nLeela Meinertas, 1990.",
