The full skirt falls in tiny gathers from the waist and has three gathered tiers which are emphasised by horizontal bands of satin piping. The designer handles black in a gentle and romantic manner and by allowing the smooth satin to shine through the fine silk, prevents it from becoming a dense and dominant mass. Although the garment appears easy fitting and flowing, the crepe-backed satin foundation is boned at the bodice and has a firm waist-stay attached.
