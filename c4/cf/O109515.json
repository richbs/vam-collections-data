These earlier pieces are rarely marked. English recusant chalices derived their form from the Gothic chalices in use until the mid sixteenth century. Charles Oman wrote an article on 'The First Gothic Revival in English Church Plate' which was published in The Burlington Magazine', April 1978 in which he identified a group of recusant chalices as late Elizabethan precursors of the more familiar early Stuart chalices; by the 1630s a number of designs for recusant chalices are found, with wide variations in size, engraving and the quality of goldsmiths' work. All have the Crucifixion engraved on the foot and some also bear the symbols of Christ's Passion including the pincers, hammer, ladder and Crown of Thorns.",

These earlier pieces are rarely marked. After 1688, Catholic plate was more often hallmarked and the range of forms expanded to include sanctuary lamps, cruets and incense boats. \n\nIn London, Catholics could worship openly in foreign embassy chapels.
