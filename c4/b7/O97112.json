Hollow cast composition (or plastic) head, wooden limbs and body and painted facial features.  The witch has a painted pink head and lower arms with black spots and lines on her face, white nylon hair strands, pink plastic hands and legs, black painted feet. Dressed in a black dress and felt hat, red spotted scarf and apron, carrying a wood and raffia broom. The puppet has an articulated mouth.\n\nThe control consists of two wooden bars pinned together at the centre so that they can be opened to form a cross. The heads are controlled by two strings, one to each side; the hands by two red strings one to each hand, the legs by two blue strings one to each knee. There is also a single yellow string to the centre back. There are appropriately coloured washers over the string hooks on the control. These prevent the strings coming off but also allow their removal in case they got tangled. \n\nThe puppet is housed in a yellow and white cardboard box which has instructions for removing and replacing the puppet and for making it walk The outer window sleeve is also of yellow card and decorated with drawings of various characters.",
