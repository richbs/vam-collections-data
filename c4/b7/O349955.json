            "public_access_description": "The relief is a contemporary stucco squeeze (or cast) from a marble relief in the Palazzo Communale at Solarolo (near Ravenna), which was originally housed in the Rocca of Solarolo. The Rocca was rebuilt by Astorgio II Manfredi (d.1468) in about 1456-1461, and the original marble relief dates from soon after this time. The lower section of the Solarolo relief is a sixteenth-century addition, and the present stucco probably reproduces the original base. Francesco di Simone Ferrucci (1437-1493) was born at Fiesole, near Florence, and trained under his father Simone. He was influenced by the work of the Florentine sculptors, Desiderio da Settignano and Verrocchio.",
