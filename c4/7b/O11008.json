This seal was probably made for Henry Lee when he became Knight of the Garter in 1597. It was certainly in use by 1609 when Lee used it to seal his own will, which is also in the Museum.\n\nPeople\nSir Henry Lee (1533-1611) was one of the most eminent figures of the Elizabethan court and held the office of Master of the Ordnance. He was knighted in 1553 and from about 1570 became prominent in the festive and ceremonial activities at court. He was probably responsible for inaugurating the Accession Day tilts, which were held every year from 1571 on 17 November to celebrate the accession of the Queen. Lee acted as the Queen's Champion in these revived chivalric tournaments until 1590 when he passed the office on to George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe seal shows the arms of Sir Henry Lee bordered by a garter ribbon inscribed Honi soit qui mal y pense ('Shamed be he who thinks evil of it'), the motto of the Order of the Garter. The Order of the Garter was founded by Edward III in 1348 and is the oldest order of chivalry in Europe. It has only 26 members at any one time, the sovereign and 25 Knights Companion. Members are elected for life and membership is a very great honour.",
