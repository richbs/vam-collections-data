The jacket is part of a festival costume for a girl.\n\nThe main body of the jacket is formed of a bright yellow fabric decorated with floral sprays, some of which are in the shape of of the stylised longevity symbol. The sleeves and opening flap of the left-hand side of the jacket are formed of a striped multi-coloured patterned fabric decorated with a regular repeating pattern of pomegranate sprays. The stripes are in six colours: dark blue, yellow, pink, white, green, and red/orange. These are the five symbolic colours used on traditional Korean garments for children.\n\nThe jacket is lined with a white fabric with a small repeating pattern of diamond shapes. The collar is formed of a stiffened band of this white diamond fabric and a further band of plain red/orange material decorated with stamped gold decoration of stylised crysanthemum heads. This same fabric with gold stamped flowers and Chinese characters is used for the two ties attached to the body of the jacket.",

As is customary with Korean jackets, the neckline is lined with a white border. Here the border is made of the same material as the inner lining but contemporary mass-produced ones are white. They are lined with paper in order to make them suitably stiff and durable. \n\nThe red border has been decorated with an auspicious gold pattern of twenty-petalled chrysanthemums, frequently seen on children's costumes. There are different ways in which gold is applied to Korean textiles. The unevenness of the flowers suggests that here a 'scatter gold' technique (salgum was used. The pattern is first carved into a wooden mould and thereafter covered with glue. The cloth is then pressed into the mould, allowing the glue to seep through the material, and then gold powder is sprinkled over the wet glue.",
