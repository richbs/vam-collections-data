As the stripes are strongly diagonal, it is possible this length was meant to be made into a pair of lady's straight-legged trousers.\nThe diagonal stripes are 7.5 cm wide, the pattern is densely packed into each stripe and there are two colourways:\n[1] straight diagonal line in blue edged in black bearing on one side a series of small botehs outlined in dark red with infill of yellow, black and red among leaves and blossoms and flanked to one side by a large red leaf veined in blue.  On the other side of the line, slightly smaller botehs edged in black and infilled with green, yellow and red, among other floral elements.\n[2] same straight diagonal line but in green, edged in black identical motifs but the flanking large red leaves are veined in green.\nThere is an unpatterned twill band 0.5 cm deep across the top and bottom end.\nWarp: white wool, S-twist\nWeft: red, dark red, green, yellow, black, blue, white, pink wool, all S-twist",
