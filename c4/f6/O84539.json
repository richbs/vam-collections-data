Gordon Anthony photographed him wearing it, gazing into a flower-framed mirror with a rabbit mask on the back of his head. \n\nCecil Beaton compiled a significant part of the V&A's Twentieth Century Dress Collection. This jacket is shown here to acknowledge this important contribution and to reveal how the collection inspires designers.",
