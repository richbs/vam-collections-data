            "public_access_description": "Pile carpets are one of many types of floor covering used in the Middle East. They are the most familiar to western Europeans as they have been imported from Turkey since at least the mid-15th century. Examples appear in Italian Renaissance paintings and are also depicted by north European artists such as Hans Holbein. Certain carpet designs became known in Europe by the names of the artists who painted them, including Holbein and Lorenzo Lotto.\n\nA major centre of carpet production was the town of Usak in western Turkey. Weavers there began to use new designs based on medallions of different types during the reign of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror (1451\u201381). Mehmet himself probably commissioned these designs. They were then used in commercial production for several centuries afterwards.\n\nThis fragment is made up of a number of pieces cut from the same carpet. The original design was one of the most accomplished variations of the so-called 'star Usak' pattern, and it may be one of the earliest examples.",
