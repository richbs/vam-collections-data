Bear baiting was the dubious 'sport' of setting dogs on to a chained bear and spectators would place wagers on the outcome. Many cities in post-medieval Europe had arenas set up where bear baiting took place on a regular basis. Travelling fairs would often include a bear baiting spectacle. It is not unusual for such imagery to be painted on to glass.\n\nIn the middle of the sixteenth century, new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass; similar to painting onto a canvas. The colours were produced by adding metallic oxides to a glass frit mixture and the resulting colour range included delicate greens as you see here.",
