Punch and Judy shows are a feature of British seaside entertainment whose history in Great Britain stretches back to the puppet show that Samuel Pepys noted seeing in Covent Garden on 9 May 1662 performed by the Italian puppeteer Signor   Bologna. This included a marionette, or string puppet as Pulcinello or Punch, but by the 19th  century Punch was more usually a glove puppet, performed in a portable booth by one  performer who had a character on each hand.\n\nPunch became a popular character in Britain by the 19th century, when images of Punch and  Judy were used as decorative motifs on a range of household items. In 1841 the magazine  Punch, or the London Charivari  was established, named after the comic and anarchic character of  Mr. Punch whose image appeared on its cover.",
