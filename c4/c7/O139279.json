In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nJones made many maritime photographs and often they reveal his interest in technological developments in shipping. This image is one of three views of the 'Shannon', a fifty-one gun screw frigate, a new fast war ship with steam as well as sail power. The dark and light pattern of her square gun ports is echoed by the square handle holes of the foreground capstan.This circular topped, multi-point capstan is positioned as a strong foreground element in the centre of this composition. Adjacent to it, a line of oblique wooden bollards leads obliquely towards the stern of the ship.",

Trading, communications and war drove the development of steam screw technology of fast boats, which still needed sails. Between November 1855 and September 1856, the Shannon was in No.1 basin at Portsmouth harbour for fitting out. In this photograph her funnel is not yet in place. (The earlier H.M.S. Shannon was famous for her capture of the U.S.S. Chesapeake in 1813, a dramatic sea battle in the British war with the United States.)",
