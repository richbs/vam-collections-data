Contemporary gazettes begin to refer to \u2018labels for bottles\u2019 in the 1770s but it was not until the 1790s that they were established as wine or decanter labels. \n\nThese tickets also illustrate, in miniature, the skills of the silversmith over the last two hundred years. While the variety of styles and materials was enormous, silver bottle tickets tended to reflect fashionable designs and technical advances in metalware generally.\n\nHester Bateman was a successful female silversmith. She learned her trade from her husband and set up in her own right on his death in 1760. It is likely that she managed the workshop rather than made the silver herself. The firm produced cheaper, thin-gauge domestic tablewares using a limited range of ornament for largely middle-class customers. Members of her family, such as her daughter-in-law Ann and her son Peter, joined the business and continued it after her retirement in 1790. Insurance documents for 1802 show that the firm, with its own steam operated flatting mill, was one of the most technologically advanced in London. Bateman silver was exported to retailers and customers all over England and North America.",
