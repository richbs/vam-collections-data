His tunic is cut away in a circle to reveal his waistcoat, straining over a bulging stomach.\n\nMatthews was a pupil of the great clown Joseph Grimaldi and made a name for himself as a clown in the 1820s, in theatres in London including the Olympic and Sadler\u2019s Wells. He excelled in comedy, dance and singling and appeared in pantomime at Covent Garden and Drury Lane where he worked for over forty years as its principal clown. He made his farewell appearance at Drury Lane Theatre in the Christmas 1864 production of Hop o' my Thumb and his Eleven Brothers!; or, Harlequin and the Ogre of the Seven-Leagued Boots.",
