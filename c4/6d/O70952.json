We have some idea of when they were made by comparing them with European furniture. Large multiple-drawer cabinets, without doors or a fall-front and mounted on stands, were very fashionable from about 1650-1700. High-style European furniture of that period also had a variety of intarsia or inlaid decoration. This included 'seaweed' marquetry, in which the cabinetmaker inlaid intricate interlacing designs that resembled the swirling forms of seaweed. The materials, inlay and intricately pierced mounts on cabinets of this type are rather like those on other fitted chests of drawers and cabinets. These are in the Sacristy of the Basilica of Bom Jesus, Old Goa. They were installed between 1654 and 1698.",

Although pieces of this type were produced in quantity, there is little that can be firmly established about the workshops that made them. Some idea of date of manufacture is provided by parallels with European furniture: large multiple-drawer cabinets without doors or a fall-front, and mounted on stands, were very much in fashion in the second half of the seventeenth century. High-style European furniture of that period is also characterised by intarsia of various types, including seaweed marquetry, named after the intricate interlacing designs and dense arabesques that were inlaid. Although these are possible influences, Indo-Portuguese cabinets of this type are also characterised by wholly distinctive elements, such as abstracted animal and geometric designs that have no precedent in any one European or Indian tradition. The scrolling legs, for instance, derive from seventeenth-century Iberian furniture, but are inlaid with bird forms that scholars have associated <font-i>jatayu</font-i>, king of the vultures and a central character in the <font-i>Ramayana</font-i>.\n\nThe materials, inlay and intricately pierced mounts on cabinets of this type bear an affinity with fitted chests of drawers and cabinets in the Sacristy of the Basilica of Born Jesus, Old Goa.\"\nAmin Jaffer, <font -u>Luxury Goods From India: the art of the Indian Cabinet-Maker</font -u>, London : V&A, 2002, pp. 56-57, ill.
