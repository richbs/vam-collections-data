            "public_access_description": "Max L\u00e4uger (1864-1952) studied painting and interior design at Karlsruhe, Germany; he then taught at the art school while also working at potteries in Kandern  between 1880 and 1890; he studied in Paris 1892-3 and there he began making lead-glazed slipware. Always ambitious and energetic, returning to Kandern he worked at a local pottery and then established his own pottery in 1895 while becoming a Professor at Karlsruhe university in 1898. As the opening date approached of the international exhibition, Paris, 1900, and his own ceramic production was becoming commercially established he made a large number of wares celebrating the exhibition specifically to sell during its run. He exhibited his ceramics at many German exhibitions as well as Paris 1900 and at St Louis in 1904 \n\nHe was co-founder of the Deutscher Werkbund in 1907 and was also a painter, sculptor, architect and designer, and teacher at the Baden state art school. From 1916 he had a studio at the Karlsruhe Majolika-Manufaktur, working there until it was destroyed by bombs in 1944.",
