Full Citation: \n \n<b>20 Unknown Woman</b> \n<b>1620-5</b> \nP32-1941 \n\n<b>Oval 55 x 43mm</b> \n\nFeatures in very delicate grey stipple and hatch with some sanguine in the nostrils, lips and eyes, the eyes in blue/black with white lights and touches of gum, on a pale carnation ground; hair in strokes and hatches of brown, grey and ochre over a pale wash; costume in pale grey wash with white lights and darker grey modelling strokes; the chain in black; touches of gold in the dress and in the jewellery; pearls in silver over white; diamond in silver lined with black; rubies and emeralds in coloured resin over silver; background a crimson curtain flooded wet-in-wet; a gold marginal strip; on vellum put down on pasteboard (a playing card). \n\n<b>Condition:</b> The features apparently faded but largely intact; losses from the resin in the jewels, with some retouches, especially in the emerald; silver blackened, especially in the pearls. A note by the then Museum conservator records that the vellum was originally laid on a single card (five diamonds) and in April 1963 was reinforced by laying on to the second card (four spades), which must have been part of the packing of the locket when the miniature was reframed in the nineteenth century.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Centre left, in gold: <i>IH</i> (see B in Appendix 2). Inscribed: The second card is inscribed by a late, presumably nineteenth-century hand: <i>Queen Elizabeth: Hilliard pt</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century silver locket, gilded outside, the back convex, the sides of symmetrical section of two steps between a narrow torus moulding sloping into the bezel, which holds a shallow convex bevelled glass. The hanger is a small round circular loop of D-section. Engraved on the back before the gilding: <i>Queen Elizabeth/by /Hilliard.</i> And faintly scratched in the silver inside the case: <i>Queen Elizabeth/by [blank]</i>  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by Sir Andrew Fountaine in the second quarter of the eighteenth century for the collection of historic portraits at Narford Hall, Norfolk; sold at Narford Hall, 6 July 1894; (1) SS Joseph, by whose widow, Mrs Emma Joseph, presented to the Museum, May 1941.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> Tokyo 1975, no. 76.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Illustrated London News</i>, 18 April 1942, p. 48, repro.; Reynolds 1952, pl, VII, fig. 19; Reynolds 1959, pI.VII, fig. 11 (dated c.1630); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 31; Murdoch 1981, p. 97, pl. 19b (repra. in colour); Murdoch in <i>100 Great Paintings</i> (1985), p. 52 (repro. in colour). \n\nThe description 'Queen Elizabeth by Hilliard', which was presumably accepted while the miniature was in the trade c.1894, was evidently abandoned by the Josephs. The miniature appears twice on the list of the collection offered to the Museum in 1941; at no. 31 as Unknown Woman, and at no. 35 with its old description. Carl Winter corrected the mistake.  \n \nThe portrait is one of the most elaborate painted by Hoskins in the 1620s. The painting of the jewellery, technically identical to the method pioneered by Nicholas Hilliard, provides some evidence that Hoskins learnt his craft directly from Hilliard as well as possibly transcribing his <i>Treatise</i>. The flat, linear construction of the features in grey, minimally coloured with sanguine as in the lips, also recalls Hilliard's face painting, and differs within the Hoskins oeuvre of the 1620s from the 'granular stipple' portraits (see Cat. No. 22) which probably reflect the concurrent influence for suitable sitters of the Olivers.(2) \n\n 1 See F Lugt, <i>R\u00e9pertoire des Catalogues de Ventes Publiques</i>, 1861-1909, vol.
