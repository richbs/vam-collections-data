The true story of the Cenci, which took place in sixteenth-century Italy, inspired Shelley's poetic drama, The Cenci, published in 1819. The debauched Count Cenci conceived an incestuous passion for his daughter Beatrice. The young woman devised, with her step-mother and brother, a desperate plan - hiring assassins to murder her the count. Despite the justice of their cause, Beatrice and her helpers are arrested, admit their guilt, and are sentenced to death by the Pope. The simple title invites this dramatic reading of the life-size, close-up head.",

Here she shows her niece, Emily Mary (May) Prinsep, as Beatrice Cenci, who was hanged in Rome in 1599 for killing her cruel father. Beatrice became a romantic heroine when her story was taken up by English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) in his play The Cenci (1819). By concentrating on the model\u2019s head and melancholy expression, Cameron suggests that the subject\u2019s beauty is intensified by her sad plight.",
