The medieval prototype was considerably smaller and the larger silver version, such as this one, was introduced to Britain by Huguenot goldsmiths. The design is carefully conceived and the high quality of the workmanship shows English silversmithing at its best.\n\nPeople\nThe maker of this bottle, Pierre Platel, was born in Lille in 1664 and arrived in England, along with his brother, in 1688. He could have been one of the many refugees driven from their homes after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, which saw the end of religious tolerance for French Protestants.  In 1699 he set up a shop in Pall Mall, London, and was officially recorded as a 'largeworker', a maker of large pieces of silver.\n\nJohn Churchill, Ist Duke of Marlborough,  inherited the bottle after his brother's death  in 1714. \n\nMaterials &Making\nA number of different techniques have been employed in the construction and decoration of the bottle. The lower part of the body is boldly chased with strapwork in relief. On the neck, fluting descends from palm leaves of cut-card work.  On either side is a mask of a female surrounded by acanthus foliage. The masks were cast in a sand mould and then finely chased.  The chain (which may originally have been used for carrying the bottle) is attached above  the masks and also to the top, which has a screw fitting.",
