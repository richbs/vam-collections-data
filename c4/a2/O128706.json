A gilt band of punched pellets decorates the base of the container and the rim of the lid. \n\nThe exterior of the lid is engraved with a ground of stylized ermine fur, against which stand the Virgin and Child, the Virgin is crowned with flowers in here right hand.The interior of the lid is a scene of the Nativity. The base of the container is engraved on the interior with the head of Christ with crossed halo within a sexfoil border, the exterior base is engraved with a similar frame enclosing the Lamb of God.",

Swinburne, widow of the last of the Swinburnes of Capheaton, Northumberland, 1950.\n\nHistorical significance: This object is a good example of Gothic style. The architectural engraving upon the pyx and the naturalism of the figures are signs of a typically Gothic design. Basse taille enamel (known as translucent enamel) was a technique developed in the 13th and 14th century, at the height of the Gothic period. \n\nIn the medieval period, wealthy people accumulated religious plate for their private chapels. This pyx is probably one such example of a religious object for private use. The pyx was in the possession of the Swinburne family since medieval times and its small size indicates that it was most likely used in a private chapel.\n\nOnly two early English pyxes have survived: the Swinburne Pyx and the Godsfield Pyx (M.360-1921) from the 14th century. The Swinburne Pyx is the only silver example to have survived.\n\nThe depiction of the Virgin upon this pyx is very like one in the Peterborough Psalter (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 53). The Nativity scene is very similar to the Cambridge University Library Book of Hours of Alice de Reydon. The goldsmith must therefore have had access to the same copy books as the illuminators of these manuscripts. The pyx therefore is a unique example of the close relationship between illuminators and goldsmiths in this period.\n\nThe Swinburne family are related to Alice de Reydon from Suffolk, who appears as donor in the De Reydon Hours. The pyx may have come to the Swinburne family as an heirloom from the Suffolk branch of the family after Alice de Reydon's death. As at least one of the Swinburnes was a recusant, it may have been used after the Reformation in clandestine masses.",

In the medieval period, it came in various forms, the most standard being a conical shape. Although silver was the preferred metal, other materials were also used, a practice noted by the English King Henry VII to his 'inward regret and displeasure'.",
