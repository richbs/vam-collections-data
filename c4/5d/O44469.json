Weldon's produced a range of illustrated publications aimed at middle-class women managing on a limited budget. However, the magazines depicted clothes and hairstyles drawn from the world of the rich and famous, such as film stars. Here you can see two elegant women dining against the backdrop of an exotic location. The sun and palm trees suggest that it is the French Riviera, then a glamorous holiday destination. \n\nEric Fraser designed this advertisement. He was a painter and a prolific designer and illustrator. He worked mainly for magazines, but he also worked for industrial clients such as British Gas.",
