So they were thought of as the deliverers of His messages concerning the future including the Coming of the Messiah. The major prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel.\n\nThese prophet panels are also known as 'messenger panels' because they convey these divinely inspired prophecies or messages. In this panel we see Jeremiah holding a banner with a cross on it. \nHe was often thought of as a prophet of the Passion of Christ.",
