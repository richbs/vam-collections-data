'A Chinese Dream' has been created from one of the most transferable and anonymous paper objects within contemporary society - money.  Through the careful selection of both crsip, newly printed Chinese bank notes, and the slightly weathered notes already in circulation, Stockwell creates a visually arresting piece which is also a political statement of the importance of China to the global trade network. The artist believes the strength and efficiency of this national economcy contributes to China's wider global relevance, particularly to the textile trade.\n\n'A Chinese Dream' is one of a series of quilts by Susan Stockwell, which includes 'Imperial Quilt' made of maps of the world reconfigured with the Middle East at the centre and a swatch of America woven into every continent.  Gathered and collected, the materials in all the quilts refer to politics and trade and use of everyday familiar materials.",
