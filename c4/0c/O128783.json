He made studies of fruit as well as images of the private estate, Ote Hall in Sussex, where he worked during the 1890s until 1908. He also photographed exciting events and discoveries, such as a local train crash, snake eggs and a vacuum cleaner. \n\nAlthough little known in his lifetime, today Jones is known for his botanical images. His photographs of pears, posed against a neutral background to capture each specimen\u2019s individuality, show his deep understanding of their plain beauty, brought about by tending them daily. The photographs are now now recognised for their simple appeal and their proto-modernist look. The combination of photographs in this album reveals much about Jones and life in Edwardian times.",

The plain background of the photographs of fruit, for example, and the way that the characteristics of each variety are illustrated in great detail are similar in style to the later photographs of Edward Weston. It is for this reason that Charles Jones is considered proto-modernist from our 21st-century perspective. His prints are very high quality, despite the fact that he later used his glass negatives as cloches for growing vegetables in the garden. Photography was a working medium for Jones.",
