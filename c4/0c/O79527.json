Tea was initially an expensive import from China, but became more widely drunk as prices fell during the 18th century.This teapot was made soon after import duties on tea were drastically reduced in 1784, after which the average retail price dropped by almost three shillings a pound. In 1785 Bohea, the most popular type of black (fermented) tea, cost about two shillings a pound, and green (unfermented) tea cost between three and five shillings. Within ten years of this legislation, figures for imports of tea had quadrupled.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe teapot is so finely potted that the base is translucent. The high quality of the materials and hand finishing would have confined its use to wealthy customers. Attention to detail extends to the internal strainer at the base of the spout, which is dome-shaped and elaborately pierced.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe figure composition was originally made in 'cut Indian paper' by Elizabeth, Lady Templetown, an amateur artist. Wedgwood reproduced 14 reliefs after her designs and acknowledged her 'exquisite taste' and 'charming groups' in the 1787 catalogue of his ornamental wares. He probably solicited designs from her hoping that they would appeal to female taste.",
