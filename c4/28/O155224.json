In this example, the narrow length of silk has been brocaded with coloured silks and silver-gilt thread in the shape of two waistcoat fronts and two pocket flaps.  Such a fabric would have been purchased at the silk mercer\u2019s or haberdasher\u2019s shop and taken to a tailor to be cut out and made into a waistcoat.  The backs of 18th century waistcoats were usually a plain wool or linen, and with very careful cutting and piecing of the brocaded silk, a splendid waistcoat could be fashioned.  \n\nThe regular arrangement of the floral design here suggests the influence of Neo-Classicism.  However the skirt of the waistcoat, fairly deep for 1780, indicates that it was worn for quite a formal occasion and is therefore conservative in style.",
