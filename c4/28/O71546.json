She had originally intended to become a painter, but under the influence of the German etcher Max Kinger she turned to drawing and printmaking. These media she thought more sympathetic to the working-class subjects she encountered, especially after her marriage in 1891 to Karl Kollwitz, a doctor working in one of Berlin's poorest districts. A number of her prints from this period depict - with unsentimental naturalism, but evident sympathy - the careworn features and dispirited demeanour of the proletarian women who consulted her husband. She made no more individual portraits of this kind after the First World War - in which her younger son was killed - instead taking up more universal themes and archetypal images of poverty, grief and suffering.",

London, V&A Publications, 2001.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>K\u00e4the Kollwitz (1867-1945)</b> \n\n<i>Arbeiterfrau (Working-Class Woman)</i>, 1903 \n\nKollwitz (n\u00e8e Schmidt) had originally intended to become a painter but soon realized that her real talents lay in drawing and printmaking.  This decision was influenced by the great German etcher Max Klinger, and in particular his views on the respective applications of painting and printmaking.  According to Klinger, painting is best suited to 'the glorification, the triumph of the world', whereas prints and drawings are better suited to the description of 'resignation...misery...the pitiful creature in his eternal struggle...'  Schmidt, who had been born into a politically radical family, was already drawn to subjects of this latter kind.  Her marriage in 1891 to a doctor, Karl Kollwitz, brought her into close contact with the hardship and misery of life in one of the poorest working-class districts of East Berlin, where her husband had his practice.  Over the next two decades she worked on two print series that addressed proletarian revolution: <i>A Weavers' Uprising</i> (1893-7) and <i>Peasants' War</i> (1903-8).  She also established what were to be her characteristic themes: the struggles of the working class, the lives of proletarian women and pacifism. \nDespite the socialist sympathies evident in her choice of subjects, Kollwitz disavowed overt political propaganda.  She explained that 'the life of the workers...provided me with what I found beautiful.'  But she also acknowledged that 'the fate of the proletariat...took hold of [her] with great force' when she came to know 'the gravity and tragedy of the most miserable kind of proletarian existence' through her meetings with the women who came for consultations with her husband.  A number of her prints from this period represent these women.  The focus is always on the face, with Kollwitz's spare but naturalistic style aptly describing the gaunt carewarn features and the often dispirited demeanour of her sitters.  This dispassionate portrait is all the more moving because it eschews any trace of the sentimentality that occasionally afflicted her later work.  She made no more individual portraits of this kind after the First World War.  She lost her younger son early in the war, and from then on, driven by her own loss and her anger at the waste and suffering she had seen, she took up universal themes, with archetypal images of motherhood, and of women in need, grief and despair.\"",
