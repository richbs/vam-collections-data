The Qutb Minar was started in 1199 as the victory tower of Qutb-ud Din Aibak, commemorating the Muslim dominance of Delhi. It was completed by his successor, Iltutmish, and the top was restored by Firoz Shah in 1369. The picture shows the cupola added by Colonel Robert Smith in 1828 and removed in 1848.\n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
