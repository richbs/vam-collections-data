Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. She first experimented with solarisation in 1934 in Paris, at the same time as Man Ray (1890-1976) and Lee Miller (1907-1977), although she claimed that she discovered the technique independently of them. Solarisation happens when negatives are exposed to light in the darkroom during developing and printing, producing partly reversed images. Bing\u2019s experiments developed from an interest in light, as she explained, at the time \u2018light was considered the medium that permits photography. But for me it became the main subject: the protagonist of my photography\u2019.\n\nThe fragmentation of the watches caused by solarisation gives an abstract, surreal effect \u2013 the watch faces appear to float in a void, highlighted by the buckles which gleam in the light. Although Bing may not have been familiar with Salvador Dal\u00ed's (1904-1989) work at the time, watch faces became a surrealist symbol after Dal\u00ed\u2019s 1931 painting \u2018The Persistence of Memory\u2019.",
