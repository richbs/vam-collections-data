            "public_access_description": "This brooch, which can also be worn as a pendant, was designed by one of the pre-eminent Victorian architects William Burges (1827-1881) for another distinguished architect John Pollard Seddon (1827-1906) and his wife Margaret Barber (1836-1910), who were married in 1864.  Another example of the brooch, also bearing their initials, is known, and it would appear that the brooches were made as gifts for bridesmaids.  In the album of jewellery designs by Burges in the Victoria and Albert Museum there is a design for the brooch with two sections, as well as a design for the back and a design for a quarter of the frame to show how it would be made under the flowers (V&amp;A inventory no. 8830:11).  The stones are identifed as carbuncle (garnet) and 'turq[oise]' (the design has been cropped).  The design is inscribed 'Seddon'.  Among other designs of the same type in the album is one for another client inscribed 'bridesmaids', specifying that six should be made in silver.  No number of examples is specified for the Seddon brooch.\n\nThe frame of the brooch is medieval in inspiration.  The 'lopped-bough' motif, which was known as bresseronn\u00e9 or brossonn\u00e9 work in France, is documented in the fourteenth century, and was popular in the fifteenth century.  Although the flowers are not forget-me-nots, the turquoise colour would have spoken of love in the Victorian language of flowers.\n\nThe re-discovery of this brooch and of the other Seddon brooch was due to the jewellery historian Geoffrey Munn.  Asked by the BBC Antiques Roadshow what missing object he would like to see found, he showed pictures of the Burges designs in the V&amp;A which he and Charlotte Gere had published in their book, Artists' Jewellery, in 1989.  A keen-eyed viewer recognised one of the designs as being that of a brooch her mother had inherited.  It was sold by Gildings of Market Harborough on 2 August 2011.  When the story was repeated by the BBC in a review of the year, a second example was brought to light by a viewer and it is this example which has been acquired by the V&amp;A.",
