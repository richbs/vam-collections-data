It is probably made by Cointre in Dieppe, France, in ca. 1820. The figures were ascribed to Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger (1680-1756) at the time of their acquisition in 1949. \nCointre (ca. 1790-1820) was an ivory carver that apparently specialised in carving genre figures of beggars in ivory in a style which looked forward to the work of Pierre-Adrien Graillon (1807/9-1872). The dark wood socles are typical of his work too. Such genre figures were typical in France in the second half of the nineteenth century, as exemplified by the work of Pierre-Adrien Graillon.",
