Although the tradition of the family who donated the carving to the Museum indicated that it was made in the 1730s, the similarity of this carving to a carved coat of arms dating from around 1710 also in the V&A's collection suggests that it was more probably made between 1715 and 1720 during the reign of George I.\n\nIn the face of opposition from supporters of the Roman Catholic son of the deposed James II, this coat of arms boldly illustrated George I's lineage and his claim to the throne.  The unusual inclusion of profile busts of Charles I, Charles II and Anne are heavy-handed reminders of George's Stuart ancestry, possibly applied at a later date.",
