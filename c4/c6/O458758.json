            "physical_description": "FORM: An Oval dish on a raised foot, in the form of a lotus leaf, with the foliated rim folded alternately inwards and outwards.\nCORE: The core is not visible at any point, but is relatively thick to the touch.\nSURFACE: The surface is decorated with lacquer in the polychrome 'tian qi' (filled-in) lacuqer technique. The basic ground colour is a dark red, other principal colours  being olive green, black, brown and yellow.\nThe underside and outer part of the upper side are decorated with lines representing the veins of the lotus leaf, filled in with fairly crude scrolling. The centre of the upper side is decorated with a stylised lotus flower, in the middle of which are a wheel of panels containing the inscription, in debased 'lantas' characters, 'Om mani pedme hum', around the syllable 'hum'.\nINSCRIPTION: Incised on the base 'Da Ming Xuande Nian Zhi'.\nPROVENANCE: Formerly in the collection of Fritz Low-Beer, and illustrated by him in ''Chinese Lacquer of the Early 15th Century'', BMFEA 22 (1950), 145-167 (pl. 26).\nDISCUSSION: Described originally by Garner as 'Chinese or Ryukyu Islands, 16th Century'', But accepted by Wang Shixiang (10/1983) as an authentically Chinese piece of the Xuande period and of the highest quality. A very similar piece in the Palace Museum, Beijing was seen by the cataloguer 4/1986.\nFor general discussions of 'tianqi' lacquers see Sir Harry Garner, ''Chinese Lacquer''(London, 1979), pp179-194, and Wang Shixiang, ''Xiu shi lu jie huo''(Beijing,1983), pp.95-100. Wang illustrates a box decorated with a 'lantsa' character, and there is another example in ''Gugong qiqi tezhan mulu'' (Taibei, 1981), no.81. (cc 27/6/1986)",
