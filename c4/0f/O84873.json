He topped the bill as \u2018The King of Handcuff Kings and Jail Breaker\u2019, and offered \u00a3100 to anyone who could open his handcuffs. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. The highlight of Hardeen\u2019s act there was his 30-second escape from a box into which he was handcuffed, within a tied bag, and his substitution by a female assistant. Carlton the card manipulator, another of Cooke\u2019s subjects, was also on the bill at the Grand that week.\n\nHardeen was born Theodore Weiss (1876-1945). He was the younger brother of the Jewish American escapologist Harry Houdini, who set him up with his act and later bequeathed him his equipment. Despite achieving less fame, Hardeen was an extremely accomplished escapologist. He was the first to realise the dramatic potential of straitjacket escape in full view of the audience.",
