            "public_access_description": "This is one of a series of wallpapers which were designed and produced for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Each pattern in the series was inspired by the crystalline structure of a chemical compound, in this case boric acid. The crystallographer in this instance was Helen Megaw. The series was developed as the result of a collaboration between the Festival Pattern Group and the wallpaper manufacturer John Line & Sons Ltd. The four wallpapers produced for the Festival were used extensively in the Festival site - in the Regatta Restaurant, the Exhibition of Science and in the Dome of Discovery.",
