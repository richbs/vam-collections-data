His main stock seems to have been cutlery (some of it sold in special boxes), razors, penknives and scissors, including horse scissors. Patten evidently marked some, if not all, of his goods with his name or initials. The eel and the pike at the bottom of the card are a reference to his sideline in fishing tackle.  The engraver has combined the fanciful with the commonplace. An exotic  Chinoiserie dragon, perched on a branch of curling scrollwork, has a couple of Patten's combs hanging from its teeth. The engraver probably based the overall design on another trade card by Henry Copland for a goldsmith and watchmaker, Thomas Gardner. Copland in turn had partly based his card on a plate from A Book of Ornaments (1745) by Matthias Lock.\n\nPlace\nHenry Patten's address is given as 'at the Saw and Crown in Middle Row Holborn'. Before London streets were numbered systematically, commercial premises were identified by their shop signs.  Patten's shop sign may have resembled the saw and crown in the centre of the upper part of the card.",
