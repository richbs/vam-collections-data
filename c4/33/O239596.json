Franke's first digitally-produced graphics.  In collaboration with the artist, Peter Henne wrote the computer program that generated and manipulated the curves.  These algebraic curves formed the basic element of the image, and the computer program produced a series of slow, step-by-step, tranformations. The curves could be enlarged, lengthened, or reduced, for example, producing sequences and patterns\n\nHerbert W. Franke is a pioneering figure in the history of computer art.  In 1971, he produced one of the first accounts of computer art entitled 'Computer graphics - Computer art'.  In 1979, he co-founded the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, an annual event that unites art and technology.  Franke is also well known as a successful author of science fiction novels.",
