It was made by the large and prestigious manufacturers Elkington & Co., who had a factory in Birmingham and a shop in London\u2019s Regent Street. \n\nBy the 1870s, exotic cultures, particularly Japan, had seized the public imagination and Elkington & Co. was one of the first manufacturers to produce silver in the Japanese taste. A key figure was the botanist Christopher Dresser (1834\u20131904), the first industrial designer. In 1876 he visited Japan as a representative of the British government to study Japanese design, and published an account of his travels. The simplicity of Japanese applied arts was much admired. Here the impact is created by the engraved and matted ornament rather than the restrained forms of the vessels.",

A key figure was Christopher Dresser, who visited Japan in 1876 and published an account of his travels. The simplicity of Japanese applied arts was much admired. Elkingtons were one of the first manufacturers to produce silver in the Japanese taste. Here, the impact is created by the engraved and matted ornament, rather than the restrained forms of the vessels.",
