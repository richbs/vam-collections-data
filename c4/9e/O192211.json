An eight-bracket <i>Kraak</i> frame surrounds a scene with two figures. A hatted man with his bare left leg stretched out, sits on a rocky mound with two hollow rocks. His left hand holds a long-necked bottle, his right hand is on his heart. Behind him a small bottle is set on a dotted table with only two legs. On the left a thin rock border reaches to the volutes of a cloud with a pine and two bamboo trees by its side and two small birds in mid-air. Only part of the other figure dressed in white is visible. He has a sharp nose and hair pulled back. The eight leafy peach panels on the outside have <i>comma</i> dividers.",

The striking effect of the new style of decoration made the design popular not only with the Persian potter but also across western Europe. The design originated in the Tang dynasty when the flattened petals of the lotus decorated Buddhist paintings, stone tiles and various artefacts. These panels vary in number but they are usually six or eight according to the size of the dish. Flowers, fruit, birds and sacred emblems are adopted as decorations and the simplified leafy peach motif becomes especially popular in both China and Persia. In the 17th century Persian potters reinterpret the human figures copied from Chinese models in a comic manner.",

Iranian potters were almost exclusively preoccupied with making wares in the styles of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain some close copies and some more fanciful. Echoes of earlier traditions remained, in particular in the black-under-turquoise colour scheme that dates back in Iran to the end of the 12th century. Towards the end of the 16th century there was a widening of interest that blossomed in the 17th century to a wide range of styles and techniques in which blue and white plays a dominant but not exclusive role.",
