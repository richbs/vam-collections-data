            "public_access_description": "This beautifully carved and lifelike marionette is easy to manipulate due to its excellent construction and weight. It was carved by the artist Arthur Wilkinson (1882-1957) who was inspired to make puppets in 1914 by some toy Italian puppets. He started as a professional puppeteer by touring England in a caravan with his brother Walter and performing with puppets he carved.Walter Wilkinson went on to concentrate on the revival of glove puppetry in Britain, while Arthur Wilkinson continued with marionettes.\n\nBy the 1920s Arthur Wilkinson was so concerned that puppetry had become neglected in England that he began The Marionette Society to produce marionette theatre throughout the country. He launched the society with a performances at the Poetry Bookshop in London in November 1923, using his own figures including Harlequin, Columbine, the dragon and Pantaloon. By 1928 he had carved the remarkable set of marionettes illustrated on a flier for his show including this monkey and Marino, Pagliacci and Pimpinella, and Harlequin and Columbine. After Arthur Wilkinson married Lily Gair his show became known as the 'Gair Wilkinson Marionettes', and he later assumed the name Gair Wilkinson professionally.",

            "bibliography": "Daily Telegraph, 28 November 1921\nA delightful entertainment for children is the Wilkinson Puppet Show, which Messrs Heal and Sons have provided for their visitors in their galleries in Tottenham Court Road.  And it may be whispered that the parents and sponsors who accompany the fortunate children will be even more amused by the show than their young charges.  Indeed, it required a mature and trained judgement fully to appreciate the artistry with which the wonderful dolls are fashioned and manipulated.  Everything to do with the performance is tuned to a nicety to engage a child's imagination.  The tiny theatre, designed in Heal's distinctive way, is just the size to give the intimacy that the puppets need.  The Showman, a pre-Raphaelite figure with a guitar, sits beside the stage and mediates between the puppets and the audience in a soft voice, sometime with the stave of a song, sometimes by a mere aside, until step by step he has the imagination captured in Puppetland.  The puppets themselves do not depend for effect upon suggestion.  They are realists, and one cannot afford to miss a single one of their gestures or the slightest turn of their heads.  There is a Harlequin who is alive in every muscle and full of grace; a Pantaloon who is a character-study of genial age; a Clown who dare to clamber over the footlights and join the audience, and still maintains the illusion of his animation. There are numerous other figures, 'Il Capitano', Columbine, the Blackamoor, and so forth, and they all walk and dance and gesture like trained actors, while words issue from their mouths with ventriloquial effect.  Mr Wilkinson and his brother artists are giving their show four times daily from now until Christmas at twelve, three, four and five o'clock.  Admission is free.\nDaily News & Reader, 10 March 1916\nPuppets have an extraordinary fascination for some minds.  Hazlitt, as we are reminded by the Showman of the Gair Wilkinsons' puppet show, which gave an afternoon performance at the Margaret Morris Theatre, in Chelsea, yesterday afternoon thought puppets the best of all entertainments.  Maeterlinck wrote a number of plays for marionettes, and Mr Gordon Craig startled the world some time ago by coming to the logical conclusion of his theories that puppets are the only artistic protagonists of the drama. \n\nThe Showman yesterday does not believe that they have the impersonality which Mr Craig thought would be a such a valuable asset in dramatic performances, and confesses than they have put many an idea into his head.  That is only right, for Mr Wilkinson (the Showman) has given his puppets life.  They do everything but talk, and that is the secret of their reality.  In the performance of a puppet show the dialogue, though dramatically spoken, is only a kind of label, made necessary by our obtuseness.  For the Gair Wilkinson puppets think with profound subtlety, and the verbal translation of their thoughts must necessarily be inadequate.  These puppets make great play with their hands.  They do not seem British by birth.  And they have wonderful joints, so all their limbs are eloquent.\n\nWe saw six little dramas yesterday.  One of them, 'Black Magic', with vivid snakes dancing to the incantation of Morino the Blackamoor, was extraordinarily real; another, a duel between a Cavalier and a Scotchman, had the unexpected violence of a cinema fight.  There was a Pimpinella, a dainty damsel, with red hair and wide open, mysterious eyes, with whom we all fell in love.  The Gair Wilkinson puppets are not common artists, and the show is a thing to see.\n<i>Puppets and the Puppet Stage</i> by Cyril Beaumont\np.113. Illustration of 'Marino and His Monkey'",

He launched the society with a series of performances at the Poetry Bookshop in London in November 1923, using his own figures including Harlequin, Columbine, the dragon and Pantaloon.  An original advertisement for the show mentions: 'an entirely new Harlequinade showing such contrivances in Scenic Art as shall set both Harlequin and Columbine dancing with delight'.\n\nMost of these figures probably date from about 1920. When Arthur and Walter performed The Wilkinson Puppet Show at Heal's in November 1921 the reviewer noted a Harlequin, a Pantaloon, a Clown, Il Capitano, Columbine and and a Blackamoor. We know that most of the marionettes in this collection were in use by 1928 since a hand-coloured leaflet produced by Gair Wilkinson to publicise his show is illustrated with Harlequin on the cover and inside with Pimpinella and Pagliacco, between the Dragon (which St George fought to rescue Princess Cleodolinda), and Pantaloon, who took part in the Harlequinade.",
