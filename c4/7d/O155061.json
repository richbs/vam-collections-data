Dedicated to producing the best works of foreign writers, the Gate established itself by 1981 as one of London's best fringe venues, along with the King's Head and the Bush. In 1982  the club expanded to include a brand-new custom-built studio theatre in Battersea, above the Latchmere Pub.\n\nMaske opened on 27 August 1981 and ran until 19 September. It featured the three plays The Underpants, The Snob and 1913, adapted by Lou Stein from Carl Sternheim's cycle Scenes from the Heroic Life of the Middle Classes. The plays are a cartooned and caricatured account of German domestic and political life in the years immediately preceding World War I, with farcical action incorporating the saga of dropped knickers and the collapse of the gold standard.  The George Grosz drawing on the poster mirrors the cartoon-like tone of the production.",
