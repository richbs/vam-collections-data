She had already played keyboards, supplied backing vocals and artwork for the fourth album and on joining Fleetwood Mac, she would contribute to song writing as well. Her addition to the band changed its musical direction, leading from a blues style to a pop-orientated sound that would eventually produce the 40 million selling 1977 album Rumours. In 2006, American arts magazine Paste named McVie as the 83rd greatest living songwriter. \n\nThis notebook features the lyric ideas and thoughts of Christine McVie, correlating with some of the band's songs from their 1973 album Mystery to Me.",
