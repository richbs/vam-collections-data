A larger plain star emerges from this pattern filled with overlapping scales with dots. The flange is incised with eight double leaves springing from a small lozenge shape. A pale blue glaze covers the outside. There is a red cross, not a mark, inside the base ring.",

Its decoration features a central eight-pointed star filled with a neat lattice of florets with leaves. The points lead to triangular panels filled with alternating flower sprays of flower lattices. A larger plain star emerges from this pattern filled with overlapping scales with dots. The style of this dish is similar to the Chinese Ahua style meaning a secret or hidden decoration. The original Persian contribution to this style consists of the combination of various geometric patterns with incised contours emphasized in blue.",

Painted motifs were combined with incised and sometimes moulded patterns. The final effect has similarities with the Chinese <i>Anhua</i> style meaning a secret or hidden decoration. This fine type of incised work first appeared in China in the Yongle period (1403-1424). Moulded dishes were also produced at the end of the Yuan dynasty. The original Persian contribution to this style consists of the combination of various geometric patterns with incised contours emphasized in blue. Incised repeats include segmented waves, dotted or plain overlapping scales, bracketed pairs of leaves and gadrooned lines. A plain coloured glaze in shades of blue or celadon usually covers the outside of the dish, and this treatment may indicate a connection with plain-glazed vessels, both Chinese and Persian, of the same period.",
