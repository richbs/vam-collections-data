The two capitals are of the same dimensions and shape and share a tautness and graphic intensity in the treatment of their plant-form which distinguishes them from their classical models. \nAnother similar capital can be found in the Jewett Art Centre, Wellesley College, Massachusettes which has been assigned to Provence or northern Italy and given a date in the middle of the twelfth century by Walter Cahn. Paul Williamson has identified capitals of similar proportions but of finer quality, which were orginally from the upper cloister of Saint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert and are now mostly in the Cloisters Collection of The Metropolitan Museum in New York. This similarity has led to an attribution to south-eastern France possibly Languedoc. This capital is also likely to have originated from a cloister.\n\nThe cloister, usually a covered walkway or ambulatory surrounding a quadrangle, with a plain wall on the one side, and a series of windows or an open colonnade on the other, was a monastic adaptation of the old Roman atrium. The walkway provided a means of communication between the various parts of a monastery, and the word cloister became a synonym for the monastic life. The word is the English equivalent of the Latin word clausura (from claudere, \"to shut up\"). This word occurs in Roman law in the sense of rampart, barrier, [cf. Code of Justinian, 1. 2 sec. 4; De officiis Praef. Praet. Africae (1, 27), 1. 4 De officiis mag. officiorum (I, 31)]. In the \"Concordia Regularum\" of St. Benedict of Aniane, c. xli, sec. 11, we find it in the sense of \"case\", or \"cupboard\" (Migne, P.L., CIII, 1057). In modern ecclesiastical usage, clausura signifies, materially, an enclosed space for religious retirement; formally, it stands for the legal restrictions opposed to the free egress of those who are cloistered or enclosed and to the free entry, or free introduction, of outsiders within the limits of the material clausura.",
