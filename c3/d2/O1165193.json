            "public_access_description": "This doll is a lovely example of a small-sized poupee, a fashion doll probably produced by the famous French doll company, Jumeau.  The doll does not have any kind of company mark on the head which was fairly usual of these poupees, but she is thought to be made by Jumeau.\n\nJumeau began manufacturing bisque dolls in the 1840s, firstly in Paris and then in Montreuil-sous-Bois just outside Paris and reached the height of their popularity around the 1880s. Their dolls are commonly thought to be some of the finest bisque dolls of the 19th century because of a high level of craftsmanship and a level of detail given to dressing the dolls in beautiful clothing and accessories. Jumeau exhibited their dolls at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and won a first place medal.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Jumeau faced increased competition from a wealth of more affordable manufactured dolls, particularly in Germany, but Jumeau dolls, particularly early examples are still highly sought after by collectors.\n\nThis doll has been dressed in a black silk button up 'princess line' dress with a small train at the back. She has a bonnet trimmed in black velvet and a pair of blue leather boots, stockings and a full set of undergarments.  The style of dress is typical of fashionable dress of the 1880s.\n\nThe company later followed on from their popular adult fashion dolls by producing the hugely popular Jumeau Bebes from 1877. These dolls were made in the image of children but still continued to have fashionable costumes and accessories.",
