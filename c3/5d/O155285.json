If you run your fingers across this piece it feels like it has a seam down the left hand side, with the added piece extending the width, although I cannot feel a seam down the right hand side the pattern and the colours are different, so a piece might have been added.\nThere is a border along the bottom [band A] with an upward right pointing pale blossom alternating with a downward right pointing pink blossom.  There are diagonal green leaves. There is a narrow edging of pink, light blue and yellow.  A narrow band is above, below and to the sides extending part way up the sides of the panel.  It has small pairs of green leaves with pink or white flowers [band B].  A section of band A on a larger scale forms an outer border part way up either side.  Band B creates a small square in the lower corners.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of brown diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These also edge the various sections in the borders.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a diagonal striped stem and bunch of pale flowers alternating with a striped stem pointing straight down with a pink blossom bending to the lower right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white and pink vase edged with light blue with a large pink carnation with green and pink striped edges and a pair of leaves edged with dark green edged at the base alternating with a larger yellow and pink vase outlined with light blue with a central spray of 3 white flowers and other small flowers.\n[b] a wider stripe with branching stems with a pale rosette outlined in pink and 2 pink rosettes outlined in green alternating with a large bunch of round white blossoms.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, light green, green, dark green, orange, beige, brown, white, light grey, light blue, blue, yellow, dark orange.",
