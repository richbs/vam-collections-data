She started making preliminary sketches but he was making up so fast - the whole process taking only about five minutes - that she resorted to the camera.\n\nThe circus clown Oleg Popov, or Oleg Konstantinovich Popov, known as the Sunny Clown, was born in Moscow in 1930, the son of a clock-maker.  After studying at the Russian circus school in Moscow he began his career in 1949 in  the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard, and six years later, he became the first clown from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to perform in the Western world. In 1969 he was honoured with the title of the 'People's Artist of the USSR'.",
