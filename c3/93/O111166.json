Richard Starkey, or Ringo Starr (b.1940), was a highly respected drummer on the Liverpool beat music scene when he joined The Beatles in 1962.  The drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, he first played with The Beatles when they were in Hamburg. The other Beatles encouraged their manager Brian Epstein to replace Pete Best with Ringo, and his slightly off-beat drumming following the singer's lead became a key element in The Beatles' sound.  Ringo discovered a talent for acting whilst in The Beatles' films  A Hard Day's Night and Help!, and went on to make films with Peter Sellers, Mae West and David Essex. He became well known as the most popular voice for the televised cartoon Thomas the Tank Engine, and continues touring with his All Starr Band.\n\nThe earliest examples of Beatles' merchandising were produced in the United States, after Brian Epstein sold a company called Seltaeb the rights to license it.  After a flood of successful Beatles items from stockings to talcum powder, Epstein realised the lucrative potential of the market and kept firm control of all future licensing. This tile is one of a set of five produced in England, one representing each individual band member and one showing the group.",
