            "physical_description": "This is a push along toy which first appeared in the 1953/54 Tri-ang catalogue with the title Skipping Man under the `Animated and Nursery Toys' section. The idea of the toy is that as the toy is pushed along the `skipping rope' moves around the figure. It is an unusual toy in design and a forerunner of a number of modern plastic push/pull toys. It crosses the period from the older wooden push alongs, usually horse related, toddler toys to the modern brightly coloured plastic ones. The toy consists of two uprights of wood painted red and a top cross bar of wood, also painted red. The bottom ends of the uprights are mounted on a metal bar which has a wooden wheel attached at each end. The wheels are painted dark green. On the inside of each wheel is a wooden spool, also painted green, and two more spools are attached to the outside of the uprights about one third up from the bottom. Running between the two spools on each side is a knotted length of string, one black and one white, which are probably replacements. The figure, turned wood with legs attached, is painted mainly yellow with black `hair', black eyes and round nose with white around the eyes and a red mouth over a beige paint. On the head is a high round hat painted dark blue and down the front of the conical shaped body are painted 6 red dots. The legs are painted yellow. The arms are dowel sticks painted yellow and beige. Through the body at the shoulders and each arm is a large loop of metal painted white; it forms the skipping rope and is attached through the uprights to the upper spools. \nAs the toy is pushed along the strings turn the upper spools and these then turn the metal loop giving the appearance of the figure skipping. \n\n*On the back of the figure is the remains of a paper label which bore the Tri-ang trademarks.",
