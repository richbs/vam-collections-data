The following is the full text of the entry. 820 Design for a console supporting an allegorical figure of a woman who holds a small unidentified object in her right hand Inscribed in ink across the back on the right side 'Franc\u00b0.' Pen and ink and wash; incised with the stylus I2 <sup>1/8</sup> x 3 <sup>7/8</sup> (308 x 98) 9061.A PROVENANCE Bought 1883 This sheet was evidently originally part of the same sheet as no. 819, which was bought with it and has inscribed across the back a continuation of the same inscription, the letters 'tringa'. The attribution to Stringa rests solely on this old inscription. From the style it is hard to believe that the drawings date from later than 1650, when Stringa was only fifteen years old, and they reveal none of that warmth and robustness which Stringa displayed in his paintings. The old attribution can therefore hardly be defended. <i>Not illustrated </i>",
