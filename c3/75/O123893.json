'Four Hundred Years of Fashion' (Victoria and Albert Museum: 1984), p.94\n\"Schiaparelli closed her house in 1954, so we are fortunate to have the Duchess of Devonshire's ball gown from one of the designer's last collections.  She maintained the inventiveness which had brought her fame in the 1930s, and in the early 1950s was responsible for some compelling evening wear.  The shocking pink silk and white organza dress (T.397-1974) with floral patterned swirling circular skirt illustrates a romantic aspect of her later work.  At this time designers were preoccupied with elaborate necklines: here Schiaparelli creates a visually effective but impractical neckline with an inverted rippling frill.  In direct contrast she also made dramatic and revealing dresses suitable for femmes fatales, and in 1965 presented one, dated 1952, to the Museum.  It is an extremely tight strapless sheath with an enormous Volant at the right hip, in mauve and purple taffeta.\nDilys E.
