The large scale of the building and the style of the interior, decorated with medieval German carvings also supplied by Pugin, is shown very clearly in the picture on the front of this blotter. The picture is inscribed on the bottom right-hand side with the name of Jennens & Bettridge and, indistinctly, on the bottom left-hand side with the name of the cathedral. The blotter may have been made as a souvenir of the completion of the building, by Jennens & Bettridge, a local firm, who became one of the largest and most successful manufacturers of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. They used pictures of churches and other buildings, such as ruined castles, to decorate their products in response to popular interest in medieval life and designs in the 1840s and 1850s. \n\nThe back of the blotter has a picture of monks in a stone-flagged interior. Originally it would have been lined with blotting paper which has been replaced by a printed cotton.",

On the left hand corner of the front board is the signature of Jennens & Bettridge, a local firm, who may have produced the blotter as a souvenir following the completion of the Cathedral in 1841. Many of this firm's p\u00e2pier-mach\u00e9 products were decorated with views of imaginary Gothic buildings but in some examples, like this blotter, the firm used actual buildings as part of the decoration of their furniture and desk accessories. \n\nThe back board is painted with a view of monks in a stone flagged interior. Originally the blotter may have been lined with blotting paper.",
