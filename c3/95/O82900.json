Sherman makes us aware of just how immediately recognisable these images are and by acting out a bewildering variety of roles, surrounded by props, and altering her make-up, hair and costume, she shows how identities are a form of social performance. Her more recent work has used everything from historical costumes to false body parts to explore historical and forbidden images.",
