Most are made of cast silver, and they frequently have complex designs with Cyrillic inscriptions and iconographic details which are unique to the Russian Orthodox Church.  Like the filigree chains on which they were worn, they are very difficult to date accurately.  Their design has remained unchanged for centuries and many crosses are still being made today from old originals.\n\nThis cross was described as 17th century, when it was acquired in 1869, but its silver marks show that it was made in 1857, in traditional style.",
