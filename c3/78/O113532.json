It was awarded in recognition of his defeat of Daulat Rao Sindhia in the Second Anglo-Maratha War. \n\nThe Mughal Emperor no longer had military power, but as a descendant of Timur, still commanded great respect. Native rulers and officials still sought the formal sanction of the Mughal Emperor and valued the titles he bestowed upon them. It was a Mughal tradition that such standards were carried in processions during state ceremonies as symbols of status and rank. This standard symbolised the official sanction by the Mughal Emperor for the military action of the East India Company taken against the Marathas.",
