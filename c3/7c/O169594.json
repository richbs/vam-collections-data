There is no stand.\n\n'The outside of the case, presumably of poplar, is painted black with rather stiff garlands of flowers and leaves in two sorts of gilding. The interior of the lid is painted green and decorated with rococo scrollwork and putti, all in a greenish-yellow monochrome, apparently executed during the third quarter of the eighteenth century. The interior of the harpsichord and the keyboard surround are crudely painted with black and white arabesques to resemble vaguely the Antwerp block-printed papers commonly used to decorate seventeenth-century Flemish harpsichords and virginals. The soundboard of spruce is decorated in gouache with flowers, fruit, birds and arabesques, and contains the maker's rose as a trade mark: a winged figure holding a harp and supporting the initials I.R.\n\nHoward Schott, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part I: Keyboard Instruments</i>(London, 1978), pp. 57-58.",

Thereafter this harpsichord languished in the Kirckman factory. It was damaged in a fire there in 1855, since which time it has lacked its keys and jacks.",
