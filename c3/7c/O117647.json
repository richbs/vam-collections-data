            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 233, 240-241\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\u201cOn thin laid paper, roughly torn along the left-hand side.\nWhen No. 410 [249-1888] is turned back to front and top to bottom the irregularly torn edges and the truncated parts of the watermark exactly fit with No. 411 [250-1888], proving that the two sheets of paper were once one. On the back (not reproduced amongst the plates) is a rough pencil scribble, perhaps indicating tree forms. The identification of the scene on the recto as a view on the Stour dates from the time the drawing was received from Miss Isabel Constable (<i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>). \n\nA comparison between this drawing and No. 347 [237-1888] shows that it represents a rough reworking of the central section, comprising a barge being towed by a horse on the Stour, with water-meadows and clumps of trees in the distance. It is probably, like No. 410 [249-1888], a studio composition. Since No. 347 [237-1888] comes from a sketch-book used in 1832 both No. 411 [250-1888] and No. 410 [249-1888] are clearly not to be dated earlier than that year.
