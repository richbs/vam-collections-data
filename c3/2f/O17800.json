            "public_access_description": "Nicolas Lancret (1690-1743) was born in Paris where he first trained as an engraver before becoming the apprentice of the history painter Pierre Dulin (1669\u20131748), and enrolled as a student at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. He later entered the workshop of the genre and decorative painter Claude Gillot (1673-1722), who had been Watteau\u2019s master (1684-1721). He specialised in the genre of the f\u00eates galantes inaugurated by Watteau and decorative works for which enjoyed a considerable success. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Lancret\u2019s production of genre paintings showing elegant figures in an outdoor setting. The present picture shows a young lady pulled on a swing by a young man on the edge of a wood and evokes an amorous encounter. These lascivious scenes were often depicted to ornate rooms\u2019 panelling or piece of furniture. Lancret\u2019s genre paintings, influenced artists as diverse as Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-1770), William Hogarth (1697-1764) and Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788).",

A pupil of Pierre Dulin and, from ca. 1711 of Gillot, he was most strongly influenced by Watteau. He became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1719 and a Conseiller in 1735. Unsuccessful as a history painter, he painted mainly genre scenes and f\u00eates galantes. \nLit.

H. Zimmermann (1912) and Georges Wildenstein (1924). \nRecently, X-ray photographs and partial cleaning have revealed a decorative framework on all four sides which was painted over when the picture was transformed from a decorative panel into an easel painting. Its original appearance may be gauged by comparison with the two other versions of this composition that formed part of decorative schemes: one painted for the Salon of Monsieur de Boullonge (Wildenstein, no. 734, fig. 188; subsequently repr. in <i>Connoisseur</i>, October 1955 (cover) and sold at Parke-Bernet, 22-3 May 1959,lot 635) and the other in the Cleveland Museum of Art. As opposed to these, the versions of this composition that are easel paintings contain more than two figures (Wildenstein, nos. 232, 235; Christie's 17-8 May 1928, lot 130) and it would appear that the scene was reduced to its essentials when used in decorative schemes. The fact that it was a decorative panel, combined with its quality, which compares unfavourably with Lancret's best paintings, suggests that it may be the work of an assistant.\n\nCondition. Cleaned in 1964, when a decorative framework was revealed. In view of the impossibility of restoring the painting to its original shape and state, it was decided to cover up the uncovered areas of the framework and to leave the composition in its repainted state. \nProv.

It is now generally ascribed to Lancret, but it may be in part the work of a studio assistant. This was common practice with painters who received many commissions. Probably only the faces and figures, together with the finer details of the modelling, are from Lancret's own hand. Nevertheless, this is iconographically a more interesting picture than <i>Le Berger Indecis</i>(No.547-1882, Jones Collection) which is indisputably by Lancret himself. \n\nLancret was an imitator of Watteau, painting <i>fetes galantes</i>and <i>Commedia dell'Arte</i>scenes that were, in their time, as successful as the master's: a contemporary report, 1723, described him as 'the pupil of the late M. Gillot and the rival of the late M. Watteau'. His elegant and lively compositions lack those qualities of melancholy and psychological insight so characteristic of Watteau, but substitute humour and naturalism. \nHere he has chosen a subject that would have been familiar to the pleasure-loving court of Louis XV, a scene of amorous dalliance (the <i>fete galante</i>itself was a new subject in painting, an art of the manners and morals of love). The swing, in such a context, was a recurrent motif in 18th-century painting - Lancret himself repeated the subject at least eight times. \nAs well as suggesting leisure, idleness and passivity - for the swinger's action is controlled by her companion - it carried a weight of erotic connotation and innuendo. The constant back and forth motion could suggest inconstancy or fickleness, but was also a specific erotic metaphor for the physical act of love.\n\nThe picture was cleaned in 1964, revealing a decorative framework on all four sides. This indicated that it had originally been a decorative panel transformed into an easel picture by over-painting at a later date. The nature of the picture's original purpose is one reason to suppose the composition partly or wholly the work of an assistant. \n\nThough the colour and the handling are not equal to Lancret's best work, it is nevertheless a charming and competent picture. The landscape setting is depicted with a convincing naturalism, and is not simply a painted backdrop to the action. The delicate colouring is typical of Lancret, as is the evident skill in rendering rich fabrics. The boy's costume is in the style of the period, but the girl's attire is essentially fancy dress. The simple 'shepherdess' gown is again derived from the theatrical fantasies of Watteau. The picture is a Rococo confection, most evocative of the frivolity and hedonism which constitute the public image of court life. \n\nGillian Saunders\"\n1893 Catalogue, p. 181.\nSir C.

After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.

They often include figures dressed in <i>commedia dell'arte</i> costumes and evoke a lascivious aristocratic world. Because of their intimate and often ambiguous subject matter, these pictures were also used as decorative compositions inserted in architectural structures or pieces of furniture. \n\nThe theme of the swing was common in 18th-century French painting and appears as an implicit allusion to carnal love. Another example of the same subject by Lancret with more figures is in the Hermitage, St Petersburg while <i>The Swing</i> by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (London, Wallace collection)may be the most famous 18th-century illustration of the theme.",
