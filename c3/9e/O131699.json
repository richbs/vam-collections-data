The back, gently raked above the seat, has an arched lunette carved with rose and leaves, and a bottom rail carved with C-scrolls, enclosing two baluster-shaped vertical turnings (and two more half-turned pieces of the same profile). The front legs are turned, with large ovals between square-sections, joined by a single front stretcher turned with tapers flanking a central reel. The four side stretchers, and the single, low back stretcher are rectangular. Of joined construction, single-pegged except for where the side rails are jointed to the back uprights which are double-pegged.\n\nModifications \nA dark stain overall, concealing various unobtrusive repairs: the left upright (replaced from just above  the seat; reinforcing infill to right upright, just above the seat; infill behind the \u2018neck\u2019 of the right finial; repaired section to the left turned baluster of the back; \nThere are two empty holes in the seat, near the rails, apparently a mistake in manufacture.",
