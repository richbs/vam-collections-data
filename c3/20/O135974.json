Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis playbill was produced for the production of Shakespeare's Macbeth at the Royal Princess's Theatre in London's Oxford Street on 16th March 1863, following its production at Windsor Castle on 4th February. Its format is a copy of the large paper playbills that Charles Kean was producing at the time, detailing costume sources, all the spectacular scene designs as well as the large cast and stage crew. Queen Victoria was fond of theatre and frequently requested private performances at Windsor which Charles Kean staged for her. Another silk programme would have been produced for the evening itself at Windsor.",
