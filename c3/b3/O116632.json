They are also found in the Greek islands of the Aegean, such as the Cyclades and Dodecanese, where they are sometimes enamelled.\n\nThese were described as late 16th century Venetian when they were acquired by the Museum in 1900, but as they were found in Patmos it seems just as likely that they are Greek, from the late 18th or 19th century.",
