Professional Ski Simulator is an isometric 3D sports simulation game released by Code Masters in 1987 for the Amstrad CPC. Gameplay consists of simulated downhill skiing of increasing difficulty. Players can race against each other, or against the computer. The slope must be completed passing through all of the checkpoints and within a time limit. The game is viewed in overhead isometric 3D perspective and the game screen always tracks the leading contestant, so if a player falls too far behind he will lose sight of his skier. However, an icon map in the corner of the screen shows the locations of both players and the checkpoints, enabling a skilled player to still complete the race. This object was published by Codemasters, one of the oldest British video game developers.",
