In 1811 he was appointed Watchmaker to the Prince Regent (later George IV), and the following year he presented a 'superb gold chronometer of his making' to his royal patron.\n\nThis 'wheel barometer' has two small dials for reading finer gradations of atmospheric pressure than can be shown on the main dial. Above this is a thermometer, with three different scales of temperature, including Fahrenheit. The case is decorated with panels of verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9 (glass gilded and painted on the back). The bottom one shows a thistle for Scotland, where Russell worked, in Falkirk. On top is a finial of Prince of Wales feathers, probably in reference to his royal appointment.",
