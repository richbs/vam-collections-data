            "public_access_description": "A writing box such as this would have been fitted with various implements utilised for writing from an ink stick, water dropper, ink stone and brushes. To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took time and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. \nThis box is illustrated with seasonal autumnal motifs from the reddish foliage of the maple on the exterior to the interior of ferns and falling leaves. The leaves are being blown in a strong autumnal breeze and three characters of a poem, fuku kaze ni (the winds that blow), are illustrated across the lid of the box. A design that combines both literary associations with pictorial representations.  \nThe poem reads: \n\n'If only I could\norder the gusting breezes\nI should like to say\nI command you to leave this\nsolitary tree alone.'\n\nThis interspersed style dates back to the 14th century and is meant to suggest a particular poem to the reader as only a few characters of the poem are ever shown. This box is by Tasai, a pupil of Taishin who mimicked the highly creative lacquer style of Shibata Zeshin (1807-1891). The box included the seal Koma in honour of Zeshin who was a pupil of the lacquerer Koma Kansai (1766-1835). \nDuring the Meiji period lacquer production went into decline and many artisans had to seek other modes of employment. The impact of westernisation on Japanese society had caused lacquerware to be considered unfashionable by the general population. Lacquerers that continued in the industry had to find other creative means of promoting interest in their wares, often by modernising and improving old techniques through a shinier finish and greater range and vibrancy in colour, as seen in this example.",
