These are clearly visible in John Mead's watercolour drawing of the building executed in 1826 and now in the Guildhall Library in London (Culme, 1977, p. 30). The engraved fish on the trowel are obviously a reference to this sign.  It is curious that so prominent a firm of manufacturers should have used a second-hand trowel for such a significant event; presumably, the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone was only decided upon when it was too late to produce a trowel especially for the occasion.
