            "public_access_description": "Louis Le Nain (ca. 1600-24 May 1648) was born in Laon and was taught there by a foreign artist, possibly Claude Vignon. He moved to Paris before 1629 with his brother Antoine (ca. 1600-26 May 1648) and Mathieu (ca. 1607- 26 April 1677) with whom he had always worked, settling in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. As they worked together, the attribution of their paintings is still problematic. They ran an important studio in Paris and enjoyed a great success as portrait and genres painters. \n\nThis painting was recently firmly attributed to Louis Le Nain. It shows a family of peasants with a flat landscape and a low blue sky in the background in a particularly large format.  Particularly notable is the monumentality of the figures and their sombre dignity that was unusual for the period, which appears to be a distinctive feature of the Le Nain, responsible for the introduction of genre painting in France during the second quarter of the 17th century.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 169-70, cat. no. 208.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nLouis LE NAIN (1593-1648) \nFrench School \nBorn at Laon in 1593, Louis was the second of three brothers - the others were Antoine (b. 1588) and Mathieu (b. 1607) - who shared a studio in Paris from about 1630 and painted genre scenes with a realism unusual in French art of the period. All three became members of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1648, the year of the death of Louis and Antoine. Mathieu, who also painted religious subjects and aristocratic portraits, survived until 1677. \nAs their work became more decisively disentangled in the 1920S and '30s, Louis emerged as the greatest of the three, indeed, as one of the outstanding artists of the 17th century. In the 17th century he became known as <i>Le Romain</i>. Whether he actually went to Rome or not, the suggestion that he was influenced by Italian artists, such as Orazio Gentileschi, is convincing. Dutch and Spanish influence has also been detected in his work.\n\n208 \nLANDSCAPE WITH FIGURES (LA HALTE DU CAVALIER) \nCanvas \n21 \u00bd x 26 \u00bd (54.6 x 67.3) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.17\n\nThis picture, or one of its replicas, was boldly attributed to Louis in a description of 1829 (Champfleury, 1862, p. 173), but subsequently the difficulties involved in separating the work of the three brothers led to its being catalogued simply as 'Le Nain' or as 'Antoine and Louis'. However, since Paul Jamot's articles of 1922-23 the ascription of this painting to Louis has not been questioned and, indeed, it is very close in style to his late masterpieces of the 1640s, such as <i>La Charrette</i> (Louvre, 1641). There are two versions, identical except for the facial expressions: (1) in the collection of Pablo Picasso (59 x 68 cm.); Sedelmeyer sale, Paris, 1907, i, no. 222, repr. p. 201; exhibited, Le Nain, Petit Palais, 1934, no. 14, repr.; (2) formerly Colonel Clerc, Paris (56 X 66 cm.); exhibited <i>Paysage fran\u00e7ais de Poussin \u00e0 Corot</i>, 1925, no. 177; repr. <i>Catalogue illustr\u00e9</i>, 1926, pl. xvii; sold Charpentier, Paris, 9 May 1952, lot 70, repr. Most of the individual figures recur frequently in Louis' paintings. The bearded man, for example, reappears in the Repas des Paysans and the Forge, both in the Louvre. \nPart of the discussion concerning the antecedents of Louis Le Nain's style has been focused on the woman in this painting. George Isarlov (1934) saw in her the influence of Frans Hals; Paul Fierens (1933) that of Jan Sieberechts.\n\nCondition. Pigment worn thin in several areas. The green of the landscape background can be recognized through the paint of the figures, showing that these were painted over the completed landscape. \nProv. This painting, or one of the other versions, was sold as Le Nain at Paris, 18 Feb. 1788, collection M. de V ... , and another was in the Cabinet Francillon in 1829, described as Louis Le Nain (Champfleury, 1862, pp. 159, 173).

The name of Louis became attached to the best of their paintings, but as there are no securely documented works and the signed ones only bear the name LE NAIN, the traditional differentiation between the styles of the three brothers was decisively rejected in the retrospective exhibition of their work held in Paris in 1979. Even so, the paintings ascribed to Louis form a distinct group and it is as well to retain the original names for the sake of convenience. \n\nThe figures are silhouetted against a low sky and a flat agricultural landscape. They were painted over the completed landscape, of which the green shows through their clothes. The rare beauty of the picture lies in the monumental quality of each individual figure. They do not appear to relate to each other, but they have statuesque proportions and are imbued with human dignity. In this respect Le Nain's peasantry differ from those of his Netherlandish contemporaries, which tend to be boorish and clownish, to be laughed at or to be looked down upon, rather than admired. The V&A painting is very similar to other exterior genre groups of like size and equally cool tonality, such as the <i>Charrette</i> in the Louvre. This is signed <i>Le Nain 1641</i> and hence our picture may reasonably be dated to about the same period. Another version was owned by Picasso and passed with his collection to the Louvre. \n\nThe Le Nain scenes of rural life remain highly unusual in French painting until similar subjects were once again explored by 19th-century painters such as Millet. This has raised the question: for whom were they painted? It has been suggested that they found patrons among the growing section of the urban middle class which invested in land in the 17th century at a time when the French peasantry was economically hard pressed. There is evidence that much land was bought for the purpose of investment rather than residence, and it suggested that the <i>cavalier</i>, whose status is indicated by the ownership of a horse, represents the class of <i>fermier</i>, who managed the estate of an absentee landlord. Such speculation is hardly susceptible to proof, but there is no doubt that these rare scenes of French peasant life are social documents as well as monumental figure studies. \n\nMichael Kauffmann.\"\nChampfleury (pseudonym for Jules Fleury), <u>Les Fr\u00e8res Le Nain</u>, Paris: 1862, pp. 159, 173.\nC.

            "historical_context_note": "Formerly attributed to a follower of the Le Nain (Kauffmann, 1973), the authenticity of this painting has been fully asserted on the occasion of technical examinations in 1993. Infra-red photographs have indeed revealed the figure of a small child on a chair under the paint layer, beneath the figure of the boy on the left. This child looks exactly the same as in <i>Visit to the Grandmother</i>, The Hermitage, St Petersburg, dated ca. 1645-1648. P. Rosenberg in his monograph (1993) groups these two  paintings with a third one in the Louvre, Peasant Family in an Interior,  under the name of Louis Le Nain, making thus the distinction with the  other two Le Nain brothers, Antoine and Mathieu. \n\t\nThe V&amp;A painting shares the same subject matter with the Louvre and the Hermitage works and shows a family of peasants, the father and the mother framing the two young boys in the centre, in a landscape. Their humble condition is defined by their outfits as well as the animals (sheep, horse and a dog) standing beside the paterfamilias. The thematic is typical of the output of the Le Nain, who specialised in genre paintings on a large scale in the 17th century. \n\nUnlike their Netherlandish and Italian predecessors and contemporaries who specialised in small scale genre pictures representing village fairs and tavern scenes, the Le Nain chose to produce austere compositions in a much larger format that was previously favoured for history paintings. By doing so, they ennobled such subject matter and combined a realistic approach in the depiction of everyday details with a fine understanding of the different characters. Particularly notable are the monumentality of the figures and their calm and serene postures. The cool tonality of the painting enhances the monumental aspect through optical effects. \n\nThe representation of the individuals also allows reaching some universality through examples of different ages of man: the children, the young woman and the older man should be seen as symbols of the unity of different generations.\n\nThese paintings however remained far removed from any pastoral tradition in painting or literature and their meaning and purpose remain uncertain.  They may be connected with the particular preoccupation of the pious Catholic movement in Paris and of the clergy of St Sulpice, the parish in which the three brothers lived, and where all were buried.\n\nThis painting is therefore a fine example of Le Nain\u2019s output of the 1640s but also of the introduction of genre painting in France, of which they were mainly responsible.\n\nTwo copies of the present composition exist. One was part of the Picasso donation to the Louvre in 1973 while the other from the collection of the Colonel Clerc in 1925 was in 1952 in a private collection in Limoges.\n\n\n'Genre painting' describes scenes of everyday life set in domestic interiors or in the countryside, especially those produced by 17th-century Dutch painters such as Gerard ter Borch, Jan Steen, and Pieter de Hooch. These subjects were not particularly popular with Italian and French artists before the 18th century. Even then, Italian genre painting is mainly restricted to works produced by Northern artists active in Bologna and the Veneto such as Giuseppe Maria Crespi (1665-1747), Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (1682-1754), Pietro Longhi (ca. 1701-1785) and Giacomo Ceruti (1698-1767). In this pre-Enlightment society, issues of social class, the legitimacy of power and the needs of common people were beginning to be discussed in Holland, England and France and the debates were slowly filtering down to Italy. Bolognese intellectual life was particularly active and Crespi, who was corresponding one of the most notable academics, Antonio Muratori (1672-1750), appears to have created a visual response to these debates. The works of the <i>Bamboccianti,</i> mostly Netherlandish painters specialising in low-life paintings, painted in Rome in the mid 17th century, may also have provided a source for Italian genre painters while the <i>commedia dell\u2019arte</i> profoundly inspired Crespi and the development of this new Italian version of genre painting. From Bologna the genre spread to Venice thanks to Venetians artists such as Piazzetta and Longhi. They drew the attention of foreign collectors, most notably Joseph Smith the British Consul in Venice, who amassed an impressive collection of such artworks and of Venetian art in general and contributed to the growing taste for these in England. In France, the genre was mainly introduced in the second quarter of the 17th century by the Le Nain brothers, especially Antoine and Louis, whose works still pose problems of individual identification.",
