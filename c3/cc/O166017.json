A heavy cord of brown wool is stitched along the fold and from it hangs a long fringe, 48 cm. max, in 6 cms. widths of dark blue, dark red, dark green and light red.  Aboive and immediately below the pile is another fringe of the same colours and length, knotted around 4 warps; the 2 fringes combine and there is evidence of white cotton and yellow wool end tassels.\n\nPendant ends: one row of symmetrical knots over 4 warp threads form a fringe of 66 cms. in the colours of the central fringe; there follows a 1.5 cm. plain weave with cream weft turned and stitched in place; between the pile and the fringe, along the fold, there is oversewing with blue wool.\n\nDESIGN: field: the top and both pendants have a white ground; the top has a design of two bands of nine serrated leaves with a central angular curl in a contrasting colour; upper and lower leaves are paired by a linked stem which frames a similar, smaller dark red leaf or a light red stepped lozenge, both containing a curl and both flanked by narrow triangles.  On the pendants the above design becomes a foliate meander with smaller secondary motifs.\n\nMain border: a white ground with a barred motif outlined in dark red and dark brown.\n\nOuter border: dark red ground with white diamonds alternating with paired intruding triangles.\n\nPendant points: a dark red ground with white blocks outlines the V-shape; within is a white ground with dark red blocks and within these V-shaped borders is a multi-coloured triangle.\n\nExtra centre band with dark red ground and white florets.\n\nExtra upper band: reciprocal horned motif in red and dark blue with white florets.\n\nCatalogue date: 21.2.95",
