No date, but a water mark, J. Rump, 1836.   In original binding, mottled boards, leather back.\n\nE.1012-1063--1902.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--Gas burners, cocks, swing joints, Argand and other burners, gas brackets, pillars, pulpit fittings, pendants, chandeliers, gas fitters' tools and pipe hooks.   Brass \" barr \" cocks, \" in fine brass for Spirit and Beer Machines,\" beer cocks with loose keys and plugs.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--A firm bearing a similar style and name still carries on business in the street named.   The illustration of the Argand burner recalls the fact that gas was adopted for lighting in 1812.*   The pattern is still employed to a limited extent.   There are a few examples of glass chimneys which were always \" charg'd extra\" in this book.   A curious example is a combined fitting of brass and glass.   On a pedestal a small cherub is blowing a horn.   He is under a glass cylindrical shade, which is surmounted with a brass socket, presumably to take the burner.   The gas apparently issued through the trumpet jet, being controlled by a cock not shown in the illustration.   Plate 28 establishes the fact that the universal cup and ball joint had been invented in or before 1836.   Plate 40 represents an early form of the now discarded water-slide fitting.   Although not specifically stated, it is fairly evident that nearly all the wares were cast brass, but there is a single example of a 24 in. \" Cast Iron Bracket Bronzed.\"   There are some dimensions, but no prices in this volume.\n\n*Mr. Paul Faraday writes,  20/10/24/ \"In your description of a catalogue issued by our firm about the year 1836 it is stated that gas was adopted for lighting in 1812.   I believe it was considerably earlier than this. In fact, it was in the nineties of the previous century that gas was first used, and is a fact that Pall Mall was lit with gas in 1807.\"\"",
