It is made up of several ethnic minorities such as the Kirgizs and the Ozbeks. Their material lives are still closely related to animal husbandry, with their garments, food and dwellings all distinctively feature nomadism. Kirgiz women are known to wear brightly coloured and highly decorated dresses of bright reds and greens and extravagantly embroidered high boots.
