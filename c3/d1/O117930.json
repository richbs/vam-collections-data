Here the front cover represents the New Testament and shows the symbols of the four Evangelists - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John - who wrote the Gospels. The back shows a crown of thorns (to recall that placed on Christ's head before the Crucifixion), surrounded by images taken from the Old Testament.\n\nLondon, England, 2005; by Rod Kelly (born 1956)\nThe Bible designed by Bruce Rogers for\nthe Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1935\nSilver inlaid with gold\nGift of the Whiteley family\nMuseum no.

The typography designed by the noted American typographer, Bruce Rogers and this Bible is therefore known as the Bruce Rogers Bible.  \n\nThe boards have been removed, some minor conservation work and the two folios combined into one volume by the bookbinder, James Brockman. The silver covers with gold details designed and executed by Rod Kelly with some assistance in the making  by Ian Calvert.  \n\nThe front and back covers are two rectangular sheets of silver with extensive, chased decoration and 24 carat gold details.  The front panel illustrates symbols representing the New Testament while the back, the Old Testament.   Each panel is chased with a large cross set against a circular frame; the front chased with fishes, the back chased with a crown of thorns.  In the each corner of the front panel are chased symbols of the four evagelists, the top left hand corner is a lion for St. Mark and reading clockwise, in the upper right, the eagle for St. John, the lower right, the bull for St Luke and in the lower left, a youth symbolising St. Matthew.  The back panel has in each corner, symbols of The Creation, the upper two corners depict the sea, the lower left hand corner illustrates the tree of life and the apple, while the lower right hand corner represents the Commandments by an engraved tablet with Roman numerals, a shell and sheaf of wheat.\n\nIn the centre of each cross on both front and back panels is a circular, chased medallion containing the letters representing Alpha and Omega.  At each extremity of each cross is a raised diamond shaped lozenge which chased decoration.  Both the circular medallions and the diamond shaped lozenges are overlaid with 24 carat gold.  The medallions, lozenges, and four bosses in each corner of the front and back covers serve to conceal the screws which secure the external covers to the inner plates attached to the binding.\n\nThe spine is a curved, oblong sheet of silver with chasing representing the four provisions by illustraing water, quails, wine and wheat.  The three sections, front, back and spine panels are held together by two continuous hinges.  The clasp holding the binding shut and in the centre of the leading edge is in the form of a Greek cross, held together by a silver rod with domed finials.  When removed the cross divides into two halves.",

Here the front cover represents the New Testament and shows the symbols of the four Evangelists - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John - who wrote the Gospels. The back shows a crown of thorns (to recall that placed on Christ's head before the Crucifixion), surrounded by images taken from the Old Testament.\n\nLondon, England, 2005; by Rod Kelly (born 1956)\nThe Bible designed by Bruce Rogers for\nthe Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1935\nSilver inlaid with gold\nGift of the Whiteley family\nMuseum no.

Rod Kelly, who designed and made them, is known for his chased decoration. In this technique the silversmith models the design on the surface without actually removing any metal. \n\nHere the front cover represents the New Testament. It shows the symbols of the Evangelists who wrote the Gospels that make up the first four books of the New Testament. St Matthew\u2019s symbol is the winged angel or man. The lion represents St Mark. St Luke\u2019s symbol is the winged ox and St John\u2019s is the eagle. The back cover shows a crown of thorns (to recall that placed on Christ\u2019s head before the Crucifixion), surrounded by images taken from the Old Testament.\n\nThe covers were commissioned to cover a bible designed by the eminent typographer Bruce Rogers for the Oxford University Press in 1935. The bookbinder James Brockman incorporated the two volumes into a single binding.",

Ashbee, initiated a decisive shift towards fine craftsmanship in church silver. This led to a sharp fall in the standing of commercial manufacturers but provided a steady source of work for many designer-silversmiths that has lasted into the present day. This revival of craftsmanship came out of the Arts and Crafts movement, one of the greatest social and artistic forces of the age. Favouring small studio workshops and simplicity of form, the movement set the pattern for church silver throughout the 20th century, whether for major cathedral commissions or for parish churches.",
