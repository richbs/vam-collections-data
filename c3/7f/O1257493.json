The Tale of Peter   Rabbit  (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.\n\nThe Tailor of Gloucester  was Beatrix's favourite of her little books and the second to be privately printed prior  to publication by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1903.  Many of Beatrix Potter\u2019s stories begin \u2018Once upon a time\u2026\u2019.  The Tailor  of Gloucester  is unusual in that the story takes place at a specific period \u2013 \u2018the time of swords and periwigs\u2019 \u2013 between  about 1735 and 1785.  Beatrix went to extraordinary lengths to create an authentic setting. Passing a tailor\u2019s shop in Chelsea  one day, she deliberately tore a button off her coat and took it in to be mended so she could observe at first hand the tailor\u2019s  posture, tools and workbench. \n\nShe sought inspiration for the Mayor of Gloucester\u2019s coat and embroidered waistcoat in 18th-century clothes owned by her  local museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum (then known as the South Kensington Museum). In March 1903 she wrote to  her publisher, Norman Warne: \u2018I had been looking at them for a long time in an inconvenient dark corner of the Goldsmith\u2019s  Court, but had no idea they could be taken out of the case.  The clerk says I could have any article put on a table in one of the  offices, which will be most convenient.\u2019  Her sketches of the Museum's costumes are so accurate that it is possible to identify  the original garments, including the mayor\u2019s waistcoat, \u2018worked with poppies and corn-flowers\u2019.",
