Snuffer trays came in various shapes and with a variety of decoration. This one is oblong, with a decorated edge and four scroll feet. It is often difficult to distinguish snuffer trays made after 1770, like this one, from so-called \u2018pen trays\u2019. \n\nSnuffers were first invented to cut off and retain the burned wicks of candles when the wax around them had melted. They were not necessarily used to extinguish the candle's flame. The point at the end was for retrieving the tip of the wick if it fell into molten wax.\n\nSnuffers are first recorded in the period 1400-1500. There were numerous patents for them from about 1750, and new improved versions of snuffers reappeared until 1840. After this time snuffers became redundant following the development of candles that completely consumed their wicks.",
