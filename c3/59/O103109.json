The barrel is of cast on construction with a small bore offset visible at the muzzle, and has been cast as a tube with an open ended breech. The breech end has been cast with an internal screw thread, and a separate breech plug which forms the cascable has been screwed into place. This method of construction is similar to the production of firearms. The pierced tapering octagonal cascable suggests a sled mounted piece with possibly a recoil rope, or possibly the method by which the plug was screwed into place.",
