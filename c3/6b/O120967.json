A little to the right of this main group is another group of figures gathered at the water\u2019s edge \u2013 one astride a horse, others seated or kneeling.  A muscular black man wearing a turban and draped in luxurious cloth stands at the far right of this group at the bottom centre of the over-all image.  He looks out across the water.  A third grouping, comprising two men, is located at the bottom left corner of the image, in front of the first group and to the left of the second.  Both men are seated and appear to be deep in discussion.  One is dressed completely in white and has long white hair.",

Despite an early interest in landscape painting, financial pressures forced him to focus on portraiture.  By 1851, when he settled at Redhill, Surrey, Linnell was financially secure enough to turn again to landscape.  He had a long and prolific career, exhibiting 176 works at the Royal Academy, 91 at the British Institute and 52 watercolours at the Old Watercolour Society.\n\nLinnell entered the Baptist Church in 1811-12 and retained strong religious views for the rest of his life.  Like Samuel Palmer (1805-1881), with whom he was friends until the former married his daughter in 1837, Linnell believed that landscape painting could be a form of religious art.  Special photography reveals the presence of a baptising figure standing in the water in this particular painting, but the figure is no longer evident to the naked eye.  It therefore seems likely that the image was originally intended to depict the Baptism of the people of Judah (New Testament, Matthew chapter 2, verses 5 and 6; Mark chapter 1, verse 5).",

            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 179\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Born Bloomsbury, London, 16 June 1792, son of a printseller and framemaker. Copied works by George Morland, and studied watercolour painting with John Varley. Entered RA Schools 1805. Associated with William Henry Hunt, William Mulready, Dr Thomas Monro, and later William Blake. In a long and prolific career, he exhibited 176 works at the RA between 1807 and 1881, 91 at the BI 1808-59, and 52 watercolours at the OWS (Member 1812, Treasurer 1817). Subjects mainly portraits up to the late 1840s, then landscapes. Worked also in engraving, etching and mezzotint. Surprisingly, he submitted his name unsuccessfully for election to ARA 1821, and withdrew 1842; the RA later offered him membership, which he refused. Died Redhill, Surrey, 20 January 1882; a memorial exhibition was held at the RA 1882-3. Three of his sons (James Thomas, William, and John junior) were also artists, and his daughter married Samuel Palmer. \nLIT: \tRedgrave Cent; Art]oumal1882, p262 (obit); A T Story Life ofJohn Linnell 2  vols, 1892 \n\nHalt by the Jordan 1845-1900 NegY1308 \nCanvas, 97.8 \u00d7 135.9 cm (38 \u00bd \u00d7 53 \u00bd ins)\n Signed and dated 'J Linnell F. 1840 Ret. 49' bc\nAshbee Bequest 1900 \n\nLinnell exhibited a painting titled 'Flight into Egypt' at the BI in 1841 (49), the size given in the catalogue as 52 by 63 inches including the frame as was usual, and again in 1849 (58), as 56 by 72 inches. These two exhibits (unless they were the same picture in different frames, which seems unlikely) fit the present work in terms of size (more or less) and date (note that the inscription records retouching in 1849), but it is difficult to identify a 'Flight into Egypt' subject. Photography reveals the presence of a baptising figure standing in the water, and it seems likely that the subject is the 'Baptism of the People of Judah' (related in the New Testament of the Bible, Matthew chapter 2 verses 5-6 and Mark 1, 5). As Julian Litten has pointed out to the present author, the people of Judah wait by the river Jordan to be baptised, people of all classes pleading and confessing their sins in various attitudes of supplication. It remains difficult to explain why the baptising figure is only visible in the old photograph (albeit dimly), and the coincidence of sizes and dates noted above. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
