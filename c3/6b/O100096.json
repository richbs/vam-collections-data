            "public_access_description": "Small low, covered bowls with matching stands like this were  used for serving soups, bouillon and other similar foodstuffs in private apartments at breakfast, through the long hours of the toilette and to invalids in bed. In France such a tureen would be called an '\u00e9cuelle' and in German it was sometimes called a 'W\u00f6chnerinnterrine' or 'maternity tureen'. However, while they  certainly were used to serve restorative foods to women after chilbirth, they were much more widely used by women as well as by men. Some (but not this one) have covers fitted with feet,  enabling this part to be reversed to serve as a plate for dealing  with meat or marrow bones. They were not made as part of a  dinner service, but were a standard component of toilet services.  Being made for personal use, they were usually finely decorated.  They were made in porcelain, silver and other materials.\n\nThis tureen and cover was intended to commemorate the birth of a special baby, the Dauphin, as the heir to the French throne was always called.  Queen Marie-Antoinette gave birth to her first son, Louis Joseph on 11th October, 1781 and the S\u00e8vres factory created some specially decorated cups and saucers and \u00e9cuelles to commemorate the event.  Sadly the Dauphin died aged only seven in 1789.  The dolphin symbol of the Dauphin can be found on the handles of both the bowl and its stand, and a royal crown, itself with four dolphins supporting the royal fleur de lys, forms the handle of the cover.\n\nThe Vincennes/S\u00e8vres factory made a variety of \u00e9cuelle shapes from 1752 onwards. This example has the mark of Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Pfeiffer, a painter who worked at S\u00e8vres from 1771-1800.  He specialised in flowers and patterns and would have been responsible for the finely painted borders of flowers and laurel swags.",

They were not used at the dinner table, where plate-like soup bowls were favoured, but in the bedroom or boudoir where they could be used to serve food during the lengthy<i> toilette</i>.  Their shape evolved from a medieval wooden bowl which by the 14th century could be made of gold or silver for high status people.  They were also made in faience, pewter and occasionally rock crystal.  A variety of shapes were made at S\u00e8vres and most were introduced already at Vincennes.  \n\nAccording to Geoffrey de Bellaigue (see below): 'During the period 20 November 1781 to 25 March 1782 a range of cups and a few broth-basins were fired in the enamel-kiln which were painted with dolphins, fleurs-de-lis and allegorical subjects, no doubt based on Bachelier's sketches.  One such cup, a <i>gobelet litron</i> of the largest size, is illustrated in Colour Plate O.  It bears the date-letters for 1781 and the mark of the artist, L.-F. L\u00e9cot.  The cup is painted with a banderole bearing the legend, '<i>Le Voeu de la France</i>', and the date, 22 October 1781, is inscribed at the foot of the composition. '  This cup and saucer is 786-1882.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Antoine Pfeiffer worked at S\u00e8vres from 1771-1800.  He specialised in flowers and patterns.",
