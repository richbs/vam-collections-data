Seat covered with green cloth fixed with brass nails.\nThe interlaced open back is veneered in cross-banded Honduras mahogany on the solid to give a ribbon-like effect. The shoe is removable and inscribed VII, the same number is inscribed on the proper right upper surface of the back pine stretcher. The under back stretcher - apparently of oak - is inscribed XII, indicating that there were originally at least 12 chairs in the set and that this chair is formed of a marriage of parts from different chairs in the same set.\n\nIn the style of Robert Manwaring.",
