At one end of the section is a larger ribbed bar of circular section, supported by a projecting baluster enclosing a double scroll motif. The upper part of each of the vertical bars is straight, while the lower part curves round to an angle of approximately 45 degrees, and was originally attached to the floor of the balcony. A length of cast iron piping, now detached from the rest, may once have been part of the gas lighting system with which the balustrade was incorporated.",

The work was carried by Hardwick's son Philip Charles Hardwick, who took over his father's practice in about 1840. The design of the hall is thought to have been inspired by the  principal apartment in Peruzzi's Palazzo Massimi in Rome. The iron-balustraded balcony ran around the four sides of the hall at the principal floor level, the balustrade being combined with gas fittings (see survey London vol. op. Cit. p. 113, and pl.62, V & A Exhibition 1973 Marble Halls p.152-3 . The Great Hall, with much of the rest of the station, was demolished in 1963 (see also N Pevsner: London. Except for the cities of London and Westminster, London 1956, p. 366-7). There is a watercolour perspective drawing of the Hall in the RIBA library.",
