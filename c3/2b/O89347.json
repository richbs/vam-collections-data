Many seem to have formed beads of rosaries. In structure jet is a particularly dense type of coal, and can be carved and polished. Medicinal and indeed magical qualities were thought to be inherent in the substance from earliest times. Jet is found in different parts of Europe (as well as North America), but the two richest regions are the Asturias in northern Spain, and Whitby, Yorkshire, in North East England.\n\nThis piece represents a fool's head and it's precise function is uncertain. It is possible that it was the pommel of a jester's stick. It may have been connected somehow with the Feasts of Fools when 'the holiest offices and orders were made matters of the lightest jesting'. References to such festivities occur from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century.",
