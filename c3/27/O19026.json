The gown has a rounded drawstring neck with an upstanding pointed picot edging (with an additional double row of embroidered dots) and puffed sleeves, finished with a band of whitework embroidery matching that on the bodice panel, and pointed picot edging (with an additional single row of embroidered white dots).  The tapered centre panel of the bodice is worked with a graduated line of four elliptical shapes, each with a different needle lace filling and linked by stem-like structures; on either side are powdered flower motifs consisting of three petals above a circular hole, and at each side a line of whitework foliage and circular holes. The scalloped robings are worked with a pointed picot edging and sprays of three petalled flowers to match those on the bodice panel, and the skirt and bodice are separated by a later waistband of machine embroidered white cotton.  The gathered skirt has a central panel embroidered at each of the lower corners with a sheaf of foliage and three-petalled flowers, and the hem is finished to match the robings.  The garment fastens at the back of the bodice with the neck drawstring and two bound buttons with stitched loops.",
