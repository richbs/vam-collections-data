The iridescent patina here is the result of a long period of burial. The surface is cut with circular facets in a honeycomb pattern. When Iran was ruled by the Sasanian dynasty (about AD 224 to631), the techniques used to cut precious and semi-precious stones were also used on glass.\n\nWhen the Middle East passed under Islamic rule in the 7th century, there was no sudden break in artistic production. One of the main influences on early Islamic art was the art of the Sasanian empire. This empire had ruled Iraq, Iran and the western part of Central Asia for four centuries before the Islamic conquest. Sasanian traditions continued for many years after that and so it is often difficult to tell whether an object is late Sasanian or early Islamic.",
