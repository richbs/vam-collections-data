There are parts of large diamonds in the middle of each side of the cover and elongated blue hexagons intersect each diagonal line.\nThe top and bottom edges have been cut.  As there was no border down the side, it is possible that this piece was intended to be joined to other pieces, in which case much more of the pattern lengthwise would be required.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; black or dark brown, dark green, green, dark red, light red, blue, light blue, yellow and light yellow.",
