On the top is a chromolithograph showing children on sleds; on the bottom is another chromolithograph showing children playing musical instruments.  Around the outside of this one is a band printed with the letters of the alphabet and above the illustration is a panel in which has been written by hand the names of the tunes played - Bonnie Dundee, Old Folks at Home and Annie Laurie.  The music itself is created by pegs on a cylinder being struck by metal tongues when the small handle, which protrudes from the top of the casing, is turned.",
