Where the wool embroidery thread is missing (insect damaged in antiquity) the drawing of the design can be seen on the linen ground. \n\nThe motif of a cross within a wreath is common in early Christian art. Its use is symbolic, the cross represents Christ and the wreath His victory over death, but here the individual components are each represented realistically. The wreath, of green and red leaves or petals, is covered at its base by a basketry sleeve, serving as a handle; a jewel or brooch is missing from its apex. The cross, with slightly flared equal arms and suspended by a chain, is apparently of gold and is embellished with square and round gemstones and pairs of pearls. Jewelled pendants hang from the cross itself and from the chain. The doves are represented in shades of blue, with yellow-ringed eyes and pink legs and beak.\n\nThe realistic treatment points to a comparatively early date. Most textiles recovered in Egypt are decorated in tapestry weave rather than embroidery. In the case of furnishings, however, embroidery seems to have been an established alternative.",
