Through commissions, exhibitions and competition awards in Scandinavia, Italy and America, he was largely responsible for putting Danish design into the International arena along with Scandinavian design, which had already been receiving much attention since the 1920s. \n\nThis design clearly shows the 'floating seat' structural technique, where the seat rested on crossbars rather than the chair frame. Influenced by the forms of Jean Art and by African sculpture, Juhl produced minimal structures with rounded, softened edges. The design is inscribed with the construction instructions which indicate that the armchair was intended to be made of wood in contrasting Cuban mahogany and sycamore. This was to be finished with a clear varnish and with a leather back.",
