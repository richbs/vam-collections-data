The V&A has one of the drawings he made of Bacon\u2019s studio in Reece Mews, London SW7 amd the double-sided working drawing for the sculpture. The title is a quotation from the occultist Aleister Crowley (1875-1947).\n\nClark created the sculpture as part of a larger project, Beautiful Dreamer.  Perhaps I sleep and Dream U, a digital projection in which the animated sculpture of Bacon appears and disappears under the eyelids of Tilda Swinton.",

            "history_note": "Created as the first of three artist's proofs by Michael Clark and made by ICEROCKS LONDON in 2008/9.  \n\nWorking from his original drawings for  the design, Clark allocated and supervised the positioning and layout on a computer screen of the 4802 diamonds, which are of varying sizes.\n\nMichael Clark met Francis Bacon in the Colony Room Club in  Soho in 1977 and, at the suggestion of Valerie Beston of the Marlborough Gallery, made the first of a series of portraits of him.  A drawing of Bacon was acquired by the British Museum, and the V&amp;A has a drawing by Clark of Bacon's studio in Reece Mews, London SW7, as well as a number of other works which relate to Clark's exploration of wounds.  His <i>Five </i><i>Wounds w</i>ere created for, and installed in, Chichester Cathedral in 1994.  Like the <i>Wounds</i>, the size of the square of <i>Every Man and Every Woman is a Star</i> is 2.236 inches, the square root of five.\n\nThe double-sided working drawing for <i>Every Man and Every Woman is a Star</i> is in the V&amp;A's collection of drawings. \n\nOn the background to the portraits the constellation of the Great Bear is picked out in white diamonds. As with many aspects of the work this has more than one resonance: not only as a group of stars, but as a reference to Michael Clark\u2019s study of wounds.  One of the earliest Ancient Egyptian scalpels has the shape of the Great Bear.\n\nThe title, <i>Every Man and Every Woman is a Star</i>, was taken by Clark from a second-hand book on  gems which he purchased in 1973 from an antiquarian bookshop.  It is a quotation from Chapter I of <i>The Book of the Law</i> by the occultist Aleister Crowley (1875-1947).\n\nAfter he completed the work, Michael Clark found the following passage by the French occultist  Eliphas Levi (1810-75), who was influential on Crowley:\n\n\u2018When we die, our interior light in departing follows the attraction of its star, and thus it is that we live in other universes, where the soul makes for itself a new garment, analogous to the development or diminution of its beauty; for our souls, when separated from our bodies, resemble revolving stars; they are globules of animated light which always seek their centre for the recovery of their equilibrium and their true movement.\u2019\n\nMichael Clark created the sculpture as part of a larger project, <i>Beautiful Dreamer. Perhaps I sleep and dream U</i>, a digital projection in which the animated sculpture opens and closes, appearing and disappearing under the eyelids of Tilda Swinton.<i>  </i>\n\nThe two images of Bacon face in the same direction so that if the rod is spun a three-dimensional image of the portrait is created, with the constellation of the Great Bear flickering in the background.",
