The goddess wears a sleeved garment with a striped cloak over it, falling to the knees-probably a version of a himation draped over shoulders and upper body. A cloak flies in a circle over her head, caught by the wind in a manner familiar in classical art for various out-of-door ladies, with its forked end behind her back. She holds a shallow bowl on the fingertips of her right hand.  The monster is the classical ketos, with ears, finny gills, flippers and fish tail. It turns its head back towards her.",
