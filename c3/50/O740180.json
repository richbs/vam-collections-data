He began his career in Basel, where he worked mainly as a painter of altarpieces and designer of woodcuts. He visited England in 1526 to 1528 and through Erasmus, he met Sir Thomas More and his circle. Returning to Basel he received commissions from city authorities and produced designs for stained glass and goldsmiths' work. In 1532 he returned to England, where he worked almost exclusively as a portrait painter, mainly under the patronage of King Henry VIII and his courtiers.\n\nMost of Hans Holbein's stained glass designs were produced during his time in Basel beween 1519 and 1526.\nThis particular design shows Bishop Pantalus and is part of a series known as the Four pairs of Saints which include: Saint Anna and Saint Barbara, John the Baptist and Saint Kathryn, Andrew and Stephen, Virgin Mary and Bishop Pantalus.\nThe eight drawings were made between 1520 and 1525.",
