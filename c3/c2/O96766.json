Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass. To prodce the colours, metallic oxides were added to a glass frit mixture. The resulting colour range included delicate blues, as we see here. Lead lines are still used in this roundel to form part of the design, but the imagery is primarily a painted one.\n\nThe coats of arms on this roundel probably belonged to the magistrates of the regional courtroom of Wetzikon, near Zurich, who commissioned this panel. There is another panel in the museum in Zurich with a similar design of Justice surrounded by exalted persons. This indicates that the glass painter had a selection of designs from which customers could choose. They would be able to personalise it by adding modifications. \n\nThe imagery on this roundel depicts Justice carrying a sword and a set of scales. She is surrounded by figures of a pope, an emperor and three crowned figures. It is an ideal subject for magistrates because it shows that no one is above the law, not even the highest in the land.",

Additionally there are ten shields with the names of their owners.\nIn the middle of the sixteenth century, new techniques for producing decorated glass had been introduced. Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass. The colours were produced by adding metallic oxides to a glass frit mixture and the resulting colour range included delicate blues as we see here. Lead lines are still used in this roundel to form part of the design but the imagery is primarily a painted one.\n\nThe coats of arms on this roundel are probably of magistrates of the regional courtroom of Wetzikon, near Zurich, who commissioned this panel. There is another panel in the museum in Zurich with a similar design of Justice surrounded by exalted persons. This indicates that the glass-painter had a selection of designs that the customer could choose from and add any modifications to personalise it. \n\nThe imagery on this roundel depicts Justice carrying a sword and a set of scales. She is surrounded by figures of a pope, an emperor and three crowned figures. It is an ideal subject for magistrates as it shows that no one, not even the most exalted, are above the law.",
