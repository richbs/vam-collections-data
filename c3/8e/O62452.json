Inside is a brass mounted tray, lined with velvet and another wooden tray beneath it.  On the underside of the lid, a panel bears the name of Jessie Keppie.\n\nPeople\nJessie Keppie was the sister of John Keppie, a junior partner in the architectural firm of Honeyman and Keppie which employed Mackintosh and Herbert MacNair. Jessie Keppie was briefly engaged to Mackintosh but he broke off the engagement to pursue and eventually marry, Margaret Macdonald, leaving Jessie Keppie heartbroken. She was to remain a spinster for the rest of her life.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe association of Mackintosh, MacNair and the two Macdonald sisters, Margaret and Frances became known as The Four. At the Arts and Crafts Exhibition held in London in 1896, their work attracted much hostile criticism but caught the attention of Gleeson White, the editor of The Studio who wrote two long articles about their work.  In the first of these articles, published in 1897, this jewel casket was mentioned.",
