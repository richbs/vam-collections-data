They were used to show wealth and status and could be made in a variety of styles, sizes and materials, including gems, pearls, enamels and crystal. This form of salt without a cover but with scrolled branches was popular from about 1660. It was the last common form of ceremonial salt made before the salt evolved into a centrepiece around 1700.  The scroll arms are designed either to hold an embroidered cloth cover or napkin or to bear a dessert dish. They show the transition from salt to centrepiece that took place in the 17th century and the related new emphasis on the dessert course.\n\nOwnership & Use\nAlmost all babies in 17th-century England were baptised within a few days of their birth. Baptisms in higher status families might be delayed in order to make social arrangements. Gifts given at baptisms often included table salts or cups, silver spoons and other precious metal objects. Salts were particularly popular due to the role that salt had played in christenings before the Reformation. Pre-Reformation baptisms often included the use of various substances such as spittle, salt and holy oils. The priest would put hallowed salt into the mouth of the infant at baptism to 'signify the spiritual salt, which is the word of God, wherewith he should be seasoned and powdered that thereby the filthy savour of stinking sin should be taken away'.\n\nPeople\nThis salt is thought to be the work of a Swiss goldsmith and chaser, Wolfgang Howzer, who was born in  Zurich and later  worked in London. He is recorded in London between 1657 and 1688. Howzer was one of the foreign or 'alien' goldsmiths working in London whose superior technical skills and designs attracted the resentment of English goldsmiths. He obtained a licence from Charles II (ruled 1660-1685) that allowed him to work outside the supervision of the Goldsmiths' Company and to sell directly to customers. He worked for the King's Jewel House, which administered the royal collection, as well as for other wealthy clients.",
