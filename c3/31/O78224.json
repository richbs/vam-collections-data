This design is very detailed and close in appearance to the printed wallpaper.\n\nDesign & Designing\nGodwin first designed wallpapers in 1872 but was already a successful architect by that time.  His wallpapers were produced at a time when the wallpaper industry in England was booming.  Godwin introduced a new style of pattern for wallpaper that was highly original combining both English and Japanese influences.  These designs were very different from the other commercially produced designs available at the time.  Colour played a very important part in Godwin's work, especially in his Japanese influenced designs. The combination of colours in this design is typical of those seen in Japanese prints.\n\nPeople\nThis wallpaper is similar to the designs of William Morris in its use of floral patterns. Godwin used Morris's wallpapers to decorate his own home. In 1866 Metford Warner joined the Wallpaper manufacturing company Jeffrey & Co. He was inspired by William Morris's work and began to commission artists and architects to design wallpapers.  This paper was called 'Bamboo' and was one of the papers commissioned from Godwin.",
