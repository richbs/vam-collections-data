After active military service in France during the First World War (1914-18) he decided to concentrate on sculpture but he also produced textile designs in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1930s he designed textiles for commercial production by the avant-garde firm Allan Walton Textiles but also designed and cut lino-blocks for textiles which were printed by his wife, Mary.\n\nThis printed linen, called 'Dancing Women', was probably printed by Mary and may originally have been intended for the decoration of their own home. It demonstrates the ease with which he could form three-dimensional figures, using simple lines to give them vitality and rhythm, and it shows his love of the human form with its balance, grace and strength. It was one of his most successful textile designs.",
