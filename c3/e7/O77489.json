The demand for 'antique' vases was so great that, in addition to copying surviving Classical antiquities, manufacturers took designs from prints of the 17th and 18th centuries. Some of these prints were highly fanciful inventions, which were not seriously intended as models for production. Wedgwood adapted the design here from the Livre de Vases put together by the French painter Jacques Stella (1596-1657). Wedgwood further dramatised Stella's design by adding scales to the fish tail and increasing the height of the plinth. He described Stella's book, published in 1667, as 'an admirable one indeed', and commented that 'many good things may be made out of [it]'. Wedgwood based at least four of his vase shapes on designs by Stella.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe vase is made of Black Basalt, one of several types of pottery that Wedgwood (1730-1795) introduced or refined. The colour came from 'Carr', an oxide of iron suspended in water that had flowed through coal seams and mines.",
