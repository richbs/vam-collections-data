Often the entire scene was used, but sometimes just certain figures were selected.\n\nSubject Depicted \nThe central scene on this dish is taken from Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid. The  poem was extremely popular. It was published throughout Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, often with illustrations, and provided a source for numerous figural scenes.\n\nThe dish shows Aeneas  fleeing the burning city of Troy. He is carrying his father Anchises and accompanied by his son Ascanius.  Aeneas's flight from Troy with his family was a scene of great symbolic meaning with a long literary and artistic tradition. To classical scholars, it represented the origins of Rome, since Aeneas was believed to be the founder of Rome. It also signified the themes of exile, of the Three Ages of Man and of filial love.  The scene was chosen by Andrea Alciati to depict filial love in his Emblematum liber ('Book of Emblems'), published in Augsburg in 1531. Alciati, a lawyer with a fine classical education, was the inventor of the emblem book, in which moral lessons were conveyed through a combination of word and image. In this case, the emblem of filial love was especially suitable for a commemorative gift from a grandfather to a grandson.",
