The many techniques deployed included underglaze painting, coloured glazes and lustre, which was revived after 1650.\n\nSafavid potters created brilliantly coloured ceramics. The effect was often achieved with glazes of a single colour. Many of these wares have moulded or carved decoration, such as the details in relief on this ewer.",
