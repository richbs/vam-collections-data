Although the shape of the actual mirror is comparatively restrained, it is decorated with lavish acanthus 'C'  scrolls in giltwood and gilt gesso, and with flowers, scrolls  and lattice work on engraved glass. The mirror is thought to have been made in Genoa, and is similar to an example in the Palazzo Rosso by Bartolomeo Steccone, who died in 1739. Steccone was Genoa's leading carver at that time. The grand palaces of Genoa were noted for the abundance of glass and gilt furniture in their state appartments, and this mirror, the maker of which remains unknown, was probably originally intended for such a setting.",

The frame is decorated with lavish acanthus 'C'  scrolls in gilt gesso, and flowers, scrolls  and lattice work on engraved glass, whereas the shape of the actual mirror is comparatively restrained. This object is thought to have been made in Genoa, and is similar to an example in the <i>Palazzo Rosso</i> by Bartolomeo Steccone (d. 1739), Genoa's leading carver at this time. The grand palaces of Genoa were noted for the abundance of glass and gilt furniture in their state appartments, and this mirror, the maker of which remains unknown, was probably originally intended for such settings.",
