It was made in plaster with hidden iron supports by Jean Pierre Fouquet (1752-1829) as part of a commission by the British architect John Nash (1752-1835).\n\nPeople\nJean-Pierre Fouquet was an architectural modeller whose clients included the American architect and statesman Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) and various British architects, among them Sir John Soane (1753-1835) and Sir Robert Smirke (1780-1867). Nash, George IV's favourite architect, commissioned this model and 14 others during a visit to Paris in 1821.\n\nPlaces\nThese models were made for Nash's London residence, 14-16 Lower Regent Street, and were exhibited in the Gallery there. Fouquet's works were also exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1817, and at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe Temple of the Winds, more properly the Horologion of Andronikos Kyrrhestes, was built by the astronomer Andronikos in Athens in the first century AD to serve as a sundial, water-clock and weather-vane. The winds featured on the eight panels are: Boreas (the North Wind);  Kaikias (the N-E Wind); Skiron (the N-W Wind);  Zephyrus (the West Wind); Lips (the S-W Wind); Notus (the South Wind); Agnaiotes (the S-E Wind); and Eurus (the East Wind). The weather-vane is in the form of a bronze triton.",
