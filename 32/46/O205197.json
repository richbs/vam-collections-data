            "history_note": "\"The kallitype is an iron-salt photographic process devised about 1899 by W.J. Nichol and derived from the work of Sir John Herschel in the 1840s.  The process is analogous to that for the Platinum print, and the results can look similar.  A thick stock of paper was brushed with a solution of ferric oxalate (which is an iron salt), oxalic acid, and silver nitrate.  This light-sensitive paper was contact printed under a negative, usually in sunlight, until the midtones began to appear.  The print was then developed out in one of several solutions, depending on the colour desired. The light had transformed the ferric oxalate to ferrous oxalate and produced an image in metallic silver.  The print was then fixed with sodium thiosulfate and washed.  Its colour, which could be further modified by toning, could be black, brown, sepia, purple, or maroon.  Because of the kallitype's alleged impermanence - Nichol's original formula for fixing was deficient - it never achieved real popularity, although many variants of the process were announced.  One kind of kallitype was known as a Van Dyke print, as its rich, deep browns are thought to resemble those achieved by Anthony van Dyck, or those of the pigment named after him.\"  Gordon Brown, Looking at Photographs, J.
