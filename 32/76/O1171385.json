Neptune, the god of water and the sea in Roman mythology, is seated at the feet of the corpse holding his trident aloft. From the god's presence, it can be deduced that the dead man is a naval officer who died in action. The postion of the body recalls Michelangelo's Pieta in the Basilica of Saint Peter's in Rome that Joseph Nollekens (1737-1823), the sculptor who made this design, would certainly have seen. This design is for a wall monument to commemorate the naval hero.\n\nNollekens is best known as the leading portrait sculptor in Britain between 1770 and 1815. With his fellow Royal Academicians Thomas Banks and John Flaxman he established the British School of sculpture following decades of dependence on immigrant sculptors (such as Rysbrack, Scheemakers and Roubiliac). Flaxman praised Nollekens as the only sculptor before Banks who had \"formed his taste on the antique and introduced a purer style of art\". Opportunities to study the antique were plentiful whilst Nollekens lived for eight years from 1762-1770 in Rome. As a draughtsman he was exceptionally well trained for his day.",

Smith. With his fellow Royal Academicians Thomas Banks and John Flaxman he established the British School of sculpture following decades of dependence on immigrant sculptors (such as Rysbrack, Scheemakers and Roubiliac). Flaxman praised Nollekens as the only sculptor before Banks who had \"formed his taste on the antique and introduced a purer style of art\". As a draughtsman he was exceptionally well trained for his day. He is also noted as a collector; he owned the three wax reliefs by Giambologna now in the V&A. The V&A's collection includes three busts by Nollekens, five of his terracottas, his marble copy after the antique, Castor and Pollux (1767)and his original marble of Diana (1778).'\n\nJulius Bryant on RF 2010/245.",
