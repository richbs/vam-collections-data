The linen background is embroidered with wool in stem and satin stitches and French knots.\n\nJessie Newbery was the daughter of a Paisley shawl manufacturer and studied at the Glasgow School of Art. In 1889 she married the principal of the School, Francis Newbery. In 1894 she began to teach embroidery there. At first she was inspired by the work of William Morris and the Royal School of Art Needlework Department. But within a short time she developed her own style using appliqu\u00e9 with heavy linen and cotton fabrics and a minimum of stitching. She believed that this experimental method would result in more imaginative work. Her characteristic motif of a circular rose as well as her lettering was typical of the Glasgow School.\n\nMuch of Newbery's work was published in the British periodical The Studio, yet during her own lifetime her work was more respected abroad than in Britain. Ann Macbeth, one of Newbery's students, is also well known for doing embroidery in this style. She replaced Newbery as embroidery instructor at the Glasgow School of Art in 1908.",
