It was drawn by the metalworker Francis Skidmore (born in Birmingham, 1817, died in Coventry, 1896) about 1865-1872 and made by his firm Skidmore's Art Manufactures Company, Coventry. Skidmore was particularly interested in the developing technology of gas lighting. His firm installed it in three buildings in Coventry - in the medieval St Mary's Hall in 1850, in St Michael's church a year later and in Holy Trinity Church in 1856.  In the following decades, Skidmore continued to design brackets for gas lighting which existed throughout Britain in this period. Inspired by Gothic decoration, the scrolling acanthus leaf between the branches of the bracket in this design demonstrates this artist-craftsman's involvement in the Gothic Revival, an architectural movement, which originated in mid-eighteenth century England, and in which nineteenth- century practitioners sought to revive medieval forms.",
