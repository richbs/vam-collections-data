On the neck guard, which is made of lacquer and iron, there is a crest of a Daimyo.  The Daimyo were powerful territorial lords who ruled over most of Japan prior to the Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe shape of this helmet is based on a European hat of around 1600.  The spike is probably copied from Chinese or Korean helmets which were seen by the Japanese during the two invasions of Korea in the 1590s. \n\nIt dates from about 1600-1650.",
