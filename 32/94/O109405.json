The draped top with cap sleeves and knife-pleated skirt have been grafted together at the waist. The resulting seamless garment is very comfortable to wear. Maria Luck-Szanto was inspired by stitches used in Victorian patterns for waistcoats which she found in the National Art Library at the V&A.\n\nThe post-war New Look pioneered in Paris by Christian Dior in 1946 featured voluminous skirts using many yards of material. However, in Britain clothing and textiles continued to be rationed until 1952. Here Luck-Szanto uses the knitted-in pleats of the skirt to give the impression of fullness.",

She employed several hundred outworkers; a large contingent were seaside landladies pleased to earn an extra income during the quiet winter months. The knitter of this dress was Mrs Doris Elvin.\n\nThis design was included in a special show of Szanto models held by the International Wool Secretariat in 1946. Like many of Mme Szanto's best designs it remained, with minor modifications to hem length, neckline, etc, in demand by her sophisticated clientele well into the 1950s.",
