On the back, a printed label of South Kensington 1862, inscribed: <i>Baroness North / Aug. 23</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> In 1862, Lady North de Kirtling at Wroxton Abbey; acquired from an unrecorded source by the Hon. FHA Wallop; by him lent to the V&A c.1927-49; ownership transferred to Alan Evans, 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\nThis miniature, though painted on vellum, is not executed in a conventional limner's technique and has more in common with mid-seventeenth-century oil 'miniatures' in the opacity and juiciness of the surface, though few small oil portraits are as bright in palette as this.The miniature may thus be by an amateur, not trained as a limner and perhaps copying from an oil painting, not necessarily a small one. On balance it is probably seventeenth-century, for there is nothing distinctive of either eighteenth- or nineteenth-century attempts at reproducing the limners' technique.\" ",
