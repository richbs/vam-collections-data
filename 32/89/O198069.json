            "history_note": "The album was engineered at Southern Studios, from October 1983 to October 1984, and cut at Utopia Studios in October 1984. It is dedicated \u201c<i>In loving memory of Wally Hope.</i>\u201d\n\n'The final album released under the moniker Crass was Acts Of Love, in 1985.Although attributed to Crass, it would be more accurate to see it as a Penny Rimbaud record with contributions from other Crass people. It consisted of fifty short poems set to quirky discordant music that owed more \u2013 much more \u2013 to free jazz than punk rock.\n\nPenny Rimbaud:\u201cI remember when we were recording Acts Of Love \u2013 Andy coming into the studio and saying he\u2019d like to do something like that himself, meaning he understood that I was trying to make a per- sonal expression within the framework of where we were. I think that was a seed for him. He was a painter before he got involved with the band, and I think that\u2019s how he saw he might be able to express himself, which is what he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nGee Vaucher: \u201cFor me, Acts Of Love was the starting point anyway \u2013 the poems and the original illustrations were done a long time before Crass.They were part of the inspiration, part of the source of going on to say what we did. For me, it\u2019s a return to those roots \u2013 not going back- wards, but the source of inspiration within oneself. It\u2019s a very natural extension of what we\u2019ve done with Crass.\n\n\u201cIt seemed to be going in the direction of causes.Young people would get caught up in causes and the whole barbaric nature of the cause that they were trying to confront.What we\u2019ve tried to do is remind people of why they were putting themselves in a very dangerous position socially and personally, by making a beautiful record really.\u201d' \n\nExtract taken from: http://crassahistory.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/penny-rimbaud-acts-of-love/ \nAccessed: 14/12/2010",
