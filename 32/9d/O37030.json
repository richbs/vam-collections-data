When working the horse walks on four double feet as an autoperipatetikos and the knight moves gently up and down.\n\n1.  knight, head and torso with attached arms; gold and silver coloured with black markings to represent armour.  The crest of the helmet is red plastic.  The figure is holding a white plastic and metal lance in the right hand and a gold, silver and black shield in the left (it is attached to the hand by a red plastic knob).  Tied to the left side is a white plastic sword.\nUnder the body is a spike which goes into the horse's back and connects with the mechanism.\n2.  horse, stylized charger, white with green, gold, silver, red and black marking representing the head and body covers, reins and saddlery.  The tail is white nylon hair and the ears of coiled white plastic film. The underside of the body is white plastic and shaped to house the battery, mechanism and the four walking feet pairs.  The on/off switch is at the back.\n\n*A knight on horse back of this type is quite alien to Chinese culture and represents a total Western image although only designed for the home market.",
