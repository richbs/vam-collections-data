Of the three coats of arms which are suspended beneath the arches of the canopy, only the central one with three fleur-de-lis has been identified: the Abbey of Ste. Genevieve, with whom the patronage rested. The others presumably refer to individual patrons or donors.\n\nThe intricacy with which essentially classical elements are built up into a complex that owes little to the antique is characteristic of French Renaissance architecture.",

Of the three coats of arms which are suspended beneath the arches of the canopy, only the central one with three fleur-de-lis has been identified: the Abbey of Ste. Genevieve, with whom the patronage rested. The others presumably refer to individual patrons or donors.\nThe intricacy with which essentially classical elements are built up into a complex that owes little to the antique is characteristic of French Renaissance architecture.\nGiven by Mr. J. H. Fitzhenry.",
