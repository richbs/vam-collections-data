The niche is supported on a pair of facetted column shafts ornamented with bejewelled festoons resting on bulbous vases decorated with lotus petals. The niche has a cresting with a central <i>kirtimukha</i> motif from which flow vegetative scrolls terminating in hamsas facing outwards above the columns. A tier on top of this contains three small niches containing seated buddhas, the two outer ones in meditation and the central one in <i>bhumisparsha mudra</i>. The main Buddha wears a crown with triangular points rising from a beaded headband decorated with festoons that hang behind his elongated ears. He also wears a<i> kantha</i>, a flat jewelled collar. He is seated on a double lotus throne supported on a foliated base holding a rounded object on his hands in his lap, which may represent the bowl of honey given to him by the monkey at Vaishali. The edges of both sides of the relief are decorated witha bead ornament, which is damaged on the right hand side.",

In a letter, a copy of which is filed in the V&amp;A Nominal File of Mrs Mary Charles, Mr Giles describes how he obtained his 'Buddhist images' from 'the old temple of Bodh-Gaya and the ruins of another temple in the same district, viz Gaya, near Patna, Bengal'. All 11 pieces were bought for \u00a375.\n\nC Bautze-Picron states that vertical rectangular slabs were intended to be inserted in 'large stupas such as those standing around the temple of Bodhgaya, many, unfortunately, today with empty niches'. 'The Offering of the madhu at Vaishali' was one of the four scenes from Buddha's life along with the Enlightenment, the First Sermon and the Great Miracle. Bautze-Picron lists eight other examples of this image with the same overall format.",
