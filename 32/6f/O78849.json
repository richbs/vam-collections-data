Other similar embroideries showing single female figures have survived so it is possible that such compositions were prepared as exercises or special commissions for students to work under supervision.\n\nAnn Macbeth was born in Bolton, Lancashire. She enrolled at the Glasgow School of Art in 1897, won a prize for needlework two years later and in 1901 was appointed assistant to Jessie Newbery. She took charge of the embroidery classes at the School of Art in 1908. Her work was highly regarded and publication in contemporary magazines included an appreciation by Francis Newbery in The Studio in 1902. \n\nShe also taught metalwork, bookbinding and ceramics and, as a freelance artist, produced designs for jewellery, carpets and textiles. Her book Educational Needlecraft (1911), written with Margaret Swanson, was one of the most forward-looking texts written on the craft. It based its exercises on the developing co-ordination and eyesight of children whilst fostering originality and innovation.",
