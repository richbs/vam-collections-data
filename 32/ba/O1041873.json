Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 371) says that the following translation by John Fisher is in one of Constable's sketch-books:\n\nThis spot saw the day-spring of my life,\nHours of Joy and years of Happiness;\nThis place first tinged my boyish fancy with a love of the Art,\nThis place was the origin of my Fame.\n\nNo source has been suggested for the Latin verses: they are probably modern.  In a letter to Lucas of 13 October 1831, Constable proposes changing 'His locus' to 'Haec Domus' in the first line; this seems not to have been done.\nLt.-Col. C. A. Brooks has identified the scene as the lane leading to the New Fen Bridge at its junction with tht road from East Bergholt Church to Flatford.\n\nNote on Nos. 156-160 [298-1888, 278-1888, 819-1888, 822-1888, 611-1888]\n\nNos. 156, 158, 159 and 160 [298-1888, 819-1888, 822-1888, 611-1888]  are evidently from the same sketch-book, used in the summer of 1817, and measuring about 4 \u00bd and 7 3/8 ins. (115 x 186 mm.).  Nos. 179-182 [265-1888, 301-1888, 620-1888, 295-1888] may also come from this book.  No. 157 [278-1888] is provisionally placed here as it agrees in style and measurement with the 1817 sketch-book.  The inscription on No. 156 [298-1888] indicates that he had arrived by 25 July.\nFor a drawing of St. Mary-ad-Murum, Colchester, which comes from a sketch-book of size 4 \u00bd x 7 3/8 ins. (115 x 186 mm.) and may be dated 9 August 1817, see No. 180 [301-1888].  For a drawing of East Bergholt Church, possibly also from the sketch-book of 1817, see No. 179 [265-1888].  For a drawing of Harwich which may have been made on 22 August 1817, see No. 142 [302-1888].",
