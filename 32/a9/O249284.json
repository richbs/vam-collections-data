Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nSilke Trekel (born 1969) worked in studios in Leipzig and Pforzheim before studying at Burg Giebichenstein; Hochschule f\u00fcr Kunst und Design, Halle. In this pendant sheet silver is treated like folded paper. Her work is often inspired by Japanese art but her more usual medium is painted balsa wood.",
