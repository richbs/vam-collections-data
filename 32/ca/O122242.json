It was originally in the Oratory of Santa Maria della Passione, next to San Ambrogio, Milan.  Painted in the style of the Milanese painter and draughtsman Bernardino Luini (born ca 1480\u201385; died before 1 July 1532) it probably dates to the second quarter of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Oratory of Santa Maria della Passione was sold to the Administration of San Ambrogio in 1812 and turned into a cloth factory.  In 1869 it passed into private ownership and it was at this time that the main scenes of the wall decoration were detached.  Part of the series re-appeared in England in 1898 when a group of nine fragments were sold through Fosters' sales rooms.  Three of these were purchased by the South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria and Albert Museum.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 175-6, cat. no. 216.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nBernardino LUINI (active 1512; d. 1532) \nItalian (Lombard) School \nAt first influenced by Bramantino and Pordenone, he later worked in the manner of Leonardo, who had been in Milan ca. 1482-99. He painted mainly frescoes of religious subjects in the churches of Milan and its vicinity, and of Lugano. \nLit. A. Ottino da Chiesa, <i>Bernardino Luini</i>, Novara, 1956. \n\nFollower of Bernardino LUINI \n\n216 \nCHRIST ASCENDING (upper part of an Ascension: a lunette) \nWall-painting transferred to canvas \n102 x 162 (259 x 411.4) \nInscribed on scrolls held by angels: \nVIRI GA[LILAEI] QUID STATIS ASPICIENTES IN [CAELUM] /HIC IESUS QUI [ASSUMPTUS EST A] VOBIS IN CAELUM (Acts I. 11) \n359-1898 \n\nThis and the following two items formed the decoration of a lunette in the Oratory of Santa Maria della Passione, next to San Ambrogio, Milan. Founded in 1473, the Oratory was sold to the Administration of San Ambrogio in 1812 and turned into a cloth factory. In 1869 it passed into private hands and was turned into a wine business, and it was at this time that the main scenes of the wall decoration were detached and bought by Michele Cavaleri. Beltrami (1911) quotes the <i>Gazzetta di Milano</i>, 12 October 1869, listing the following scenes among those removed at that time: the Agony in the Garden, the Flagellation, the Resurrection and Pentecost. When the series reappeared in an English sale room in 1898, it included a Last Supper; lunettes with the Agony in the Garden, Christ mocked, the Ascension and the Virgin enthroned and a fragment of the ceiling decoration with the Holy Lamb and cherubs. The sale contained nine fragments; three were bought by the Museum, one - the Last Supperis in the chapel at Tonbridge School, the whereabouts of the others is unknown. \nThe decorative scheme is closely related to that in the church of S. Maurizio, Milan, executed by Luini in ca. 1522-24 (Beltrami, 1911, p. 385). Beltrami, having examined the fragments in the Museum and those surviving in the Oratory, concluded that while the decorative scheme was inspired by Luini himself, the execution should be attributed to his followers. \n\nProv. Oratory of S. Maria della Passione, Milan; 1869 Michele Cavaleri; sale, Foster's, 8 June 1898, lot 6, bought by the Museum for \u00a310 10s. \nLit. G. C. Williamson, <i>Luini</i>, 1899, p. 101; L.
