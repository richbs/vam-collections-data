            "public_access_description": "In England, few porcelain and pottery snuffboxes were made. The Chelsea porcelain factory made small decorative objects, particularly in 1758-69, although the term 'snuffbox' does not appear in surviving documents of the time. This box could also have held small sweetmeats or pills.  The mounts were also made in England, possibly Birmingham.\n\nSnuffboxes made out of porcelain followed the shapes of those made in gold and hardstones. Painted scenes or portraits ornamented the sides, covers and interiors. Changing forms and decoration were important, as these fashion accessories might be chosen to match the season or a particular costume. Most European (though rarely English) porcelain factories made snuffboxes. The largest producer was Meissen in Germany, which manufactured vast quantities of boxes from about 1735-65. A price list of 1765 mentions 11 varieties, the cheapest painted with flowers.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
