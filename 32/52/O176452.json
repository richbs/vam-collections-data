The vase is partially indebted to pl.21 of J.F.J. Salys book of vases of 1746, known to have been used by Chambers (see 5712.89, 5712.110, 5712.232,5712.13 and 5712.59), while the whole composition finds an echo in an overmantel scheme in Chambers's design for York House (RIBA). On the other hand, the sureness of this drawing and lack of Chambers's initials suggest that it is not a composition by him but a careful copy of a drawing by one of his French colleagues.",
