It was considered to protect the wearer from harm and to reflect the health of its wearer. Turquoise was also believed to restore harmony between husbands and wives. The Cambridge scholar Thomas Nicols's 1659 A Lapidary or History of Precious stones claimed that turquoise was not only a delight to the eye but strengthened the sight and renewed the bond between man and wife. \n\nThe number of small turquoise rings that survive may suggest that the stone had some particularly beneficial or protective effect for young children.",

A small group of similar turquoise set rings survive in the British Museum (Dalton cat. nos. 1902-04), the Kunstgewerbemuseum, Koln (cat. no. 248) and the Hashimoto collection (Scarisbrick, cat. nos. 156-7).\nTurquoise has long been reputed to have protective and talismanic qualities. In 1569, Fenton's 'Secret Wonders of Nature' describes its ability to protect the wearer from harm: <i> \"the turkeys doth move when there is any peril prepared to him that weareth it\"</i>.\nJohn Donne (1572-1631) wrote about the turquoise's ability to reflect the health of its wearer:\n<i>The compassionate turquoise, that doth tell\nBy looking pale the wearer is not well\"</i>\n\nTurquoises were also believed to restore harmony between husbands and wives. The Cambridge scholar Thomas Nicols's 1659 <i>A Lapidary or History of Precious stones</i> claimed that turquoise was not only a delight to the eye but strengthened the sight and renewed the bond between man and wife. \nThe number of very small turquoise rings surviving may suggest that the stone had some particularly beneficial or protective effect for young children.",
