Worked in a professional letter-writer's office before studying art at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh under Sir William Allan, where he became headmaster. Exhibited eight works at the RA between 1836 and 1846, one at the SBA 1832, five at the Institute for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland 1828-9, and 98 at the RSA 1828-47. Elected RSA 1829, ARA 1843; Professor of Colour, then of Drawing, at the RSA. Painted portraits, and genre, historical and literary subjects, always Scottish. Several of his works were engraved. Died young, of a brain tumour, Edinburgh 25 April 1845.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1847, p380 (with engr self-portrait) \n\n<b>The Waefu' Heart</b> \nFA69 Neg 59216 \nPanel, 77.4 x 59.6 cm (30\u00bd x 23\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'Thos Duncan Pinxt 1841' in red bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1841 with the following quotation appended to the title in the catalogue: \n\nI gang like a ghaist, and I carena to spin; \nI darena think on Jamie, for that would be a sin. \n\nI wish I were deed, but I'm no like to dee, \nAnd why do I live to say, Wae's me. \n\nLady Anne Lindsay, <i>Auld Robin Gray</i> \n\nLady Anne Lindsay (1750-1825) wrote the popular ballad <i>Auld Robin Gray</i> in 1772. It was published anonymously in 1776, and in a corrected, but very limited (26 copies) edition in 1825; it seems to have been best known in the 1776 edition, although it was presumably reprinted in other volumes of collected verse. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> reviewer called it 'A most painful, but most arresting picture: poor Jenny, the heart-stricken wife of \"Auld Robin Gray\". It touches almost as newly and powerfully as the lines copied from the ballad. There are few better works of its class in this or any other collection'. Waagen was more critical: 'The expression of the girl is very noble, but the lower part of the person too undesigned'. The influence of Sir David Wilkie is very marked in the handling of the heads of the girl and dog, and strong chiaroscuro and heightened use of colour. \n\nA note in the MS <i>Register</i>, possibly by Richard Redgrave, reads 'It is simply and broadly painted for general effect with but little detail'. \n\nEXH: RA 1841 (518) \n\nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1841, p47; G Waagen <i>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</i> 1854, II, p300\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
