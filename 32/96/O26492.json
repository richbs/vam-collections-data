The game is in three parts.  At the top are medallions, each showing a portrait of sovereign from George l to Victoria with the dates of their reigns.  The central part of the game is a map of Europe, Africa and Asia with three sailing routes from England to India; one route is numbered and major cities are shown.  Around three sides of the game are 36 squares in two layers.  Each square is dated and illustrated and linked by a tree root design in sets of 3 pairs.  The starting date is 1714 and the finishing one 184? with the last number obliterated - it may be 1845 or 1846.  Below the title ae three illustrations of  prominent Indian towns, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras/\n\nThere is no booklet and the rules were probably written in it.  The game is probably played with a teetotum and markers.  The players move from one square to another, must read out the details found in the booklet and match the event illustrated and sovereign.\n\nAttached to the top centre panel is a card folder into which folds the game.  It is covered with dark red embossed cloth and stamped in gold with the title.  To the upper right is a price 6/6.  This may be the original price as it is consistent with the average cost of these games at the time.\n\nRules placement: booklet",
