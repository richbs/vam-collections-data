The poster is laid out in a chequerboard pattern, with 20 different scenes for the daily life of a stereotypical woman. Each panel illustrates a time of day. For example, the top, left panel shows 6am, depicting a mother going to her son, who is crying in his cot. The panels move from left to right, going through the day, showing the mother preparing breakfast for the family, taking the children to the park, and doing housework. The bottom right corner is the same as the top left, indicating how every day is the same. The 1pm panel shows the father in the pub with his friend saying 'my wife doesn't work.' The poster is entirely in blue and white, with the times of the day denoted in red.",
