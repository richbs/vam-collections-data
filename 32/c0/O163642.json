The skirt panels and the sleeves are black or red silk, while the bodice is heavy plain weave blue cotton; there is a narrow waistband or strip of finer blue cotton. There is a long front and back slit from the neck to the lower chest [around the level of the bottom of the shoulder blade]; the back slit has been closed by rough stitching at the top and on the front with a globular metal button and silk loop at the top and tablet-woven braid which is on both sides of the slit at the front. Both slits are faced with resist and block printed cotton with a rust brown ground and a stylized boteh design in white and pink and blue.  Both sleeves and the skirt hem are trimmed with a border of three fine lines of toothed appliqu\u00e9 and a twisted blue cord sewn along the edges.\nThe ends of the sleeves are decorated with small embroidered isolated leaf motifs in blue, green, black, white and yellow and a 'crossed swords' motif in black edged with white. This stitch is also used for the front and side skirt panels [ the five back panels are not decorated] for the series of large zigzagged lines in various colours.  Again all the front and side panel seams are decorated with couched silk cords and with and interlacing stitch [a variation on buttonhole?].\nThe inside of the skirt hem is reinforced with a narrow band of roller printed cotton with a white ground and closely packed offset rows of grey rosettes with red centres.\nEmbroidery Thread: Silk, 2Z.",
