The 'Milanese' version would originally have been used to play music by Vivaldi and his contemporaries in the 1730s, whereas the 'Neapolitan' had largely replaced it by the 1780s. By 1752, the date this instrument was made, frets were more often metal and fixed permanently to the fingerboard rather than made with gut and replaced when worn out.\nNicholas Lambert (d. 1761) was probably Paris's leading maker of smaller stringed instruments in his day, and his wife carried on his business after his death, until 1789.\nIt was fashionable in Europe to employ black servants and dress them in exotic oriental costumes, like the figure on the finial of this instrument.",
