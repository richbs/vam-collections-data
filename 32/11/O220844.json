Throughout the south of Italy, the main material used to add a red colour to jewellery was coral.  The production of coral jewellery was a major industry in the south from prehistoric times.  Tourists loved to buy coral jewellery in fashionable shapes, but it was also very popular with Italian women, who valued it for its colour and amuletic qualities.  Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces, or combs, were always shaped.  The facetting on these beads is typical of 19th century Italian work.  \n\nIn the south of Italy, particularly in those places which had been under Spanish rule, many women wore decorative combs in their hair.  These combs were not restricted to traditional costume, and would have been worn just as readily with fashionable dress.  This comb was acquired in Genoa, in the north of Italy, where combs were not part of traditional costume.  It was bought for \u00a32 as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
