He also produced costumes for fancy dress and period balls, which were a feature of social life in the 1920s and 1930s.  These leaves might have been used in wreaths (one such does exist) produced for such a ball, maybe the famous Chelsea Arts Ball, a famous, somewhat bohemian, annual event at which the guests vied with each other to wear the most extravagant or outrageous costumes.  A vine-leaf wreath, with its overtones of Roman banquets, would have been very much in keeping with the event. \n\nThe leaves are made of leather, a material that Messel used a great deal, as it is light and can be moulded into complex shapes, which can then be painted to resemble metals or, as here, vegetation.\n\nGreat Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

However, a viewing of the film confirms that no such leaves were used, nor is there any obvious scene in which a wreath from them might have been used.  They are as likely to have been made for a costume party or be from Messel's general stock.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs would have been sold or given away during the artist's lifetime).  The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981.  The Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.\n\nHistorical significance: While many completed costumes and accessories survive, various 'parts' used in their making do not, and it is rare to have the evidence of an accessory 'in progress'.",
