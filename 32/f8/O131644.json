His father, a local decorative painter, gave him his first artistic training before he studied under Francisco Domingo (1842-1920) at the Academia de San Carlos in Valencia. He went to Rome where he settled definitively and was entrusted there by the King Amedeo of Savoy with the portraits of his children. He became director of the Spanish Academy in Rome in 1903 until 1912 when he returned to Valencia.  From Rome, he achieved considerable success within the European art market while his reputation was growing in Spain as well.\n\nThis painting is a good example of Benlliure's genre painting which belong to the category commonly called 'casacones'. It shows a group of soldiers, dressed in typical 17th-century fashion, gathered around a table in the courtyard of an old inn. This painting probably dates from 1890s, a period in which Benlliure produced a series of similar pictures and witnesses the renewed taste for the imagery of the Dutch Golden Age that took place in Spain at the end of the 19th century.",

Florence, 1916\n\nHistorical significance: This work is typical of paintings of the second half of the 19th century influenced by 17th-century Dutch paintings; a genre associated principally with Ernest Meissonier (1815-1891). In Spain such pictures were commonly called 'casacones'.\n\nThe present work depicts cavalrymen in 17th-century costume with swords, ruffs and large-rimmed hats at a table in the courtyard of an old inn. Its title 'The Posada' is Spanish for 'Inn'. The na\u00efve graffiti of soldiers fencing on the left wall recurs in other compositions, such as the <i>Tavern scene</i> in the collection of Vicente Fuster.This painting was probably executed in Seville in the 1890s, as were a number of similar scenes (See <i>La Taverna</i>, ca. 1890 and <i>A la taverna</i>, both in a private collection, and <i>La tertulia</i>, ca. 1890, collection of Vicente Fuster). The earthen palette, enlivened by small touches of red, reproduces the subdued colour scheme typical of 17th-century Dutch paintings. The thick impasto and brilliant touches of colour are characteristic of the artist.",

He achieved considerable success on the European art market, as well as in Spain. Benlliure specialised in genre paintings of 17th century subjects. He later adopted greater realism and more contemporary subject matter.\n\nPaintings of everyday life had been popular from the 17th century in Spain, where Francisco Pacheco in his <i>Arte de la pintura</i> (1649) called the naturalistic genre scenes of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599-1660) 'bodegones', from the name of a rough public eating-place ('bodegon' in modern Spanish means 'still-life'). The genre was further developed by Francisco de Goya (1746-1828). During the 19th century genre paintings emphasised social concerns, combined with a growing interest for the direct observation of nature and the rendering of light. At the same time, there was a revival for the 17th-century Dutch imagery in paintings called in Spain 'casacones', which merged history and genre subjects.",
