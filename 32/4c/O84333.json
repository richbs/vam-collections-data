These supple hats could be shaped and customised to suit any season and a variety of looks. The style was often worn with midi- and maxi-length skirts or tailored ensembles.\n\nEdward Mann was a London based millinery brand which produced high fashion hats. The company label featured the phrase 'Edward Mann- Always making Fashion' and included a line drawing of a little face under a flat diamond shaped hat. Edward Mann designed the hats for iconic 1960s television character Emma Peel of 'The Avengers' played by Diana Rigg.",
