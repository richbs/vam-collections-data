Three tetralobed panels filled with reserve-painted birds amidst small clouds fit on the shoulder between the lesser necks.  Animated scenes run round the body; a spotted buffalo and its broad-hatted rider gallop towards a grand tree with a white trunk on a rocky base.  Transitional clouds and small ships lead the eye to the pair of seated figures with hats and low necklines.  One of them shows a bare leg.  They face a standing figure across a scenery of islands and boats.  Two lower bands of lotus panels and a knotted scroll surround the base.",

The form was unique to Iranian pottery from the 12th century, and was revived in the 17th century. The idea of spouted vessels for cut-flowers was evidently exported to Europe and copied in the Netherlands at the end of the 17th century. In the mid-19th century the spouts, damaged over time, were repaired with the addition of engraved brass mounts.",
