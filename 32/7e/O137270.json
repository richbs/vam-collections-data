It is framed on the underside by a narrow band that is rivetted to the sheet;  like every edge of this slice, it carries \"length\" sub division marks.  The blade had a square cut rear edge whose frame is accented by ten small applied circles.  It is hinged to the first part of segmented rectangular handle shaft whose top side is a zig-zag cut out frame for a steel ruler.  A U-hinge connects to a similarly constructed piece that is hinged to a semi-circular finial shape of allied construction.  The shaft may be folded;  the finial is thus brought into juxtaposition with the blade to form a compact knife shape, which unifies the net design.  Raised circles on the finial display the numbers 2000, 2003 - the commissioning and delivery dates.  Surfaces are polished.",

The \"measurement\" motif is extended in the edges of the server each with tiny sub-divisions. The piece is hinged in four places and folds into a compact knife shape, echoing a fisherman's pocket knife. The utilitarian design is enhanced by the square cut blade and finial with severe net diamond pierced pattern that is riveted to its frame. This subtly humourous design references three aspects fishing; the net, the knife, and the ruler for measuring purposes. The individual touches to this piece are bold, roman numerals IX, II, V, extend across the shaft claiming the silver standard. The first segment of the blade bears a short swivelling tube with a flag engraved \"SEYMOUR\" that turns to reveal \"FROM KIFF\". The strong individuality of this piece creates a striking presence.",

He conveys a humour in his work, in this case derived from the casual reference to the killing of the fish. The absurdity of this ingenious design \"first measuring the fish and later, after cooking, pulling it out again and unfolding it for service\" appealed to Slemmons. The signing of this piece is unusual for his work, a homage to the commissioner.",
