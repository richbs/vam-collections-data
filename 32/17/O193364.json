These toys often proved a source of inspiration for ballets, and on at least three occasions Goncharova made designs for costumes and other accessories from them, the first being for Fokine's production of <i>Les Jouets russes</i> at the Palace Theatre, New York in 1921. the style of these drawings seems, however, closer to Goncharova's work of the mid 1930s, when she produced the designs for the production of <i>Les Jouets russes</i> at Monte-Carlo in 1934.",
