The outfit reflected a style of dress associated with 'yardies' and worn by some Jamaican women in the 1980s.\n\nThe term \u2018yardie\u2019 derives from the slang name given to occupants of government yards in Trenchtown, a neighbourhood in West Kingston, Jamaica. Trenchtown was originally built as a housing project following devastation caused by Hurricane Charlie in 1951. Due to the poverty endemic in the neighborhood, crime and gang violence became rife, leading the occupants of Trenchtown to be in part stigmatized by the term \u2018yardie\u2019. Yardies\u2019 aspirational pursuit of wealth and status were mirrored in a style of dress which emphasised luxury through gold jewellery, luxurious fabrics (such as the gold lurex used in this dress) and designer accessories.",
