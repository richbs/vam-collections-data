The skirts below the waist are pulled back with loop and button and draped over the hips.\nConstruction: The back and train are 1 panel of silk with bodice back set in 4 tapering pleats arranged to match the silk pattern.  The square neck at the back is self-bound and mitred.  The fabric of the train and skirts has been reversed to show right side when correctly draped.  The bodice appears to have had a silk taffeta lining. \nAlterations: The bodice has been altered for wear as fancy dress in late 19th century.  The train has been permanently stitched up.  Sleeve lining was added by Textile Conservation.\n[Petticoat] Style: A back fastening round petticoat to be worn over circular hoops.\nConstruction: Seven panels of silk sewn selvedge to selvedge, with seam at centre front and slit at centre back for opening.  Openings at side seams constitute pocket slits. \nAlterations:  Traces of stitch lines at waist.  Fancy dress wear and conservation for mounting has obliterated any original pleating and finishings at waist and hem.",

Elbow-length sleeves with a deep pleated cuff characterised the mantua, or gown, during this decade. Looped-up and draped bodice skirts and a pinned-up train are typical features of a mantua. The silk design represents an early example of the new patterns of the 1730s, which emphasised the three-dimensional nature of the forms. The dark, rich colours seen here were popular during the early decades of the 18th century.",
