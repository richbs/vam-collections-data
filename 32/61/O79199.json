Each part consists of a stiff hollow segment, flat on the inside and curved on the front (giving it a D-shaped section), and shaped like half a circle.  The outside face of each part is decorated with three horizontal rows of coil rings, separated and bordered by strips of beaded and twisted wire.  The two parts are the same size, and are hinged together at one end, with tubes made of coiled wire.  At the other end there is a similar screw fastening.  The screw is made from a rod of silver, with a wire wound round it anti-clockwise to form the thread, so that the screw unfastens by turning it to the right.  There is a lozenge attached over the front of the fastening, decorated with nine cylinders of coiled wire which may originally have held gems.  There is a small pyramid of granules on the top of the screw.",
