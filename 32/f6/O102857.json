Her hair is curled to front and plaited in a knot at the back with long plaits, bound with pearls, falling to the front; on her head she wears a stylized tiara topped with ostrich plumes and an aigrette.  Fitted around her neck is a pearl necklace and a pendant jewel.  The bodice is fitted and finished in a point centre front with a decorated stomacher; from the shoulders are shaped lappets, continuing at the back into small scallop-edged 'capes' ending in a tassel; under the lappets are fitted elbow-length sleeves overlaid with a ribbon lattice, finished in lappets; from the elbow fall shaped hanging sleeves beneath which are fitted sleeves to the wrist.  The full length skirt is overlaid with lace 'panels' and edged with a fringe; from the back falls a fringed train.  Attached at the waist, over the train and skirt, are long shaped 'lappets'.",

As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
