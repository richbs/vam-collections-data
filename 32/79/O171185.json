Like Catholic women elsewhere in southern Europe they often wore elaborate crosses as jewellery.\n\nRed was the most popular colour in traditional jewellery throughout Italy. In the northern and central regions the jewellers usually decorated their crosses with garnets, as here, often mixed with pearls. This cross, which comes from Genoa, has white pastes, which were much less common, and may reflect Genoa's international outlook. \n\nIt was bought for 16 shillings as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
