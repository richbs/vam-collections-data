De Wint also exhibited a smaller picture with the same title at the British Institution in 1816.  Harvesting scenes were a favourite subject with the artist early in his career, and particularly the panoramic view (compare the watercolour \"Cornfield with Harvesters\" also in the V&A (museum number 1201-1886) and also the oil painting \"Haymaking\" (museum number 260-1872).\n\nExhibition Label downloaded from Elise - author unknown:\n\"In a nation such as England, even after the Industrial Revolution, the autumn harvest was symbolically as well as in practical terms the most important event in the agricultural year .  De Wint painted many panoramic views of corn and hay fields, usually at the time of greatest activity when the crops are being gathered in and the extent of the coming year's prosperity is being assessed.  Better known as a master of watercolour - and he is represented as such in this exhibition - De Wint achieves the same luminescence in his paintings in oils.  Without doubt, he 'romanticizes' his scenes of hard labour in the countryside.  Harvesting can never have been as idyllic an experience as he suggests here.  But for an urban audience and metropolitan collectors of landscape paintings, this image of England as a rich and fertile Arcadia was irresistible.",

Pupil of the portraitist in crayons and engraver John Raphael Smith 1802-6; entered RA Schools 1807. Exhibited 13 landscapes and topographical views at the RA between 1807 and 1828 and 11 at the BI 1808-24, but principally watercolours - 417 at the OWS 1808-49. Also worked for engravers of topographical books. Married the sister of his friend William Hilton RA. Lived many years in Lincoln, where the Usher Art Gallery has a fine collection of his work. Many watercolours and drawings also in the V&A collections. Died London 30 June 1849; his studio sale was at Christie's 22-28 May 1850. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1849</i>, p260 (obit); W Armstrong <i>Memoir of Peter De Wint</i> 1888; H De Wint A Short Memoir ... privately printed c1900, reprinted in <i>Smith</i>; H Smith <i>Peter De Wint</i> 1982 (and for fuller bibliography) \n\n<b>A Cornfield</b> \n258-1872 Neg GDl122 \nCanvas, 104.8 x 163.8 cm (41\u00bc x 64\u00bc ins) \nGiven by Mrs P Tatlock (the artist's daughter) 1872 \n\nPossibly 'A Cornfield' exhibited at the RA in 1815 (W Whitley <i>Art in England</i> 1800-1820 1928, p245, states without evidence that it was); he also exhibited a smaller picture (91.5 x 124.5 cm/36 x 49 ins including the frame, according to the catalogue) with the same title as the BI in 1816. Harvesting scenes were a favourite subject with the artist early in his career, and particularly the panoramic view (compare the watercolour 'Cornfield with Harvesters' also in the V&A collections (1201-1886), for example, and 'Haymaking', 260-1872, below). \n\nThe work, together with 'Wooded Landscape', (261-1872, below) was offered by the artist's daughter first to the NG; the Director, Sir William Boxall, apparently refused both paintings without inspecting them, and they were soon after accepted by the Keeper of Art at South Kensington, Richard Redgrave, who confessed they were 'the first oil paintings by de Wint I have seen'. If this work were indeed exhibited at the RA in 1815, it would have hung in the company of Constable's 'Boatbuilding ... ' (V&A FA37); the 1969 Norwich exhibition catalogue described the De Wint as a 'masterpiece of naturalism on a large scale'. \t\n\nA replica of almost the same size (102.9 x 166.4 cm/40\u00bd x 56\u00bd ins) is in the Usher Gallery, Lincoln (repr Smith p169). Smith also records a copy (94 x 152.4 cm/37 x 60 ins) and a small sketch (also not autograph), both formerly in the Yale Center for British Art (Paul Mellon Collection), New Haven, USA, sold Sotheby Parke Bernet 18 November 1981 (174, 175).\n \nEXH: ?RA 1815 (290); <i>Peter de Wint</i> Agnew 1966 (63); <i>A Decade of English Naturalism 1810-20 Castle Museum; Norwich, 1969, and V&A 1970</i> (22); <i>English Landscape Painting</i> Tokyo and Kyoto 1970-1 \n\nENGR: Sir Frank Short, V&A collections, E1122-1920 (etched state), \nE1123-1920 (mezzotint) \n\nLIT: <i>Armstrong</i>, p45, repr fig 22; <i>Smith</i>, pp65-9 \n\nREPR: <i>Studio</i> special summer number 1903, p1 W1\"",
