This sketch is not highly finished, and the painting technique is relatively crude but very vigorous.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe monarchs, William and Mary, are shown attended by the figures of Concord and the Cardinal Virtues. The King presents the personifications of Peace and Liberty to Europe and tramples on Tyranny and Arbitrary Power. The figure of Architecture holds a drawing of part of the Hospital (which was erected partly as a memorial to the Queen). Time rescues Truth;  Wisdom and Virtue destroy the Vices; and Apollo and the Hours are seen in the Heavens. The Signs of the Zodiac, presided over by the Seasons, are grouped around the oval frame. The present ceiling, executed in 1708/9-1712 varies in some respects from this design.\n\nPeople\nThornhill and his assistants worked intermittently on the Painted Hall at Greenwich Hospital for l9 years, completing two vast ceiling paintings and five murals that celebrate the Protestant succession of English monarchs from William and Mary (reigned 1689-1702) to George I (reigned 1714-1727).",
