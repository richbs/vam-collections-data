His wife designed textiles and their company became incorporated in 1942 (Ascher Ltd). Ascher developed a range of different fabrics for use at the top end of the fashion market. He used samples such as this one to show prospective clients his wares, and as a record of his output.\n\nThis design was called 'Rose Pompom' by Ascher and featured in the haute couture collections in Spring/Summer 1953, when Dior made it into a dance ensemble. The extremely fine silk was woven in Macclesfield originally to insulate electrical wiring, and it was Ascher's idea to print on it. This was the first attempt.  It was printed in three colourways: red/pink, lemon/yellow and blue on a white ground. Princess Margaret had a dress made of it and wore it in public on a Caribbean visit later in the 1950s.",
