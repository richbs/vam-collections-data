She had the opportunity of continuing her singing studies at La Scala, but her family felt she was too young, and after a bout of TB affected her voice she abandoned grand opera for the variety stage, appearing with concert groups including The Seven Romps in1912 and then in various double acts with other girls including The Trilbies with Eileen Lawler in 1913, touring the Near East and Asia as well as Britain, and with Evelyn Kirkby as Kirkby & Harrington.  She appeared in pantomime in London and the regions as well as in variety.",

The red kerchief indicates that it was possibly for Dick Whittington, although the style of the jerkin is in line with other non-aristocratic principal boy characters.\n\nHistorical significance: The costume was for a non-aristocratic principal boy, such as Dick in Dick Whittington or Robin Hood in Babes in the Wood, when it would have been made in green fabric.  It shows the break from the heavily boned, stylized costumes of the late 19th century, of which the Museum possesses a superb example in S.1351/B-1984 to a simpler style, following fashions of the post-1914 period.  This style became the traditional costume for non-aristocratic principal boys throughout the 20th century.",
