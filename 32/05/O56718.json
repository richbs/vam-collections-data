The stems and border outlines are worked in stem stitch - irregular in places. On two sides there are lines of knotted insertion stitches. The border design is a fine red meander which joins red flowerheads and from which there are blue and green leaves.   The field is decorated with three rows of stylised floral motifs: the spacing is somewhat irregular.  The rows to the left and theright are almost identical: they begin with an irregular red motif with internal indistinct patterns in reserve.  Above this in a U-shaped blue stem with three blue flowers. Above is an oval red motif with six petals and a central green catherine-wheel. Above this are three straight joined blue stems, each with a blue flower and ending with one of the oval red mtoifs with the green catherine-wheel.  At the top is a joined pair of green leaves with a red centre and a repeat of the first red motif.   The central row is an offset version with the pair of green leaves and large red motif in the middle. \nThe impression is that a textile design has been copied and distorted over time; that it has not been fully understood and that the proportions have been lost.",
