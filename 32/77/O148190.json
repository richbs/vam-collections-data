The game can be played by any number of children who, all but one, sit in a circle passing a slipper around the circle behind their backs. The child in the centre must discover who is holding the slipper. In one variation of the game, the children in the circle stop passing the slipper when the child in the centre has closed his or her eyes and counted to ten, and the child in the centre then tries to discern who is holding the slipper by analysing the children's facial expressions. In another variation of the game, the children in the circle continue passing the slipper behind their backs while the child in the centre looks for it.\n\n'Hunt the Slipper' appears to have been particularly popular in the eighteenth century. In 1766, Oliver Goldsmith described the game in his novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, and by 1838 it was described as 'nearly out of fashion' in England.  However, the game continued to be popular in the Victorian period alongside other typical parlour activities such as music, reading aloud and amateur theatricals.  Other parlour games included Blind Man's Buff, Twirl the Teacher and My Lady's Toilet.",
