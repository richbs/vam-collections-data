Other details include a sacred cord with three dividing threads, waistband and patra-kundala ear pendants.\nAccording to the myth, Aiyanar is the son of Siva and Vishnu, the latter god having been wooed by Siva after assuming feminine form as Mohini. He is also known as Harahariputa, ie, son of Hari (Siva) and Hari (Vishnu). Aiyanar is his Southern Indian name. Sasta is a form of Aiyanar shown riding on an elephant.",

            "public_access_description": "Aiyanar is one of the most popular folk-deities of rural south India where he serves as the principal protective deity of village communities, especially from the malevolent forces that abound at night. His shrines are readily identified in the countryside, where painted terracotta horses are dedicated to him; these are usually located outside the village or town boundaries.\n\nAiyanar is generally worshipped as the son of Siva, though his origins are undoubtedly in a local hero (vira) cult deity. Legend attributes his birth to a sexual union between Siva and Visnu who appeared to Siva in a female form as Mohini. Due to his parentage, he is revered by both followers of Siva and Visnu. He is also referred to by some devotees as Harahariputa, that is, the son of Hara (Siva) and Hari (Vishnu), underscoring the manner in which he bridges the two principle sects of Hinduism.\n\nAiyanar is exceptional in that he is a village guardian deity elevated into the pantheon of temple Hinduism, where processional bronze images were commissioned. He is here represented seated in a relaxed posture (sukhasana) and holding an elephant goad (ankusa). His radiating hair, mimicking that worn by Siva in his ascetic-yogic forms, is decorated with a cobra and crescent moon, thus identifying himself closely with Siva. The elephant on which he rides wears bell-garlands and a small 'howdah'-pedestal on which Aiyanar sits. Behind Aiyanar, holding on precariously, is a smaller figure, presumably the elephant-keeper (mahout). A similar ensemble is preserved in the Government Museum, Chennai. The form of Aiyanar shown riding an elephant is called Sasta.",

The LACMA elephant is also missing the figure of Aiyanar or Sasta. Dr Pal notes that Sasta is a form of Aiyanar but as Aiyanar rides a horse, while Sasta rides an elephant, the missing figure should properly be called Sasta. The same would apply to the V&A figure.",
