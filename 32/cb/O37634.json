The image\n(slightly recessed on a flat mount of ivory card) shows a group of 33\nboys & 7 adults (the central one of whom is probably the headmaster) in rows outside the doorway of a brick building with large sash windows, presumably the school.  The headmaster, who has a moustache and wire-rimmed pince-nez, is in the middle of the second row, and wears a three-piece suit with a wing collar and plain tie; on his left are 3 men, also wearing suits, one with a carnation buttonhole, and another with wire-rimmed pince-nez; on his right are 2 young men, one with a carnation buttonhole, and a woman with upswept hair who wears  a pin-tucked and embroidered dress.  The boys wear a dark uniform with single-breasted jackets, long trousers, white shirts and dark ties, with a certain amount of non-conformity allowed in the wearing of different types of collar, pocket handkerchiefs, tie-pins etc. This photograph shows the same school as in B.1213-1993, but on another, earlier occasion (judging by the appearance of some boys on both images).",
