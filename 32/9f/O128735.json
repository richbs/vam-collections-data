John de Beauchamp was summoned to Parliament in 1299. As this design is actually counter vairy it may represent Ferrers/Peverill, but Beauchamp is more likely\". Returning to the design represented here, she states: \"The seal of the Sir John who died in 1301, was <i>Argent an eagle's breast displayed, a shield vair</i>.
