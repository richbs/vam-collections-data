            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in straight stitches, chain, stem and running stitch [probably back stitch], padded [in one section: A] and quilted, backed with plain weave cotton and faced with roller printed cotton twill.\nWhite cotton ground with a narrow border outlined in green stem stitch is decorated with a line of semi-circular arches, again in green, each arch containing a flower bud in red and orange [B]. A wider band, top [outlined in blue] and also down both sides follow infilled with isolated tri-stemmed plants either red with orange infill or red with blue and yellow infill, or pink and yellow or pink and blue. Repeat of [B]. The central area has a lobed niche form outlined by a chevron band of crimson and green edged in green or dark blue. The lower section ground is quilted in an irregular lozenge lattice in white running/back stitch decorated with a bi-stemmed flower plant in red and orange with green stems and leaves.  A single blue stitched star is placed offset, lower left. The upper section continues the offset floral motifs but at the apex of the niche form, a roundel framed in pink and light green, edged in dark blue, over a small padded area [A].  the spandrels are patterned with a regular lozenge lattice in green or blue, with the junctions marked in pink each lozenge containing a small bud in similar colouring.\nThreads: 2S silk: the green is badly dyed and almost looks as if one ply is white and one green.\nBacking: beige cotton; the same fabric backs 24-1877.\nFacing: bias cut roller printed; incomplete pattern of wide white stripes dotted with blue and green and a brown/beige floral motif.\nThere are dark green silk loops attached along one edge for display purposes.There is no inscription embroidered in the roundel although a space has been left for it. This suggests that the inscription from the daily prayers was the last thing to be worked - perhaps its addition changed the nature of the mat into something with religious significance?",
