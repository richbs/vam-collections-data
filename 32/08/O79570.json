In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nThese delicate glass bracelets would only have been worn by townswomen.  They must have been made in large numbers, but are almost unknown today due to the fragility and low intrinsic value of the glass.  These owe their survival to being kept safe in a museum collection.  They were described as from Beirut when they were acquired by the Museum in 1873.",
