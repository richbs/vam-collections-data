It is most likely to have been made in Italy at the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century when Italy and Spain were the main silk-weaving centres in Europe, and the pomegranate incorporated into its design was a popular motif. Both Florence and Venice had skilled craftsmen who made these textiles for domestic and international markets, having served a long apprenticeship in order to acquire the requisite skills. \n\nThe scale of the pattern repeat meant that the textile was seen to its greatest advantage in wall hangings, although paintings from the period show that such patterns were also used for dress, both secular and ecclesiastical. Indeed, even after it fell from fashion it went on being used in the vestments worn by Catholic priests.",

MA/1/B8359.\n\nHistorical significance: The word 'tissue' was fist used to denote textiles with metal loops during the 15th century, in connection with velvets woven with boucl\u00e9 metal wefts, and as these metal loops came to be incorporated into lampas and brocatelle silks, during the 16th century 'cloth of tissue' came also to be applies to these cloths. The various 'tissues' were expensive cloths destined for the luxury market. During the first half of the 15th century  silk velvets began to be woven with looped effects, both the loops scattered through the pile and with massed gold loops on areas voided of pile (L. Monnas 1998:63).\n[Woven silk] There are droplets of candlewax on this piece, perhaps indicating that the panels once were used for \"churcheworke\".",

            "historical_context_note": "<i>Place of production</i> \nEuropean velvet production in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was mainly located in the Italian states (Lucca, Venice, Florence, Genoa, etc) and in cities in the Spanish peninsula which had been occupied by the Moors for seven hundred years before 1492 (Valencia, Granada, etc.) Guilds regulated production, organizing training and workshop practice. Velvet-making was highly skilled and craftsmen could only operate independently once they had trained for about ten years and paid their guild dues. Both raw materials (silk and gold) and labour were costly, velvet being one of the techniques in silk manufacture that required specialised - highly valued and remunerated - skills.\n\n<i>Status and use</i> \nThis costly fabric is typical of the fine silk textiles imported into England from Italy under licences stipulating that the monarch should have 'first sight and choice' of them. Under Henry VIII the use of gold-looped fabrics, termed 'cloth of gold of tissue', was restricted by law to the king and his immediate relatives (with notable exemptions). It cost \u00a32-\u00a311 per yard, at a time when some royal craftsmen earned 12d (5p) per day.  'Tissues' with this particular design of sinuous, branching pomegranates were popular for noble dress and furnishings from the 1470s into the early sixteenth century, but by the 1540s their popularity as dress fabric had waned, superseded by a newer range of designs. Thereafter, they continued to be used for secular and ecclesiastical furnishings and for ecclesiastical vestments - too valuable to discard these cloth-of-gold were mainly relegated to the chapel. The scale of their designs was particularly suited to furnishings rather than dress.\n\nAlthough this panel is impressive, it does not represent the very finest quality; the Fayrey pall incorporates a finer cloth-of-gold and the textile of the Henry VII cope is richer still.\n\n<i>Similar velvets</i> \nStonyhurst cope (red) on display in the British Galleries, V&A.\nChasuble (green), Bennefantenmuseum-Limburgs Museum voor Kunst en Oudheden, Maastricht; 433BM (cat. 46, Christa C.

He was a dealer from 1874, and had a gallery in Florence from 1881; a bequest in his will created the Bardini Museum. His first contact with South Kensington Museum was in 1884; he subsequently corresponded with the Museum for thirty years, and was one of the dealers who played the largest part in the history of the Museum before 1900. He sold objects; and even held a sale in London at the New Gallery in November 1898. The majority of pieces bought from him by the Museum were genuine and of high quality. (Clive Wainwright, 'The Making of the South Kensington Museum IV', <i>Journal of the History of Collecting</i>, Vol. 14, no. 1, 2002, pp. 72-77).\n[Woven silk] Several items in Henry VIII's textiles are recorded as \"churcheworke\", which probably was a descriptive term rather than a technical term, as many are frequently described as a type of 'tissue' (L. Monnas 1998:69)",
