Attended the Academy of Music in Hanover Square from about 1843 to 1846, when he studied painting with his elder brother George (1822-1909). In 1854 settled in Cranbrook, Kent, with Thomas Webster (to whom he was related) and others; they came to be known as the Cranbrook Colony, specialising in rural genre painting. Exhibited 93 works at the RA between 1851 and 1898, and five at the BI 1851-56, all scenes of cottage life, sometimes humorous. His pictures of children engaged in adult pursuits were especially popular. Died Cranbrook 1 April 1911.\n \nLIT:  <i>Art Journal</i> 1875, pp73-6; A Greg <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> exhibition catalogue Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977 \n\n<b>Children Playing at Doctors</b> \n1035-1886 Negs GK3333, 8834 \nCanvas, 44.7 x 61 cm (17 5/8 x 24 ins) \nSigned and dated 'F D Hardy/1863' on toy cart br \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nPresumably the painting exhibited at the RA in 1863 with the title 'The Doctor', although there are at least two other versions (see <i>Versions</i>: below). It was admired by the <i>Art Journal</i> critic: \n\nBut of all the pictures given up to child's play, and they are legion, a little work called 'The Doctor' ... is certainly one of the best ... The execution is sufficiently minute to give reality to the circumstantial narrative, without falling into excess of elaboration. The quiet humour and quaint character which reign throughout, so closely akin to Wilkie and Webster, and allied indeed to the wit and mirth which flow freely in our native literature, should not be passed without notice. \n\nEXH: RA 1863 (358); <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977 \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1863, pl12 \n\n<i>Versions</i>: 1 Christie's (L F Loyd Collection) 31 January 1913 (117, panel, 54.6 x 74.9 cm (21\u00bd x 29\u00bd ins), as exhibited at RA 1863 and signed and dated 1863), bought A M Singer 80 guineas; sold by Lady Singer, date unknown; with a dealer in Torquay c1960; private collection, Devon, 1961 \n\n2 (Probably identical with the above) Sotheby's Belgravia 24 October 1978 (22, panel, 55.9 x 76.2 cm (22 x 30 ins), as exhibited at RA 1863, signed and dated 1863 on toy cart), sold \u00a322,000.
