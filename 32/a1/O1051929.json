This photograph shows the limestone quarry, which had a kiln for producing farm fertilizer. Or perhaps she found the quarry a suitably Gothic setting. Here her daughter leans wistfully on a stick, tarrying near dusk on a summer evening. The lush verdure overtaking the cliffs remind the viewer that Nature will reclaim her territory in time. Perhaps, like many of her contemporaries, Lady Hawarden was interested in the possibility of recording the passage of time in an instant'.",
