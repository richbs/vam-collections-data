His  sculptures typically investigate the dynamics within  groups, or single pieces, of sculpture which derive in  form from domestic pottery: objects such as coffee  pots, cups, jugs etc. In this suite of prints he draws  the outline of the form and then extends the image with the addition of printing direct from his own inked  hands, leaving impressions on the paper / linear image, of finger, knuckle, palm etc., which strongly evoke the handling of clay by a potter.  Each print is untitled  but for identification the suffixed description of the  object has been added.  There are ceramics by Lord in  the Ceramics collection C.172,173-1984, Cubist Vase and Tray, 1978, and Box, 1972 Circ.154 & a-1973",
