They were made from various hardstones, including agate and jade. This ring is made of agate and has two inclusions - areas of naturally different colour in the stone. The carver shows remarkable skill in shaping the ring so that the inclusions, particularly the circular inclusion at the front, are perfectly located. The ring belonged to the renowned British connoisseur Sir Andrew Fountaine of Narford Hall (1676-1753), who was a friend of the Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver\u2019s Travels.\n\nFrom the early 16th to the mid 18th centuries, the Muslim Mughal dynasty ruled territory straddling the modern states of both India and Pakistan. The ring may have been made in either of these regions.",
