Inside is an illustration of the two rabbits, the female sitting waving a flag in a wheeled truck which the male pushes along a path to a half timbered house; the verse reads:\nTODAY YOU ARE TWO,\nAND LOOK WHO IS HERE !\nTWO GAY LITTLE BUNNIES\nTO GREET YOU, MY DEAR.\nTHEY BRING BIRTHDAY WISHES\nSO GLAD AND SO GAY,\nFOR FUN AND FOR FROLICS\nON THIS HAPPY DAY !",
