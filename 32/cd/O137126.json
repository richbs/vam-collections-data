The label was founded by Kawakubo in Tokyo in 1969 and established as a company in Japan in 1973, becoming successful there through the 1970s. Kawakubo\u2019s early collections, like Issey Miyake\u2019s, incorporated elements of traditional Japanese work-wear. Later collections were more radical and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons's 1981 debut show in Paris created a storm of controversy for its predominate use of black and distressed garment surfaces. Throughout the 1980s, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons's clothes were frequently monochromatic, asymmetrical and draped over the body, often featuring tears, holes and frayed edges. \n\nKawakubo has no formal training as a tailor, relying on the ability of pattern-makers to interpret her austere design concepts. In this dress she contrasts a body-hugging silhouette with ragged edges and a skirt that appears to have fallen off the hips to expose the petticoat underneath.",
