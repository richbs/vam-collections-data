One side of these objects is often mirrored on the inside, so that the shape of the object is reflected internally through incoming light. Sally Fawkes has been sharing a studio with her partner Richard Jackson for many years. They have collaborated on a numbers of objects, where Jackson attacks Fawkes perfect and self-contained shapes by cutting them with a diamond saw. In case of 'Sublime Transmission', Richard d Jackson has made one single cut with his circular saw running along the top length of the object. This seems like a scar from the violation of the pure shape of the object but it has also created an internal rough strip which can be read as a beautiful landscape.",
