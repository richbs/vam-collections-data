From the Polovtsoff Collection.\n\n<b>Description.</b>-A brassfounder's catalogue.   Various sizes, 13 plates, English; about 1780.   Rebound.   E.3651-3663-1910.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>-Commode handles, escutcheons, sconces for candles, clocks, knockers and furniture fitments and ornaments.\n\n<b>Comments</b>.-This is, perhaps, one of the oldest volumes in the collection.   It is a scrap-book, in which the engravings, each measuring about 16 in. by 12 in., have been carefully mounted.   At some time or another the plates have been folded for convenience in storing or transmission, and it seems unlikely that they were ever bound up as a book.   The designs are all of brass wares, but whether cast or stamped it would be a little difficult to decide.   The examples of handles for furniture, both stiff and drop, appear to be drawn full size.   The embellishments , of a somewhat florid character, include masks, lions' heads, dolphins, and rams' faces.   Descriptive numbers are engraved on the page near the articles, but the prices have been written in by hand.   The last-named do not help much in arriving at comparative values.   Thus, a clock stand, one of three shown, which, if approximately full-sized must have been 14 in. or 15 in. high, is priced at 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.   The design is marked by the French influence, and is graced with two delightfully-modelled figures, male and female, in dress of the period.   There is also a dial, indicating the presence of, or position for, the clockwork.   The most probable explanation of the low price mentioned is that here is a set of sheets issued by a firm of brassfounders to indicate what could be made of their castings.   In a word, the prices quoted were for the parts out of the sand, the purchasers working up the wares and retailing them. \"",
