Around ankles is a line of stitches. Nostrils, mouth and chin are indicated by stitches and the mouth and nostrils together with the cheeks are painted pink. The eyes are dark brown with black glass stuck to the head. The hair is an auburn mohair wig on a black linen skull cap.\nThe whole doll is stuffed with kapok. The whole is dirty and stained, possibly by water. On the upper chest is a crosspatch of sticky plaster which covers a small hole in the stockinette. \n*Elizabeth Ellen Houghton founded the Shanklin Toy Industry Ltd., Isle of Wight, 1914-20, as a cottage industry; in the 1920s the Nottingham and Shanklin Toy Industry was based in London; also known as British Toys. Originally funded by the Three Arts Women's Employment Fund; after\n1918 taken over by Roberts Bros. of Gloucester.",
