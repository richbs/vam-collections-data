He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1944, designer Oliver Messel was released from his war duties in camouflage to work on the film Caesar and Cleopatra, adapted from George Bernard Shaw's play.   Messel was responsible for the costumes and the interior design of the sets, bringing all his imagination and ingenuity to creating Roman and Egyptian costumes and interiors in the context of the mid 1940s. The film was the most expensive British film to date, costing over \u00a31m, and brought a welcome sense of extravagance and colour into a drab post-war world.\n\nThe table decorations in this photograph (and many of the props) were made out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 which was then painted gold. Wartime rationing made it difficult for Oliver Messel and his team to source authentic looking props. The wartime ethos of \u2018make do and mend\u2019 was applied to the film and Messel\u2019s resourcefulness created a genuinely Egyptian atmosphere with the costumes, props and interiors.",
