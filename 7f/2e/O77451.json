The surface is worked with a burin (the basic tool with which the engraver cuts lines into, and lifts out, slivers from the printing surface). This is then inked with a sticky ink, stiff enough to prevent it from flowing into the hollows. The ink is then transferred to the paper by pressure, often in a printing press. The fine lines cut by the burin are beneath the surface carrying the ink, and they therefore print white. \n\nWood engraving has experienced an international renaissance in recent years. This print by Hilary Paynter is typical of her work in the use of subjects that deal with psychological issues related to daily life.",
