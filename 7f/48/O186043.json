The annual spring exhibition, which attracted large crowds of art lovers, provided the students with a prestigious forum in which to display their work alongside that of their peers and elders. Finally, a system of prize competitions formed a barometer of a student's progress. The fa\u00e7ade has a studied air to it. Its sculptural programme relates to the three sister arts, while its style seems loosely derived from popular Adamesque models.",
