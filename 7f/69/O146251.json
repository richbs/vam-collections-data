Actor-director Barker had overseen the rehearsals until Shaw interrupted, adding his own unique twist to the proceedings.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw adapted the fable of Androcles and the Lion, in which a Roman slave in the Colosseum is saved by the reciprocated mercy of a lion, in order to examine Christian faith in contemporary Britain. At the time, non-believers in public life were pressured by the Christian Church; Shaw used his writing to convey his belief that the most important part of religion was not ostentatious faith but rather earnestness and a lack of hypocrisy.\n\nThe photographer Langdon Coburn was a member of the Photo-Secession, a group involved in raising the standards of pictorial photography. He became friends with George Bernard Shaw, whom he regularly photographed, alongside other literary and artistic figures to whom Shaw introduced him.",
