Baumfeld, Vienna, 1880, died London, 1977) initially worked internationally as an interior designer before graduating as an architect from the University of Munich in 1920. She designed housing for the Western Baugesellschaft in Vienna from 1920-36, after which she was forced to emigrate to England.  She travelled twice to Sicily in the early 1930s to take photographs of the vernacular architecture there, and offered her prints to the V&A for the sum of \u00a314 and 14 Shillings. This image is underpinned by an awareness of structure and composition. The church door is framed at a steep angle, and sharp lines meet the delicate shadow of the tree artistically. Briggs plays with light and shade, natural and human architecture.",
