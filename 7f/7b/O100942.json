Cuirass of fine white linen, covered with blue silk gauze, overlaid with flat silver strips, to accentuate its metallic appearance.  The embroidered motifs romantic in style, of card and thread shapes covered with silver thread strip and purl in a stylized acanthus design, with central jewelled rosettes of paste glued to card.  Two buttons at shoulder, presumably for the attachment of a cloak.  Sleeves in three parts to represent the epaulettes, tunic and bare arms.  Epaulettes of blue grosgrain with an overlaced silver weft strip, carrying an appliqued acanthus motif in silver thread with central jewelled motif.  Tunic sleeves of white linen, could have been covered with blue gauze like the cuirass; both epaulettes, and tunic sleeves edged with silver passementerie made of silver fringe and tassels.  Lower sleeves covered with pink silk tafetta.  Peplum apron and tunic skirt covered with blue grosgrain with overlaid silver strip, edged with the silver fringe and tassels.",
