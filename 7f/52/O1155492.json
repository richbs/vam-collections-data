The shop was owned by Nigel Waymouth, and the shop front was designed by him and Michael English, who would later be known as design duo Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. Together they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, also designing for concerts held at the UFO Club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their artistic influences combined the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions with the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, Indian and East Asian interests and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.",
