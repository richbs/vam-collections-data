The contact print shows the full negative, revealing how radically Breslauer has cropped the original in a print of this image also in the V&A photography collection  (Ph.797-1987). This scene was used as a cover for the book Begegnungen, by Gotthard Jedlicka, published in Basel in 1933.  Although Breslauer published the cropped version of the image in a late monograph of her work this way up, old pencil inscriptions show that at one time the image was viewed the other way up, perhaps to emphasise the Surrealist nature of the image.",
