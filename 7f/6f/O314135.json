            "public_access_description": "In Greek mythology, Prometheus, the son of a Titan, stole fire from the gods for the benefit of mankind, and was punished by Jupiter by being chained to a rock, where an eagle fed daily on his liver, perpetually renewed. He was later set free by Hercules.  According to legend, it was either Vulcan or Mercury that bound Prometheus, and here it is Mercury, the messenger of the gods, identified by his winged helmet and sandals, and his caduceus or magic wand with two entwined snakes, which lies by his foot.\n\nAn inscription on the base records that this bronze was  given by Grand-Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany to the French  painter Hyacinthe Rigaud in 1716, together with its  companion group representing The Flaying of Marsyas (see A.2-1967). The bronzes were received in exchange  for a self-portrait that Rigaud sent to form part of the  Duke's collection of self-portraits (Uffizi, Florence).  Such  exchanges were common and considered by both sides as  a honour.  Cosimo probably ordered versions of existing  models from his court sculptor, Giovanni Battista Foggini, and this is the only known cast of this model.\n\nFoggini was born in Florence in 1652 and was later sent to  Rome by Cosimo III, where he studied under Ecole Ferrata.  On his return, he became the leading Florentine sculptor,  bringing with him the exuberant Baroque style that had  evolved in Rome. A gifted portrait artist, Foggini was  appointed Grand-Ducal Sculptor in 1687, which gave him  access to the foundry in the Borgo Pinto used by his  predecessors Giambologna and Pietro Tacca. His elaborate  bronzes mark the transition from the intimate small  Renaissance bronze to larger-scale decorative and  theatrical Baroque works. The dramatic movement and  flowing drapery are typical of the style, but despite their  dynamism, this group and its companion are designed to be seen primarily from the front.\n\n\n.",

In the Crozat de Thiers sale catalogue the bronze (together with its pair, The Flaying of Marsyas, A.2-1967) were given to Lespingola, highlighting the stylistic connections between the French sculptor's bronzes and those produced in Italy.  By the time it entered the V&amp;A's collections in 1967, it was already identified as the work of Cosimo III de' Medici's Grand-Ducal sculptor, Giovanni Battista Foggini (1652-1725). The Florentine Foggini was sent by Cosimo to train at the newly instituted Accademia Fiorentina  (Florentine Academy) in Rome under the sculptor Ercole Ferrata and the painter Ciro Ferri. On his return in 1676, he soon received commissions from the court, and was later appointed both Sculptor and Architect to the Grand-Duke.\n\nThis group (and its pendant) form one of the pairings of two- figure allegorical or mythical groups created by the artist in bronze, perhaps inspired by those of his predecessor as Grand-Ducal sculptor, Ferdinando Tacca. The compositions are designed with a primarily frontal viewpoint.  The bronze was given to the French painter Hyacinthe Rigaud by Grand-Duke Cosimo III in 1716 in exchange for a self-portrait by the artist. Its later provenance includes: Louise-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers sale, Paris, 26 Beb - 27 Mar 1772, lot 911; John Edward Taylor sale, Christie's 1-9 July 1912, lot 34; George Durlacher sale, Christie's, 6-7 April, 1938, lot 46; Miriam, Lady Marks; given to the Museum by Lady Marks in 1967.",
