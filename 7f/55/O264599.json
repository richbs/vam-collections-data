Portfolio purchased for \u00a365, this piece priced separately at \u00a38.\n\n9 Dec 1929, Mr. Wace wrote:\n\n\u2018This portfolio I found in the Warren collection at Lewes when I went to see the things before the sale. I found that Mr. Arditti was intending to buy it for himself and, therefore, made arrangements with him to give us the first opportunity of acquiring it. He secured it at the sale and has offered it to us\u2026 The textiles in the portfolio come mostly from the collection of San Giorgio in Rome, for some of the sheets bear his mark. There are some splendid specimens of Italian silks velvets and two pieces of early Italian silks which would be extremely valuable for Circulation purposes. For this department the important sheets are two superb pieces of 15th century Italian velvet, two pieces of Spanish silks of the 14th and 15th centuries, which will be an excellent addition to our rather small group of this class, and several other fine pieces. \n\n\u2026Mr Arditti offers another piece of Spanish silk which was exhibited at the Munich exhibition in 1909 and represents a well known type of which we have no examples. He asks for this the very moderate figure of \u00a38\u2019.",

It is likely that immediately after the conquests of Muslim lands, the same weavers continued to produce silks for their new patrons, and that they used the same colour schemes and technical construction as Nasrid silks. The design of paired birds among flowering plants became particularly common, in keeping with a general move towards more figurative subject matter. (M. Rosser-Owen, 2010).\n\nSamples of coloured threads from this object have been taken and are being analysed as part of a collaboration between the V&A and the Spanish Research project \"Caracterizaci\u00f3n de als producciones textiles de la Antig\u00fcedad Tard\u00eda y Edad Media temprana: tejidos coptos, sas\u00e1nidas, bizantinos e hispanomusulmanes en las colecciones p\u00fablicas espa\u00f1olas\" (\"Characterization of Late Antique and Early Medieval textile production: Coptic, Sasanian, Byzantine and Spanish Muslim textiles in Spanish national collections\") (HAR2008-04161) directed by Dr Laura Rodr\u00edguez Peinado, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Dpt. de Historia del Arte I (Medieval).",
