Each vessel was given a specific name according to its shape and function. The vessels were buried with the deceased. When they were accidently unearthed centuries later they became treasured objects of antiquarian scholars and collectors. The Museum was a pioneer in the study of Far Eastern metalwork when it bought this object from the Parisian art dealer Siegfried Bing in 1876, at a time when very little was known about Chinese ritual bronzes.",
