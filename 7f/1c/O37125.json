It contains 98 pages showing the title and indexes.  The majority of the pages, numbered 7 to 92, are printed on shaded olive green paper to show a photograph and details about each toy, doll or piece of equipment available together with its number, price and tax.  Each section is titled, for example Beads, Jig Saws, Music etc.\n\nSome of the toys shown bear E J Arnold labels while others are the products of different English companies.  For example, on page 56 there is a list of dolls, these were patented by Mitchell & Hardy in 1948; on page 57 there is a Lines Bros. (Tri-ang) dolls' house.  Because of the predominence of plastic toys and equipment, the catalogue is probably of the 1950s rather than the late 1940s.",
