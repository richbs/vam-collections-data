Formed in 1966 by david Queensberry, then Professor of Ceramics at the RCA, and his former student Martin hunt. the partnership have designed ceramics for major producers and retailers around the globe. these include Wedgewood, Hornsea, Rosenthal, Habitat, Crate and Barrel, John Lewis and Jamie Oliver. Their practice spans a period of immense change in the industry, brought about by the adoption of new technologies, and the shift in production towards East Asia. Working in an essentially modernist aesthetic, Queensberry Hunt have been responsible for some of the most familiar and best-selling tableware of recent decades.\nBoth \u2018Ebony\u2019 and \u2018Cinnamon\u2019 used the shapes that Martin Hunt had designed around 1979 for Hornsea\u2019s \u2018Concord\u2019 range. \u2018Ebony\u2019 won a Design Council Award in 1982 but proved not to be a commercial success.
