Until the widespread adoption of the percussion cap as an ignition system in India in the middle of the 19th century, these flasks could to be used for either matchlocks or flintlocks. \n\nThe piece was part of the collection of hardstones belonging to Colonel Charles Seton Guthrie bought by the Indian Museum in 1868.\n\nThis priming flask was almost certainly used in association with a hunting or sporting weapon, where such accessories were often highly decorated or made of high quality materials to reflect the status of the owner.",
