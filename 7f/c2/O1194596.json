Its neat, clean appearance and unusual range of colours not normally seen on this type of product made it suitable for use on the dinner table.  The machined base which distributed the heat evenly, without distorting the vessel, enabled it be used on either gas or electric hobs.  One of the judges expressed reservations about the ease of removing the lid without the traditional knob but it was felt that the advantage gained in saving oven space compensated.\n\nSince 1951, John Reid and his wife, Sylvia, practised as architects, interior and industrial designers.  Their professional work covered a wide range of commissions from major clients such as British Rail, Thorn Electrical Industries, Boots and the City of London Corporation.  They were granted four Design Awards by the Council of Industrial Design (later the Design Council) and two Silver Medals as well as a Diploma di Collaborazione from the 10th, 12th and 13th Milan Triennales.",

A good cooking utensil which heats evenly must of necessity be fairly heavy and the properties of conductivity and heat retention make cast iron an ideal material.\n\n<b>DIRECTIONS FOR USE</b>\n\n1.  Put in fat or liquid before putting on a hot cooker.\n2.  Start cooking with a MEDIUM heat and then reduce it to LOW.  Cast iron utensils never need the application of a very fierce heat thus economies of fuel are obtained.\n3.  Very hot utensils should not be immersed in cold water nor should cold water be poured into them.\n4.  Avoid boiling dry but should this happen accidentally, allow to cool before adding further liquid.\n5.  Clean with soap or detergent and, if required, a nylon scourer.  Do NOT scour with abrasives or steel wool.  Wood handles should not be immersed.\n6.  Dry the base thoroughly before storing in a dry place, preferably with base uppermost.\n\nAnniversary ware can be used on both gas and hot-plate cookers and the utensils will last a lifetime if the points above are observed.  The range includes Casseroles, Saucepans, Entr\u00e9e Dishes, Omelette Pans and Frypans.",
