            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 127, 134\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe sketch has been placed here to be in series with the tree drawings Nos. 203 [251-1888] and 204 [ 351-1888], and because its measurements agree with those of the smaller sketchbooks used in 1820.  However, it should be noted that the drawing No. LB. 13a in the British Museum, which measures 10 1/8 x 6 5/8 ins. (259 x 170 mm.), though larger, closely resembles No. 205 [821-1888] in style and subject, and is inscribed <i>Hampstead June 21 1823 Wednesday 9 o clock Eveng Ash.</i>  No. 205 [821-1888] may then have been made at the same time, although there is no other evidence for the use by Constable of a sketch-book of the size 4 5/8 x 7 \u00bc ins. (116 x 185 mm.) in 1823.\n\nNote on Nos. 185-190 [296-1888, 309-1888, 619-1888, 824-1888, 820-1888, 293-1888], 193-195 [262-1888, 261-1888, 279-18888], 198 [310-1888], 199 [617-1888], 201 [299-1888], 202 [621-1888], and 205 [821-1888]\n\nIn 1820 Constable used two sketch-books each measuring 115 x 186 mm., one with the Whatman watermark of 1817, the other with the watermark of Dickinson (unless, of course, he had a single book made up of these different papers).  Nos. 187 [619-1888], 190 [293-1888], 193 [262-1888], and 201 [299-1888] come from the Whatman book, Nos. 198 [310-1888] and 202 [621-1888] from the Dickinson book.  Nos. 185 [296-1888], 186 [309-1888], 188 [824-1888], 189 [820-1888], 194 [261-1888], 195 [279-1888], 199 [617-1888] and perhaps also No. 205 [821-1888], come from one or other of the books, but bear no watermarks.  Constable used sketch-books of the size 115 x 186 mm. in 1812? (No. 118 [263-1888]), unless, as seems more probable, he has misdated a page of one of the 1820 sketch-books, in this instance, 1815? (No. 142 [302-1888]), 1817, and again later in 1828 (Nos. 302 [294-1888], 304-309 [350-1888, 199a-1888, 199-1888, 199b-1888, 199c-1888, 207-1888]), whilst books measuring 115 x 181 mm. were in use in 1815 and 1816.  (See also Nos. 179-182 [265-1888, 301-1888, 620-1888, 295-1888] for other sketch-book pages of this size)\n<u>Constable. 200 years in Hampstead<u> Exhibition catalogue for exhibition at Burgh House and Hampstead Museum, October 2012 - April 2013.",
