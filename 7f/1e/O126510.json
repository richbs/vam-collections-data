            "public_access_description": "Antonio Allegri Correggio (1489-1534) was an Italian painter and draughtsman. His best-known works are the illusionistic frescoes in the domes of S Giovanni Evangelista and the cathedral in Parma, where he worked from 1520 to 1530. \n5935-1857 is a reduced copy, on canvas, by an unknown artist probably painting in the early 19th century, of Correggio's fresco in the squinch of the dome of the cathedral.\nAlthough the dome is octagonal, Correggio\u2019s Assumption of the Virgin, illusionistically opens up the cupola so that the viewer in the church witnesses her Assumption from below. At the base of the dome is a fictive parapet pierced by real round windows. In front of it, on a fictive stand the Apostles in a variety of responses to the event occurring above. Beyond them is the Virgin herself, among an exultant throng of music-making angels and putti who carry her into heaven. The patriarchs, headed by Adam, are to the left, the women with Eve to the right. The whole drama is moved away from the centre, so that the Virgin is more easily visible from the nave. In the centre of the dome is a plummeting figure alternatively identified as Christ or as an angel. As the figure has no beard or stigmata and wears green and white, a colour combination not usually associated with Christ, his identity remains a topic of debate. \nThis canvas reproduces one of the paintings on the squinches, which depict four of the patron saints of Parma (John the Baptist, Hilary, Bernard Uberti and Joseph), were designed and executed after 1528 and are painted in an even more ethereal style than the dome. The combination of technical virtuosity, dynamic movement and playfulness in these works ensured their importance for later generations of artists.\nSaint Joseph is here represented as a traveller with red cloak, heavy boots, and a staff, angels carrying his pack and water cask. The angels carrying a palm frond and cluster of dates refers to Joseph's role as the protector of the Holy Family in Egypt, the lily attests to his role as perfect spouse.",

Clemente Ruta, in his <i>Guida ed essatta notizia \u00e0 Forastierei delle pi\u00f9 eccellenti Pitture che sono in molte chiese della citt\u00e0 di Parma</i> (1739), was the first to name the soutwest figure as Thomas, an indentification that was seconded and made more popuplar by Mengs. Vasari described the figure Saint Joseph and scholars have more recently returned to this identification.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This is a copy on canvas after Correggio's original fresco. Fresco is a painting technique in which pigments are dissolved in water and then applied to fresh, wet lime plaster (the <i>intonaco</i>) . As the wall dries, the pigments become an integral part of the wall.  Fresco painting was technically demanding and was usually carried out on a large scale, so the painter had to be accurate in drawing up his composition and capable of cognizing a team of skilled assistants. The appearance of the finished fresco depended on the way in which the <i>intonaco</i> was applied. Until the 15th century it was worked with a trowel to a smooth surface, however, from the 16th century onwards, a rougher texture was created by working up the surface with short strokes of a brush, emulating painting on canvas.\n\nIllusionism in painting describes the attempt to make images that seemingly share or extend the three-dimensional space in which the spectator stands. The term is also applied in sculpture, for a presentation of figures that attempts in some way to make them seem alive, and occasionally in architecture, for a presentation of structures that attempts in some way to enhance their dimensions. For imagery, the painter may represent a flat surface from which planes jut and recede to a slight depth or great distance- an effect also known as <i>trompe l'oeil</i>. This practice was common in antiquity and in Italian painting from the 15th century.",
