It is made of hemp cords which are shaped to the desired form and repeatedly saturated with lacquer and allowed to dry. Her interest in material and texture as well as lacquer is particularly well reflected in this object.\n\nKiyomi Okukubo graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1984, majoring in urushi lacquering. In 2003 she won the Gotoh Memorial Cultural Award for the most promising young talent which enabled her to travel to North America and Europe. In 2003 she was selected as a trainee of the Japanese Government Overseas Study Program for Artists and spent a year in London attached to the V&A. She regularly submits her works to various prestigious exhibitions, winning First Prize at events in 1985, 1986 and 1990.",
