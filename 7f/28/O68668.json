Possibly made up by James Nixon of Great Portland Street, who is known to have been associated with Lord Stuart de Rothesay. From the collection of Lord Stuart de Rothesay, Highcliffe Castle.\n\nThe table is raised on four shallow cabriole legs, above brass castors, the feet with gilt-bronze sabots, the knees with gilt-bronze male masks, with patinated and gilt fillets running on the outside edges of the legs in the place of metal mounts.  The surfaces of the legs and of the shaped aprons between them are veneered with panels of plain brass, outlined with pewter stringing against a ground of ebony.  The legs are joined at low level by a square-sectioned curving X-stretcher, veneered similarly, and centred by a flat roundel veneered in ebony.\nThe table is carried on a frieze approximately 6 cm deep, veneered on all sides with panels of contre-partie boulle, with pewter and ebony against a brass ground, the design of symmetrical scrolls.  On one short side this frieze forms the front of a drawer, the keyhole cut arbitrarily through the marquetry, without an escutcheon.  The lock has a double throw.  The present key is new.  The drawer is of oak, with fairly large dovetails, the base nailed on.  The front 7 cm are partitioned off into 3 compartments, but with no evidence of having been fitted for writing.\nThe top is formed of one almost-square panel of contre-partie marquetry, covered in normal use by two hinged flaps, each of which carry the same panels of marquetry on both faces, a large central roundel framed by scrolls.  On the main panel a central roundel is set within a cross-shaped parterre pattern with scrolls in the spandrels.\nUnderneath the box of the table, and the stretcher, the carcase oak has been blackened and a large number of glue blocks added under the box.  The ends of each stretcher rest and are screwed to small circular iron pads, each with a screw tang by which they have first been imbedded in the legs (in the manner of screw-eyes).",

It would originally have been supported on a faceted, tapering octagonal shaft above a tripod base. But about 1830 the top was reused, and turned into this fashionable piece of occasional furniture. This adaptation may have been carried out by the cabinet-maker James Nixon of Great Portland Street, London. The table was then acquired by Lord Stuart de Rothesay, British ambassador to France in 1815-1824 and 1828-1830, who collected boulle marquetry (named after Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle, 1642-1732, a celebrated furniture designer whose sumptuous marquetry was widely copied) and French Empire-style furniture. Stuart de Rothesay probably bought this piece to furnish his country house, Highcliffe Castle, in Dorset.",

            "history_note": "[Table] One of a large number of pieces of French furniture, ceramics, metalwork, books and other decorative arts, from the late Empire period and earlier, acquired in Paris by Sir Charles Stuart (from 1828 1st Lord Stuart de Rothesay) (1779-1845).  The Empire furnishings were probably purchased during his first period of ambassador in Paris (1815-1824), the earlier furnishings, like this table, during his second embassy (1828-1830). The Empire furnishings may have been intended for a London house. He acquired 4 Carlton House Terrace and work there continued from 1827 to 1831 and into which he moved in 1834. Older pieces, including this piece including older elements, were probably purchased for his country house, Highcliffe Castle, Hampshire (now Dorset), which was re-modelled and enlarged in the most ambitious Gothic style from 1830-1834, with some work continuing throughout the 1830s.  In 1841 the Carlton Terrace House was let. The family moved their London residence to Whitehall Yard. It is possible that 1841 (or 1845, the date of Lord Stuart de Rothesay's death) may be the date when the Empire furnishings were moved to Highcliffe.\n \nLord Stuart de Rothesay's collections were inherited in 1845 by his wife, Lady Elisabeth Stuart de Rothesay (n\u00e9e Yorke). After her death, Highcliffe House and its content passed to his second daughter, Louise, Lady Waterford (1818-1891) who maintained Highcliffe. She left the house and its collections to to her distant cousin, Major-General Edward Stuart Wortley (1857-1934). When his younger daughter Elizabeth ('Bettine') married Montagu Bertie, 8th Earl of Abingdon in 1928, he bought the castle and its content from his father-in-law. The Abingdons sold Highcliffe and most of its contents in 1949 but retained this piece, and all other pieces, of the group which became the V&A Hole bequest. After her husband's death in 1963, Lady Abingdon lived much of the time with her close friends, Mr and Mrs Tahu Hole, to whom she bequeathed all her personal possessions on her death in 1978. Tahu Hole died in 1985 and a year later his widow Joyce approached the Museum and offered the collection as a bequest. She died in December 1986 and, in accordance with her will, the Museum chose those items that it wished to add to its collections. Other items from the collection were sold to benefit the Museum and the proceeds added to the funds bequeathed.\n\nThough there is no evidence of the source of this table, it is close to the sort of furniture Nixon is likely to have supplied. In the 1942 <I> Country Life</I> photographs this table is shown in the centre of the Octagon Room at Highcliffe. It figured as lot 94 in the 1949 sale but was bought in. Lord Abingdon's notes in his copy of the catalogue suggest that it was formerly in the Drawing-Room. \n\nThe top of this piece, including the drawer section, is taken from a table of the 1680s which would have been supported on a faceted, tapering octagonal shaft above a tripod base (examples of such tables are in the British Royal Collection and the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu). The four stout cabriole legs supplied for the table in the 1830s are derived from French forms of the 1750s for small tables (particularly porcelain-mounted or laquer-mounted tables) by the cabinet-maker Bernard Van Risamburgh II (after 1696- c. 1766) or Roger Vandecruse (1727-1799), but are considerably less delicate in line. The mounts at the tops of the legs are of a Louis XIV pattern.",
