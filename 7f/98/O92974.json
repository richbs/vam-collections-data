The bear has fur ears and a brown glass eye (the other is missing), red plush jaws and bone teeth. Nose and paws are of carved wood painted black. The right forepaw is clasped and through it moves a wooden, knob topped walking stick. It wears a brass wire muzzle to which is attached a chain and ring. A large brass key with a circular handle is inserted into the right side of the body and on the left side protrudes a metal start/stop rod. The base is formed by elongated feet with holes through which metal plates protrude. When wound up these plates emerge alternately rocking the bear from side to side to give the impression of walking.",
