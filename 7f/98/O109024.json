Here the Nativity, unusually set in an ancient Roman temple, has been hammered into strong relief (embossed). Mary and Joseph sit either side of a piece of classical architecture with the infant Christ between them in the foreground. To the left are shepherds and to the right, on a balcony, the Wise Men discuss the appearence of the star. Above the figures winged cherubs carry off the bust of a Roman god from the top of a classical column, perhaps symbolising the triumph of Christianity over pagan religions.\n\nThe goldsmith may have been inspired by the Spanish sculptor and painter Alonso Berruguete (about 1488-1561), whose expressive style dominated the decorative arts in Spain in the 16th century.\n\nFor a companion plaque by the same, unknown, goldsmith see M.193-1956. It depicts the Baptism of Christ.",

Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
