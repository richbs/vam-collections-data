            "public_access_description": "This ivory snuff grater is carved in low relief with a group of musicians and fruits. It was made in France, probably Dieppe in about 1750.  \nA snuff rasp was used like a nutmeg grater for grating dried tobacco into snuff.  A perforated metal section was fixed inside the ivory cover for grating. Snuff taking was a popular pastime in France for the wealthy and fashionable. There was the rumour that a regular dose of snuff would protect against the plague. The tobacco was grated from the solid tobacco roll known as a \"carotte\".\nThe ivory carving on these rasps is often rather crude, while the subjects depicted, often mythological figures, or exotic ladies, are typical of decorative objects made from a rare and costly material to be sold as luxury good.",
