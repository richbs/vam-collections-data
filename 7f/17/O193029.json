Lazarus) Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, / with conquering limbs astride from land to land; / Here at our sea-washed sunset gates shall stand / A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame / Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name / Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand / Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command / The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame./ \"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries she / With silent lips.\"Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\" [This poem was written in 1883 by American poet Emma Lazarus, and in 1903 it was inscribed on a bronze plaque in the pedestal of the statue of Liberty, a gift of the French to the United States, designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi using an iron frame by Gustave Eiffel, dedicated in 1886 by US President Grover Cleveland on Liberty (then Bedloe's) Island, New York Harbor.

The artist has carefully selected the width of each letter so that some areas are denser than others and out of the text emerges an image of the head and crown of the Statue of Liberty.  \n\nKen Knowlton (born 1931, USA) worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories (Bell Labs) from 1962 until 1982, where he researched and developed computer graphics.  Whilst there, Knowlton met, and collaborated with, many of the other early digital pioneers, such as A. Michael Noll, Edward E. Zajac, Lillian Schwartz and Aaron Marcus.  Knowlton was responsible for developing many of the early computer programming languages, as well as one of the earliest bitmap graphics systems for creating moving images, or animation, using the computer.  He rarely uses off-the-shelf computer software, preferring to write his own, or customise existing software.",
