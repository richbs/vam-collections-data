Machin / Union / Commercial Room / S. Raven Pinxt'.  J. Machin was the landlord of a pub called  The Union in Cherry Street, Birmingham from 1825. This must have been bought for his 'Commercial Room', where salesmen, clerks and others working in city offices and shops would have met. The portrait of George IV on the lid was presumably chosen as a patriotic gesture and suggests that the box was made before William IV came to the throne in 1830. 'S. Raven' was Samuel Raven, a painter who worked in Birmingham and specialized in painting such miniatures to decorate small boxes made in papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.  At first he had worked for a manufacturer of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, but by the time he decorated this box he was buying in blanks, decorating them and selling them himself.",
