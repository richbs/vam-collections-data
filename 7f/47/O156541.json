            "public_access_description": "This box bears the monogram 'FE'  for Felipe V and Elisabetta Farnese.  Inside the lid is the miniature portrait of Felipe Bourbon (1683-1746). Brought up as Philippe, Duc d'Anjou, he was proclaimed by his grandfather the French king, Louis XIV, as king of Spain in 1700.  He succeeded his great-uncle Charles II and reigned as Felipe V until 1724 when he abdicated in favour of his son Louis. After Louis's premature death from smallpox only eight months after taking the throne, Felipe resumed his reign until his death in 1746. \n\nThe underside of the box is decorated with symbols of love - a quiver of arrows, a burning torch, a pair of doves and a flaming heart.  The box was a romantic gift from Felipe to Elisabetta Farnese of Parma, whom Felipe married in 1714. \n\nTaking snuff (powdered tobacco) became a fashionable pursuit in the early years of the eighteenth century. Ladies and gentlemen would offer each other snuff from rich, elegant boxes in the latest styles.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
