            "public_access_description": "Zulu pottery achieved a high degree of sophistication in the 19th century. The use of pottery became more widespread as Zulu communities changed from scattered, mostly pastoral clans to being concentrated in large military kraals. Large clay pots were made for the mass storage of food and brewing of beer (utshwala). A variety of smaller pots of different shapes and sizes was created for serving and drinking beer.\n\nMaking pottery was a highly-specialised skill. Clay was dug near the homestead, dried out and later reconstituted with water when required. Different kinds of clay were used for different sizes of pot, with finer clay being used for smaller, more delicate vessels. Pots were constructed using the \u2018thumb and coil\u2019 method before having their external surfaces smoothed down with a small pebble. Following a preliminary firing, smaller pots were re-fired in a smoky fire to produce a glossy, dark finish.\n\nThis pot was probably used for drinking beer although its unusual shape and nodular handles \u2013 useful for holding the pot \u2013 reflect the appearance of larger wooden vessels used by Zulu communities for the storage of milk.",
