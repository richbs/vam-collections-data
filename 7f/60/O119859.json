It was bought at the Paris International Exposition of 1867 for the not insignificant sum of \u00a324.00 from 'the Tycoon's Government'. (This was the name given to Tokugawa military shogunate in its final days of power.) \n\nIt dates from around 1860; the wirework and enamelling are clearly of the finest quality and compare very favourably with other cloisonn\u00e9 objects of the period. The dull blue enamel ground has a large number of fine brass (or gold) background wires delineating a design of scrolling \u2018karakusa\u2019 (Chinese grass), together with geometric, Seven Lucky Treasures (Japanese: \u2018shippo\u2019) and floral motifs in a limited range of polychrome enamels. The handle is of silver, or perhaps of silvered copper.\n \nWe do not know who made this piece but it is most likely to have been produced in Nagoya, possibly by Kaji Tsunekichi who was responsible for the renaissance of Japanese cloisonn\u00e9 enamels around 1840. The type, style and application of the enamels here have many similar features to another early cloisonn\u00e9 vessel in the V&A\u2019s collections (Museum no. 895-1869). It too was purchased at the Paris International Exposition of 1867.",
