He was a friend of Ralph Montagu, Earl of Montagu, who was Master of the Great Wardrobe, the royal department responsible for storing and supplying the court with clothing and textiles of all kinds. This portrait may have been made in the workshop of John Vanderbank, commissioned as a memorial by Montagu, or his son John, the Second Duke, who inherited the post of Master, who was in charge of the tapestry weavers.\n\nVanderbank was the leading tapestry weaver of his day in England. In 1689 he had been appointed yeoman arras-worker at the Great Wardrobe tapestry workshop in Great Queen Street, London, a position he held until his death. The cartoon for the tapestry portrait is copied from Jacques Parmentier\u2019s portrait of Saint Evremond, engraved by George Vertue.",
