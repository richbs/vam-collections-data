            "public_access_description": "Object Type\n'Berg\u00e8re' was the term given to a new form of winged armchair that was developed in France in about 1725. It was designed to be particularly comfortable, with a long seat and a sloping back. The French term was anglicised as 'burjair' by the London cabinet-makers William Ince and John Mayhew in their Universal System of Household Furniture (1759-1762). Examples are illustrated on plate 40 of that publication. Thomas Chippendale (1718-1779) tightened the Ince and Mayhew design to make a more elegant chair for a drawing room, which, with its generous cushion stuffed with feathers, was still very comfortable.\n\nPlaces\nThis chair was made for the Drawing Room in David Garrick's London house, which formed part of the Adelphi development designed by the Adam brothers. The inventory compiled at the time of Garrick's death in 1779 lists in the Drawing Room the full set of seating furniture to which this chair belongs. It consisted of 12 cabriole elbow chairs, four further chairs, a sofa and two 'Berjaires with Down Cushions'. They were all decorated to match in green and white and covered with green silk damask with green serge cases to protect the damask. The carpet, woven at Moorfields, was also green and white. The ceiling from the Drawing Room, painted to the designs of the architect Robert Adam, is  also in the V&A.",
