He came to power by seizing the throne and spent much of his time as Emperor repelling invaders, notably the Normans, under their charismatic leader Robert Guiscard. Alexius' time as Emperor also coincided with the first Crusade, and the story of the Byzantines' distrustful relationship with the Crusaders is told in Alexius' biography, the Alexiad, written by his daughter, Anna Comnena. Alexius' coinage reflects his vigorous rule. In the early 1090s, he reformed the coinage, replacing the old solidus with a slightly smaller, but finer gold coin, known as the Hyperpyron, of which this is an example.\n\nThe portrait on this coin emphasises that the emperor was a semi-divine figure invested with imperial authority directly through God's will. The items worn and held by Alexius were the traditional symbols of his authority: the crown, the sceptre, and the 'globus cruciger', a globe surmounted by a cross, indicating that the emperor receives his authority from God.",
