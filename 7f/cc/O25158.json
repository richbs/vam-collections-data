The god stands beneath a <i>kirttimukha</i> mask in a frontal, unflexed position holding, (although the left hand is missing) two sinuous tendrils of fully-opened lotus blossoms, which are held aloft by two small heavenly, figures (<i>apsaras</i>). He wears a crown upon his head and a diaphanous robe over which he wears elaborate jewelery, including a belt, earrings, bracelets and necklace with long strands of pearls rippling diagonally across his body.  His sword lies beside his left leg and he is wearing boots. The small female figure who stands in front of his legs is probably his principal consort, Prabha (brightness), while his charioteer, Aruna, is depicted beneath her in a truncated form upon a double lotus pediment supported on a stepped plinth, from under which spring  his seven horses. Two similar attendant bearded figures with matted locks, potbellies and pearl jewellery stand in a <i>tribanga</i> position holding batons at the outer edge of the sculpture. Next to them are two smaller female attendants in three-quarter pose who appear to step forward with their<i> chauri </i>whisks held above their heads.  Beneath the left hand<i> </i>male figure stands the diminutive figure of a female archer dispelling darkness: her companion on the other side is now missing.",
