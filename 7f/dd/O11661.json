The pattern consists of wide and narrow stripes of blue, red, yellow, brown and white. \n\nTechnical Details:\nWarp: 61 threads per inch. (i) white cotton; Z-spun, paired threads; (ii) blue cotton; Z2S lightly plied and now separated; (iii) red cotton; Z2Z; (iv) yellow cotton; Z-spun, paired and sometimes three threads used together, but it might be loosely plied Z3S; (v) brown cotton; Z-spun, usually paired threads.\nWeft: 15 threads per inch.  White cotton; Z-spun, usually paired threads.  There is a loosely woven band about 4.5 inches deep which includes eccentric wefts.\nLower Edge (where the Museum Number is): left hand panel: first three sheds each contain 4 weft threads.  Right hand panel: first two sheds each contain 4 weft threads.\nUpper Edge: both panels: last two sheds each contain 3 weft threads.\n\nRed cotten dyed with Alizarin, patented in London and Germany in 1871.",

This tzute is made from two panels oversewn with white and blue cotton. A decorative seam such as this is known as a randa. A natural, undyed brown cotton has been included in the warp; this is known as Cuyuscate or Ixcaco (Gossypium Mexicanum).  It produces shorter fibres than the more common white cotton and consequently is more difficult to spin, more expensive and more highly prized by weavers.   \nThe fabric is stained and there are ring marks from cups or dishes which suggest that Mr and Mrs Maudslay used this as a table cover.",
