The name comes from the numerous little knobs which decorate the surface \u2013 unlike most rings worn with traditional costume it had no religious or marital significance.  \n\nDoprings are often very large in size.  Because the decoration goes right round the band, it is very difficult to alter the size without destroying the pattern.  So most of them were made on the large side, to allow the owner to grow into them.  If it was too large to be worn comfortably, she wrapped blue wool round it, on the back where it could not be seen, to reduce the size.  This example was probably made between 1850 and 1900, when rings of this kind were at their widest.",
