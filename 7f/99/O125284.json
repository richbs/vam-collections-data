It shows how many brides opted for colourful, rather than white, gowns in a time of strict rationing during the Second World War. They used whatever fabric they could find and some dresses were even made out of parachute silk. \n\nElizabeth wanted a traditional style of dress and found a beautiful satin curtain material as rationing did not yet extend to furnishing fabrics. She commissioned Ella Dolling, a Court dressmaker of Portland Street, London, to fashion it into this lovely gown. \n\nIt is typical of the fashionable style of the period with its fitted sleeves slightly puffed at the shoulder, sweetheart neckline and long stiff skirt. Elizabeth opted for a prayer book instead of a bouquet and artificial flowers on her head, although Rowland did wear a carnation in his buttonhole.",
