            "public_access_description": "This flask, one of a pair, was almost certainly part of a toilet service. Toilet services comprised items for grooming and breakfasting (such as combs, ointment pots, a mirror, candlesticks and bowls for broth), and the fashion  for them originated in France. Flasks like this one are referred to in seventeenth-century inventories as 'ferri\u00e8res', and held water scented with oranges for handwashing.\nThe marks on the flasks suggest the  complexity of the French marking system and, perhaps, the subterfuges  practised by goldsmiths. Both flasks bear the marks of different Paris goldsmiths. The very worn maker's mark on the base of one flask (V&amp;A 806A  &amp; C-1892) is probably that of Ren\u00e9 Delacourt, a Paris goldsmith punished  by the French authorities for fraud and pardoned in 1635. Jean Leroy, whose mark appears on the base of the other flask (V&amp;A 806 &amp; B-1892) was recorded in the London borough of Westminster in 1655 and was still resident in the city in the early 1670s. He was a contemporary of a third goldsmith, Genevi\u00e8ve Cabarin, whose mark appears on the sides of both flasks. Cabarin was the widow of the goldsmith  Pierre Danet, and she took over his workshop after 1671. The location of these different goldsmiths' marks on the flasks appears to suggest that Cabarin's workshop made the cast side panels and soldered them to bases recycled from works made by the other two goldsmiths. Yet other scenarios are also possible. Cabarin and Leroy were contemporaries living in different cities. Did they know one another? Did Leroy, in fact, import silver made by Cabarin to London and add this to pieces made in his own workshop? This aside, the assay and tax marks  struck on the base of both flasks are inconsistent.  Both flasks bear a tax mark for 1672-74, which  coincides with Cabarin's activity, but the assay letters on the flasks are for different, earlier, dates.  If Cabarin did indeed assemble the flasks, this suggests some form of  fraudulent activity on her part. Her workshop may have used  substandard silver for the cast sides of the flasks and deliberately retained  the worn assay marks on the recycled silver bases to make this appear legitimate.",
