In earlier catalogues this miniature has been recorded as the first by Stevens, but this supposition I would suggest is doubtful considering the assured  technique of the ivory, and the fact we cannot be certain that Stevens did not use the medium in Italy.\nNo other and later examples are known in this country.\nPainted at Blandford, Dorset, August 1843.\n<i>Water-colour on ivory and mounted in an oval chased and inscribed gold case.  Size of miniature,</i> 1<sup>1</sup><sup>3/16 </sup>X 1<sup>7/16</sup>  (4.6 X 3.7).\nExhibited No. 135 Tate Gallery Loan Coll. of <i>Works by A.S.</i>, 1911-12.
