When working on a monument, Scheemakers submitted sketch models of the principal figures to his patrons before the contract was finalised.

Its mottled appearance is due to the removal of various later layers of paint.\n\nPeter Scheemakers (1691-1781) was one of the leading sculptors working in Britain in the mid-18th century, and was renowned for his tombs and portrait busts in particular.\nHis training in the Netherlands would have included the modelling of terracottas.",
