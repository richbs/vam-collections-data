These glazed Fassi (from Fez) wares were made by professional male potters as decorative ware for urban consumers. Their style may have been influenced by the appearance of Chinese porcelain, historically made available through Mediterranean trade. Another factor was the availability of increasingly pure cobalt blue imported from Europe from the 1850s onwards.\n\nThis jar or khabia was used for storing food such as oil, honey and vegetable and meat preserves (its Arabic name means \u2018to store\u2019). The inside of the jar was therefore also glazed. The jar was donated to the V&A by George Maw, founder of Maw & Co., a British manufacturer of ceramic tiles. The company won many medals and awards at the international exhibitions which were a feature of the late 19th century. This jar was displayed at the 1871 Annual International Exhibition held in London.",
