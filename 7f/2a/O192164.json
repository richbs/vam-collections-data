The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThere are two worms coming out of an apple, one on the left and one on the right, referring to different political positions. The words on the poster state: 'Mich wurmen die Linken und die Rechten - deshalb CDU', meaning 'I am rankled by the Lefts and the Rights - therefore CDU'. There is a nice wordplay here, which only works in the German language.  'Wurmen' means 'rankling' and 'wurm' is 'worm'.  \n\nThe Alliance for Germany was an opposition coalition formed on 5th February 1990 in then West-Berlin to stand for the 'Volkskammer' (People's Chamber) election. It got the majority of the seats and thus formed the interim-government until reunification, with Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as Minister President.\n\nThe CDU, DSU (German Social Union) and DA (Democratic Awakening) were part of the Alliance. The political aims (reunification of Germany and reconstitution of the federal states) were mainly determined from the West German side of the CDU. The then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared at many election campaign activities for East German CDU.",
