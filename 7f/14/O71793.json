The two remaining rosettes show traces of gilding.\n\nAccording to E. Machell Cox, in his Commemorative Catalogue to an Exhibition of Models and Designs by the late Sir Alfred Gilbert (1936), this is the working model for a memorial to be carried out in marble and bronze. It is not known whether the memorial was ever erected.\n\nAlderman James Conrad Cross (1879-1952) was Lord Mayor of Liverpool in 1931 and 1932. On 23 July 1932 he unveiled the aluminium replica of Gilbert's figure of Eros given to the City of Liverpool by George Audley. It is possible that Cross commissioned the memorial, which may be to his son, from Gilbert after that unveiling.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. He epitomised the movement known as the \u201cNew Sculpture\u201d, with a new focus on naturalistic forms. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.",
