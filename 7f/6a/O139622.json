It shows the artist's lively but meticulous watercolour style and combines her skill at topography and figure drawing. This drawing for a book cover shows the typical style of artist and illustrator Phyllis Ginger (1907-2005), which is often characterized by distinctive and lively sketches of people in everyday situations. Though best known as a topographical artist, whose skill led to her contribution to Pilgrim Trust\u2019s \u2018Recording Britain\u2019 project, Phyllis Ginger's (1907-2005) first ambition was to become an illustrator. From 1941 her illustrations to Mrs Robert Henrey's book entitled 'A Farm in Normandy' led to a collaboration with the author which lasted for thirty years. She was commissioned by Puffin to write and illustrate a children\u2019s story \u2018Alexander, the Circus Pony\u2019, published in 1943 and illustrated another children's story a few years later, entitled 'The Mushroom Pony', written by Joan Lamburn.",
