In the centre of the portrait is an image of the actor Amitabh Bachchan on a motorbike, he is depicted in natural colours and contrasts with the green of the other portraits. The English title runs across the bottom of the poster and the typography is  in a three-dimensional style which gives a sense of a monumental scale. The Hindi and Urdu titles are much smaller and in the bottom left hand corner. The artist's signature, Laxman, is on the right hand edge.",
