By the 19th century these chains had fallen out of fashion.  Only priests, and people who wore traditional dress, continued to use them.  It is impossible to date these chains accurately, as they remained unchanged for centuries, and are rarely marked.\n\nRussian filigree chains are usually made from scrolls of wire soldered together to make individual links.  This chain has only two scrolls in each link, but some have as many as eight.  At each end there is a longer wedge-shaped terminal with a hole at its end, which would have held a cross or religious pendant.",
