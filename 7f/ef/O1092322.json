London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n<i>\"Julia Margaret Cameron   British   1815-79\nCirce   1864-65\nGold toned albumen print from wet collodion negative\nSigned, titled and inscribed by the photographer on the mount:\n'From Life Circe \"Who knows not Circe / Daughter of the Sun\"'\nP &amp; D Colnaghi stamp on mount, lettered 'Registered Photograph'\n244 X 202 mm   Mus. no. 45,140   Given by the photographer</i>\n\nMrs Cameron's technical skills as a photographer were more limited than her imagination and many of her photographs are effective in spite of their imperfections.  The limited depth of field of her portrait lens used at full aperture, and the long exposure times, combine to produce a softness of detail unusual for the period - although it was to become a fashion at the end of the century with the rise of 'impressionist' photography.  Many of her photographs, including this one, show a cr\u00eape-like pattern in the image; this almost certainly results from too thick a coating of collodion on her plate.  This is a case, perhaps, in which her imperfect techniques contributed by happy accident to the effect of the final result.  Very large numbers of mounted copies of her photographs were sold or distributed, either printed on albumen paper - as in this example - or by the carbon process (see the example of Etienne Carjat's portrait of Charles Baudelaire, Mus. no. 1190-1980).\nMrs Cameron's career began with the gift of a wet collodion camera and darkroom equipment from her daughter and son-in-law in 1863.  Her portraits boldy revived a tradition of artistic imprecision in photography (see Gustave Le Gray's example 'In the Forest of Fontainebleau' of 1851, Mus. no. 68,007) and carried it to an extreme of expressive intent.  Her hall-mark is the extreme close-up thrown slightly out of focus.  Her methods veiled detail by optical means (rather than by retouching, which spoils much portrait photography of the later collodion era).  In the 1850s and early 1860s some photographers, notably Claudet, had sought means of softening the ultra-sharp and often unflattering delineation of physiognomy which was thought of as a problematic feature of the collodion process.  Mrs Cameron's intentions were clearly to draw from her sitter's ideal, symbolic or universal qualities.  In this photograph the title invites us to find a young girl (Kate Keown, born in 1857) the imprint of the sorceress daughter of the sun, preparer of the magic cup whose contents changed the companions of Odysseus into swine.  Characteristic of many of Mrs Camerons's portraits is the dark background from which the head emerges, lit by diffused light (although, of course, some of her major portraits are lit starkly and dramatically).\n\nKingsley, Hope with contributions by Riopelle, Christopher <u>Seduced by art : photography past and present</u> London: National Gallery, 2012",
