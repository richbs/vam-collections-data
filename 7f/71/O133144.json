Clarke uses a 19th-century teapot as the basis for this composition. The teapot is sawn in half, the pieces joined together with lead inserts to create another functional object: a vase. The title, literally meaning a commotion or uproar, could refer to the treatment of the teapot, as well as being a play on words, referring to the former function of the pot, to brew tea.",
