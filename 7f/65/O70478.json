The Virgin, crowned and wearing a gown and a cloak fastened with a brooch, kneels in front of the mound in the centre of the panel, facing right and looking upwards, her hands held apart. Behind her kneel two bearded apostles, hands held together in prayer, looking up at the disappearing figure of Christ. Two similar apostles kneel in prayer on the same side of the panel behind the mound, while another figure stands at the back of the panel, his left hand raised. On the right of the panel the tonsured St. Peter kneels facing the Virgin with the beardless figure of St. John the Evangelist behind him; three more bearded apostles are grouped round the mound and a fourth stands at the back of the panel, his right hand raised. All the figures except the one on the immediate left of the Virgin--who wears only a robe--wear long cloaks and robes. The panel is unusually wide.\n\nThe top corners of the panel are missing, including the head of an apostle on the left. The feet of Christ are also missing. The carving is weathered. There is a hole right through the panel near the right shoulder of St. Peter. \n\nGreen paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. The background of the top of the panel bears traces of gilt and gesso knobs. Very little other paint remains. There are traces of gilding on the hair of some of the figures. The mound has traces of a reddish colour. The back of the panel bears four lead-plugged holes with traces of latten wires. The bottom has been cut away.",

Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
