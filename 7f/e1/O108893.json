In the earlier instances, as in the Kootub, these arches merely towered over the quondam temple, as if emblematic of the relations of the two religions; but subsequently the principle compartments of the temple were raised by an upper colonnade to the height of the arches, and the whole became a complete, harmonious, and graceful design, of which the most perfect example exists at Ahmedabad. \n\n\nRef: Delhi, Agra, and Rajpootana, Illustrated by Captain E.C.
