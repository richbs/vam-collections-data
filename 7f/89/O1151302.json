High stiff stand-up collar. Short sleeves ( above the elbow). Slit at sides. Cream silk twill lining with applied lace. White synthetic cut velvet on a crepe ground with printed  orange-red and pink floral motifs. Some of the red dye has run, possibly due to a previous clean.Shanghai 1930s\nThe dress is an interesting piece of modern technology. The velvet and crepe are synthetic fabrics ( as opposed to organic textiles such as silk) and machine woven. There is also a lace detail that is iun the very fashionable art deco style. This dress thus is an interesting combination of a traditional Chinese form with modern Western influences.",

Coming into vogue as the new Chinese republic was founded in 1911, the qipao was seen as the woman\u2019s dress of \u2018new\u2019 China. Although it retained the basic form of the dress of the \u2018Banner people\u2019, the Manchus (who were not ethnic Chinese), changes in details in ornamentation and tailoring marked the \u2018overthrowing\u2019 of the feudal past. \n\nThis dress is an interesting piece of modern technology: the velvet and \u2018crepe\u2019 are synthetic fabrics (as opposed to organic textiles such as silk, which these fabrics are traditionally made with), and machine woven (as opposed to loom weaving). There is also a lace detail that is in the very fashionable art deco style. This dress thus is an interesting combination of a traditional Chinese form with modern Western influences.\n\nThe qipao was worn mainly by women in urban centres, generally until the socialist People\u2019s Republic of China was established in 1949. Shanghai was well known for its congregation of skilled tailors and dressmakers who incorporated features of Western tailoring (for e.g. darts and laces) into the construction of the qipao. After 1949, for fear of reprisals for \u2018being bourgeois\u2019 and being associated with capitalism, many of these tailors fled to Hong Kong, where the tradition of qipao making continued for many years.",
