His first novel, Pickwick Papers (1837), was an enormous success. It  was followed by Oliver Twist (1839) and many other books that drew on his life experiences. As a child Dickens had grown up in poverty, and his novels deal with social injustices with compassion and humour. Dickens's novels were serialised monthly before being published in book form. He gave public readings to audiences in Britain and the United States. He was also editor of the Illustrated London News, a newspaper that reported on politics, current events and fashion.",
