A church that wished to glaze its windows with elaborately painted glass would have to seek sponsorship. In large cathedrals, wealthy ecclesiastics or members of royal families would often supply the necessary funds. Smaller institutions would have to seek financial assistance from well-off members of their communities, both ecclesiastical and lay. The people who contributed these funds are known as 'donors'. The donors could choose to be depicted in the windows they financed. Alternatively, they might display only their armorial bearings, as we see here. In this panel, the donors' arms are those of Margareta de Bergis, who was abbess of Herckenrode, and Johannes Geloes, a priest in Hasselt.\n\nThe Cistercian abbey of Herckenrode is situated near Hasselt, in modern-day Belgium. It was closed down at the time of the French Revolution, which began in 1789.\n\nWe do not know where this window originally came from. In Lichfield Cathedral in England there are windows from the abbey of Herckenrode, and we know that Abbess Margareta donated sums for their creation. However, the other donor of the panel in the Victoria and Albert Museum,  Jan Galoes, was the parish priest of Hasselt.  So it is possible that this panel came from a church there.",

            "historical_context_note": "Decorated windows could be very expensive to produce. A church wishing to glaze its windows with elaborately painted glass would have to seek sponsorship. In large cathedrals, wealthy ecclesiastics or members of royal families would often supply the necessary funds. Smaller institutions would have to seek financial assistance from well-off members of their communities, both ecclesiastical and lay. The people who contributed these funds are known as 'donors'. The donors could choose to have themselves depicted in the windows they financed or they could instead display only their armorial bearings as we see in this panel.\n\nThe donors whose arms are displayed in this panel are Margareta de Bergis who was abbess of Herckenrode and Johannes Geloes, a priest in Hasselt.\n\nThe Cistercian abbey of Herckenrode is near Hasselt, in modern day Belgium. The abbey was closed down at the time of the French Revolution.\n\nIt is not known where this window was originally located. In Lichfield Cathedral there are windows from the abbey of Herckenrode and it is known that the Abbess Margareta donated sums for the creation of these. However, the other donor of the V&A panel, Jan Galoes, was the parish priest of Hasselt and so it is possible that the panel came from a church there.",
