Justification for this brutal event was sought, in the British press, by depicting the Oba and his people as \u2018savages\u2019 who practised human sacrifice. However, the elaborately carved ivories and cast brass plaques and sculpture seized from the royal court, and dispersed to British museum collections, were evidence of a sophisticated and technologically-advanced society.\n\nThis unsavoury aspect of British history was reflected on by artist Tony Phillips in a 1984 series of etchings, History of the Benin Bronzes. In this image, the third in the suite of twelve plates, we see the \u2018Shrine of Sacrifice\u2019 in Benin City. A bronze figure stands to the left of the image and other objects, including a sculpted head, lie on the floor.",
