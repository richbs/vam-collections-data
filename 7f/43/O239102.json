Reynolds, <i>Victoria and Albert Museum: Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, 1973, pp. 44-45\nThe following is a note on the entry:\n\n'Not dated, but clearly made on the same occasion as No. 33 [804-1888] from a viewpoint further to the right.\n\nNote on Nos. 33-35:\n\nAn unpublished extract in Farington's <i>Diary</i> for 12 May 1802  records that Constable called on him to say that he was going to Windsor with Dr. Fisher (the future Bishop of Salisbury) to be introduced to General Harcourt, who wanted someone to teach drawing at a military School. Constable called on Dr. Fisher later, on 20 May, having paid the visit and being very much exercised in mind as to whether he should take the offered position. Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 20) records that Benjamin West strongly dissuaded him from accepting it, and undertook to approach Dr. Fisher and to decline it on Constable's behalf without giving offence. In his letter of 29 May 1802 to Dunthorne, from which another excerpt is given below (see note following No. 40), Constable says, referring to his visit to Windsor: \"I have had much ado to keep my mind together enough to write to be understood owing to a reumatick pain in one side of my head particularly in my teeth and lower jaw which has caused one cheek to swell very much. I beleive I got cold at Windsor as I was there in the late severe weather\" (L. ed. S., p. 21). Nos. 33, 34 and probably 35 were made during this visit.'\n\nG Reynolds",
