It shows the Antique goddess Diana resting and is probably a fragment of a large decorative cycle representing the Olympian gods. A pupil of Alessandro Rossi (1627-1707) and best known for his fresco paintings, Gherardini developed a more painterly approach in Florentine art and anticipated the style of painting characteristic of the late 18th century.",

Before 1800,</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 129, cat. no. 148.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nAlessandro GHERARDINI (1655-1726) \nItalian (Florentine) School \nBorn in Florence, he was influenced primarily by Veronese and Luca Giordano. He painted frescoes in many Tuscan churches and was one of the most distinguished of Florentine baroque painters. \n\n148 \nDIANA SLEEPING; WITH BOY AND HOUNDS \nFresco on tile \n26 x 37 (66 x 94) \n680-1864 \n \nOriginally attributed to Giovanni da San Giovanni (Florence, 1592-1636) and then to Baldassare Franceschini (Florence, 1611-89), 680-1864 was published by Gerhard Ewald as Gherardini in 1963 and convincingly compared with this artist's other frescoes of mythological subjects. Like Giovanni da San Giovanni and Franceschini, Gherardini is known to have painted frescoes on tile (compare for example, <i>Mostra dei tesori segreti delle case fiorentine</i>, Florence, 1960, no. 123, pl. 95). \nDiana is recognizable from the bow she is holding and from the moon on her head, but the composition showing her asleep in the company of a small boy is very similar to depictions of Venus reclining, with Cupid, from which it appears to be derived (e.g. Titian, Uffizi; Guido Reni, Dresden-Venus awake; 16th century Venetian School, Dulwich-Venus asleep). For a discussion of the 'sleeping nymph' composition see O. Kurz, 'Huius Nympha Loci' in <i>J. W. C. I.</i>, xvi, 1953, p. 171 ff. \n\nCondition. Cracked vertically in centre and on left. \nProv. Bought for \u00a38 in 1864. \nLit. G. Ewald, 'Il pittore fiorentino Alessandro Gherardini' in <i>Acropoli</i>, iii, 1963, p. 125, n. 7, fig. 5.\nG.

This technique is a good example of Gherardini's art as he favoured especially this medium to display his inventive compositions and was indeed particularly appreciated as a fresco painter by his contemporaries. Fresco painting is among the most complex projects undertaken during the Renaissance. This technique, i.e. painting on wet plaster, originated in the Antiquity (see the surviving fresco of Pompeii, near Naples, destructed during the eruption of the Vesuvius in 79 B.C.), was reintroduced and developed in the late 13th century and the 14th century particularly in the work of the Isaac master, Giotto and his followers and perfected during the Italian Renaissance, culminating in Michelangelo's technological tour de force in the Sistine chapel, Rome (1508-12). \n\nThe present work shows a reclined Diana resting, identifiable as such by her bow and the crescent moon on the top of her head while two hounds besides her (she is a hunter) are playing with a <i>putto</i>. Francesco Saverio Baldinucci in his biography of the artist recalls that soon after 1702 Gherardini painted in the palace of his friend and protector in Florence, Alessandro del Grazia, a series of frescoes representing Olympian gods. This painting may be a fragment of this lost ensemble. \n\nThe composition recalls famous examples of reclining nude women, more closely associated with Venus rather than Diana, a connection which is strenghtened by the presence of a putto at her side, interchangeable with Cupid. Here the influence of Florentine artists such as Michelangelo (see the sculpture <i>The Night</i> in the Sagrestia Nuova of S. Lorenzo, Florence) for the monumentality of the figure, and the Northern school, especially Titian, Veronese and Correggio, for the dynamic composition as well as the subtle and colourful palette, is patent (see Correggio, <i>Venus and Cupid with a Satyr,</i> Louvre, Paris; Titian, <i>Danae,</i> Capodimonte, Naples; and Veronese, <i>Allegory of Love,</i>, The National Gallery, London).\n\nFresco painting was used to decorate large wall areas of both private and public buildings. Such sizable paintings, in which timing was of critical importance, took careful planning and involved a number of assistants. A precise plan in the form of a drawing or of many drawings was required so that the composition would fit exactly on the wall. The artist could draw directly on the wet plaster (this underdrawing technique is called <i>sinopia</i>) or use cartoons (from the Italian word <i>cartone</i>) from which the composition was then transferred onto the wall. Another method of transfer, used especially in the 17th century for vast ceiling frescoes, was squaring, which replaced the time-consuming and costly cartoon technique.",
