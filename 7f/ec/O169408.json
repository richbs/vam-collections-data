His style, incorporating flat areas of colour enclosed by thick black lines, was influenced by the example of the Japanese woodcut, the poster artist Alfons Mucha and the Art Nouveau style. His career started in 1890, when he became a regular contributor to The Graphic magazine. He began designing theatre posters when he joined the advertising company David Allen & Sons, in 1895, whom he worked with for over 50 years.",
