In 1906 she exhibited this work (or a similar one) in Liverpool at the Walker Art Gallery's Autumn Exhibition, entitled The Queen of Dreams. The source for the subject may be literary: the American writer Louisa S. McCord (1810-1879) referred to such a figure in her poem 'The World of Dreams'. \n\nThe sculpture depicts a half-length young woman wearing a winged headband, and drapery swathed around her waist, looking down at the baby in her arms, in a composition reminiscent of a Virgin and Child group. The group is in the tradition of the work of Alfred Drury (under whom Williams trained at the Wimbledon School of Art), as well as Alfred Gilbert and George Frampton, in its expression of tender human qualities; typically of the New Sculpture, it echoes stylistically the Florentine quattrocento.\n\nThe material is relatively unusual. Spelter is a zinc alloy, somewhat cheaper and easier to work than bronze; here the artist has given it a finish to make it convincingly resemble bronze.",

Williams specialised in small-scale, intimate bronzes, of which this one is typical. In 1906 Williams exhibited this bronze (or one similar) at the Walker Art Gallery's Autumn Exhibition entitled <i>Queen of Dreams</i>.\n\nThe exact source or nature of its subject is obscure; it shows a half-length young woman wearing a winged headband, and drapery swathed around her waist, looking down at the baby in her arms, in a composition reminiscent of a Virgin and Child group. The bronze has a good patina, and is in the tradition of the work of Drury himself, as well as Alfred Gilbert and George Frampton, in its expression of tender human qualities; typically of the New Sculpture, it echoes stylistically the Florentine quattrocento.\n\nThis bronze is the V&A's first example of a work by this artist and significantly adds to the Sculpture section's holdings of work by British women artists. Moreover, as Williams trained in South Kensington, this sculpture has particular relevance in the collections.\n\nBought from Ted Few for \u00a34,000 with funds from Deptl &amp; Central funds, and a contribution from Gilbert Bayes Trust.",

She exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, the Royal Hibernian Academy, The Royal Cambrian Academy, the City Art Gallery, Leeds, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, and the Bristol Academy, as well as numerous other British venues. She lived in London, and also studied in Rome and elsewhere in Europe before the First World War.",
