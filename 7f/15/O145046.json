The first theatre burnt down in 1672, and was rebuilt in 1674; this was demolished under the management of Richard Brinsley Sheridan to make way for a larger theatre, seen in this picture, which opened in 1794. Unfortunately it too burnt down the year after this scene was painted by Pugin, in 1809. The show being performed is most probably Shakespeare's tragedy, Coriolanus. The current Drury Lane Theatre opened in 1812.  \nThis aquatint is based on an original painting by Augustus Charles Pugin, created so that people could buy prints to display in their homes. Reproducing other forms of art by engraving was a common practice before the advent of photography.",
