The fact that this waistcoat survives with its original receipt or bill (T.313:2-2009) makes it very unusual, however, and this receipt reveals some fascinating details about the waistcoat's history.\n\nGenealogical research has shown that the waistcoat's original wearer, George Knight, may have been a farmer in Kent, and married an Elizabeth Gurr in that county in 1858. We can picture his complete outfit from the evidence of the bill - he wore it with a 'Super' (fine, densely woven wool) blue frock coat, and a pair of lavender tweed trousers. The fact that George Knight bought his wedding clothes from a 'Merchant Clothier' rather than a tailor indicates the changing nature of the London retail industry in the nineteenth century, towards department stores and away from craftspeople working in their own retail premises.",
