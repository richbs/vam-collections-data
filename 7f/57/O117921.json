Images of ruins were a recurrent theme in Romantic art and literature.  Constable would return to painting ruins after the death of his wife in 1828, when they took on a more personal significance.\n\nThis watercolour is difficult to date because Constable preserved the same manner in his watercolours of East Bergholt Church for a number of years.  It was probably painted between 1805 and 1811.",

Reynolds, <i>Victoria and Albert Museum: Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, 1973, p. 57, no. 68.\nReynolds contests the date given by Homes (see below) on the basis that Constable's manner in watercolours of East Bergholt Church remained the same over many years.\n\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n'This drawing is listed at this point of the Catalogue because of its affinities in subject-matter and style with Nos 66 and 67 [224-1888 and 346-1888]. Holmes, p. 240, implies that the drawing is dated June 1806, but this is not the case.\n\nNote on Nos. 66-71\n\nThese drawings are carried out in a manner which Constable preserved for a number of years when making watercolours of East Bergholt Church, the consistency of which makes the precise dating of uninscribed examples, such as Nos. 68-70, impracticable. An early instance is found in the watercolour 'East Bergholt Church' in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, which is signed and dated 1805, and is virtually identical with No. 70 [200-1888] apart from being two inches more in height. A later example is the drawing of 1811 recorded in the note on No. 70.'\n\nReynolds, pp. 57-58\nC. J. Holmes, <i>Constable and his Influence on Landscape Painting</i>, 1902, p. 240.\nHolmes dates the watercolour to June 1806, a date which Reynolds contests.\nEvans, M., with N. Costaras and C.

In June he was at East Bergholt, as is attested by Nos. 66 and 67 [224-1888 and 346-1888].
