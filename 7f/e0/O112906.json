They gave the finishing touches to elegant dress and were one of the few pieces of jewellery worn by men as well as women. \n\nMaking buckles became a highly skilled craft at which English silversmiths and jewellers excelled. Exquisitely wrought designs, glittering pastes and precious stones reflected the status of the wearer as well as the occasion. Cheaper and plainer versions were made of steel, brass and other metal alloys. Gentlemen wore matching shoe and knee buckles. By 1790 shoe buckles were falling out of use, except as part of ceremonial or court dress.\n\nThis buckle is one of a pair, with Museum no. M.30A-1909. It features bright-cutting \u2013 a method of engraving popular in the late 18th century whereby shallow curved grooves were cut with sides of varying steepness to create facets that give a reflective, sparkling effect.",
