In the late 1960s, sometimes with Nigel Waymouth as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, he created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Weymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. He also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\n5th Dimension was a Leicester psychedelic club in the late 1960s. Many big psych-rock acts played, and although the club no longer exists, the esteemed name has occasionally been revived for psychedelic club nights held in Leicester today.",
