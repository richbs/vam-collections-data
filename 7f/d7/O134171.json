London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 123, cat. no. 138\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nManner of German School, 15th century\n\n138 \nTHE BETRAYAL OF CHRIST \nreverse: THE AGONY IN THE GARDEN \nThin pine panel \n12 7/8 x 7 \u00bd (32.7 x 19) \n530-1870\n\nThis painting and its companion (see no. 139) were acquired as works by Hubert van Eyck (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 178). In 1933 Sir Charles Holmes expressed the view that they were German, 16th century (oral opinion). This is a reasonable attribution: the extensive landscape and the sketchy treatment of the figures in the background could indicate a 16th century date. However, the costume - in particular the very pointed shoes - suggests a slightly earlier origin, perhaps in the late 15th century. The date may reasonably be rendered ca. 1500. These panels show strong Netherlandish influence, particularly that of Dierick Bouts, which is typical of German painting of the period. The place of origin is probably Southern Germany; the closest parallels are Swabian. \nThis description does not apply to the paintings on the backs of these two panels, which are weak in execution and painted without priming straight on to the wood. They appear to be later imitations. \n\nCondition. There are areas of repaint, for example on St Peter's robes. \nProv. John Parsons; bequeathed to the Museum in 1870.",
