These skeins were intended to be used as embroidery threads. Prior to the introduction of aniline dyes into China in the 1860s, dye materials were based on organic materials, mineral or vegetable colours. It is commonly assumed that brightly coloured dyes correspond to new chemical techniques. However this packet of silk skeins from around the 1840s, colour retained intact, demonstrate that organic Chinese dyeing techniques were already producing bright and vibrant colours. Also, despite being closely packed, and skeins coming into contact with each other, colours have remained intact and not transferred.",

They have been kept in their original Chinese packaging, and then wrapped in an English newspaper dating to  the 1840s, giving us a strong date of origin for the objects. It was likely that Catherine Potts catalogued the silks and wrapped them in the newspapers in 1844, and this gives us a strong indication of the approximate date the silks might have been produced.",
