Marietta Pallis, aunt of Adrien Naylor who presented the V&A with the mortar and pestle, was from a Greek family that had settled in Liverpool. Marietta was one of five children, and she studied botany at Newnham College, Cambridge. Following her time at Cambridge she travelled to the Danube Delta to study reeds, then settled in Cheyne Walk, London. Her niece, Adrien Naylor, remembers that the pestle and mortar were kept on the top floor of the house, but has no knowledge of where or how they were acquired by Marietta Pallis. Her aunt, apparently, collected any item of interest, quite indiscriminately (information kindly supplied 28.06.2011 by Mrs Pat Diaper, a friend of Adrien Naylor).",
