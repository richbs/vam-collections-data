They are particularly suitable for the vertical form of a candlestick.\n\nCollecting\nOne fascinating aspect in the history of collecting was the resurgent interest in the 18th century among collectors in the second half of the 19th century. Joseph Bond (died 1886) was typical of those who focused their collecting on one material and a particular period. The Museum was encouraged to formally acquire Bond's collection by the fact that 'the collection consists entirely of English plate dating from 1700 to 1824 and well illustrates the history of English silversmiths' work during that period'. The Bond Collection in the Museum consists of over 50 pieces, predominantly tableware and lighting that range in date from 1731 to 1834.",
