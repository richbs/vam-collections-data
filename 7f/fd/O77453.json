This involves scooping and pouring the powdered tea from the caddy into a ceramic bowl. Hot water is added and the mixture is worked into a viscous suspension with a bamboo whisk. The one bowlful of tea is usually shared by four or five guests. Japanese ceramic tea caddies are small because they are required to hold tea for only one serving.\n\nPlace\nBizen is located near the coast of Japan's Inland Sea a little over 100 kilometres west of Osaka. It has long been known for its deposits of high quality iron-bearing clay. This turns a distinctive reddish brown colour when fired. Natural ash glazing and irregular scorching of the clay surface are achieved by the use of a wood-firing kiln.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis tea caddy was one of over 200 Japanese ceramics bought by the V&A after they had been shown at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in the United States in 1876. Some, like this piece, were old, but the majority were new or nearly new. The collection was assembled by the Japanese with funds sent from Britain.",
