Nicaise dated 11 February 1937. Rackham says that we have two tiles similar in technique to the Brioude tiles which came from the Abbey of Escaladieu in the Pyranees. The Abbey was founded in the 12th century and is in the neighbourhood of a castle occupied by the Counts of Foix. He goes on to say that it has been suggested that the tiles were brought from Italy by Gaston de Foix who died in 1512. Rackham says that their design of very formal foliage and rosettes is crude and hard to date and so just conjectures the 15th century.",
