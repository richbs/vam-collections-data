The embroidery in the main section is incomplete, only the pink and dark blue elements have been worked. There are spaces for other colours.  In the lower left hand corner of the main section only the outline of a motif has been worked.  The edge between the striped lower band and the main section is irregular.  The top and bottom edges have been cut.\n\nThe pattern is a series of dark brown diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  \nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: the ground has not been worked.  There is a geometric meander in dark brown with pink and dark blue details within square blossoms.\n[2] wider stripe in two designs: [a] dark blue wool ground with a downward pointing floral sprig with 2 drooping buds and a large drooping flowerhead alternating with a bracket with a central pink rosette.\n[b] pink silk ground with an unembroidered floral sprig.\nThreads: Wool: red, dark blue, dark brown, yellow; Z-spun; Silk: pink; 2S.",
