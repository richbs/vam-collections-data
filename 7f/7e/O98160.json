            "public_access_description": "This sculpture is an exceptionally rare and early metal image of the Buddha, probably the product of monastic workshops in Bihar, eastern India, and represents the culmination of the development of early Buddhist imagery. The Gupta period marked a watershed in the evolution of the stylistic development of the Buddha-type and in the spread of Indian Buddhist influence. The Gupta period is credited with creating this quintessential Buddha-type, which was subsequently disseminated and emulated throughout the Buddhist world.\n\nThis figure was cast in the late phase of the Gupta era, which produced some of the most emblematic images of the Buddha. Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha (literally, the wise member of the Sakya clan), is represented with his hand raised in abhayamudra, the gesture of allaying fear, underscoring his role as a spiritual protector. This gesture is shared by images of all early faiths in India. The downward cast of the eyes and head are a reminder that the image of the Buddha, no matter what the scale, should be viewed from a lower position \u2013 this Buddha image would have served as a processional icon during the regular cycle of worship performed within a monastery or temple.\n\nThe standing figure is clad in pleated robes drawn over both shoulders in the \u2018northern style\u2019, with his raised right hand with outward palm, the left hand lowered and holding the end of his robe. The hair curls, skull protuberance and webbed fingers are part of the 32 auspicious marks (laksanas) symbolic of his attainment of Buddhahood. The treatment of the body and its translucent form-defining quality has created a figure that embodies both spirituality and sensuality.",
