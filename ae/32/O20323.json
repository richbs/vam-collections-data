The interior is lined with green laid paper (stuck down with adhesive), to which are applied 242 white feldspathic stoneware casts of gems and impressions from gems, each of which is numbered above in ink. The numbers run from 850 to 1099, the sequence of numbering corresponding to that used in the Wedgwood & Bentley catalogues of ornamental productions. The following gems and numbers were omitted from the sequence, though space was allowed for their later inclusion: 856, 968, 1010, 1045, 1082, and the following numbers are included in the sequence, though the gems are now missing: 1054, 1055 and 1086 (the last two numbers being in a later hand). The front top edge of the draw is numbered 129 in ink. Gem number 961 was loose at time of cataloguing and appeared to be of translucent feldspathic stoneware; it is both incised and inscribed in pencil with the number 961. This is one of three such trays, probably from Josiah Wedgwood's personal reference collection, the others being C.112 and C.114-1999.",
