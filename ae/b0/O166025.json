This print, Northern Guernica, relates to the fire-bombing of Dresden by the British air force during the Second World War. The print is based on a post-war photograph of the view from the top of Dresden's City Hall. The brooding figure on the right was one of the few pieces of statuary that escaped destruction. The title is a deliberate reference to a similar incident of atrocity during the Spanish Civil War, a subject immortalised by Picasso's monumental painting Guernica. Torres (born Spain, 1948) believes that art which deals with social or political issues \"serves as a point of departure for reflection on the kind of world we live in.\" (1988)",
