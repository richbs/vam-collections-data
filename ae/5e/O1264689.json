However, how the doll has been used is the main justification for its acquisition. Dempster herself had been an air raid warden during the second world war in Liverpool and had worked with one other woman on a shelter that Dempster oversaw, and the doll was used to comfort children who had been injured, were scared, or had lost family during the Blitz. It remained in the shelter and was used throughout the duration of the Blitz in Liverpool.",
