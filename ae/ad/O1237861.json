This Computer Commandtm type was designed to have an ergonomic grip, a development on the original ball top or bat top style, which would be more comfortable over long periods of game play. They were criticised by left-handed users, however, as they were difficult to use because the main fire button was on the left-hand side of the base. Although Wico steered the market through innovation in the 1980s, the company failed to diversify in modern gaming and foundered by the mid 2000s. Wico joysticks are still revered by collectors, however, and are often used by hobbyists refurbishing arcade machines.",
