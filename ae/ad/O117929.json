The pink appears in a band across the relevant motifs, but nowhere else.  The light orange appears in a band across the relevant motifs and also as the ground of the main border.  There may have been other colours which have faded.  Symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 64 knots per sq. inch (930 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: Lower: incomplete but 3 cms plain weave band with warp loops around a stout weft cord which was placed there to keep the warp threads in order and the form a firm basis against which to beat the pile and weft.  Warp loops form a fringe.  The warp threads have been manipulated slightly to the left in a form of sprang so that 4 threads have been introduced between each natural pair.  This may have been a technique to control tension but it also has the effect of a decorative finish.  Upper: missing but evidence of plainweave.\n\nDESIGN: Field: light brown ground with a central row of 2 large white rosette-like blossoms containing a central star and leaves; the upper rosette has been cut and re-joined.  Between these two are two blue 'stars' with a central quartered diamond, two small rosettes and a central small white rosette.  This central line of 3 rosettes is framed by four white stylised lilies.  This sequence appears below and above the two large blossoms and the entire sequence is off-set on the left and the right hand side of the field.  Between each row is a line of stylised blossoms in dark yellow and blue each containing an 8-pointed star.  NOTE: the width of the field narrows towards the top of the carpet: it measures 102 cms across the lower end but only 98 cms at the upper.  This was probably because the weavers were more confident or more tired and were pulling the weft more tightly.\n\nCut in steps across the upper end - the steps match the borders.  18.5 cms. are missing.",
