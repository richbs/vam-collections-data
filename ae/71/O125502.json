Three of his brothers, George, Edmund and Frederick James, were also artists. Chiefly known as a watercolourist, he travelled in Wales and the Lake District in 1802 and 1803, working with Comelius Varley and Joshua Cristall: founder member of the OWS 1804. Artist on Lord Amherst's embassy to China 1816, resigned, and worked as portrait painter in India and Burma 1817-25. Visited Italy 1828-9. Exhibited 103 works at the RA between 1804 and 1857, 42 at the BI 1806-56, 32 (including five watercolours) at the SBA 1828-53, and 154 at the OWS. Subjects principally landscapes in Wales, Lake District, south and west England, Italy and China. Died Kensington, London, 16 December 1857. Redgrave believed 'his oil pictures show much excellence, and though rather yellow in tone and monotonous, the effect of sun and sunshine is admirably expressed'. There are fourteen watercolours by him in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: Redgrave <i>Diet</i> and <i>Cent</i>; DNB. \n\n<b>Landscape</b> \n1833-1900 Neg HF974 \nPaper on mahogany panel, 21.6 x 29.5 cm (8\u00bd x 11 5/8 ins) \nAshbee Bequest 1900 \n\nThe location has not been identified, and like that of 3-1866 (pl2l) may well have been invented. Havell exhibited what seem to be similar subjects at the RA in 'A Shrine near Gondo, Simplon' (1844) and 'The Roadside Cross, to mark the spot where murder has occurred. - The scenery near Subiaco, Roman States' (1851).\"",
