Both have some openwork decoration, and inset bases. In each case, the base has a different composition from that of the body. The bodies both contain lead, as well as low concentrations of the alloying elements tin and zinc.\n138-1876, the vessel possibly dates to the 13th or 14th century A.D. (R.K.). It is a small openwork object, apparently with a inset base. It can be suggested that it was made in more that one stage, the first of which was casting. Then, it seems that pieces were cut out, since the area of spirals apparently shows a piece that was not completely finished. There is a crack in the body. The handles are very tiny, and are hardly thicker than wire. There looks to be a casting seam by one of the handles, and a small amount of the neck decoration seems to be cast, perhaps by the \u2018lost wax\u2019 method. Most portions of the object were not cut evenly or symmetrically, and the base ring show file marks. Where patina exists, it is dark brown in colour. The bare metal is yellow-brown in colour. \nAnalyses of the body and base plate were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. It was quite clear that the body had a completely different composition from the base plate. The base plate metal had much more zinc in it, and much less tin. There was quite a lot of lead, so it seems that the base was a casting, and it appears likely that it was not the original one. The body metal was predominantly made from copper and lead, with a total of about 5% of alloying components. This composition is related to a number of vases where Sn + Zn = about 5%. The present colour of the bare metal is consistent with the composition. Impurities included nickel, antimony and sliver in the body metal. Nickel and antimony were apparently below the detection limit in the base plate metal.",
