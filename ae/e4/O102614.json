This was painted by the folk artist, Shanti Devi who is from the  Godna school of folk art, in the Madhubani region of Bihar. The style, consisting of simple line drawings, is typical of Madhubani art. \n\nIn the middle of this background, perpendicular with the right edge of the painting, Arpana Caur has painted a figure of a Jain Tirthankara, recognisable by his broad shoulders and elongated ear lobes. This figure is in white and over-painted on this are intertwined green leaves.\n\nThe title of the painting, Prakriti, means nature and/or creative force. This is one of a series of paintings with this title and refers to the creativity of the women who have collaborated in making these paintings and the natural world which is a part of their daily village life and which is depicted in these paintings.\n\nSigned and dated: Arpana '96 in bottom right hand corner.",

This was painted by the folk artist, Shanti Devi who is from the  Godna school of folk art, in the Madhubani region of Bihar. The style, consisting of simple line drawings, is typical of Madhubani art. \n\nIn the middle of this background, perpendicular with the right edge of the painting, Arpana Caur has painted a figure of a Jain Tirthankara, recognisable by his broad shoulders and elongated ear lobes. This figure is in white and over-painted on this are intertwined green leaves.\n\nThe title of the painting, Prakriti, means nature and/or creative force. This is one of a series of paintings with this title and refers to the creativity of the women who have collaborated in making these paintings and the natural world which is a part of their daily village life and which is depicted in these paintings.",
