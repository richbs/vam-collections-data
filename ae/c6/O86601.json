The fisherman sways precariously on his \u201criver bank\u201d when touched, while the comical bird attempts to catch the \u201cfly\u201d when his body is rocked to and fro.\n\nTony Mann was voted \u201cToymaker of the Year\u201d by the British Toymakers\u2019 Guild for both 1987 and 1988. He originally trained as an industrial designer and worked in this field for twenty years in both this country and Canada, (where he emigrated in 1962.) He later set up degree courses at the College of Art and Design in Nova Scotia where he still teaches one term a year. The rest of the year is devoted to toymaking, and , when in England, he is based at Chulmleigh, Devon.",
