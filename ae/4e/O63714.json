            "physical_description": "This damaged stone fragment comprises the top part of a cusped moulding and a badly damaged part of the superstructure on the right hand side of a stepped <i>torana</i> arch. The central portion is carved in high relief.  At the top o f the cusp there is an architectural aedicule with a couple of ringed columns under canopy with a deeply incised flat foliate cresting.  Within this stands a female figure in a <i>tribanga</i> posture.  She wears her hair in a side bun and is ornamented with strings of pearls and a clinging lower garment, while holding the end of a scarf which is twisted round her upper arm in her one remaining hand on the right.\n\nOn either side of this niche there are foreparts of makaras with pearl necklaces, whose noses twist upwards with frilly appendages that curl round a rounded object knotted into a cloth (Is this a cosh-like weapon?). The cusped part of the arch is decorated with a frieze of <i>vidhyadaras</i> (celestial warriors) whose legs are tucked up to denote that they are flying.  Each of the four figures has a bare torso,a clinging garment round his lower body, a scarf, and large round earrings, a pearl necklace and wrist bangles. All are shown wielding swords in their right hands and grasping a stiff folded piece of cloth in their left ones. (Is this a means to deflect sword thrusts or was it a weapon of some kind?).\n\nThe figurative frieze is topped with a half-round moulding decorated with a twist of strung pearls. At the outer edges there are cavetto mouldings with deeply incised curving lines and comma-like motifs denoting flame decoration. The fragment of the segment above this cusped portion has the same decorative beaded and flame mouldings springing above the canopy",

(1815-1884), former Governor of Bombay, in 1877.\n  As John Guy writes in <i>The Peaceful Liberators </i>(see reference below) the high degree of stylistic uniformity suggests that these pieces were collected from a single temple, or at least from sites that were contemporary.
