Publish'd according to Act of Parliament by I &amp; O Westwood.

Dates on bottom of plates 1776 and 1777.   Original stiff boards with paper back.\nE.1467-1493--1907.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--Looking-glasses with gilt frames, furniture roses and ornaments, swags, mouldings and carvings for window architraves, door panels, chimney-piece cornices, \" frizes,\" heraldic figures, mouldings for panel work, chimney pieces, alternative friezes and pilasters therefor.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--The chimney piece designs, two in number, show how the details illustrated in the book would be applied.   Each part has the detail number engraved near it.   It is disclosed tha thte \" single ornaments in the book are engraved full size,\" and that they were sold separately or made up.   \" Their Elegance, Duration, and Cheapness,\" we are told, \" are best recommended by a comparison with other carvings.\"   Their elegance is beyond dispute, as also is their cheapness, for no prices are quoted.   The chimney piece drawings are dimensioned and are to scale.   There are two or three figure carvings, notably an oval, entitled \" Boys' Tablet,\" a bacchanalian <i>motif</i>, and a Vestal Virgin.   Their utility in general schemes is shown in two plates comprising 15 friezes.   The engravings are well executed, and there is much in this catalogue worthy of adaptation to modern needs.   <i>See also</i> M. 61. k., <i>page</i> 24.\"",
