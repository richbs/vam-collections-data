            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThis page has a picture on each side. On one side, Mahavira plucks out his hair in the presence of the God Shakra, in part of his diksha or renunciation of the worldly life and embarkation on his spiritual search as a wandering ascetic. On the other side the illustration is more difficult to identify. It appears to show a Jina and his disciple in discussion with an old, bearded man, but may represent Mahavira giving away his possessions.",
