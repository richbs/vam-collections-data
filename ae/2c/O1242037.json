Potter often took her pet animals on holiday with her and here her rabbit, Peter Piper, is depicted in a domestic scene by the fireside. \n\nPeter Piper was the model for Peter Rabbit. Peter Rabbit was first conceived in September 1893, in a picture letter sent to Noel Moore, son of her former governess who was ill at the time, whilst Potter was on holiday with her family in Scotland.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale",
