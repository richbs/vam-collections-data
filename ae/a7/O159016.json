It is the work of Sir Edwin Landseer. \n\nLandseer was indeed one of the most popular British painters of his day. Landseer was commissioned in 1858 to design the four bronze lions to sit at the four corners of the column. The lions, which were cast by Carlo Marochetti in 1866, and unveiled in January 1867, represent Landseer's first use of bronze. Blackwood recorded that the main section of the Nelson memorial was completed by 1843, with the figure of Nelson being executed by Edward Hodges Baily. He notes that 'the famous lions took a full sixty-two years to assume guard. The first sculptor commissioned, John Lough, failed to provide any. Thomas Milnes' lions were so lacking in spirit that they were rejected. Finally on the strength of his skill as a painter of animals, Sir Edwin Landseer was brought in'.",
