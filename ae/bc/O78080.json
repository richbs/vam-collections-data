This character was one of several that were considered auspicious and were frequently incorporated into designs on ceramics and other artefacts. The style of decoration would have appealed to a Victorian audience interested in the 'exotic' East. Commonly known as 'Chinese blue-and-white', vases like this were used to decorate the interiors of many British homes in the 19th century.\n\nChinese blue-and-white porcelain had been imported into Britain since the 16th century. Although by the 1870s it was no longer regarded as rare, it continued to feature prominently in interior design. Rooms were filled with blue and white porcelain of different shapes and sizes to create a sumptuous effect. Older pieces were displayed alongside newer products.",
