The first couple of shoots of weft are chained around the warp threads.  There is 1\" (2.5 cms) of plainweave with the same thread as the warp, then a line of weft wrapping in red and green.  Upper: missing but with evidence of plainweave with the same thread as the warp.\nDESIGN: There are several bands of supplementary weft patterning with reciprocating floats.  There is evidence of two weavers working side-by-side: along the upper end the band of blue/yellow changes design mid-way. White ground which extends to the sides; a line of 3 connected dark brown diamonds, within the lower one is a deeply serrated green hexagon containing a yellow diamond and within that is a blue motif with a white abrred column.  The 2nd is the same design in blue, red, green and yellow; the 3rd is the same design in yellow, blue, red and green.  In all three are narrow bands of supplementary weft patterning and white and brown crosses. Parallel with the sides of the diamonds are diagonal barred bands in yellow and green.\nInner border (sides only): red barred line which intrudes between the diamonds.\nOuter border (sides only): blue line with bars extending inwards.\n Lower band: 12 bands: dark brown/red/dark brown/yellow/green/red/green/yellow/blue/yellow/dark brown/brown and white mixed.\nUpper band: 10 bands: dark brown and white mixed/yellow/blue/red/green/yellow/blue with supplementary weft patterning/yellow/dark brown/red.\n\nCatalogue Date: 26.11.97",

This is a weft-faced plain weave in which the weft passes over and under alternate warp threads and conceals the warp.  Unlike pile carpets, the weaver works from the back of the fabric and the weft does not pass continuously from side-to-side but is worked backwards and forwards in small areas to create the blocks of colour required by the design. In its simplest form this produces a vertical slit between the differently coloured areas and these make kelims vulnerable to wear, By using a design based on diagonal lines, the weavers are able to aovid large slits. Each block of colour in this kelim has been outlined with two threads of a contrasting colour which sharpens the pattern but would have increased the weaver's work.",
