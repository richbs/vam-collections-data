This liquid was very effective as a textile dye, which he patented, and set up a factory to produce at Greenford in Middlesex in 1857.  The new shade was called mauve, from the French word for the mallow plant which has purple/ mauve flowers. Queen Victoria seems to have boosted its popularity by appearing in a mauve dress in 1862.",
