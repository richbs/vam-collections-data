They were filled with pot-pourri (perfumed or sweet-smelling leaves) similar to those used to sweeten the air today. Perfume vases of this design are recorded as being sold singly, but were also made in pairs.\n\nTrading\nThree vases of this kind were among the stock of Chelsea porcelain sold at a London auction in 1770. One, possibly this vase, was described as 'one large pot pourie vase and cover; on a pedestal, mazarine blue and gold, decorated with Cupids and garlands of flowers. This reached \u00a313 15s, while those with crimson grounds fetched only \u00a38 and \u00a37 17s. Another vase of this design was probably included in an auction of 1771. According to the marked-up copy of the catalogue, this fetched the remarkable sum of \u00a363.\n\nPeople\nThis vase, which has panels painted with children representing the Elements, is believed to have been one of a pair owned by George IV. He is said to have given the companion vase, painted with children representing the Seasons, to John Bridge of Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, the London firm of goldsmiths.",
