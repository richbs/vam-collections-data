The victory was the Battle of Culloden Moor near Inverness in northern Scotland on 16 April 1746. It has been suggested that this bust represents a man older than 25, the age of the Duke of Cumberland in 1746. However, comparisons with contemporary commemorative medals show him with similar features.\n\nWilliam Augustus, Duke of Cumberland (1721-1765) was third son of George II and Caroline of Ansbach. He was created Duke of Cumberland in 1726. He became known as a formidable and ruthless military commander ('Butcher' Cumberland). He fought in Flanders and later, back in Britain, he defeated the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. He commissioned a series of pictures that combined his artistic and military interests. \n\nSir Henry Cheere (1703-1781) was one of the most successful sculptors in  mid-18th-century Britain, and unlike some of his more eminent sculptor contemporaries, such as John Michael Rysbrack and Louis Fran\u2021ois Roubiliac, he was a native of this country. He specialised in portrait busts and tomb sculpture, and in the latter was particularly adept in the use of coloured marbles. He also employed a light, and yet at the same time highly-finished, style that was typical of the Rococo.",
