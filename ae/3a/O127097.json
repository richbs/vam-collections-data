His understanding of antique sculpture, derived from his study of ancient Roman sculpture in Italy, is evident in many of his works. He was appointed Statuary to His Majesty George III in 1761, and in 1768 became a founder member of the Royal Academy. However in the same year he inherited a large legacy from his father and neglected sculpture thereafter; he went bankrupt in 1793.",
