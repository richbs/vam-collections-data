Xing and Ding wares were of the earliest true porcelains made in China, and the world. The term porcelain is applied to ceramics made from a  mixture containing a of clay called kaolin and a white stone called petuntse, which was fired at high temperatures.   Porcelains differ from other ceramics in their impermeability, their whiteness and fine texture.\n\nXing and Ding wares were both made in kilns in the Hebei province of China during the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Although they look very similar, subtle differences in the glaze and the body of these dishes can link them to the wares produced in their respective places of origin, the cities of Xing yao and Ding yao.",
