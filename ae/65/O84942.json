            "public_access_description": "This jar is among the last lustre ceramics made in Syria. During the period 1300-1400, lustre production became concentrated in Spain, and large amounts of blue-and-white porcelain were shipped from China. Caught between the two, Syrian lustre production ceased.\n\nThe technique of lustre decoration on ceramics was first developed in Iraq in the 9th century. A glazed vessel or tile with little or no decoration was made in the normal way. When the piece had cooled, a design was painted over the glaze in metallic compounds. The pot or tile was then fired again, this time with a restricted supply of oxygen. In these conditions, the metallic compounds broke down, and a thin deposit of copper or silver was left on the surface of the glaze. When polished, this surface layer reflected the light.\n\nLustre continued to be made for many centuries, but the centre of production moved to Egypt and then to Syria and Iran.",
