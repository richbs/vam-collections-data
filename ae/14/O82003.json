The year 1619 was the year in which he resigned his fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and joined Viscount Doncaster's mission to Frederick, Elector Palatine in Heidelberg.  There he became a firm advocate of the Protestant forward policy pursued by Frederick, and on his return to England in September he was knighted and appointed English agent to the Princes of the Protestant Union in Europe.  At the same time he succeeded to the politically secretaryship to Elizabeth of Bohemia with a substantial salary from James I, but he did not rejoin her until she and Frederick had left Heidelberg to take up the crown of Bohemia in Prague in the summer of 1620.  The present portrait evidently marks Nethersole's sudden rise to eminence in 1619 and could have been painted either London or Heidelberg: in Oliver's output about this time, the presence of the Bohemians or of those associated with them suggests that he might have been quite regularly attached to the Princess and therefore in Heidelberg in 1619. \n \nAnother possibly portrait, by an unknown artist, was with the Sabin Galleries in 1969: a half-length seated figure, at a table with pen and ink, writing on folded sheets of paper.  Dated on costume to c.1614, the portrait - if it was of Nethersole - would show him as a scholar, as an aspirant courtier, the recent author of a funeral oration for Prince Henry, <i>Memoriae Sacra Illustriss\u2026Henrici Walliae Princips\u2026laudation funebris</i> (Cambridge, 1612).\"",
