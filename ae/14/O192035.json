The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nAt the Volkskammerwahl (Public Chamber election) the Green Party ran for office in an alliance with the Independent Women's Union. The poster therefore addresses the possibility for a woman to become Prime Minister stating: 'Warum gr\u00fcn w\u00e4hlen - Damit der Herr Minister eine Frau wird', which means 'why vote green - so that Mister Minister will be a woman.'\n\nThe Green Party was founded in November 1989 out of the GDR green movement. Politically the party was close to the different alliances of the Citizen's movement. In 1993 the Green Party merged with the party B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen ('Alliance 90/The Greens').",
