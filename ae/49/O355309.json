Treadsole:  Straight. Stitching cord remains. Stitching pattern of  a V leading to an oval leading to a teardrop shape.  Midsole: of cork/papyrus (?) Layers stitched  together in centre of sole with some cord remaining.  Insole: layer missing. Vamp: Forepart to centre has  horizontal incised lines. Appears to have been a V  shaped row of applied leather coverd in gold leaf.  Central and instep decoration of lines of square,  openwork exposing white (?) leather and stitching;   appears to be two lines of stitching of interlaced  waves with cutout central dots. The dots would  have exposed gold leaf (?); with lines of openwork  and stitching either side. Lines create a V shape to  point of instep (high throat). Instep is probably  finished with a row of applied leather and gold leaf -  now missing.\n\nCoptic footwear was generally made of leather, primarily using the turned technique to produce a slipper or shoe with a straight sole. Slippers often included a rand at the vamp and a fibre padded sole sewn together with prominent stitching or insole tab. They show variation in the form and height of the instep. Shoes were generally slip-ons and also show variation in the form and height of the instep. Footwear was highly decorated in geometric and floral designs. Often a variety of techniques were used in combination with the most popular being dyeing, gilding, openwork and appliqu\u00e9.",
