            "public_access_description": "Constable usually made studies directly from nature for his large oil paintings, and this study of ash trees may be an example of his working method: the foremost tree, with a dead branch hanging against its trunk, appears to be the same as that in the right foreground of a painting owned by Tate Britain, The Valley Farm.  However, the sketch's resemblance to studies of ash trees at Hampstead may suggest that this is an independent drawing, done after the completion of the painting.",

See note to No. 375 [1249-1888] for a fuller discussion of the relationship between the foremost tree in this study from nature and \u2018The Valley Farm\u2019.  The drawing is placed in this position in the catalogue because it has close affinities with Constable\u2019s other detailed drawings of trees in the collection; compare, for instance, the undetailed treatment of the background with that in No. 161 [256-1888].  But, for the reason given in the note to No. 376 [1248-1888], there is a slight possibility that No. 375 [1249-1888] as well as No. 376 [1248-1888] may have been drawn from a tree at Hampstead.  If that were so, No. 163 [252-1888] would probably not have been drawn before 1819, when Constable first stayed at Hampstead.\nAnne Anderson, Tim Craven, Della Hooke.
