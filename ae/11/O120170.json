The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.  They represented a wide variety of subjects; those of actors and actresses were especially popular.\n\nThis represents the English actor George Rignold (1838-1912) as Henry V. Born in Leicester, George Rignold played the role in America and Australia before coming to London and sub-leasing Drury Lane Theatre which had been unoccupied for nine months.  He re-opened it on 1 November 1879 with a spectacular version of Henry V which had originally been adapted for the stage in Manchester by George Calvert. Featuring a huge cast and a real horse, magnificent costumes and new scenery, it was described by one contemporary critic as 'little more than a series of pictorial tableaux' but nevertheless attracted large audiences to Drury Lane Theatre for two months before the start of the pantomime season.",
