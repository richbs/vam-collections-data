Inner sides: one cord overcast with red weft.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: 3.5 cms. plain weave with cream weft, and some red, turned and stitched in place.  Upper: missing.\n\nDESIGN: Described as it would have been used: Field: red ground with two bands of three identical guls with stars in between.\n\nPendant flaps: the outer ones have diamonds, some have a white field.  The left one has diamonds and triangles in addition but the right one has only triangles.  Both outer flaps were probably woven separately which accounts for differences in the patterns.\n\nCentral flap: larger, white ground diamonds.\n\nDate catalogued: 21.6.94\n\n\n.",
