On this kashkul they include a poem in Persian lauding the kashkul in mystical terms.\n\nMany kashkuls are carved from half the shell of a huge nut - the fruit of the coco de mer palm. The tree grows in the Seychelle Islands, in the Indian Ocean, and the shell washes ashore in southern Iran. This took on spiritual significance as a symbol of the dervish\u2019s journey on the ocean of mystic knowledge. The shape of the coco de mer nut was copied in steel kaskhuls like this one.",
