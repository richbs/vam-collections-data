It was made between 1500 and 1600 in Florence at a time when Italian copperwares were often covered with decoration. Copper was as easy to work as silver and metalworkers used similar sophisticated decorative techniques for the two metals. Here the maker has used different types of punches and a special hammer to model the surface with chased decoration. The pierced decoration would have made the warming pan even more efficient.\n\nBy about 1650 warming pans were common household objects. They were used to warm the bed but they were not left in it. Just before the master or mistress retired, a servant would fill the warming pan with hot coals from the fire and, using a long pole, swiftly stroke the sheets with it. Some dexterity was needed to avoid scorching the linen.",
