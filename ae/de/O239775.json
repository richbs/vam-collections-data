            "public_access_description": "Designs (5) for embroidery, dated 1850 and 1854, by Sarah Bland (1810-1905).  The pattern at the top is annotated with the inscription 'Coral Pattern; Scarlet Braid on Muslin' for embroidery on a woman's gown. The inscription records that it was done in 'London' in '1850'.  Beneath this pattern is a single design is for an embroidered penwiper. Three of the designs which are arranged beneath the coral one are continous patterns for scalloped borders for the embroidered hems for women's garments. According to the inscription, they were made in 'Cheltenham' in 'September.1854''. Bland eventually settled in Cheltenham where she died in the early twentieth century. \n\nThese designs were probably traced from commercially available patterns from a magazine such as The Lady's Newspaper.  These designs are in an album which includes Bland's collection of  her own botanically accurate designs, simplified patterns from accurate botanical observation, patterns traced from magazines, commercial, printed Berlin wool work patterns, gifts of patterns, including commercial ones from friends and relatives. The designs include those for petit-point, bead-work, decoration for dresses, collars and cuffs, aprons, slippers, tablecloths and covers, cushions, bags, penwipers, initial letters, alphabets etc. In Bland's case, the gift of designs demonstrates connections between relatives of merchant and banking families and is of historical significance in bonding such families.",

Women's amateur as opposed to professional designs for embroidery raise problems because amateur work has tended to be regarded as less significant. Embroidery was a pastime but was also an economic activity. Upper middle class women's property was closely linked to their status within the family as daughters, wives and widows and only allowed semi-independence. This semi-independence was underpinned by legal, political, and social practices which subordinated them. Nevertheless, it was combined with recognition of their economic worth within the family enterprise. However, women were restricted as they often could not be openly involved in working for money. See L. Davidoff and C. Hall (Reference Tab). Bland could not be seen to be working but it is likely that she embroidered accessories for dress, penwipers, tablecloths, book covers, and cushions as gifts which were her contribution to the household, wider family, and friendship. The quality of her samplers and designs shows the value of such gifts in terms of relationships with family and friends.\n\nMaterial about the perceptions of a woman's role is pertinent to the discourse on women and therefore gender history. In Bland's case, the gift of designs demonstrates connections between relatives of merchant and banking families and is of historical significance in bonding between such families.",
