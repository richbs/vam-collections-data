            "public_access_description": "This ivory medallion in relief, representing Charles Marbury (dates unknown), is made by David Le Marchand in ca. 1700-1720 in Britain. Little is known about the sitter, although it is likely he was a member of the Rose and Crown Club, which was a social group of gentlemen with antiquarian interests. \nDavid Le Marchand (1674-1726) was famed for his ivory carvings, particularly his portraits. He was a native of Dieppe, France, and came from a Huguenot, or Protestant, family. With the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and the consequent persecution of non-Catholics, he had to flee France. He was next recorded in Edinburgh in 1696, where he is documented as receiving official permission to open a shop and take on apprentices. He was in London by 1700, when he started to achieve a reputation for his portraits. Despite his wide circle of important patrons and his evident success, Le Marchand apparently died in poverty, though the exact reasons for this are unknown.\nHe is recognised as the most distinguished ivory carver to have worked in England in the early 18th century, a period when the art enjoyed a popularity unknown since the Middle Ages.",
