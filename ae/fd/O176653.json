The high waisted bodice has been cut from the lower edge of the original length of floral lace fabric (which is more densely patterned than the upper part), and the waist front and skirt edge therefore show the original scalloped edge finish of the fabric.  The skirt is gathered to the bodice, and is trimmed to the true left of the waist with a multi-looped and streamered bow of ivory coloured satin baby ribbon; the garment fastens at the back of the bodice with three pearl buttons and stitched loops.\n[Christening undergown] The ivory coloured silk under-gown has a round drawstring neck and short magyar sleeves with drawstring hems; the skirt is lightly gathered to the high waisted bodice and finished with a plain hem.\n[Christening bonnet] The bonnet is made of the same lace fabric as the gown, and lined with ivory habutai silk gathered into a small circular crown at the back of the head.  The front edge is trimmed with two rows of lace frill, and two double rows of pleated white net.  The bonnet fastens with tying strings of ivory coloured satin ribbon falling from beneath rosettes of ivory coloured satin baby ribbon.",
