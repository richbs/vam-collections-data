This woodcut has been coloured using a stencil. The artist would have placed the stencil on the surface to be painted and brushed the colour over it. A different stencil, cut to the required shape, would have been needed for each colour.",

London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"ANONYMOUS\nThe HAPPY MARRIAGE, c. 1700.\nLettered with the title, various texts and <i>Printed and Sold at No. 4 Aldermary Church Yard Bow Lane, London,</i> and <i>(No. 144)\n</i>49.6 X 61.6cm\nWoodcut with stencil colouring \nE.300-1986\n\nIn colour woodblock printing, where the inked pattern is stamped down onto the paper or the paper is laid across the relief surface and rubbed from the back, there tends to be a build-up of colour along the edges of each coloured area.  This has not happened in this print but the poor registration, particularly that of the blue pigment in relation to the lines of the design, indicates that this print was not coloured freehand as are all the other prints to follow.  Instead the colours were brushed onto the paper through a pierced stencil.  Stencil colouring, a half-way house between hand-colouring and colour printing, has often been employed by publishers intent on mass production of such goods as playing cards, wallpapers and nineteenth century toy theatres. \nThe central portion of this print is similar to an anonymous English engraving of the same date. <sup>1</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup>Aileen Ribeiro, <i>A Visual History of Costume, The Eighteenth Century</i>, London 1983 illustration.\"",
