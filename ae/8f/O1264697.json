For the exhibition, the museum has sought to build up a strong collection of military toy vehicles, figures and weapons from key manufacturers and also toys which have mirrored significant aspects of warfare over time.\nThe real corporal missile was designed as a tactical nuclear missile for use in the event of Cold War hostilities in Eastern Europe.  First developed in the USA, the technology was quickly sold to the British. The Corgi Corporal was marketed to children as 'the rocket you can launch'. It was timed to coincide with the British test firing in 1959 and its production as a toy shows a continued public fascination and appetite for nuclear technology. It has been selected to be shown in the \u2018On the Battlefield\u2019 section of the exhibition which takes a chronological view of how real warfare, both in technology and strategic aims, has been reflected in the war toys that were made at that time.\nCorgi toys, a trade name of the Mettoy toy company, were hugely popular in the late 1950s and 1960s, producing scale models of high profile vehicles, both real and from films.  This example was selected for acquisition because it is in good boxed condition with its nose cone (which could be fitted with caps to explode on contact with the ground) and its operational leaflets.",
