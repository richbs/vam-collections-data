The exhibition captures Tobe Pottery\u2019s artistry in the best possible way. \n\nTobe Pottery has been discreetly, yet unmistakably alluring to a range of people - Bernard Leach and Muneyoshi Yanagi (a leader of Japanese Folk Crafts Movement) contributed to Tobe\u2019s design revolution in the 1950s. Craft masters and \u2018Living National Treasures\u2019 such as Kenkichi Tomimoto helped Tobe Pottery to flourish in the following decades. In 1989-90, Tobe Pottery impressed Herm\u00e8s of Paris so much that they sent Edith Touati, head of International Marketing, to visit Tobe for further research and inspiration.\n\nMore than 200 artworks in the Exhibition, specially selected and brought from Japan, vary in shapes and size - from small sake cups to large pieces. The main exhibits are works by Masters of Traditional Crafts (the Dentou Kougei Shi) and works from the Baizan Studio, one of the most important studios in Tobe, as well as selected contemporary works by up and coming artists. \n\nAlthough the very beginning of Tobe Pottery\u2019s history goes back to the 6th century, it was Yasutoki Kato, a Lord of Tobe who succeeded in the establishment of this particular form of art in the 18th century. The Exhibition presents a slice of history with pieces from the early 19th century excavated from the ruins of disused kilns, and includes a famous 1951 stoneware panel by Bernard Leach.\n\nTobe Pottery is blessed with indigo blue GOSU (cobalt ore containing traces of manganese) patterns over the melting warmth of the milky white surface. Its thicker texture, unusual for ordinary porcelain, is relative to its strength. \n\nThe Exhibition encourages all visitors to touch and feel the pieces. Tobe Pottery is often seen on everyday dinner tables especially in southern Japan. This Exhibition focuses not only on refined traditions and blossoming contemporary works but also Tobe\u2019s practical and affordable nature. \n\nThe Mayor of Tobe and Director of the Committee for the Exhibition will fly to London to open this two week Event. TE, TOBE YAKI - the Tobe Japanese Pottery Exhibition will unwrap a new view of Japanese pottery to that traditionally presented so far in the UK. \n\n\nhttp://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/japanuk150/events/art/Tobeyaki.html\n\n3Bedfordbury Gallery\nOpening times:\n9.30am - 6pm\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAddress:\n3 Bedfordbury\nCovent Garden\nLondon WC2n 4BP\nUnited Kingdom\nwww.3bedfordbury.com",
