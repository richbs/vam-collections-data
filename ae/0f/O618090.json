Both panels are in the V&A (W.12-1944 and W.13.1944) and their date of c.1718 can be relied upon to date this drawing. \n\nAn inscription on the back of the drawing identifies the figures as allegories. Above are figures representing Clemency, Prudence and Justice supporting the royal arms (in this case, those of Hanover). Below are gathered figures representing the Roman goddess Minerva (patron of learning and the arts) to the left, and the Roman god Mercury (messenger of the gods, personifying eloquence and reason) to the right, with a group of seated women representing Liberty, Discretion and History. In the centre is a figure representing Heroic Poetry (holding up a scroll). \nThere are minor variations between the preparatory drawing and the finished panel such as the addition in the latter of putti figures and a female allegorical figure supporting the unicorn. The rectangular format of the drawing also differs slightly from the squarer format of the panel. However, the close similarity between both works of the colour palette and main figures suggest that the drawing may have acted as a presentation work.\n\nCoaches were a highly important emblem of the wealth and power of monarchs and in this case George I, who succeeded to the throne in 1714, took the opportunity to add a strong statement about his intentions as king after an initial period of turbulence at the beginning of his reign. \n\nThornhill was appointed History Painter to George I in 1718 and Sergeant Painter (a more lucrative post) in 1720. He turned his decorative talents to ceilings, including the painted hall at Greenwich and the dome of St Paul\u2019s cathedral, walls and theatrical scenery, as well as to coach panels.",
