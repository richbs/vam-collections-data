It held the water through which the smoke was drawn in order to cool it using a long flexible tube connected to a container through two holes. They are also known as a hookah, huqqa, qalian, qalyan, qaliyan, narghile, shisha, and a hubble-bubble.\n\nThe decoration combines two types of ornament and aesthetics. The blue-and-white decoration was inspired by Chinese models, which had been popular in Iran since the 14th century. Production rose sharply in the 17th century, when Chinese wares were temporarily unavailable. The red- and green coloured slip represents an Islamic technique and design, completely non-Chinese in inspiration. The deer painted in red unites the two styles.",
