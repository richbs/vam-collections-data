It was a style characterised by a strong reliance on typographic elements and the use of sans serif typeface. In his posters, Hofmann uses restricted colours and forms and approaches typography as an integral part of the overall design expression - not just a means of transmitting literal information. Hofmann became well known for his work for cultural institutions in Basel and his style became synonymous with the institutions it was used to promote.",
