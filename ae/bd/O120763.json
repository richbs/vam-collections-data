            "physical_description": "Caucasus woollen carpet made of knotted tent bands. Seven strips have been coarsely sewn together to form a cover. The ground of each band is striped in red on buff with decorative motifs at intervals. Theses are small men, birds, hooked lozenges and dogs. The bands are coarsely knotted with Turkish knots on groups of nine warp threads and double-cloth ground. The colouring is varied, but mainly in red, blue, pink, green and yellow\n\nTent bands or bands for securing a load on a pack animal, joined together. 7 lengths from at least two bands have been joined together. (1) has a red stripe at the sides. (2) has a red and a white stripe at the sides. The widths vary from 12.5 cm to 15 cm and are sewn together with double strand of red cotton; Z2S.\n\nWARP: (1) cream and red wool; Z2S; 20 red threads in one stripe and 22 in the other; 60 threads per inch (240 per dm). (2) cream and red wool; Z2S; 24 red threads in one stripe and 26 in the other; 48 threads per inch (194 per dm).\n\nWEFT: (1)  cream wool; Z2S; in piled areas there are 2 shoots after each row of knots; 7 knots per inch (30 per dm); in plain weave areas there are 15 threads per inch (60 per dm). (2) cream wool; Z2S; in piled areas there are 2 shoots after each row of knots; 7 knots per inch (30 per dm); in plain weave areas there are 16 threads per inch (62 per dm).\n\nPILE: (1)  wool; 12 colours: dark red, red, dark yellow, dark green, green, dark blue, blue, light blue, purple, dark brown, brown, white; symmetrical knot tied around 7 threads; 210 knots per sq. inch (3600 per sq. dm).\n\n(2) wool; 9 colours: dark red, red, dark yellow, yellow, dark green, dark blue, blue, dark brown, white; symmetrical knot tied around 7 threads; 168 knots per sq. inch (2910 per sq. dm).\n\nNB. The widths have been assembled so that the pile goes in opposite directions on alternate widths.\n\nSIDE FINISH: returned weft.\n\nEND FINISH: cut except for one width where there is a fringe of warp loops 7 cm long, twisted in groups of three.\n\nDESIGN: each band contains a variety of geometric motifs - guls, hooked lozenges, stylised flowers, people and animals. The animal forms are on the widths with the red stripe and the floral sprigs are on the widths with red and white stripes. Each band of motifs is separated from the next by a series of solid colour or 'dotted' knot bands.",
