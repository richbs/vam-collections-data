English examples were developed in the mid 18th century when the Chinese tea bottle was superseded by the tea caddy, having an opening large enough to accommodate a small spoon to dispense and measure the tea and when the cover (the thimble top) was no longer used as a measure.  Caddy spoons were always required to be hallmarked, being excluded from the exemption of the English act of 1790 relating to small articles.",
