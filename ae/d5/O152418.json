Angular brackets are attached to the 2 long sides of the hexagon.\nThe red indented octagon is in the centre of the cover; above and below are horizontal versions of motif [2] and then partial red octagons. To either side of this central row are light blue indented octagons alternating with vertical versions of [2].  Along either side are partial repeats of the central row.\nThe border has a blue ground with linked alternating motifs: elongated cartouche in light blue or yellow and roundel with a pale ground.
