Drawing for\na photogravure frontispiece to Vol. I of Sir \nThomas Malory\u2019s <i>Le Morte D\u2019Arthur</i>, \npublished by J. M. Dent & Co, London,  \n1893-4 \nSigned within the design <i>Aubrey Beardsley</i> \nand with the artist\u2019s emblem, and dated \n<i>March 8 1893</i> \nPen and ink and wash. 37.8 x 27.1 cm \nVAM E.289-1972 \n \nThis is an elaborate drawing in the hair-line \nmanner, and, as Brian Reade notes, \u2018there is a \nstrange profusion of what amounts to  \nautomatic drawing in the details that decorate \nevery part of the landscape: these include a  \ntreble clef, a signature, a spider\u2019s web, a  \nphallus and calligraphic flourishes in the \nmanner of the seventeenth-century writing \nmasters\u2026The lines defining King Arthur\u2019s  \ngarment imitate the gougings of the burin \non the copperplate reproduced in the lines of a \nfifteenth century engraving\u2019. \n \nBeardsley was one of the first artists to make  \ndrawings specifically for reproduction by \nphoto-mechanical processes. He realized that \nthe printing process could enhance the quality \nof the drawing, the velvety tones of photo- \ngravure, for example, bringing out the best \nqualities in his wash drawings, and the \nsharpness of line-block giving precision to his \nline drawings.\n(B.
