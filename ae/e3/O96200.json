Probably produced in series, sets of such gamepieces comprised of perhaps thirty-two pieces, which have subsequently been split up, and in part lost. It is likely that they were made in Augsburg in the mid-sixteenth century, copied from slightly earlier medals by Freidrich Hagenauer and others. Emminent personages such as Charles V or his brother Ferdinand are usually portrayed on this type of gamespiece",
