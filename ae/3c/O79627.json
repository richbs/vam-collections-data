This allowed a group of women to embroider individual panels at the same time. If required, the hanging could be dismantled at a later stage and the panels re-used.\n\nHistorical Associations\nSurviving embroideries can rarely be identified as having been owned or worked by royalty. Unfortunately for the doomed Mary, Queen of Scots, she had plenty of time while imprisoned to work on numerous  embroideries, some of which include her initials or cipher. This activity must have both filled her time and occupied her mind as many of the emblems or mottoes used have more significance than is immediately apparent.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nMary's personal  cipher is not included but her  identity would have been clear to the recipient. Her emblem of  the marigold turning towards the sun and a dog, symbolising a faithful friend are seen with the  royal arms of Scotland surrounded  by the Order of the Thistle.\n\nA 1586 Inventory of Mary's belongings lists:  ' a square of  petit point, with a single emblem in the middle and others around  (it) with the arms of France, Scotland, Spain and England ', which may well be this panel.",
