ISBN 1851770712.\n\u2018Exotica\u2019 was first displayed in \u2018Stockholmsutst\u00e4llningen\u2019, the major exhibition of art and industry, Stockholm, 1930 and the following year in the London showing of part of the same exhibition at Dorland House, Regent street, from which examples were acquired by Queen Mary. Percy trained as a painter in Stockholm and then lived in Paris and the South of France, experiences which proved influential. His work was distinctively southern or Mediterranean in its affection for lush colouring, such images and ripe curves. He joined Gefle porcelain factory in 1923 and in 1925 was awarded a dipl\u00f4me d\u2019honneur at the international exhibition in Paris. In 1928 he produced decorative panels for the liner <i>M/S Kungsholm</i> in which semi-classical figures in Botticellian style were shown in a landscape filled with palm trees and other exotic plants. This theme was continued by him into his designs for ceramics, at times formed and decorated to the point of extravagance. Model Q was Percy\u2019s first dinner ware shape and its engraved copper-plate printing illustrates lush jungle peopled with leopards, crocodiles and natives.",
