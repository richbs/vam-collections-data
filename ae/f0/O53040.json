It was probably made in the 1750s, when such chairs were the height of fashion.  Of additional interest is the matching drawing, by the chair's designer, Matthias Lock.\n\nPeople\nMatthias Lock, as well as designing and making his own furniture,  probably also supplied some of the furniture designs for the first edition of Thomas Chippendale's The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director, published in 1754. We do not know the client for whom he designed this chair.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe chair was probably made for domestic use, as it is similar to contemporary chairs made for that purpose.  It does not appear to have been made as a special sitters' chair for a painter's studio. Cosway probably bought it secondhand in the 1770s. It appears in three portraits he painted, notably that of Elizabeth Draper (1744-1778) in about 1777.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe chair has been covered in modern silk damask, copying the upholstery which is visible in Draper portrait. The stuffing gives rounded profiles to the seat, back and arms.",
