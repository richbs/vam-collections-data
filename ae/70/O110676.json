They could be rough or detailed, large or small, and were made in clay, terracotta, wood and wax. Smith submitted this model for the competition for a commemorative statue of William Beckford. Other London sculptors, including Agostino Carlini and John Flaxman, also submitted models, but John Francis Moore had in fact already been selected.\n\nThe subject William Beckford was baptised in Jamaica in 1709. He was the grandson of Peter Beckford (bap. 1643, d. 1710) who travelled to Jamaica as a young man and became the founder of the greatest sugar fortune in the West Indies. His son, Peter Beckford, William\u2019s father, was also a sugar planter, as well as speaker of the Jamaica house of assembly and comptroller of customs.",

            "historical_context_note": "William Beckford was baptised in Jamaica in 1709. He was the grandson of Peter Beckford (bap. 1643, d. 1710) who travelled to Jamaica as a young man and became the founder of the greatest sugar fortune in the West Indies. His son, Peter Beckford, William\u2019s father, was also a sugar planter, as well as speaker of the Jamaica house of assembly and comptroller of customs.\n\nWilliam was schooled in England but returned to Jamaica after the sudden death of his father in 1735. Two years later the death of his brother Peter, the principal heir, left William with the majority of his family\u2019s vast Jamaican estates, which included complete ownership of eleven sugar plantations and at least 1737 slaves. By the time of his death this had been extended to thirteen sugar plantations and approximately 3000 slaves. During the nearly ten years he was resident on the island he was largely preoccupied with the management of his estate: purchasing land, slaves, equipment, and supplies: lending money to planters and engaging in trade and shipping.\n\nIn 1744 William returned to England and within three years had entered parliament. He served as Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury from 1747 to 1754 and MP for London from 1754 until his death in 1770. He also served twice as Lord Mayor and his mayoralty was notable for its luxurious character. His mayoral banquets were renowned for their extravagance: one banquet alone was said to have cost him \u00a310,000.\n\nDuring his political career in England, William was leader of an influential group of MPs who were absentee proprietors from the West Indies. Unpopular with the public for their identification with slavery, \u2018nouveau-riche\u2019 status and habits of conspicuous consumption, the \u2018West Indies lobby\u2019 used their political influence to resolve debates in their favour, particularly when involving issues such as the military defence of the colonies, trade and shipping and public and private finance.\n\nAs an individual whose personal wealth depended on the labour of enslaved Africans, it is no small irony that William\u2019s political profile was founded on his defence of the City of London\u2019s liberties. He delivered a remonstrance drawn up by the Court of Common Council to King George III, asking him to dissolve Parliament and dismiss his ministers. He also made a speech directly to the King asserting the loyalty of the citizens of London to the Crown and the Constitution. After William\u2019s death his supporters showed their respect by voting a statue in his memory to be placed in the Guildhall; it represented him in his robes of office, delivering his speech to the king, which was inscribed on the pedestal in letters of gold. This statuette by Nathaniel Smith was one of those proposed as the design for the commemorative statue. In fact, one by John Francis Moore had already been selected.\n\n[Notes prepared for 'Uncomfortable Truths / Traces of the Trade' gallery trails (Trail 3: 'Britain & The West Indies'), 20 February - 31 December 2007.
