The design is of typical crewelwork leaves from meandering branches, with different fillings; no birds or animals, and only a very small mound at the base of the curtains from which the branches are growing.\n[Hanging] note on register from P G Trendell 4.10.1930 : Embroidered in long and short, split, chain and satin stitch, laid and couched work.\n[Hanging] Ground - linen and cotton twill, with a distinct nap in places. Four vertical seams, and some piecing.Green wool braid along bottom and both sides. Fully lined in plain woven linen. Underdrawing in ink, now brown, visible in some places.\nInscriptions in ink, now brown, on both top corners : top left, \"1713/1714 [illegible smudge] 4 1713 [struck through]\"; top right, \"jan 4 : 1713/1714\".\n[Valance] Valance, with irregular shape which appears to be intentional - straight top edge, and wavy  lower edge; side edges not matching. The greater part is embroidered in coloured wool on a fine linen and cotton twill, in a typical crewelwork  floral pattern, with an applied strip of coarser plain woven napped cotton or fustian embroidered in similar colours but a different pattern. Underdrawing is visible in brown ink in various places. All of the edges are bound with green wool braid. It is lined with coarse linen, extended with patches in two places. At one end is a loop of green linen threads twisted and plaited together, presumably to allow the valance to be attached to something. at the top edge is a later linen sleeve.",

When acquired by the Museum, the set was said to have come from Wattisfield Hall, near Bury St Edmunds.\n\nCrewelwork hangings became the most popular form of English domestic furnishing in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The design was heavily influenced by contemporary Indian embroideries imported into Europe by the East India Company. \n\nThese embroideries experienced a revival of interest as antiques and fashionable furnishings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when sets (many of which had survived) were bought for use on antique four-poster beds and were also split up and used as curtains on windows.  At the time the work was described erroneously as 'Jacobean' work, but  later acquired the nickname 'Jacobethan'. Original crewelwork hangings were used in fashionable homes and those of collectors,  but the style also spread to new furnishings, with contemporary designers and manufacturers producing printed linens with similar trailing tree and hillock designs.",

            "history_note": "The vendor William Newton said that the set had come from Wattisfield Hall, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He described it as comprising 2 curtains 7' x 6'3\", 2 curtains 6'3\" x 3'3\", 3 top valances with fringe, 3 bottom valances, and 3 plain bits to go at the back of top valances. He also notes : \"two of the curtains are dated in old marking with June 30 1713 and 1713/14, but this might have been when they came into possession of a new owner.\"\n\n13 parts were numbered. \nParts J, K and L were written off in 1933, RF 33/584. They were included on a list of objects described as \"quite unsuitable for Museum purposes in any way either in this museum or in any other Museum. As Mr Tattersall suggests some might be used as material [for repairing or in other ways] but many are fitted only for destruction\". The list was subdivided, and they were included in the section marked as suitable for sale. They were, however, destryoed, 27/7/1934.\nThe rest of the set was divided between the Textiles Department (parts c,f and i) and Circulation Department (353, a, b, d, e, g and h). The set was described as \"lined, some with linen and some with canvas : they are bordered with modern green braid.\"\n\nThe measurements of the written off valances were :\n5'11\" x 11\", 6' x 11.5\", 4'5.5\" x 11.5\".",

            "historical_context_note": "This type of late 17th / early 18th century crewelwork was very popular again in the early 20th century. When the set was offered to the museum for purchase in 1907, its acquisition was recommended : \"apart from their usefulness in hanging round one of our contemporary bedsteads in the furnished rooms, the demand for such specimens of English worsted embroidery is constant and increasing.\" \"The work of this character in the Museum is being constantly copied by students\". \"Embroideries of this character are very useful for students and are in great demand\".\nThere is also an endorsement by Walter Crane : \"A set of embroidered bed-hangings (crewelwork) of late 17th century period (English) are extremely good and well preserved. The curtains especially. These would be very useful for the Circulation Department as examples for needlework students. And the price is moderate. 24/4/07.\"",
