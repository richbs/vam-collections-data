The sleeveless garment has a round neck trimmed with\n white braid and white ribbon roses, with matching decoration around\n the armholes, and fastens at the neck back with a metal press stud.\n The sides are open at skirt level, with retaining straps of self\n fabric part way down.\n Although the garment shows some signs of having been worn, it is\n essentially an impractical hybrid with many resemblances to lingerie\n (the colour, fabric, decoration, hand stitching and methods of\n seaming) while retaining the construction and fastening more typical\n of a pinafore: it has the air of a garment made in a sewing class,\n possibly by Peggy Joyce herself, or perhaps a slightly older relative\n or friend.",
