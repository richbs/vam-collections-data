The simple heart-shaped motif in mother-of-pearl on the back rail was also part of the Lovat design and is typical of Walton's elegant decorative style.\n\nPeople\nThe chair belonged to John Llewellyn, one of Arthur Lasenby Liberty's fellow directors at Liberty's. Llewellyn was a leading light at Liberty's and, after joining the company in 1889, took only three years to become head of the Silk Department. In 1898 he was appointed to the board and was instrumental in commissioning and promoting Liberty's range of Art Nouveau furnishing fabrics.\n\nDesign & Designing\nLiberty's established its own furniture design studio in 1883 and a workshop in 1887.  However, not everything was designed or made in-house.  The firm increasingly bought designs from independent artists such as Walton and also continued its relationship with independent manufacturers such as William Birch of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.  This chair was made by Birch and the original design is in the Birch records at High Wycombe Public Library.\n\nTime\nChairs with tall backs were a feature of progressive furniture design in the 1890s.  It is possible that this taste for height was inspired by the attenuated and elegant forms found in Japanese art.  Since the 1870s it had been fashionable to collect prints and artefacts from Japan, and Walton is known to have had his own set of Japanese pattern books.",
