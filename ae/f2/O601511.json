He regularly contributed illustrations to the magazine Punch between 1843 and 1850. Fascinated by both folklore and fantasy, Doyle explored these interest in numerous paintings as well as producing colour illustrations for his famous book In Fairyland, published 1869-70. These depictions of fairies coincided with a growing interest in the world of fairy-tale in Victorian society.\n\nDoyle was fascinated chivalry and the folklore of different cultures. Here a knight encounters a J\u00f6tun, a giant from Norse mythology.  There is a humorous contrast between the giant's friendly grin and the effect that his enormous presence has had in scaring the horse in to overthrowing its rider.",
