This day dress appears simple, with its natural folds and smocked waist, but the silk jersey fabric required great skill to work with successfully. A fitted lining beneath the dress holds the fluid drapery in position.\n\nThese scaled copies use the same fabrics and show the superb craftsmanship as their full size equivalents. The V & A have four of these miniature dresses which the donor acquired from the archive of the wholesale house of Dorville. Wholesalers would buy the copyrights to couture dresses so that they could sell modified ready-to-wear copies. It is thought that these quarter-scale dresses were sold alongside the patterns to show how the dress looked when made up.",

            "historical_context_note": "According to donor, these dresses were bought with the toiles by wholesale companies who copied and adapted these dresses for the ready to wear market. During the post-war fabric shortages, items such as this would have provided a way to show a wholesale-purchaser what the dress looked like without the expense of making a full-size dress with all the attendant usage of fabric. The ready to wear houses and representatives would buy couture models to reproduce and copy.\n\nAn early theory was that the dress was intended for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode travelling exhibitions (of 1944 and 1946),but didn't make the final cut. Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode was intended to show the world that Paris still had mastery over dressmaking and couture, and featured quarter-scale dolls dressed in the very best miniature garments that Paris could procure.  A connection is unlikely, as while the dress demonstrates superb couture craftsmanship and perfect miniature scaling, it does not appear it would fit one of the very small-waisted Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode mannikins, making the theory unpalpable. The Maryland Museum, who own the 1946 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode mannikins, have confirmed that these objects are not connected to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode. \n\nWhat is clear is that they are amazingly well-made, beautifully hand-finished, exact scale models of couture dresses, using the same fabrics as their full size equivalents.",
