Often called a sweetmeat glass, it was used primarily as the top fitment of a pyramid of graduated salvers (trays or 'waiters' for serving a dessert such as jelly) loaded with jelly and custard glasses (flaring stemless glasses with small feet). The name 'orange glass' or 'top glass' found in 18th-century bills shows that it usually held a crystallised orange. Many survive, some with expensive and elaborate cutting, suggesting that they had a secondary role as small dishes for delicacies on the dessert table.\n\nRetailers & Trade\nThe component parts of a pyramid of jelly glasses could be bought from a glass dealer as a complete kit, or as separate items - all being likely to need regular replacement through breakages. In 1744 six ribbed jelly glasses could be bought for two shillings (4d each), while three salvers cost seven shillings.",
