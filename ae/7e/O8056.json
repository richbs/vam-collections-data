Minton's, like other manufacturers, made their largest and showiest pieces for such international fairs, to demonstrate their technical capabilities, the skill of their painters and the quality of their design.  Even so, they often assembled forms already in production to make a new work for the occasion.  Here the vase itself is probably a standard shape, but the coiling snakes have been added and the stand of four crouching boys was designed by Albert Ernest Carrier de Belleuse especially for the exhibition.\n\nPeople\nAlbert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, designer of the stand supporting this huge vase, was a sculptor and modeller. He trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Over a long career he employed Auguste Rodin (1840-1917), he worked for Doulton, Minton and other English companies, including Coalbrookdale ironworks and from the 1870s he was art director at the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory, near Paris.  He produced  a number of designs for Minton production in  Parian ware, bone china and majolica.",
