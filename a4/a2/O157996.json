The bulbous body has two applied rococo cartouches of scrolls, foliage, and corn, with a lamb mask beneath, all on a tooled and punched matted ground. The scroll handles issue from a stylised shell, scroll, foliage and scalework mask. The covers are domed in two stages, with a gadrooned border, applied cut-card lambrequins on a punched matted ground with a scroll-and-shell border, and a central scroll handle. The cartouches are engraved with the crest and coronet of Richard Edgcumbe and his wife Matilda Furnese. The covers bear the same coat of arms and coronet. The plain liners have two small shell-shaped handles applied to their inside walls. They are also engraved with the Edgcumbe crest and coronet. The design of the crest varies. The tureens were first made around 1722, but remodelled by de Lamerie around 1747. Although they retain their original shape, gadroon borders and the intricate applied decoration on the covers in the <i>r\u00e9gence</i> style; the feet and lions masks, the handles and the cartouches were all added later and are typical of de Lamerie's rococo style.",

This tureen, along with its pair, belonged to the Edgcumbe family of Mount Edgcumbe, outside Plymouth. They were remodelled in the 1740s in the fashionable Rococo style.  The liners were made by Wakelin and Garrard 1795-1796.\n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauceboat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
