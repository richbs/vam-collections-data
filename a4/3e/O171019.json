Thus, this costume, designed by Alison Chitty for the National Theatre's 1987 production of Antony and Cleopatra, owes nothing to the clich\u00e9 ancient Egypt, eschewing obvious 'Egyptian' style and motif, but looks back to an era before modern archaeology when Egpyt was synonymous with a vague, sensuous 'east.'  \nA major consideration when designing costumes is the comfort of the performer.  Perhaps not by chance, the loose, slim-line coat and full trousers recall outfits worn by Dame Judi off stage, but given enough of a twist to create a theatrical costume.  The trousers, especially, combine practicality with style.  They are made of two exceptionally wide tubes, stitched onto a hipster band which is slightly pointed back and front.  They look and move like a skirt, but allow extremes of movement without the attendant problems of riding up or 'floating.'",
