The scheme ended in 1952.\n\nThis bureau was made by Maples between 1948 and 1950 and was classed as Utility. It was sold as being in the New Zealand manner, as featured in the New Zealand State House in Wellington. It was also shown in the Ideal Home Exhibition for 1950.\n\nCertain additions have been made, notably a \u2018secret drawer\u2019 for one pound notes, located just above the main writing surface, and activated by lifting a screw head at the back of the recess above the two small drawers.
