Kitchen\n\nArticle from \u2018Architectural Review\u2019 July 1968, Vol 144 no. 857\n\u2018Chairs for the new Cunarder: Chairs for the first class and tourist restaurants for the new Cunard, 2, have been designed by Robert Heritage for Race Furniture. The frame is in aluminium alloys either die cast or extruded which are bonded with an epoxy adhesive, the first time, it is believed, that this kind of construction has been used in the furniture industry, the advantages being that a stronger and cheaper joint can be made without using mechanical fastenings, which often work loose and lead to maintenance problems. In any event it has been tested and approved by the Furniture Industry Research Association. Seat and back are in preformed laminates upholstered in specially developed fire-retardant cushions and covering materials.\u2019\n\nDescription of V&amp;A object from Hollis, R. 1970. Modern Chairs:1918-1970. The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London:\n\"The chair frame is of special aluminium alloy, and the bonding of leg extrusion to foot casting depends on a special adhesive developed through prolonged research. It was first shown at the Design Centre, London in 1969, and received a Council of Industrial Design annual award in the same year. Alternative versions are made in which the outer surface of the arms and back is either faced with post-formed plastic laminate or with hide, fabric or vinyl.\"\n\nDescription of Craftsman from Hollis, R. 1970.
