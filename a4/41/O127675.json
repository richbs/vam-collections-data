Jim-Ima Crow (whose name references \u2018Jim Crow\u2019 the comic blackface act first seen in London in 1836, pictured on a poster above Jim-Ima here) kneels by the hearth, bellows in hand, tending the fire and the coffee pot.

William Henry Hunt was responsible for a whole series. Two were of black children, exhibited at the Old Water-Colour Society in London with the titles 'Jim Crow' (1837) and 'Miss Jem-Ima Crow' (1839). Lithographs after them were subsequently published in a volume of 'Hunt\u2019s Comic Sketches' mainly composed of images of white children aping their elders \u2026 In this collection the two watercolours of black children were given obviously comic titles: 'Master James Crow \u2013 Out of his Element' and 'Miss Jim-Ima Crow \u2013 a West Indian Cinderella'. Both must have been painted from living models posed and surrounded with studio \u2018props\u2019 to suggest a story. The boy, out of his element (the sun), warms himself in front of a stove. The West Indian Cinderella kneels by the hearth, unable to go to the ball suggested by the print of a dancing black labelled James Crow.'\nBlack Victorians, Black People in British Art.
