It is smaller than the table fork and may have three or four pointed prongs for spearing the slippery shellfish, although some later Victorian models, such as this one,  have a spoon-shaped bowl.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe decoration of oyster forks is much more restrained that that of other types of Victorian cutlery, such as fish knives and forks or butter knives. Typically, there is very little engraving on the body of the fork, and the handles (of mahogany, mother-of-pearl or ivory) are mainly of simple form. The rounded bowl is reminiscent of  the late Victorian salad helper, to which this shape of oyster fork may relate.\n\nRetailing\nOyster forks could be purchased individually for about the same cost as  butter knives:  between 2s (10p) and 6s (30p) each, depending on the decoration and material. However, the Goldsmiths' and Silversmiths' Company catalogue of 1896 offered boxed sets of oyster forks in solid silver, which could have been purchased as wedding or Christmas gifts. These were  more elaborate than cheaper examples, and cost about \u00a32 5s for 6 or \u00a35 for 12.\n\nManufacturer\nWilliam Hutton & Sons were a large, well-known firm of manufacturing silversmiths in Sheffield. Their advertisements claimed that they produced 'Every article for the table'.",
