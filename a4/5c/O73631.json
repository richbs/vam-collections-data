It was to go in Garrick\u2019s villa on the bank of the River Thames at Hampton, Surrey. For the furniture of their villa, Mr and Mrs Garrick chose a light-hearted painted style, with Chinoiserie, or Chinese-style, decorations. This cabinet was for their bedroom. It matched the bed, two wardrobes and a small bookcase, which are all now part of the V&A collections (W.70-1916 and W.21 to 32-1917). In form, low corner cupboards like this one copied French fashions. In France, a pair of corner cupboards was often made to match a commode, or chest of drawers. Chippendale also supplied more formal furnishings for David Garrick's London house in Adelphi Terrace.",
