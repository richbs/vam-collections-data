From about 1615-1670 they were by far the commonest type of relatively comfortable chair in what today we would call middle- and upper-class homes. They remained in use long after that. They were generally fitted with fixed covers of leather or wool, as here. The design of such covers, known as turkey-work, imitated imported carpets. Chairs like this mark an important stage in the development of upholstered seating in Britain. This cover has '1649' worked into the design and is a rare dated example. However, it was fitted to the frame, which is of about the same date, only in the 20th century.",
