This tile is decorated with a scene from the epic Iranian poem known as the Khamsah, or Five Tales of Nizami, written by the 12th century Iranian poet Nizami Ganjavi. The romance of Khusraw and Shirin is the second of these tales, and relates the passionate courtship of the Sasanian monarch Khusraw and the Armenian Princess Shirin. The tales were recorded in manuscripts, many beautifully illustrated, for Iranian rulers. In this scene, probably copied from a contemporary lithograph, Shirin on her black horse, accompanies Farhad, who has been asked by Khusraw to cut a road through Mount Behistun. The lithographic printing process was introduce to Iran in the 1840s, and almost immediately inexpensive copies of the great classics were produced and widely circulated. In the mid 19th century, tiles were sold as individual objects for display, rather than as multi-part friezes, many were acquired by Western tourists and visitors as souvenirs.",
