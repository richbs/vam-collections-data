However, comparisons with the features on a funerary monument by Westmacott to Harriet Elizabeth, Lady Beresford and her father would suggest Harriet (1790\u20131825) as the probable subject of this bust. She died prematurely at the age of 35, within nine months of her father. The blank eyes also suggest it is likely to be posthumous. She was the daughter of Henry Peirse and she married Admiral Sir John Poo Beresford, 1st Baronet in 1815. The funerary monument is in the church of St Gregory, Bedale, Yorkshire. The date of the monument \u2013 1825 \u2013 provides the dating for this bust. Sir Richard Westmacott belonged to a dynasty of sculptors active in the late 18th and early 19th century.",
