Volume I, 14th - 16th century</i> London, Victoria and Albert Museum, HMSO: 1979.\nTietze and Tietze-Conrat suggest, that the drawing may have served as a model for two figures (the second and fourth spectator from the left) in Vincento's 'Allegory' in Schleissheim. But the connection is slight. There is a closer connection, as Mrs Lucy Gent has pointed out to me, between the drawing and the figure of St Peter in the Madonna dell'Orto, Venice (painted about 1550-55: Bercken pl. 57). The pose of the two figures is alike. But there are differences too. The saint in the picture is rapt in the contemplation of his vision; but he is not frightened or surprised, and his body is in a state of repose. The man in the drawing on the other hand looks frightened rather than rapt, and he is looking at something straight in front of him, not at a vision in the sky. Moreover he seems to be in the act of springing to his fee, as though recoiling from something, while his left hand looks as though it were drawn back to ward off an attack rather than to support a book, as it does in the painting. It is difficult to explain why the pose of the two figures should be so alike and their expressions so different. But it is possible that the artist, having posed his model, made many quick sketches of him and strayed away from his original purpose, experimenting with the different actions and expressions that might be given to a man in that position. Tintoretto's well known habit of making many drawings of the same model is in accord with this explanation.\nThis and ten other Tintoretto drawings in the Dyce bequest were in Reynolds's collection and are inscribed with the artist's name in the same 18th century hand.
