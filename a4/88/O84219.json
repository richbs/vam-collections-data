His images for the 1997 campaign for the fashion house Prada received considerable acclaim. Luchford's work to date has been mysterious and suggestive of film stills where the motivations of the central characters must be unravelled and completed by the viewer. \n\nThis photograph is from the final campaign that Glen Luchford worked on for Prada. His photographs for the fashion house mark the 'top end' of contemporary fashion photography and have re-established beautiful, classic, fashion imagery in advertising campaigns.\n\nDye destruction prints are made using print material which has at least three emulsion layers, each one sensitised to a different primary colour - red, blue or green - and each one containing a dye related to that colour. During exposure to the negative, each layer records different information about the colour make-up of the image. During printing, the dyes are destroyed or preserved to form a full colour image in which the three emulsion layers are perceived as one. Dye destruction prints are characterised by vibrant colour. The process used to be called Cibachrome; it is now known as Ilfochrome.",
