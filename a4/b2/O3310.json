            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nChandeliers became increasingly popular after the middle of the 18th century, when the natural beauty of British lead glass was perfectly complemented by elaborate styles of cutting. Early chandeliers were hung with spindly, fragile, glass arms and drops. By the early 19th century, these had been replaced by more architectural forms with sturdy metal frames entirely covered with shimmering curtains of prismatic, flat, glass drops.\n\nTime\nMany forms of lighting were available at this period, from miners' grease lamps to very expensive reading lights with sophisticated oil burners. But until the development of 'gasoliers' in the 1830s, the only effective method of lighting large rooms was to use the reflective and refractive properties of cut glass and to increase the number of candles - in the case of this chandelier, to eighteen.\n\nOwnership & Use\nChandeliers were prohibitively expensive to buy and likely to need regular dismantling and replacement parts. For these reasons, only wealthy owners of country houses (such as Wroxton Abbey in Oxfordshire, the source of this fine example), and occasionally commercial social venues (such as the Assembly Rooms at Bath), could afford to purchase directly from specialist glass dealers. Others would simply hire them for parties, along with the china, the glass, and all the catering facilities. Hire charges were about 10% of the value: in 1812, for example, the Duke of Atholl hired from a London glass dealer a twelve-light chandelier, valued at 98 guineas, for ten guineas.",
