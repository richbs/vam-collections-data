Reverse not inspected. \nD.78 Neg: 48254 \n\n21 John James Halls (1776-1853) \n\nEdmund Kean as Richard in (Richard III by William Shakespeare)\n\nRichard is shown in Act IV scene iv when, having dispensed with the curses of his mother, the Duchess of York, and the shallow changing blandishments of his sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth the widow of Edward IV, he first hears the news that portends his own defeat and death: \n\nK. Richard: Once more, what news? \nStanley: Richmond is on the seas. \nK. Richard:There let him sink, and be the seas on him! White-liver'd  \n                 runagate! what doth he there? I know not, mighty \n                 sovereign,   but by guess. Well, as you guess! \nStanley: I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.\nK. Richard: Well, as you guess!\nStanley: Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham and Morton, He makes for    \n              England, here to claim the crown. \nK. Richard: Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd? \n                 Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd? What heir of York \n                 is there alive but we? And who is England's king but \n                 great York's heir? \n\nKean's first mature appearance as Richard in London took place on 12 February 1814 at Drury Lane, shortly after his debut as Shylock on 26 January. It became his most popular part, adored by the public and a goldmine for artists. There are well over a hundred prints of Kean as Richard including Charles Turner's mezzotint after 21 (57.5 X 37.45 cm.), published 21 November 1814 and dedicated to Samuel Whitbread. There are a number of watercolour copies of Turner's mezzotint and the same engraver also produced a stipple engraving of Halls's picture showing Kean three-quarter length. It was also published in 1814. \nThe costume and wig worn by Edmund Kean in 21 are now in the Museum of London (53.96). The costume is a particularly good example of early nineteenth-century stage dress and consists of a long red sleeveless coat, edged with ermine and decorated with a border of gold braid, pattern of white Yorkist rose in bottom corner. Under this a paned doublet and hose, dark blue edged with gold braid and patterned with gold braid flowers, with white lining, over a long sleeved blue tunic with red cuffs, all decorated with gold braid. Ermine cap with gold crown, the crown with three vertical members at the front all edged with pearls.'\n\nGeoffrey Ashton, 1992\n\n\n",
