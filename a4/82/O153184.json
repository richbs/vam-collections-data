The woven silk is in at least six pieces which have been rather crudely sewn together.  There are 8 long purple silk loops attached at regular intervals around the edge.  The original function is unknown but the facing is carefully attached and the loops appear to be a later addition.  No attempt seems to have been made to ensure that the facing or the backing fit the woven silk properly.\nThe ground was originally covered with metal thread.  The pattern is a flattened ogival lattice formed by a green edged  cream 'ribbon' filled with red and dark green spots.  Each compartment contains a floral spray with central red blossoms with blue calyx and a small blue petalled flower on either side and dark green leaves.\nWarp: cream silk\nWeft: dark green, blue and red silk.\nMetal thread: silver strip open S-wound on cream silk.\nThe selvedge has two cotton cords, S-spun.\nFacing: bias cut plain weave light blue silk.\nBacking: plain weave cotton; yellow ground with a small repeating pattern of a boteh trailing a flowering stem from a base.  The predominant colours are red, green, black with details in purple and blue. The rows of botehs are offset , and they face alternate directions in alternate rows.",
