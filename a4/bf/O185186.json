            "public_access_description": "This fruit basket and two dishes are part of a large dining service decorated with the arms of the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) together with its motto 'Auspicio Regis et Senatus Angliae' [ 'By right of the king and the senate of England'] depicted within a scroll. Established in 1600 the first English East India Company was named ' The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies,' until it was merged with another company in 1698. Upon the merger the name was changed to the Honourable East India Company and in 1709 a new coat of arms was adopted. By 1711 a new trading post was established in Canton. \n\nThe shape of the basket is European in origin and probably modelled on pierced work pieces made in Meissen or Berlin. The feather-leaf handles with vine leaf terminals are reminiscent of the headdresses worn by oriental and South American princes that were popularly depicted in costume and travel prints during the 17th century. Baskets, such as this, were a significant part of the dessert service and were always accompanied by a dish used for holding fruit such as strawberries. During the 18th century it had become increasingly fashionable to eat fruit with cream. The open-work design, linlong in Chinese, was produced by using a sharp shaped knife, widely used on export porcelain during 1780 and 1825. This particular service was probably commissioned by an officer within the Honourable East India Company to celebrate its centenary. The pieces came from Fort St George in Madras, one of the most important trading centres in Asia.",
