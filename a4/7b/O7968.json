It would have been prominently positioned in the house, for example over the door of a large screen built across a hall or above a fireplace in a chamber, in order to emphasise the importance of the owner's family.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe panel is of carved oak, and would probably have had highlights picked out. The presence of Prussian blue suggests that the  current  painted surface dates from after 1720.\n\nTime\nFrom the Middle Ages heraldry was often used to decorate more costly items or conspicuous parts of both the exteriors and interiors of a house, in order to enhance the prestige of the owner. In this panel the coats of arms are placed in a highly fashionable frame of about 1600, in a design similar to prints by Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527-?1606), an engraver and designer who spent most of his working life in Antwerp. Carvers, like silversmiths, painters and embroiderers, often used published prints as inspiration for decorative frames around coats of arms or images.",
