This was christened by its sitter 'The Dirty Monk'. Mrs Cameron later used it as the frontispiece to her edition of Tennyson's Idylls of the King, from which a plate is also shown in this exhibition. The portrait was, for her, both the 'Immortal' poet - whom she had probably known since 1850 - and also 'a fit representation of Isaiah or of Jeremiah'. Her work habitually refers both to the Victorian present and the legendary, mythic and biblical pasts."

            "public_access_description": "Julia Margaret Cameron's career as a photographer began in 1863 when her daughter gave her a camera. Cameron began photographing everyone in sight. Because of the newness of photography as a practice, she was free to make her own rules and not be bound to convention. The kinds of images being made at the time did not interest Cameron. She was interested in capturing another kind of photographic truth. Not one dependent on accuracy of sharp detail, but one that depicted the emotional state of her sitter.\n\nCameron liked the soft focus portraits and the streak marks on her negatives, choosing to work with these irregularities, making them part of her pictures.  Although at the time Cameron was seen as an unconventional and experimental photographer, her images have a solid place in the history of photography.\n\nMost of Cameron's photographs are portraits. She used members of her family as sitters and made photographs than concentrated on their faces. She was interested in conveying their natural beauty, often asking female sitters to let down their hair so as to show them in a way that they were not accustomed to presenting themselves. In addition to making stunning and evocative portraits both of male and female subjects, Cameron also staged tableaux and posed her sitters in situations that simulated allegorical paintings.\n\nThrough the acquaintance of the author Sir Henry Taylor (who was a neighbour) Cameron was introduced to poet laureate Alfred Tennyson, who would remain a life-long friend, public supporter and a frequently photographed subject.  In 1874, Tennyson commissioned Cameron to create the first ever photographic illustrations for his collection Idylls of the King and Other Poems, based on the legend of King Arthur.",
