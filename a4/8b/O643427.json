It is a fine example from Rosa's large output of prints and shows a rarely-depicted episode inspired by the medieval Tuscan history: the life of Albert, companion and disciple of Saint William of Maleval, a Tuscan penitent of the 12th century, who withdrew in an especially horrid valley of Siena where he died in 1557. The armour relates to the early life of the saint, which was believed to have been a licentious soldier. This print and its companion piece, <i>St Albert</i> (E.1301-1900) are unique in Rosa's production of larger prints as they present a non classical subject matter. \nThe isolated figure in the wilderness is a recurrent thematic in Rosa's oeuvre, which echoes his personal attraction for the pessimist views of the Cynics, a philosophical movement from the ancient Greece, founded by Antisthenes, a pupil of Socrates, who were marked by an ostentatious contempt for society. The most famous was Diogenes, to whom Rosa dedicated one of his larger etchings. \n A copy of the print in reverse was published by Johann Jakob von Sandrart (1685-1698) and another by Jeremiah Wolff (ca. 1663/73-1724) while another copy in the same direction was published by Carlo Antonini in 1780.\nA painted version, probably derived from the present composition, however less detailed, is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna while another painting showing a hermit in the same position is most likely derived from the same composition but doubtfully by Rosa himself (Salerno, no. 172).\nThe original plate is preserved at the Calcografia Nazionale in Rome (Inv. 7471).",
