ISBN 1851770712.\n\u2018This range, \u2018Pyro\u2019, was designed by K\u00e5ge in 1930 to be inexpensive, well-designed, useful ovenproof ware, made in a heat-resistant earthenware named \u2018Pyromassa\u2019. The storage jars were labelled for their contents: these two were to contain \u2018risgryn\u2019 (rice) and  \u2018nejlikor\u2019 (cloves). The range was first shown, with painted decoration in brown, in \u2018Stockholmsutst\u00e4llningen\u2019, the major exhibition of art and industry, Stockholm, 1930. A reduced version of this exhibition was shown in London, in Dorland House, Regent Street, in the following year, 1931. The range was extremely successful and was made continuously for 25 years. The blue version, \u2018Marina\u2019, was introduced by 1933, the year in which this set was on loan to the museum before its formal acquisition in 1934. It was designed by Wilhelm K\u00e5ge as a re-working of the earlier brown painted range. Margaret Bulley bequeathed these pieces, among a large number of 20th century objects, to the Museum. She collected contemporary design and was advised occasionally by Roger Fry, the art critic, painter and founder of the Omega Workshops.\u2019",
