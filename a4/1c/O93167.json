Springtime scenes of outdoor meals or entertainments were popular in Safavid art and poetry. Here a young woman is the centre of attention, surrounded by her attendants. The blue-and-white vessels on the ground may be Chinese, or Iranian copies. \n\nThe Safavid dynasty was established in 1501 by Shah Isma\u2019il. He was the young but charismatic leader of the dervish brotherhood founded by his ancestor, Shaykh Safi al-Din. Isma\u2019il reunited Iran and made a branch of Islam known as Shi\u2019ism the religion of the state. \n\nMany of Shah Isma\u2019il\u2019s successors, including his son Tahmasp, were great patrons of the arts. They developed a dynastic style in which human figures played an important role. This was in strong contrast to their main rivals, the Sunni Ottomans, who generally avoided such motifs.",
