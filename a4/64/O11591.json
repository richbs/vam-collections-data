It was shown, with its companion, a vase known as 'La Gloire', which was bought by Queen Victoria and is now at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.  They were made by the manufactory of S\u00e8vres, on the outskirts of Paris, and exhibited as an example of technical expertise and artistic mastery.\n\nTime \nThe fortunes of the S\u00e8vres factory were always closely tied to political events. The factory  was originally established under royal patronage; after the French Revolution, Napoleon awarded it state subsidies and  from 1806 took it under imperial patronage. These subsidies and, after Napoleon's overthrow,  the support of the restored Bourbon monarchy continued until 1848, when the factory came under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.  In 1851, as the State Manufactory, S\u00e8vres was keen to reaffirm its technical and artistic superiority.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe vase was selected for the Museum by a committee consisting of Henry Cole (1808-1882), Owen Jones (1809-1874) and Richard Redgrave (1804-1888).  They pronounced it 'remarkable for the elegance of general form; and the delicate treatment of the coloured decoration exhibiting the limit of light and shade applicable to pictures painted on a round surface'.  Such an example was acquired to instruct students and craftsmen in related industries.  Accordingly, this vase was lent to the Hanley Museum, in the Staffordshire potteries, between 1888 and 1890.",
