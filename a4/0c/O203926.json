Because Mr Atkinson had not made a profit from his business, the lease was cancelled. \n\nThe premises were then let out to John Hudson, he continued to hold the lease until 1781. The Gin House gave its name to the nearby neighbourhood, which became known as \u2018The Ginns\u2019. \n\nIn 1813, John Goulding and John Tunstall obtained the lease of some land for the erection of a pottery. A third pottery began in 1819. It was known as the Whitehaven Pottery, and was run by Woodnorth, Harrison, Hall and Co. It stood on Pottery Row, on the site of the old abattoir. They advertised themselves as manufacturers of \u2018blue printed, blue painted, enamelled blue and brown, lined upon and under the glaze, blue and green edged - fine and common cream colour, black purple, red and rose coloured, printed, and in a great variety of fancy coloured, printed and embossed ware\u2019, and declared that their products were \u2018equal, if not superior to the Generality of the Staffordshire Ware\u2019. \n\nIn 1829, John Wilkinson took control of the Whitehaven Pottery; he is described as a manufacturer of \u2018white and coloured delf\u2019. Following the death of John Wilkinson in 1868, his widow continued to run the business until her death in 1877, she was aged eighty. On her death the business passed to her son, George, who maintained it until 1881 when it closed. \n\nWilkinson\u2019s was by far the most outstanding local pottery business of the time. Randle Wilkinson ran a wholesale pottery store on Roper Street for some years, then in 1923 he moved to Tangier Street. Randle retired from the business shortly after this move, he died in September 1925, aged eighty. \n\nThe oldest surviving piece of pottery from Whitehaven is a jug with naval scenes on it. It was made for Daniel and Mary Macintosh in 1797. \n\nDuring 2003, in Whitehaven's marketplace, the site of the original Whitehaven Pottery in the 1700's, a new pottery centre was opened, ensuring that this unique industry wasn't lost.\n\nSee Ceramics Department Object Information File",
