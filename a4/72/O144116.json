They have large bases and capitals of scrolled and foliate lacquered brass of rococo character. Above the capitals are curved cast iron corner pieces with naturalistically painted flowers surrounded by a band of gilt scrolled ornament. The rails of the bed are fitted with curved and tapering ends which slot into the corner pieces; the rails are of square section and undecorated. The front legs rise above the corner pieces as foot posts, similarly decorated to the legs with the addition of turned brass finials above the brass capitals. The foot board, of papier mache, is connected to the foot posts by bolts which connect with plates projecting form rococo scrolled brass mounts on the foot posts. The bolt extents from brass mounts fixed to the outside of the footboard; they are decorated with grapes and vine leaves. The foot board has curved sides and a scrolled and wavy fret cut top profile. It is decorated in the centre with flowers naturalistically painted in colours surrounded by rococo scrollwork mostly gilt but partly painted in red. The inside of the footboard is decorated at the top edge with gilt rococo scrollwork. The back legs rise as bed posts similarly to those in front but enclose at first a framework of brass tubing, formed by a single cross tube from which depend two vertical tubes connected at the top by a second cross tube from which depend five vertical tubes. Above this framework is the papier mache headboard, similarly supported and decorated to the footboard, but for the fact that its back is plain. The posts rise above the headboard and are there decorated with a single brass mount incorporating a captial and base identical to those on the legs. Above this the posts rise again to another capital. The posts are otherwise similarly decorated with flowers and gilding to the legs and foot posts. Above the capitals are large turned finials terminating in globes. A rail is fixed to the narrower part of these finials and extends straight out along the bed for a certain length after which it curves round to form a support for the canopy which is also held by tubular brackets rising from the bedposts. This canopy is covered with a dark grey cloth and has a front valance of green cotton rep with a fringe of twisted and looped cords and wooded tassles bound with green and yellow silk. This fringing extends to the sides of the canopy where it conceals the tops of the floor length rep curtains. The back of the headboard is also filled by a rep curtain and there are also rep valances, except at the front.",
