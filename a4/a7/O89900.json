It has three conical-shaped purple flower sprays made up of small five-petaled flowers and buds. The two smaller side sprays terminate  stems branching off a central stem which ends in a larger flower head.  Each flower spray has a delicately painted veined calyx at its base. There are four pinnate leaves in pale green which are modelled in a deeper shade with hatched lines.  The plant rises from the notional ground which is indicated by wispy tufts of green grass, similar to the treatment of the flower shown on page 52B.\n      The painting is framed with black ruled lines in ink with plain strips of pale ochre-coloured paper on the plain ivory-ground of the main border.  The page has strips of grey paper at its outer margins with two narrow black outlines and a beige piece of woven material added as a gutter for the binding.",
