It shows the Firebird pulling away from Ivan Tsarevitch as he tries to capture her. \n\nThe Firebird was created for the second ballet season Diaghilev presented in Paris and first performed at the Paris Op\u00e8ra on 25 June 1910. Its narrative combined elements from a number of Russian folk tales and it was the first ballet for which Igor Stravinsky had composed the score. The choreography was by Mikhail Fokine and the original sets and costumes were designed by Alexandre Golovin. This illustration shows the last version of the revised costumes for the Firebird and Ivan Tsarevitch, designed by L\u00e9on Bakst. It depicts the ballet as it was performed in London in 1919 at the Alhambra Theatre when Lydia Lopokova danced the Firebird and L\u00e9onide Massine played Ivan Tsarevitch.\n\nThe illustration is reproduced on page 5 of Cyril W. Beaumont's book Impressions of the Russian Ballet: The Firebird.",
