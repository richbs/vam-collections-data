Decorated handkerchiefs, however, were often purely fashionable accessories and gifts. This example has cutwork decoration. Cutwork is the earliest form of needle lace. It is based on a woven ground, from which areas have been cut away. The technique developed during the 16th century. Lacemakers cut away increasing areas of fabric to create a geometric grid of threads over which they worked their stitches. This type of advanced cutwork became very fashionable. It reached the height of technical and stylistic perfection around 1615.",
