E.1905-1962\n\nAt first, only buildings which jeopardized the Commune's defence were fired. But within hours of the first fire in the Rue Royale the attitude of the desperate communards had become more vindictive. Buildings, such as the Tuileries Palace, which were symbolic of the abominated past were set alight. The weather was warm and dry with a strong wind which spread the blaze until all Paris appeared to be in flames. Large parts of the Palais-Royale, the Palais de Justice, the Prefecture of the Police, the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, the Conseil d'Etat and the H\u00f4tel de Ville were burnt and whole sections of the Rue de Rivoli were gutted; the Louvre only just escaped.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
