The muted colour, lack of glaze and decoration was ideal for a piece that would probably have been used in the inns around Japan to serve waiting clientele. Its warm colour and unadorned appearance was suitable for an informal setting but could also be admired for its wabi or, 'quiet taste'. \n\nManufactured on the Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa Prefecture) in Tsuboya, the centre of Okinawan pottery,  this piece was probably exported to Japan where the stoneware was favoured for its warm and variegated colour. Despite a flourishing trade with Japan, other pieces were also exported to the Philippines, Indonesia, China and as far a field as the Persian Gulf. The dynamic style of these Southern barbarian or 'namban' wares produced at the Tsuboya kilns influenced the development and appearance of later Bizen wares in Japan.",
