Coward must have used it for several years since it is crammed with items, the weight of which proved too much for the handle which was worn through when it came to the Museum.\n\nAttached to the case is part of a luggage label which originally identified No\u00ebl Coward's address as 17, Gerald Road, the house in London's Belgravia in which from 1930 until 1956 he lived in the top floor flat.",
