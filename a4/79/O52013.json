Banded tulips on stems curl around the crescents. \nThe blue field is covered with fine, undulating parallel stems which run through banded tulips and carnations. the stems are coloured in sections: thin red and then thicker green. There is a secondary system of stem underlying the parallel ones: this also changes colour in sections and is red, black, green and white. It moves horizontally and forms circles around the large carnations and tulips.",

They are decorated with large-scale, bold designs in red, blue, green and yellow, with some white and black. In the 17th century the main designs were based on wavy parallel stems which run along the length of the fabric. In this example, the lattice has been overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of flowers.",
