It was commissioned by the Baroness Alain de Rothschild to wear for the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to Paris in April 1957. Many grand events were held during the visit, such as dinners at the Louvre, Versailles and the Elys\u00e9e Palace, and also visits to the opera and races.  \n\nThe state visit was the highlight of the year's social calendar. Couturiers were inundated with requests for evening gowns and gala dresses from society ladies. Lady Gladwyn, the wife of the British Ambassador, commented in her diaries that even the Queen\u2019s dresses did not compare to the French clothes for grandeur.\n\nThis dress was originally much whiter but has unfortunately become dirty with age.  It is treated with a stiffening agent that means that it cannot be cleaned.",

Le large decollete s'adoucit d'un drape en forme de fichu, noue d'un long ruban de satin de Guillemin.  Christian Dior.  Rouge a levres Christian Dior.\"\nVickers, H., 'Cecil Beaton' in Wilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, London), p.165 & pl.7.9.\nHer Majesty The Queen donated a 1965 Hardy Amies day ensemble and, to avoid causing ruptures in the world of couture, the Norman Hartnell dress from the April 1957 state visit to Paris, at which Beaton had been a guest. (pl.7.8).  He had been invited by Lady Jebb (later Lady Gladwyn), wife of the British Ambassador in Paris, to sketch the return state banquet at which the queen had entertained president Ren\u00e9 Coty at the British Embassy in Paris.  At the time, he had written to his hostess, saying 'The Queen triumphed over Hartnell's bad taste'.  Despite this, he was delighted to accept the ivory satin evening dress, encrusted with beads, brilliants and gold.  Beaton succeeded in acquiring several other dresses worn during the same visit.  Lady Gladwyn donated the lilac lace evening dress [T.173-1974] by French designer, Jacques Fath.  Lady Diana Cooper, Lady Gladwyn's (and Beaton's) great friend, donated a strapless Balmain gown of appliqu\u00e9 printed silk satin [T.50-1974].  Baroness Alain de Rothschild (Mary Chauvin de Treuil), the wife of one of the Rothschild banking brothers, gave a white spotted tulle dress by Dior [T.121-1974] (all pl.7.9).\nDior Archives, Paris - Dior's dressmaking charts\nThe chart shows a sample of the dress fabric.  It is bright white.",
