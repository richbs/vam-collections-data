A native of Alsace, France, Kirckman settled in London in the early 1730s, where he married the widow of his employer Hermann Tabel in 1738. In 1770 he went into a very profitable partnership with his nephew Abraham (1737-1794), and his rich-sounding instruments were much in demand. \n\nKirckman fitted his instruments, like this one, with a 'nag's head swell', a moving flap fixed to the lid which helped vary the volume, so that they could compete with pianos, which were becoming increasingly popular in England from the 1760s onwards. Although the harpsichord was virtually eclipsed by the piano by about 1800, Kirckman's instruments remained much sought after and were still being produced in 1809.",
