The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. Work probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\nThis scene has been identified as the capture of Hamza and Muqbil who are put into irons and led into the fortress of Aqqa. The page is in very poor condition, and the faces of all the living beings in the picture, whether humans, elephants or the divs (demons) in the background, have been deliberately obliterated.",
