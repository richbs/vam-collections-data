In the foreground is tree surrounded by shrubs, in front of which a ragged man is standing. He is dressed in a battered hat and patched trousers and is carrying a long pipe in his right hand.

The back sheet is printed with the music and lyrics for the first section of the song.\n\n\nAccording to Peter Davidson in 'Songs Of The British Music Hall' the song originated in the 1840s and was sung by Frederick Robson at the Grecian Saloon (This adjoined The Eagle Tavern  which became famour for the song  'Pop Goes The Weasel'). A note at the base of this sheet indicates that the song comes from Villikins & Dinah Polka, containing Villikin's Lament and introducing Giles Scroggins and Billy Taylor.",
