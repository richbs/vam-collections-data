The temptress Likenion tries to seduce the shepherd Daphnis, but he rejects her and remains true to his lover, Chlo\u00eb. The production period was troubled, with disagreements between Diaghilev and Fokine, and the ballet had to be postponed while its composer, Ravel, completed the complex score which required large musical resources, including a choir. Despite the difficulties it was well received at its opening in Paris and was revived for three performances in 1913 and taken to London in 1914. Margarita Frohman danced the role of Likenion in 1912, and this design appears to be a reworking of the costume for a different dancer in 1913.",
