            "public_access_description": "The historical information about the Strasbourg factory is from the published work of Doroth\u00e9e Guillem\u00e9 Brulon.\n\nThis extraordinary fa\u00efence clock case was made in Strasbourg at the manufactory of Paul Hannong from about 1754-61.  Paul and his brother Balthazar had taken over the factory following the retirement of their father, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Hannong in 1732.   Charles-Fran\u00e7ois, of Dutch origin, started as a humble pipe manufacturer in the city in 1709 and went on to found a dynasty of three generations producing high quality faience and porcelain.  His fa\u00efence factory started in 1721 when he joined forces with a German fa\u00efencier, Henri Wachenfeld.  The following year however, Wachenfeld returned to Germany to establish his own factory at Durlach.\n\nThe Strasbourg enterprise went from strength to strength and in 1724 a branch was established 40 kms to the north in Hagenau.  By 1737, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 eldest son, Paul, was in sole charge of both factories.   The continuing success of the factory was assured when between 1745-1748 he perfected the technique of \u2018petit feu\u2019 decoration, using a second low temperature firing in a muffle kiln to produce the rich pinks and purples (derived from purple of Cassius) for which Strasbourg is famed today.  The development of this wider palette was essential in order to compete with the new French porcelains being produced and was particularly important for the popular theme of flower painting at this time.\n\nThe success of his factory attracted workers from all over Germany.  The first notable recruit was the Meissen painter Christian-Wilhelm Lowenfinck in 1748.  He was soon followed by his brother Adam-Friederich and his wife Maria-Seraphia, an accomplished painter of flowers and landscapes.  Paul Hannong went on to produce hard-paste porcelain in 1751 or 1752 with the aid of the former Meissen chemist, Jacob Ringler.  This enfringed the monopoly of the Vincennes factory and Hannong was forced to move this side his porcelain production beyond the Rhine to the Palatinate, establishing the Frankenthal factory in 1755.  \n\nHis new concern obliged Paul Hannong to spend long periods away from Strasbourg, in addition many of his original staff died or moved away, making it difficult for him to control the quality of the work.  In 1754 in an attempt to safeguard his wares from inferior copies, he started to use the PH mark found on this clock.  In 1759 Paul died and his two sons took over:  Pierre-Antoine at Strasbourg and Hagenau, Joseph at Frankenthal.  Pierre-Antoine however, proceeded to sell the secret of hard-paste porcelain production to the French royal factory of S\u00e8vres, an action which provoked his co-legatees (his brother Joseph and his five sisters) to disinherit him.  In Frankenthal, after suffering financial difficulties, Joseph sold out to the Elector Karl-Theodore and returned to Strasbourg to assume the direction of both factories.\n\nThe basic design of this clock case is a traditional one as it takes the theme of the fleeting passage of time, embodied by 'Old Father Time', the standing classical figure at the top holding an hour glass.  He is there as a reminder to the young couple, represented by male and female busts, not to dawdle or waste time, while the crowing cockerel in the centre is a further encouragement to 'seize the day'.  Allegorical figures of 'Time' and other symbols were commonly used in gilt-bronze clocks of the late 17th and early 18th century Baroque period.   By the 1750s however, lightness, frivolity, asymmetry and colour were all popular design elements in the decorative arts, usually referred to by the term 'Rococo' today.  In this colourful clock case the modeller has given full expression to these elements, using the wonderful plasticity of the clay to create bold asymmetrical scrolls and shell-like forms.",
