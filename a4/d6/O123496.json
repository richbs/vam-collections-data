In 1835 he entered the Royal Academy Schools but was rarely there, preferring instead to learn from his own studies of objects such as the Elgin Marbles.  \n\nDespite being a successful history painter, Watts is best known for his portraits.  He painted many of the notable figures of his day including William Morris and Cardinal Manning.  He travelled widely and exhibiting abroad, on the Continent and in New York, helped establish his reputation as a prominent artist.  Watts was elected ARA early in 1867 and then RA later the same year.\n\nThis portrait was one of around ten portraits by Watts of various members of the Ionides family.  Constantine Alexander Ionides was a keen collector of art and when he died in 1900 he bequeathed over a thousand paintings, drawings and prints to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  This particular painting of his grandmother Mary is one of a group of 20 family portraits which, while part of the original bequest, did not come to the museum until the death of his widow in 1920.",
