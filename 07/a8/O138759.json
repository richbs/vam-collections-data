Used in social situations, snuff was usually carried in a small container, such as this gourd which is missing its wooden stopper. Snuff containers are among the most personal objects produced in southern Africa. Being discreet but portable tokens of status, snuff containers were worn as accessories by both men and women. The value of this container is highlighted by the use of fine brass and copper wire in its decoration. Copper was not available locally to the Zulu people and had to be traded for.",
