It is a two-sheet - a poster printed in two parts to be pasted together on the hoardings. Variety performers of any worth at this date were expected to provide managements with their own poster when their act was booked. They would then be displayed locally, over posted with slips to announce the venue.\n\nMay Moore Duprez (1885-1946) was born in St Louis, Missouri as May Moore and began her stage career as a child touring the western and southern states of America with her sister and mother as the 'Moore Sisters Comedy Company'. She developed her comedy Dutch routine quite early, billed as Baby Moore and Little May Moore, adding the sometimes-hyphenated 'Duprez' after going solo in 1897. She came to England in 1900 and by 1904 was well enough known to tour to New Zealand where she was billed as 'another brilliant star'. In 1912 she made recordings of some of her best-known songs including 'The jolly Dutch girl', 'Hans across the sea' and 'Leetle Mister Baggy Trousers'.",
