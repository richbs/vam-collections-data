It is based on a character from an operetta by Offenbach, called Jean qui Pleure and Jeanne qui Rit (John who Cries and Joan who Laughs), which was popular in France in the 19th century. It is not a child's toy, having probably been made in Paris, in about 1860 for a wealthy adult as an amusement for his guests. The clockwork mechanism is a complex one; when it is activated the boy plays a sad tune, the ears move back and forth, the right arm moves up and down and his left leg swings.",
