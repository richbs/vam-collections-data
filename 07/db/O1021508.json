The text is as follows: ZUCCARO, FREDERICO (c. 1540-1609) 425 Design for the entrance to the garden of the artist's house (the Palazzo Zuccari) in the Via Gregoriana, Rome Pen and ink and wash on faded blue paper 6 5/8 x 10\u00be (168 x 273) 3436-2 PROVENANCE John Talman (as indicated b: the decorated gold border); C. J. Richardsc bought from him 1863 LITERATURE E. Guldan, 'Das MonsterPortal am Palazzo Zuccari in Rom' in Zeitschrift fur Kunstgeschichte, 1969, pp. 229-61, pI. 29 Zuccaro designed his own house and began building it in 1591, but never completed it. The garden wall, pierced by a door and two windows in the form of grotesque masks with gaping mouths, is shown here approximately as executed. Between 1904 and 1907 the house was substantially altered, the garden was built over and the wall which enclosed it incorporated into the new structure. See W. Kiirte, <i>Der Palazzo Zuccari in Rom, Leipzig</i>, 1935, pp. 14-20 and pis. 5-9. Guldan suggests in his article that the origin of Federico's conceit is to be found in medieval illustrations representing the entrance to Hell as a mouth. He also points out that there is a garden house at Bomarzo near Viterbo in the form of a head with a gaping mouth, and another belonging to the Villa Aldobrandini, near Frascati. Compare also the drawing no. 894 in our vol. 2.",
