The photographs are presented in deep frames with labels which parody museum information.  They are offered as if they were artefacts from a remote civilization or society, though in fact they are from Britain in the 1980s and 1990s.\n           \nA C-type print, such as Ektachrome, is a colour print in which the print material has at least three emulsion layers of light sensitive silver salts. Each layer is sensitised to a different primary colour - either red, blue or green - and so records different information about the colour make-up of the image. During printing, chemicals are added which form dyes of the appropriate colour in the emulsion layers. It is the most common type of colour photograph.",
