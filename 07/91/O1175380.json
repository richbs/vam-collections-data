The play was produced at the Haymarket Theatre, London in 1848 by Charles and Ellen Kean (1805-1880). Mr and Mrs Kean were typical of many actors and actresses in that they married someone also in the theatre profession.  After her marriage, Ellen changed her professional name from 'Ellen Tree' to 'Mrs Charles Kean', reflecting the theatrical partnership in which both managed and acted in their own productions.\n\nSeveral contemporary prints depict Kean wearing this belt, including examples from the V&A Collections. See for instance, S.4985-2009 (an illustrated portrait).",
