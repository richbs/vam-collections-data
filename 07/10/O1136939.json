The following is the full text of the entry: CORTESE, GIACOMO Jacques Courtois known as il Borgognone (1621-76) 675 A cavalry skirmish Inscribed in a later hand in ink 'Bourguignon' Reed pen and brown ink over red chalk with touches of grey wash 7 1/2 x 12 1/8 (190 x 308) Dyce 202 PROVENANCE Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE Dyce Catalogue no. 202 (as by Cortese) Among the drawings which can be attributed to the artist with reasonable certainty is a group of six, perhaps even 13, in the Louvre, which Bellori bought soon after the artist's death (according to Mariette) and which subsequently passed into Crozat's collection (see J. Guiffrey and P. Marcel, Inventaire general des dessins du Louvre et du Musee de Versailles, 4, 1909, pp. 10-13, nos. 2737-2749). Two of these drawings (nos. 2747 and 2749) are connected with etchings by Cortese. All these 13 drawings are in a very similar style, and thus form a homogeneous group against which other drawings may be tested. No. 675, which has an old attribution to Cortese, seems to pass the test.",
