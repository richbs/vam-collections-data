            "public_access_description": "Phyllis Ginger studied at the Richmond School of Art between 1932 and 1935. Although her main ambition was to be an illustrator, she was encouraged during her studies to also follow her interests in etching and portraiture. She exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1938 and was elected to the Royal Watercolour society in 1952. In 1939 Phyllis Ginger's skill as a topographical artist led to her involvement in the Pilgrim Trust scheme 'Recording Britain', which invited artists to paint topographical views of buildings and other characteristic British sites judged to be at risk of destruction by enemy action.\n\nThe sheet shows a sketch a group of four figures. The grouping of the figures is similar to that in E.314-2007, E.315-2007 and E.316-2007, suggesting that it may have been made at the same time. The outline of each figure has first been drawn in pen before the artist has added watercolour to bring depth to the figures in the group. The dress of this group of figures suggests that the work is from the late 1940s. This can be seen particularly in the knee-length skirt of the woman in the background who wears a dark blue suit. This sketch reflects the artist's work as an illustrator for fashion magazines such as 'Harpers Bazaar' in the 1940s.",
