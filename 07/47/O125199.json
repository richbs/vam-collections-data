His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s painterly and poetic interpretation of medieval period costume and architecture complemented Christopher Fry\u2019s verse play, The Lady\u2019s Not For Burning (1949), about a woman wrongly accused of witchcraft in a small English market town around 1400.  Fry's first play to be presented at a West End theatre, it won critical acclaim; one critic hailed it as \u2018a poetic fantasy of rare splendour and delight.\u2019 (The Times, 10 November 1950).   \n\nJohn Gielgud (1904-2000) co-directed the play and also played Thomas Mendip, a discharged, disillusioned soldier.  He tries to save Jennet from being burned as witch, and despite his cynicism,  falls in love with her.  Messel designed a medieval costume with vivid violet boots, a studded leather waistcoat and chainmail around his waist.",
