John Stafford-Howard </b>\n(b.c.1660 d.1714) \n<b>c.1687-95</b>\nP57-1923 \n\n<b>Oval 90 x73 mm\n</b>\nFeatures stippled in grey and sanguine, with touches of yellow and blue and some white heightening in the eyes, on a pale carnation ground; hair in pale brown wash, hatched and stippled with darker browns and black and with some gouache lights, over the carnation; cravat in white with pale grey over an off-white wash; robe in opaque black; background in opaque dark brown, hatched with darker colour to the left of sitter's head, and paler colour centre right; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Margins very roughly trimmed and no marginal abrasion, though some flaking; presumably cut down; heavy retouches in zinc-white on the cravat; minor retouches overall. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Centre right, in black: <i>PC</i>. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> A modern gilt rim of curved section with flanged sides, creating a rebate for the glass; for fitting to a velvet -covered board, but altered for independent display by the attachment of a small loop hanger at the top. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Presumably by descent in the family; purchased for \u00a350 from Sir Henry Stafford Jerningham, Bart, October 1923. \n\n<b>Literature:</b><i>Accessions</i> 1923, p. 304, pl. 18; Long 1929, p. 108; Long 1930, p. 16, fig. 63; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 , p. 13. \n\nThe identification of the sitter depends on the statement of the vendor and presumably on family tradition. It is plausible as to date and age of sitter, but slightly less so for politics and place of execution. The date of the portrait should be in the late 1680s or 1690s when John Stafford-Howard was about thirty years old. \n\nThe Hon. John Stafford - Howard was the son of Sir William Howard, Baron and Viscount Stafford (cr. 12 September and 11 November 1640), and of Mary, Baroness Stafford in her own right (cr. 5 October 1688).John was the second son, the younger brother of Henry (b.1658, 1st Earl of Stafford, cr. Simultaneously with his mother, 5 October 1688), and the father of William (b.c.1690), who eventually succeeded his uncle Henry as 2nd Earl. John was a prominent Jacobite and an officer of the household of the exiled James II from March 1695/6. His first marriage was in December 1682; he died intestate in Paris on 11 November 1714.\" <i><i>\n",
