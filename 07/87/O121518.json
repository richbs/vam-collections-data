The cover is characteristically patterned with auspicious motifs, the cranes and pine trees used here both being popular symbols of longevity.  This design has been produced using a stencil resist-dyed method known as katazome. Rice paste was applied through the stencil to cloth stretched out on a long board. The stencil was then removed and placed on the next section of cloth and the process repeated.  When the cloth was dyed the colour did not penetrate the areas protected by the paste.",
