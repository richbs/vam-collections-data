His subject-matter included coal-mining communities in north-east England, street traders in London, and the domestic lives of the middle and upper classes. \n \nMost middle-class families employed at least one servant, usually a maid, for cooking and cleaning. Life in service could be very hard. Parlourmaids had to get up hours before their employers in order to light fires in the downstairs rooms, fetch hot water to the bedrooms and serve breakfast. They also had to generally clean the house and wait at table. There were often strict rules as to how they should spend what little free time they were allowed. Working-class girls became less willing to go into domestic service when they had more opportunities to work in shops, offices and factories.",
