This beautifully detailed, yet theatrical, headdress, from the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet's 1943 production, perfectly suggests a medieval setting, while still belonging to a fantasy world.\n  \nThe designer of the production, Leslie Hurry, was relatively new to ballet design, having made his reputation as a surrealist painter. This made him an ideal choice to create the world of Swan Lake, where the realistic costumes of the court anchored the more flamboyantly dream-like sets and the basic unrealistic dance costumes. His designs were so successful that, with various reworkings, they were still in use thirty years later. By the 1970s, however, he had had enough and pleaded with the Royal Ballet never to ask him to design or revise the costumes again.",
