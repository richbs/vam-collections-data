The drawings took a month to execute. The profile of the maquette (IS.150-1984) at regular intervals in its height and also along its length (see 190a-1984) was transferred with the aid of a profile gauge onto pieces of cardboard which were cut to fit over the model. These two series of cards then served as stencils for the two drawings. The drawings were enlarged by projecting photographs of them onto large sheets of paper; the enlarged drawings then served in guiding the construction of the armature for the full-sized version (made of 12 mm thick iron, which was worked with hands and a jigsaw). The armature was covered with 'expamet', (expanded metal) before application of the surface coating of concrete.",

The drawings took a month to execute.\n\nDruva Mistry was born in Kanjari, (Gujarat) in 1957. He studied sculpture at the Faculty of Fine Arts, MS University of Baroda (1974-79), graduating with distinction and a gold medal. He went on to gain an MA at Baroda (1979-81) and then came to Britain on a British Council scholarship to take an MA in sculpture at the Royal College of Art (1981-83). Mistry has since gained international recognition and many prizes. He was the youngest person since Turner to be elected a member of the Royal Academy of Art. In 1997 he returned to Vadadora and in 1997 was appointed Professor, Head of Sculpture and Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Baroda. He was awarded an honorary CBE in 2001.\n\nMistry's work ranges from huge public commissions to maquettes and wall reliefs, related in part to Hinduism and Buddhism, but also encompassing influences from the West - Egyptian and Cycladic art and European traditions of figurative sculpture.",
