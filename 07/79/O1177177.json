This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into the creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.\n\nDavid Bowie is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the last five decades. This t-shirt is a souvenir of the Serious Moonlight world tour, Bowie\u2019s longest and most successful concert tour which ran from May to December 1983 and visited 16 countries.",
