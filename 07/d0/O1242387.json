The image has been signed by the artist, Allan Stewart (1865-1951), in the bottom right hand corner. \n\nOtello is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) to an Italian libretto by Arrigo Boito, based on William Shakespeare's (1564-1616) play Othello. It was Verdi's penultimate opera, and was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on February the 5th 1887 with the tenor Francesco Tomagno (1850-1905) in the role of Otello.\n\nAllan Stewart (1865\u20131951) was a Scottish painter who built his reputation on romantic, historical and particularly military paintings as well as landscapes and portraits. Stewart served on the staff of the Illustrated London News for a number of years and in this capacity, went to South Africa as a 'special' artist during the Boer War. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
