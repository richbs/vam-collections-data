After polishing, ivory can be stained or partially painted or gilded.\nThese panels are English and probably originate from Canterbury. They were formerly mounted on the covers of a Bible printed in Paris in 1552 which is now in the National Art Library (Press mark 88.E.23). The covers were removed from there in 1921.\nThe type of foliage ornament and prancing lions have their closest parallels in the crypt capitals at Canterbury Cathedral of around 1100-20, where the flattened leaf forms and beading of the panels, ultimately derived from the late Anglo-Saxon 'Winchester acanthus. can be matched exactly.",

The type of foliage ornament and prancing lions have their closest parallels in the crypt capitals at Canterbury Cathedral (especially those illustrated by Zarnecki, 1951, pl. 49) of around 1100-20, where the flattened leaf forms and beading of the panels, ultimately derived from the late Anglo-Saxon 'Winchester acanthus. can be matched exactly.\n\nDr Otto P\u00e4cht has suggested (verbally) that the ornament on these reliefs should be compared to that in the second Winchester Bible (Oxford: Bodleian M.S.Auct.E.inf.1) illuminated at Winchester ca. 1140-1150. parallels are to be found among the interlaced foliated scrolls in the initial on fol. 31. (cf.T.S.R. Boase, English Art 1100-1216, Oxford, 1953, pl.66a) and f.278v. These comparisons suggest that the reliefs are English work of the second quater of the 12th-century. Dr P\u00e4cht also suggested the hypothesis that the reliefs were originally the cover of the Shaftesbury Psalter (B.M. M.S. Lansdowne 383).",
