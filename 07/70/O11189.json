It seeks attention with its silvery surface, and suggests a slightly adventurous taste on the part of its owner. The method of making double-walled silvered glass was complex and made more so by the introduction of coloured glass and cutting.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe process of making double-walled silvered glass was patented by Edward Varnish and Frederick Hale Thompson in 1849.  A number of glassworks, such as that of James Powell & Sons of Whitefriars, London, made the blanks.  A vase or, as in this case, an inkholder shape, was formed, with  the glass-blower stopping short of opening out the mouth.  Instead, the top of the vase, still sealed as a bubble shape, was reheated and 'dropped' inwards to form a double-walled interior. This plain, undecorated object was then supplied to a retailer or dealer such as Lund, where it was filled between the walls from the foot end with a solution of silver nitrate and glucose (in the form of grape juice).  The final stage was to seal the hole in the foot with a metal disc, in this example marked for Lund, who may have patented some further detail of the decoration or mount.",
