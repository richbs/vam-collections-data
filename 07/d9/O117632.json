This green wool continues in a plait for max. 16 cms. at both corners with the wool of the soumak weft (see below).\n\nEND FINISH;  Lower: cut and secured at a later date with blanket stitch.  Upper: 2 bands of countered soumak worked over 6 threads and back behind 3, using very light brown wool and divided by a running stitch in very light brown and dark green wool and followed by 1 cm. of warp twining with a fringe of 2.5 cms. emerging from the base of the twining.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark blue ground (very dark green in the lowest part).  On it is a large medallion which stretches across the whole width of the field.  This has a red ground with, at both ends, an angular niche flanked by two smaller ones, the whole outlined in dark green, brownish red, white, red and yellow, the last two colours sprouting into flower-like double hooks above each niche.  A brown bar stretches across the centre of the medallion.  In it are three pink and white floral sprigs, a pink and a green rosette and two mainly pink serrated leaves.  Seven parallel and outward facing brackets, ending in decorated books, like along both sides of the bar.  In both halves of the medallion a five-sided and arched shape in blue, hooked on the two outer rims, points towards the main niche.  Within the shape is a decorated green object (perhaps a lidded container?).  Also on the medallion are two pairs of other green containers' apparently with a handle and spout - perhaps stylised ewers?  There are also several floral motifs.  Beyond the niches and supported by horizontal bars are a pair of stylised multi-coloured palmettes pointing outwards and into the complementary angles of a pair of doubly triangular green figures enclosing pink and blue rosettes.\n\nMain border: blue ground with predominantly green, red and brownish red rosettes.  Along the sides most are attached by stems to brownish red interrupted parallel lines nd are punctuated by red bars at right angles to the lines, that each contain half a small flowerhead.  At the top and bottom the lines are more stem-like.\n\nInner border: red ground with a line of joined sprigs with single flowers in a variety of colours.\n\nOuter border: red ground; multi-coloured rosettes and smaller flowers alternating with multi-coloured serrated leaves.",
