Made in 1995, it was inspired by Medieval and Renaissance dress. The print is contemporary, yet harmonises perfectly with the theatrical and historical mood. The overdress has a shirred, high waist and an immensely full skirt is supported by multi-layered tulle petticoats. The beadwork is inspired by Uzbekistani craftsmanship.",
