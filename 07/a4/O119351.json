It would have been part of a set of similar bottles for different drugs, belonging to a pharmacy. \nMaidenhair (Adiantum capillus-veneris ) is a small, hardy fern with an aromatic, lily-like fragrance. It can be found throughout southern Europe and the Atlantic coast as far north as Ireland. The dried fronds, sometimes with roots attached, are the medicinal part of the plant. Since the Middle Ages, it was taken as an infusion for various diseases of the respiratory tract, as a syrup for coughs, and as a rinse to treat thinning hair and promote healthy skin tone.\nThis type of bottle was typical for the workshop of Orazio Pompei and his extended family in Castelli (active ca. 1510/20-after 1590). Most of the jars and bottles made there have depictions of men and/or women in comtemporary dress.",
