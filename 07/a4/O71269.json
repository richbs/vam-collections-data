In her right hand she holds a two-tiered tower decorated with horizontal mouldings and a boss which may represent a cannon-ball. The tower is surmounted by a truncated spire. In her left hand she carries a closed book and presses a palm branch against her body. She wears a tight-fitting gown, and a loose cloak draped from the left shoulder.\n\nThe panel has been broken across in the middle and repaired. The top right corner has also been broken away and repaired. Part of the top left corner has been repaired with plaster. Much colour and gilding remain on the figure. Green paint remains on the ground, with the usual daisy pattern. The main part of the tower is a mottled pinkish-brown colour. The boss and the spire are green. The book is red, the palm is green, and there are traces of gilt on the crown. There are traces of red on the cloak with blue in the folds. The back of the panel bears one lead-plugged hole. The bottom has been cut away.",

Religious themes penetrated private life, so devotional images of saints were sculpted not only for church interiors, but also for individuals to contemplate within the privacy of their homes.",
