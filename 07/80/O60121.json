Perhaps because she has a more delicious flavour although she may not have such pretty features. If you eat me, good appetite to you! But if you think of touching I advise you to go easy with your finger and think about it twice if it be fresh. Sometimes am I a cause of illness but a bottle of citrate is sufficient for the indigestion to vanish. And I would also like to tell you what he gets who samples my sister too many times but those are family affairs.' There is a play on the fact that the word 'fica' in Italian also refers to the vulva.",
