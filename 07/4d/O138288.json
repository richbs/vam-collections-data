By 1600 a strong framed 'gate' developed that swung out from the main frame, to support each leaf. Gateleg tables (as they are now known), usually made of oak, and with oval tops would be folded down at the side of the room between meals. \n\nTwo constructional features help date this example to the 17th century: the top has been fixed to the frame by means of pegs inserted from above, where angled screws from below or glue blocks were often used in the 18th century. On this table the hinged leaves meet the fixed top in a flush-edged \u2018butt joint\u2019, where a stepped ovolo moulding became more common after the early 18th century.",
