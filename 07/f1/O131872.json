Before 1800</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 77, cat. no. 75\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Lucas CRANACH the elder (1472-1553) \n<i>German School</i> \nBorn in Kronach (Upper Franconia), he is said to have been a pupil of his father, Hans. After working in Bavaria and Vienna, his patron from 1505 was the Elector Frederick of Saxony at Wittenberg, where he achieved various municipal positions, including that of burgomaster (1537 and 1540). The output of his studio, in which his sons Hans and Lucas worked, was large and there is frequently confusion between it and his own work. \n\nManner of Lucas CRANACH \n\n75 \nPORTRAIT OF A LADY IN A COSTUME OF c. 1530 \n<i>Lime panel </i> \n16 1/2 X 13 1/4 (42 x 34.3) \n771-1865 \n<i>Not reproduced</i> \n \nAcquired as '16th century Swiss(?) School of Basle' (1893 <i>Catalogue,</i>p. 90), this is a 19th century imitation somewhat in the manner of Cranach (cf. M. J. Friedlander and J. Rosenberg, <i>Die Gem\u00e4lde von Lucas Cranach,</i>1932, figs. 139, 148, 238-42). The costume is Saxon, rather than Swiss. \n\n<i>Prov.</i>Jules Soulages, Toulouse; his whole collection bought by a body of English subscribers in 1856 and subsequently acquired in stages by the South Kensington Museum. \n<i>Exh. Art treasures,</i>Manchester, 1857, no. 1093 (School of Basle). \n<i>Lit.</i>J. C. Robinson, <i>Catalogue of the Soulages Collection,</i>1856, p. 162, no. 586 (early 16th century, School of Basle).\"",
