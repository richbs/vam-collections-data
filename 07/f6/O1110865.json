His right hand grips the reigns [of his white charger], his left bears his sword and shield'.\nContes russes/Children's Tales, set to music by Anatol Liadoff with colourful  scenery and costumes designed by Mikhail Larionov, was a popular ballet that drew on the fantasy of Russian folklore. It was choreographed by Leonide Massine who also danced the role of the hero, Bova Korolevitch.\n  \nContes russes consisted of three linked scenes telling the tales of Kikimora, the Swan Princess and Bova Korolevitch, and Baba Yaga.",
