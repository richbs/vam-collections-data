His 1962 meeting with model Jill Kennington sparked an exciting period of high-octane image-making for numerous magazines and newspapers. \n\nIn 1966 his studio provided the principal set for Antonioni's film, 'Blow-Up'. Cowan himself was prominent among the new generation of photographers whose lifestyles provided the inspiration for the film's central character.

By the end of the decade he was in financial difficulties and falling out of step with the world of fashion. He left London for Milan, Paris and New York.
