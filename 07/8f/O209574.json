Letter XLII  (page 181) was written at Sevastopol on April 6th, 1786 and the gift was 'a very fine beautiful handkerchief of his sister's embroidery, which the Governer told me I must accept.  I desired the Kaim-Kan to thank her, and tell her I would keep it for her sake. It is of muslin, the borders embroidered with different coloured silk and gold and what I could not comprehend, both sides are the same'.",
