            "public_access_description": "This tailored jacket and skirt is by Frederick Bosworth. The rise of the ladies tailor-made garment at the end of the nineteenth century is widely attributed to the tailoring house of John Redfern. Bosworth, the former manager of the London branch of Redfern, set up his own ladies tailors, on New Burlington Street, at the turn of the century. As a key player in Redfern's success Bosworth transferred many of Redfern's characteristic qualities to his own production, using quality fabrics of different weights, unique buttons and fancy braiding in his tailormade garments. \n\nThis suit, faded from its original lilac colour, is tailored to the curvaceous Edwardian shape which is emphasised with the military-style frogging. The long jacket falls over a waist nipped in at its natural height and has a high straight collar and sleeves with softly pleated headings. The gored skirt is slightly flared and sits about two inches from the ground. It is fuller at the back. This ensemble is part of a collection of well over 100 pieces of clothing worn by Miss Heather Firbank and donated to the museum in 1960. It is said that Miss Firbank favoured purple colours to complement her name and this is one of numerous purple garments in the collection.",
