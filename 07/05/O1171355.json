This medal shows an unusual aspect of Ramshaw's creative output (the award or medal) yet the shape, material and technique, which present an original take on the award medal, are all characteristic of Ramshaw's creations in metal and glass (here acrylic).

The format of the medal is reminiscent of a computer disk holding a store of interrelated information and memory. (...) The medal is constructed as a series of layers, each one conveying a different message.' (Ramshaw, 2004, p. 90).",
