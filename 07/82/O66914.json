They were seen as the deliverers of God's messages concerning the future, including the Coming of the Messiah. The major prophets include Ezekiel.\n\nStained glass panels with figures of prophets bearing scrolls with text are also known as 'messenger panels', because they convey these divinely inspired prophecies or messages. \nThe Latin text on the scroll that Ezekiel holds is abbreviated. In translation it reads: 'I shall pour out pure water upon you'.\n\nOriginally, the panel would have been placed above or below a larger one depicting a scene from the New Testament. The scene would be related to the prophecy recorded on the prophet\u2019s scroll. Here it would be the image of the Baptism of Christ. This arrangement is known as a \u2018typology\u2019, by which persons or events in the Old Testament are prophetic symbols of ones in the New Testament.\n\nThis panel was originally one a series depicting the prophets. It may been in the church of St Cecilia in Cologne. The windows from this church have been dispersed and can be found in other museum collections in Britain and the United States.",

So they were thought of as the deliverers of His messages concerning the future including the Coming of the Messiah. The major prophets include Ezekiel.\n\nStained glass panels with figures of the prophets bearing scrolls with text are known as 'prophet (or messenger) panels' because they convey these divinely inspired prophecies or messages. \n\nThe text on the scroll that Ezekiel holds is abbreviated and translates from the Latin as: \n\n\tI shall pour out pure water upon you\n\nThe panel would have originally been placed above or below a larger panel depicting a scene from the New Testament. This scene would be related to the prophecy recorded on the prophet's scroll. Here it would be the image of the Baptism of Christ. This arrangement is known as a 'typology' by which persons or events in the Old Testament are prophetic symbols of persons or events in the New Testament.\n\nThis panel was originally one a series depicting the prophets which may been in the Church of St. Cecilia in Cologne. The windows from this church have been dispersed and can be found in other museum collections in Britain and in the United States.",
