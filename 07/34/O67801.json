Indeed, this dagger itself shows a man in Iranian court dress wearing a dagger of this type carved on the front of the hilt, which is probably made of ivory. He wears the weapon tucked into the sash round his waist. \n\nThe fine carved decoration on the front of the hilt also includes two inscriptions in Persian, above and below the carved figure, which together read, \u2018Portrait of Manuchihr, the brave king, the prince who wrestles panthers and grapples lions\u2019. Manuchihr is a hero of the Iranian national epic The Book of Kings, and it may also have been the name of the man for whom the dagger was made. Manuchihr is shown wearing a long coat with a sash and a tall hat, as well as loops of pearls and other jewels, and he is armed with a sword and a rifle as well as the dagger. \n\nInscriptions on the back of the hilt give the name of the maker as \u2018Ahmad al-Husayni, who has the sobriquet Kashtah\u2019, the date 1254 (equivalent to AD 1838\u20131839), and an appropriate Qur\u2019anic inscription: \u2018In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. We have opened for thee an evident victory.\u2019 The blade is of fine watered steel and bears a small inscription inlaid in gold, \u2018His [that is, God\u2019s] slave [A?]hmad\u2019.
