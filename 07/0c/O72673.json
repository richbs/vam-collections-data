The title is in bold three dimensional lettering in the centre of the cover. In the top right hand in a large scale portrait of Amitabh Bachchan and opposite him in the bottom left hand side is a portrait of Dharmendra, both are carrying guns. They are surrounded by lots of action pictures; in the top left hand side is a ship with flames shooting out of it and above that a helicopter. In the bottom right hand side is a scene showing men on horses in the middle of a gun fight.\n\nOn the inside cover is another montage of images, the most prominent image is that of a man (Amitabh Bachchan)  and woman lying horizontally but in opposite directions across the page and looking like they are about to kiss. The other images are action shots  and are on a  much smaller scale placed on the left hand side of the page. \n\nThere are four pages inside the booklet, the first has a list of the film credits, the second has a synopsis of the film in English along with a black and white image of Amitabh and Rekha. The next two pages have a synopsis and song lyrics in Hindi. The back covers, both inside and out, have further montages of action shots from the film.",
