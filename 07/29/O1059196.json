Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>126 Called Edward Gregory</b>\n<b>c.1665</b> \nEvans 24 \n\n<b>O<b>val 62 x 51 mm</b> </b>\n\nFeatures firmly hatched in brown and sanguine, with touches of white in the eyes, on a pale carnation ground; the hair in brown wash, lined and hatched with darker colour and with pale gouache for the lights; cravat in grey wash modelled in white; the robe in brown washes with the lights in gold; background to the left a brown wash, and to the right a sky and landscape in opaque washes; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some small retouches (zinc-based) in the right margin and in the hair to the right; otherwise excellent. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> In yellow, centre left: <i>TF</i> (see G in Appendix 2). On the back of the locket a label inscribed perhaps by Wallop: <i>Mr Gregory./ Clerk of the Cheque,/ at Chatham, by T.Flatman / signed in monogram.</i> \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Modern gilt-brass, flat front, formed by bending the flat strip sides over to make a rebate for the glass; the sides pierced by three pin-holes for securing the slightly convex backplate; the hanger of D-section, channelled down the middle and bifurcating into reverse turns before beginning diminishing spirals of three turns. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an unrecorded source by the Hon. F H A Wallop before 1921 ; lent to the V&A 1927-49; the ownership transferred to Alan Evans, June 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Grosvenor Place 1932; RA 1934, no. 1008 (dated c. 1665). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> WiIliamson 1921 , p. 90; <i>Summary Catalogue</i> 1981, p. 22; Murdoch 1981, p. 152, fig. 163. \n\nThe relatively smooth and integrated brushwork of the face-painting supports Wallop's dating of c.1665. \n\nThe identification as Mr Gregory rests only on the inscription which, since it refers to someone well known from Pepys' Diary, could have become attached to the miniature in the trade before Wallop acquired it. Wallop's interest in sitters, and his knowledge of who was who in the seventeenth century, would have encouraged his dealers to sell him named miniatures. \n\nPepys knew two Edward Gregorys, father and son: Edward senior was Clerk of the Cheque in the Chatham Dockyard 1661-5; Edward junior served as a junior clerk at Chatham (and was secretary of an Admiralty committee to enquire into finance, 1663-4) before succeeding his father as Clerk of the Cheque in 1665. His subsequent career was distinguished: he became one of the Naval Commissioners at Chatham (1689-1703) and was knighted. \n\nEach naval dockyard, depending on its size, had its complement of full-time officials. Chatham, which was strategically very important in the Dutch wars, was a large yard, and the Clerk of the Cheque, who was in charge of finance, personnel and the throughput of work, was the senior permanent official. He was assisted by two other senior clerks, the Storekeeper and the Clerk of the Survey, and they were assisted by a group of executive officers, such as the Master Shipwright and the Master Attendant, who each headed a department of skilled men. For Pepys in the 1660s, as Clerk of the King's Ships, Clerk of the Privy Seal, and in 1665 Surveyor-General, and \nconcerned above all to promote the efficiency and probity of naval administration, his senior dockyard staff were key figures. Most of the references in the Diary are to the younger Edward Gregory, who, on grounds of age, is doubtless the sitter put forward here. (1)\n\n1 <i>The Diary of Samuel Pepys</i>, ed.
