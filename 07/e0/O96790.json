The central image of Christ on the Cross is associated with four male figures, each engaging in a different activity.\n\nIt is possible that these figures represent the Four Elements. In medieval and Renaissance imagery, the Elements are usually personified by female figures or by gods and goddesses. By the 1600s some painters chose to represent them as figures of the time, engaging in activities appropriate to each element.\n\nThe Four Elements are Air, Earth Fire and Water. On this roundel the young nobleman with a falcon on his wrist symbolises Air. The youth digging with a spade is Earth. The blacksmith at his furnace protecting his face from the flames is Fire, and the elderly man drawing his fishing net is Water.",

The central image of Christ on the Cross is associated with four male figures, each engaging in a different activity.\n\nThese figures have been tentively identified as representing the Four Elements and this seems most likely. In Medieval and Renaissance imagery, the Elements are usually personified by female figures or by gods and goddesses.\n\nBy the 17th century, some painters chose to represent them as contemporary figures engaging in activities symbolising the Elements.\n\nThe Four Elements are air, earth fire and water. On this roundel the young noble man with a falcon on his wrist symbolises Air. The youth digging with a spade is Earth. The blacksmith at his furnace protecting his face from the flames is Fire and the elderly man drawing his fishing net is Water.",
