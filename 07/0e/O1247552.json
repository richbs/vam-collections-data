            "public_access_description": "This handknitted toy is one of a pair made by Florence Ridley in the early 1930s for her two young daughters, Myrtle and Shirley. Each doll is dressed in an ensemble of vest, trousers, skirt and jacket which fasten with metal press studs and colourful buttons. Shirley inherited the dolls, and kept them until her death in 2010. She showed her own daughter the dolls, but kept them safe as they were 'her treasures'.\n\nThe character of the golly originated in a series of children's books written by Florence Upton between 1895 and 1909; the first was 'The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg'. The appearance of the character was based on the Blackface performance tradition. Towards the end of the 19th century, the character gained popularity and toy makers saw potential. Golly dolls and soft toys were mass produced, and the character was used in advertising campaigns, as well as appearing in the work of other authors. \n\nHowever the character, which had evolved from a racist performance tradition, promoted stereotypes. The term 'gollywog' was appropriated as a racist slur, and associated with violence and prejudice. In the 1960s, increased sensitivity to issues of race and representation lead to campaigns to withdraw the golly from children's culture. Today the golly is historically interesting as one of the few black characters to gain such widespread fame in the early 20th century, and as a children's character whose significance was sharply felt in the adult world.",

The family lived in Cockfosters, north London. After Myrtle married and emigrated to Australia, Shirley inherited the dolls, described as 'her treasures'. She kept them until her death in 2010, when they passed to her daughter. The donor remembers seeing the dolls when she was very young, and liking their clothes, which can be removed and swapped around. However, they remained her mother's dolls and kept in a 'safe place'.",
