The work is an irregularly folded sequence of handmade paper strips, with watercolour, collage and gilded elements. Both artists had graphic design backgrounds, and both consciously strove for abstraction and innovation, refusing to follow earlier, finer traditions of livres d'artistes or artists books. Bicknell in particular preferred to question the very nature of 'the book', using unorthodox approaches to typography or lack of it, folding, binding and illustration. 'Balcons' continues this exploration for Bicknell, altering and expanding his scope by collaborating with Tyson, for this work.",
