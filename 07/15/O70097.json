In his left hand he holds a scroll, which presumably originally bore the phrase of the Apostles' Creed attributed to him. He wears a robe and a cloak draped from his right shoulder.\n\nThe top of the scroll is broken off at hand level. There are traces of the usual green ground and daisy pattern. There are traces of blue in the folds of the cloak. \n\nThe back of the panel is marked with 12 closely spaced incisions. There are two holes with the remains of lead in-filling. There is a mark down the middle, running the length of the figure, which shows where the alabaster was sawn from the block. On one side the surface is smooth, on the other very rough. The bottom has been cut away.",
