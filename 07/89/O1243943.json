Her parents were originally from rural mid Wales but settled in Ashby de la Zouch after the war and ran a butcher's shop in the town.\n\nThe dress was given to Jean in the summer of 1951 shortly before her 11th birthday in the November of that year. The dress was a well loved item and Jean fondly remembers wearing it for Sunday best and also for occasions such as the church fete at the Ashby de la Zouch Bath grounds.\nAs an adult Jean gained a scholarship to the Royal academy of Music in London and became a professional soprano.",
