A fighter against apartheid in South Africa, he was jailed for 28 years. The Nelson and Winnie Mandela Scholarship Fund was established by the University of Sussex Students' Union in 1973 as an initiative to oppose apartheid in South Africa and to provide higher education for South African students. The Students\u2019 Union initially funded one South African scholar every three years, for whom the University agreed to waive tuition fees.  In 1985 an Independent Charitable Trust was founded to administer the fund, and the number of was scholars was increased. The fund has remained close to the Students\u2019 Union and has continued to offer funding for scholars from the southern African region to undertake study at the University of Sussex.",
