            "physical_description": "Summary Description:\nOctagonal box with raised cover set with panels of glass painted and etched with arabesque designs through gold and silver leaf raised on fllat turned feet. The interior is fitted with several compartments with gold edges and painted with a floral design in bright colours. One compartment is lidded.\n\nDesign:\nExterior: The box is composed of a framework of mouldings enclosing the verre eglomise panels. Those on the lid are shaped. The panels are symmetrically placed and are decorated on opposing sides with the same decoration. This arabesque ornament includes baskets of flowers, dolphins, fanciful birds, peacocks, snails, monkeys, rabbits, cornucopia, seerpents and flanking urns. The gold ground gives the whole decoration an effect of contre partie boulle work in its use of similar motifs, though here they are more detailed. The red areas can be read as appearing to imitate tortoiseshell and the blue urns imply hard stones.These effects have been achieved by using coloured silver foil behind the translucent glazes.\nInterior: The inside is fitted with a grid of nine small compartments with two slots for papers surrounding a larger central well with a lift-off lid, which gives access to a shallow well covering the whole base of the box. The interior is stained dark red with gilded edges and the lid with gilded decoration of a bird and foliage. The lid is centrally placed with a red silk lifting tassle. The underside of the lid is decorated with stylised red, blue, orange and mauve flowers including tulips, turkshead lilies, chrysanthemums and gold leaves on a stained red paper ground. The centre of the lid is set with a square frame of gilded moulding which may have contained a mirror.\n\nDecoration: Gold leaf has been applied to the whole of each glass panel, probably using gelatin dissolved in water. The shapes of the ornament have then been scribed onto the leaf. Because of the fragility of the leaf this is unlikely to have been done freehand though what method was used is uncertain.Translucent glazes have then been applied over the top to add colour. A silver leaf or foil has then been applied on top of the pigment to enhance the colour and achieve a foil like appearnce. The two silver pools of water seen on two of the panels would have had  the pool shapes taken out of the gold leaf and then the pattern scribed through the silver leaf and inked in on the silver to define the outlines. \n\nConstruction:\nThe box is built up of poplar or birch boards approximately 1cm thick with the octagonal base set within the sides and the bottom of the sides are nailed to it from underneath.  Each glass panel is framed in moulded ebonised wood, attached to the board by pins and glue. The top is a thin fillet of wood mitred at the corners and stuck on.\nThe inner compartments appear to have been constructed and fitted in the process of making the box. The base of the compartments is composed of three boards; one butt jointed crosswise between the other two and the joints reinforced with a fillet underneath. This structure is set into rebates in the sides of the box as are the vertical divisions. The lid is made of a single board, angled at the front corners to fit the profile of the box. The lid is attached with two cranked iron hinges attached with nails. The lid is composed of two broad boards running accross the sides forming a frame with two narrower boards running at top and bottom of the lid. These are lap jointed. The central raised octagon is built up over the inner edges of these boards behind the gilded central frame, with boards of poplar or bich mitred together and supporting a flat octagonal panel.\nThe framing of the glass panels of the lid are framed and constructed in the same way as the body of the box with overhanging moulding on the lower edge of the lid.\nThere is a metal hasp for a lock set into the top middle to the underside of the lid and evidence of a filled recess on the inside of the front of the box which indicates a lock might have been considered and abandoned.\nThe box rests on eight small flat turned feet.",
