They were known as cream ewers at the time. The evidence for their use in the dining room is limited. The dessert was the last course at dinner and no expense was spared. Silver or gilt cream jugs with richly chased decoration  (decoration worked in high relief)  would have complemented the costly and elaborate dining equipment of dessert. Other vessels for serving cream may support the use of  cream jugs at dinner. Cream boats, which are smaller versions of the sauceboats used on the dining table during the first two courses, appear to confirm the link with the dining room. Contemporary cookery books, designs and paintings suggest that the host might seek to amuse or intrigue guests at the dessert. Surviving novelty creamers, in the form of cows and cream pails, may have served this purpose. The cream jugs allowed diners to pour or spoon cream over their individual portions.\n\nPeople\nThe maker's mark on the jug is that of Aym\u00e9 Videau (active 1723-1775), a silversmith  who was probably of Huguenot (French Protestant emigr\u201a) descent. He made high quality silver that included tea and coffee wares. Several silver cream pails have survived that bear his mark.",
