In this, a zigzag line was made by pushing a narrow chisel across the surface of the metal, and moving it from side to side. Wrigglework was not carried out by trained engravers, but by journeymen working in the pewterers' workshops, almost certainly to cut costs.\n\nHistorical Associations\nTowards the end of the 17th century royal portraits were used to decorate a wide variety of wares in Britain, including pewter.  The portraits appear to have been copied from contemporary coins and medals.  One group of these wares is a series of flat-lidded pewter tankards decorated with royal portraits done in 'wrigglework'.  Thirteen have been recorded so far, eight by one particular maker, who seems to have specialised in their manufacture.\n\nThe Maker\nThe eight tankards are struck with the touch-mark RS. Two London pewterers have been suggested as the maker. The first is Robert Seare, who recorded his touch at Pewterers' Hall in 1669, the second is Rowland Steward, who recorded his touch in 1694.  This pewterer also made a small plate decorated in a similar manner. It is also in the V&A but is not on display in the British Galleries.",
