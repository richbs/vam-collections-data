The Chelsea porcelain factory also made matching Turkish table figures: these were entirely decorative and were set out during the dessert course of grand dinners. This suggests that this figure was also intended for the dessert, and that the shell was intended to contain dry sweetmeats.  However, the Bow porcelain factory also made such figures, and theirs are described as 'Turk salts' on an invoice. This one probably represents a theatrical figure in Turkish dress, not a Turkish woman.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Meissen factory in Germany was the first to make porcelain figures of Turks. These were copied by the English porcelain factories and some were also made in Staffordshire salt-glazed stoneware. The Chelsea porcelain factory copied this figure from a Meissen one modelled by Johann Friedrich Eberlein (1695-1749) in 1746.\n\nTrading\nFigures in Turkish dress were included in London auctions of Chelsea porcelain held in 1755 and 1756. Several pairs of these figures were included in the sale of 1756. Some of these matched groups of theatrical figures in Turkish dress. The 1755 sale also included '2 small figures with scollop shells'.",
