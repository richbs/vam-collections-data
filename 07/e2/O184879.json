Early Trolls were carved from wood however increasing demand saw production switch to soft rubber and vinyl in the early 1960's. Trolls have appeared in all shapes, sizes, and forms, and are immediately identifyable by their tuft of brightly coloured hair. Trolls were imitated by several other companies although they were often of much lower quality. Their popularity peaked in the mid-1960's and then virtually disappeared. The early 1990's saw a new craze for collecting them and as a result many new designs were produced.",
