It is lithographed tinplate and the mechanism is housed in the body with the key bar  protruding from the left side.   It is red with black, blue, yellow, grey and white markings.  The underside is black.  The head of the figure is soft vinyl painted with black hair.\nWhen wound up the whole moves on two wheels set under the centre area and connected to the mechanism; there is a balancing wheel under the feet of the figure.  On the left side is a green plastic ridged knob which may act as a pulley.  (it is possible that the real ploughs were used as stationary engines and the pulley would then have a purpose).\n*This is quite an innovative toy showing the woman working the motorised plough.",
