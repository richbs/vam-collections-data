It shows the portrait of a man with short curling hair, wearing a skull cap and a  close fitting robe fastened up the front. \nGiovanni Bastianini (1830 \u2013 1868) was an Italian sculptor who started as a stonecutter in the quarries at Fiesole. Bastianini's name became famous in relation to his skillfull art forgery.\nBastianini loved Renaissance sculpture and took this for his main inspiration. He worked with a Florentine art and antique dealer where he produced numerous neo-Renaissance works, most often busts and bas-reliefs in the style of Donatello, Verrocchio, Mino de Fiesole and other Italian masters.",
