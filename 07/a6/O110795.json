The print shows an image of the exhibition on the South Bank in London, but the Festival was spread across many other venues through the city, and it was celebrated all round Britain.  The design also refers to the Great Exhibition of 1851 by incorporating silhouettes of the Crystal Palace, which was constructed to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park in London.",
