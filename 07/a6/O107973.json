Instead they were attached to a tape and tied around the waist as separate garments. Worn under the hoops and petticoats, they were accessed through openings in the gown and petticoat seams.\n\n This single pocket of linen is adorned with wool embroidery, reflecting the tradition of British crewel work (wool embroidery) of the late 1600s and early 1700s. However the pointed ends of the petals and leaves show the influence of Indian printed cottons. The embroidery motifs mirror each other on either side of the pocket, but are asymmetrical enough to suggest they were drawn free-hand. Around the pocket opening is a design imitating the kind of metal mount used on furniture of the period.\n\nThere is a slight angle to the top of the pocket implying that it might align to one or other side of the body. It is not clear from the documentation about pockets and images of women wearing them whether they were tied at the front or the back of the waist.",
