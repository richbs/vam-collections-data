Central red indented octagon with a light blue border.  It contains a central dark red star in a yellow octagon surrounded by four dark red blossoms and two brown and two light blue ones.  The ground of the cover is black.  There is a pink ground cartouche along each side; it contains three angular light blue sections; the central one contains an orange cartouche with a blue S-shaped stem and two dark red blossoms; the other two contain a central red blossom between two stylised figures [see other items from group 1 to see the probably origin of this design].  In the lower left hand side one of these figures has been replaced by a leaf.  There is a white lozenge in each corner filled with a blue lozenge and small coloured motifs.  White and orange stylised blossoms surround the main motifs.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; black, orange, pink, grey, light blue, brown, light brown, white, dark red, yellow, red, blue, light green/blue.",
