            "public_access_description": "Tracy Kendall is a designer and maker of bespoke and limited edition wallpapers. Some are hand-crafted and involve sewing buttons, sequins, or slips of paper to a length of paper. Some are straightforward prints, with oversize images of feathers, flowers or cutlery. Others are based on photographic imagery to produce trompe l'oeil representations of objects such as stacks of plates, books, or as here - magazines. Colours, grounds and materials can be varied to suit the client's specifications. Much of her work has been for retail spaces, hotels, and clubs. \n\nKendall's work represents - and indeed pioneered - many of the contemporary trends in wallpaper, notably the idea of wallpaper as work of art and as a feature decoration, rather than a background covering for a whole room. She was also one of the first of the current generation of designer/makers to make wallpaper fashionable by moving away from established conventions and introducing bespoke patterns and motifs, limited (though un-numbered) editions, contemporary imagery, and 'found' motifs and materials. Her designs are witty, elegant, and dramatic.",
