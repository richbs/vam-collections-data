            "historical_context_note": "This tapestry reveals how Andean weavers followed European modes to create hybrid, colonial work. The design combines Andean geometrical motifs with symbols of the Christian church hierarchy. The zigzag design represents the potato flower and vine, a motif known from contemporary native Andean weavings and frequently found on traditional garments. In the centre is a black tasseled hat which may indicate the office of a priest or regional administrator, or an archbishop (Kendrick presumed the last in 1925). The double cross to the right of the hat would have preceded an archbishop in processions. An Andean flower with curved stem, depicted upside-down to the left of the hat, perhaps referred to the pastoral staff. Interspersed among these ecclesiastical symbols are Andean spotted felines, parrots, and running animals, all framed within a traditional Andean band of patterning.\n\nAccording to Elena Phipps (2004), the tapestry weaving is characteristically Andean, with technical features typical of colonial tapestry of this period, including double-sided tapestry weave with single-interlocked colour changes and uncut warp loops. The hatching of the colours to indicate basket forms, the detailing of the birds' wings, and the overall outlining of the motifs may been adapted from European models.\n\nSimilar piece: Textile Museum, Washington, D.C.
