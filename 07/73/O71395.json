The word <i>Proun</i> is an acronym of a Russian phrase meaning 'Project for the Affirmation of the New', and the artist explained the concept in a lecture at 'Inkhuk' (The institute of Artistic Culture) in September 1921 as 'a changing station between painting and architecture'.  It was also in 1921 that Lissitzky taught architecture at Vhkutemas, the Russian Bauhaus, where Vladimir Tatlin was among his colleagues.  Lissitzky developed Suprematism's visual language of pure geometric abstraction and applied it to the Constructivist aim to recreate the world along rational lines, transforming the disciplines of the propaganda poster, book illustration, architecture and exhibition design in the process. \nAfter a successful exhibition of <i>Prouns</i> in Hanover in 1922, organized by the Kestner-Gesellschaft, a society founded in 1916 to promote new art, Lissitzky was commissioned to produce a portfolio of six lithographs which the society published in an edition of fifty in 1923; this print is from that portfolio.  Exploiting the properties of the lithographic process, he adds texture and extends the monochromatic tonal range, heightening the tension and spatial ambiguity of the floating Suprematist forms in the composition.\"",
