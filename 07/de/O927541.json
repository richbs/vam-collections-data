Each cut, E.526 48.5 x 60.5 cm; E.520 50.4 x 63.5 cm\nE.520,526-1890\n\nThese plates reproduce frescoes at the Villa Negroni, Rome, unearthed in 1777. They show decoration similar, although less dotted with whimsical features than some, to the kind that inspired Raphael (see cat. no. 1.9.b) and other artists early in the 16th century.\n\nAs fervour surrounding such archaeological digging increased with the beginning of the excavation of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 1748, such sumptuous publications recording the findings were issued in several languages. The forms they depicted were by no means always accurate but they had an enormous influence on contemporary design. The volumes, however, were intended as much for the connoisseur. That this was particularly so in the case of the exhibited prints is shown by comparing them uncoloured versions. An editing has taken place during the hand-colouring, with the result that the subjects are considerably falsified by the veiling of all genitalia beneath skilfully painted draperies executed in body-colour.'",
