Registered File number 31783/1901.\n\nNote on register:\nRobe of woven silk brocade (kesi) executed in diverse shades of blue relieved by a light buff ground traversed by threads of gold. The decoration consists of five-clawed dragons of bold design pursuing pearls in the midst of scrolling clouds, the cloud interspaces being filled in with longevity (shou) characters and bats of felicity and with the eight symbols of good fortune (pa chi-hsiang) of Buddhist lore. The sleeves and lower border are encircled with the usual striped pattern culminating in waves on which are floating symbols of rank and riches- the ruyi sceptre with jewels, the 'cash' etc.- and the emblems of the four liberal arts: calligraphy, painting, music and chess, all bound with fillets. These finer details of the designs are often filled in with brush-work.",
