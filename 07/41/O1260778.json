David Garrick (1717-1779) played Richard III at London's Goodman's Fields Theatre in 1741 which is a role that made him famous. Garrick played this role again at Drury Lane Theatre in 1792, and Hogarth chose to depict Garrick in this role in 1745, the year that Garrick took over the management of Drury Lane. \n\nThe engraving captures the power of Garrick's acting as he awakes from a nightmare-beleaguered sleep in his tent on the battlefield at Bosworth (Act V, scene iii), and admits his terror about the ensuing battle. He grasps his sword in his left hand while he attempts to fend off the ghosts of his dreams with his right hand. The inclusion of other props and symbols including the portrait of Christ and the suit of armour reveals Hogarth's desire for this to be seen as a serious history painting as much as a portrait of Garrick the actor.\n\nDavid Garrick (1717-1779) was recognised during his lifetime as one of the greatest actors ever in both comedy and tragedy. He was born in Hereford, came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but made his London debut as an actor at Goodman's Fields as Richard III in 1741. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted in many of his most famous roles during his lifetime, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810).",
