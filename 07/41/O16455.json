He first established himself as an artist in England, but then went to work in Paris. There he flourished and used the watercolour medium in an original way. His contemporaries noticed and admired his work, even though his working life lasted only eight years.\n\nThis watercolour is a typical example of his technique. It is surprisingly lively considering that he based it on a drawing. In the Italian city of Verona he made several drawings that he later worked up into watercolours.",

            "bibliography": "<i>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</i>London: V&A, 1985, p.116\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Richard Parkes Bonington 1802-1828\n<i>British School</i> \nCORSO SANT' ANAST ASIA, VERONA \nWater-colour, 23,5 X 15.8 cm \nSigned <i>RPB.1826</i> \n3047-1876. <i>William Smith Bequest.</i> \n \nDuring a tragically brief career Bonington produced a large <i>oeuvre</i> of historical pictures, highly regarded in their time, as well as the many atmospheric landscapes in oil and watercolour on which his reputation chiefly rests today. Bonington was born in 1802, the year of the Peace of Amiens, during which English topographical artists, including Turner and Girtin, flocked to travel abroad seeking picturesque views in war-ravaged Napoleonic Europe. Following the peace of 1815 Bonington accompanied his father, a landscape and portrait painter, to France. There he became a pupil of Louis Francia in Calais and later of Baron Gros in Paris. Of all English artists of the period Bonington seems to have had the greatest sympathy with, and in turn some influence upon French painters. French interest in English landscape and water-colour painting was at its height during the 'Anglomania' of the 1820s when Parisian connoisseurs and painters 'discovered' Turner and Constable, whilst Bonington under the influence of Delacroix's painterly and romantic work took up oils in about 1824 and executed lithographs for the celebrated illustrated book, <i>Voyages Pittoresques.</i> \n\nBonington travelled widely, visiting Italy for the first time in 1822 and again in 1826, from which year dates this watercolour of Verona. It shows the Corso Sant'Anastasia and the Palace of Principe Maffei, and is a typical view of picturesque old buildings surrounded by the bustling life of the populace wearing colourful costumes much favoured by Bonington and his fellow romantic topographers such as Thomas Shotter Boys and Samuel Prout.\n\nStephen Calloway\"",
