Although Shounsai was never directly involved in the Japan Craft Design Association, exhibiting at the Nitten exhibition and from the mid-1960s at the Traditional Crafts Exhibition, he had an underlying interest in the functionality as well as the expressive possibilities of basketry and bamboowork. This revealed itself in the increasingly simple but powerful forms that he produced during his later years.\nAlthough the making of non-woven bamboo items remains a largely artisanal activity, there is a long-established tradition in the tea ceremony of individuals fashioning their own tea scoops and flower vases out of bamboo. The relative simplicity of the processes involved makes bambooworking an ideal focus for the untrained amateur, and the bamboo utensils made by former tea devotees are valued as a direct reflection of their taste and disposition. Seen in this light, Shounsai's vase may be interpreted as an especially charged manifestation of his artistic personality.",
