A terracotta and a plaster model for this bust are still to be seen there. Although these works are unsigned, the sculptor is almost certainly Ren\u00e9-Michel (Michelange) Slodtz, who was a friend of the sitter.\n\nMichelange Slodtz was one of five sons of the sculptor S\u00e9bastien Slodtz. He won first prize for Sculpture at the Acad\u00e9mie in Paris and went to Rome two years later, where he stayed until 1746 when he returned to Paris. In Rome, he was profoundly influenced by the sculpture around him and particularly by the work of Bernini. This bust, and above all its confident and energetic depiction of drapery, shows both the elegance of Bernini's work as well as a remarkable skill in handling marble. Slodtz became the most distinguished French sculptor in Rome at the time.",

A terracotta and a plaster model for this bust is still to be seen there.\n\nThis bust was attributed to the German sculptor Willem de Groff (d.1742) when it was inventoried in 1952. In his publication on the Slodtz family (1967), Fran\u00e7ois Souchal attributed the terracotta and plaster busts, referred to above, to Michelange Slodtz. Terence Hodgkinson (1972) supported this attribution for the V&A marble bust and firmly identified the sitter as a result of  Souchal's work. However, in 1982, having by then seen the marble at the V&A, Souchal re-attributed it to Pierre Lestache (1687-1774).  In 1995 there was another unpublished suggestion that this bust was by Coustou. However, Souchal's attribution to Lestache has been rejected by the most recent scholarship (Anne-Lise Desmas, 2002) and the bust re-attributed by her to Slodtz.",
