The cup had to be drained in one go and upturned.\n\nThis cup has silver mounts and lining. Silver featured in all aspects of a gentleman\u2019s daily life, from the morning toilet to an evening at his club. Personal silver was commonly engraved with armorials or a crest, a name or initials. The less affluent would aspire to a few small pieces of silver, perhaps a pair of shoe buckles, a snuff box and a watch.",
