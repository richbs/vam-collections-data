It was made in about 1865 and looks like a building, with columns supporting a decorated roof. Both the sturdy construction and the architectural form are examples of the Gothic Revival style. The front is enamelled with patterns inspired by Celtic designs.\n\nPeople\nBruce Talbert (1838-1881) was a very successful commercial designer who designed metalwork, furniture, textiles, carpets, wallpapers and stained glass. His influential book, 'Gothic Forms Applied to Furniture, Metal Work and Decoration for Domestic Purposes', published in 1868, illustrated a range of designs in the Gothic Revival style. He worked on both architectural schemes and on furniture for Skidmores of Coventry, prominent manufacturers of architectural metalwork, who made this clock in about 1865.\n\nTime\nThe Gothic Revival style was very popular in the 1860s and 1870s in Britain. It is characterised by the use of architectural forms and details, often taken from ecclesiastical sources, for domestic objects. This clock, which looks like a building, shows how commercial designers and manufacturers used the Gothic Revival style.",
