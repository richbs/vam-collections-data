Pugin designed it in collaboration with the Birmingham manufacturer John Hardman & Co. Most of their  designs were for church furnishings.\n\nDesign & Designing\nA.W.N. Pugin may have seen dishes with similar ornament in Italy, which he visited in 1847, a year before this piece was made. The manufacturers' ledger entry, dated  18 April 1848, records:  'Large Silver Dish in Florentine Pattern, with enamels in Centre of Arms. Dish beaten in sections etc. \u00a337.15s'. The design originally came from Germany. Brass dishes from centres such as Nuremberg were exported and copied all over Europe between 1475 and 1525.\n\nPeople\nIn 1847, A.W.N. Pugin wished to marry Helen Lumsdaine, a vicar's daughter, who promised to convert to Roman Catholicism. Her family did not approve and Henry Benson, a friend and neighbour of A.W.N. Pugin, tried unsuccessfully to reconcile the bride's family to the marriage. He was given the dish as a token of A.W.N. Pugin's gratitude.",
