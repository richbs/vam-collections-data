It was made to commemorate the death of the respected General Lieutenant Sergei Leonidovich Markov, who died on June 13th, 1918. Though the poster bears a simple image of the military leader, as do many White Russian posters, its propagandistic message is conveyed through the quote printed throughout the page. Said to be the General's last words, the message is a patriotic rallying cry to continue supporting the army under General Denikin's leadership, which will one day deliver the nation from the \"humiliation\" of Bolshevism. White Army posters often targeted a literate audience, whereas Bolshevik posters targeted a more inclusive audience through the reliance on evocative images.",
