Louis acceded to the throne in 1643 when he ws barely five years old and reigned until 1715. \n\nThis portrait was probably made around 1660, when the king was in his early 20s. Later to be known as the Sun King, the young monarch was asserting himself as absolute ruler. Around this date he started to rebuild the extravagant Ch\u00e2teau of Versailles, which was later to become his court and seat of government. The importance of valour, glory and military strength as virtues of sovereignty are reflected in the bust - traits that emulated Louis's grandfather, Henri IV. The mantle is richly decorated with fleur-de-lys and he wears armour adorned with the Order of Saint-Esprit on which the 'Hs' in the chain represent Henri III, who founded the Order in 1578. Under Louis XIV, the Order became the highest honour bestowed on a subject. \n\nLouis can also be seen as a leader of fashion with his periwig, and the thin moustache, that the King himself made popular in the 1660s.  The stiff, narrow collar was also of its time, replacing the wide lace of the earlier period.",
