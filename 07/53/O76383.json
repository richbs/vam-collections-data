The design is universally found on interlocked tapestries; \"blixtr\u00f6lakan\". Its beautiful zigzagging spectrum of colours made it a very popular design. It is also referred to as a 'crest', 'water' or 'tufted duck' design.\n'Halvkrabba' is a Swedish term for a brocaded tabby with the pattern weft floating across the whole pattern motif, tied down along its outline by the ground weft picks, one or several, which are shuttled in between the inlays. The pattern units in 'halvkrabba' are small squares combined ina checkerboard pattern. Usually found in combination with other techniques, used especially in coverlets, bench runners and bed curtains.\nThe Association of Friends of Textile Art (Handarbetets V\u00e4nner) was formed in 1874, \"in patriotic spirit and alignment promote the textile craft in Sweden\". The Association established a pattern studio and distributed assignments to weavers all over the country.",
