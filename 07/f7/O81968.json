XII, no. 33; Reynolds 1959, pl. X, no. 16 ('said to be the artist's wife'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 22; Murdoch 1981, p. 151, pl. 26b; Reynolds 1988, p. 70, fig. 36. \n\nWhile the miniature was in the Joseph Collection the sitter was identified as the artist's wife. When it came with the rest of the Collection to the Museum in 1941, Carl Winter dismissed the identification, pointing out in notes on the file that Flatman was married in 1672, eleven years after the date of this portrait. \n\nAnother idea was offered by Elizabeth Walsh: 'I made enquiries re - two miniatures by Flatman - Charles Beale, 1661 [sic J and the one listed as \"An Unknown Woman\" of the same date, which 1 am convinced is Mary Beale, at the age of twenty-eight ... I based my deductions on the drawing at the British Museum, of Mary Beale as a girl, and the self-portraits from the NPG and Hugh Beale, both of which, though of Mary at a much later date, bear a striking resemblance to this miniature. Also the whole setting of the miniature struck me as complementary to that of Charles Beale [Cat. No. 117], and it is known that such a miniature of Mary was painted in the same year.' (1) Walsh, in her subsequent work on the Beales (2) did not refer to this idea again, so had perhaps abandoned it. \n\nFor Mary Beale, comparison would have to be with a) <i>Self-portrait</i>, c.1666 (NPG); b) <i>Self-portrait</i>, c.1675 (Anon. collection); c) <i>Self-portrait</i>, 1681 (Mrs Whitely); d) <i>Portrait drawing</i> by Charles Beale (BM), 3 e) <i>Self-portrait</i>, miniature, c.1678-80.(4) On this range of comparison, the sitter for this miniature seems to be younger than twenty-eight, considerably thinner and less placid in appearance than Mary Beale. It cannot therefore be the miniature assumed to be referred to in Charles Beale's 'almanack' for 1661 - 'given several wages to Mr Flatman for Limning my own picture. My D. Malls father Cradock & the Boyes - 30 II. o.o _'; (5) Although not of Mary, and not a pair with Cat. No. 117, the miniature does indeed closely resemble the other portraits of members of the Beale circle painted by Flatman at this time. \n\nCould she however be Alice Beale, Charles's first cousin, the daughter of his maternal uncle the Revd Theodore Beale? She was with the Beales in 1661 and was married to Samuel Woodforde on 10 October of the same year. John Tillotson, subsequently Archbishop of Canterbury, a close friend of Woodforde, Beale and Flatman, took the service. The couple remained resident with the Beales after the marriage; Alice died giving birth to her son Heighes Woodforde in 1664 and was much mourned by her husband. \n\nApart from the question of identity, this miniature raises the interesting question of how Flatman has been valued by the historians and critics. Long clearly admired Flatman greatly and referred to Mrs Joseph's two miniatures as 'excellent examples'. Reynolds, however, says of Flatman in his earliest works that 'he copies with extreme literalness the characteristics of the duller type of Cooper portrait, and in the process loses much of the power of the original'. (6) The two ex- Joseph miniatures are reproduced by Reynolds to demonstrate this. Mrs Foskett adopts this judgement as her own: 'His work shows the influence of Samuel Cooper ... particularly in the earlier miniatures which show the characteristics of the duller type of Cooper's portraits. Examples of this period are Signed and dated portraits such as those of Samuel Woodford [ sic] ... an unknown man dated \" 1662\" and Charles Beale, sen., both in the V&AM. These examples are good but uninspired portraits, painted in a more hesitant manner than Flatman's later works. They tend to have brownish flesh colour which is unattractive. Often his miniatures have a sky background, the blue being harsher than that used by Cooper.' (7) \n\nTo my eye, however, these miniatures are clearly beautiful and are painted with complete technical assurance. It is true that they are inconceivable without Cooper, for no one painting miniatures in the early 1660s could remain unaffected by his brilliant graphic virtuosity. But interestingly, they suggest also a consciousness of the younger Hoskins, or at least that artist who used the IH monogram from the later 1640s and through the 1650s in such portraits as the <i>Wildman</i> (Cat. No. 33), the <i>Duke of Hamilton</i> (Earl of Haddington), <i>A Cleric aged 67</i> (formerly Pfungst Collection) and Sir John Maynard (formerly Pierpont Morgan Collection). The characteristics of the early Flatman - the bright blue of the sky, the use of landscape backgrounds, and the tendency to view the sitter from slightly below and place the figure back from the margins of the oval- are all equally characteristic of the younger Hoskins and may suggest a tutorial relationship. In any case, the resulting images are certainly not simply imitative of Cooper. More subjectively, they seem also very different in sentiment. The nature of the eye contact between artist and sitter in the present miniature surely has an unguarded transparency different from that visible in professional portraits of grandees; the sitter's expression is one of domestic familiarity rather than proud or polite formality. Historians may differ as to the extent to which the later seventeenth century saw a rise in affective relationships within or around the family: what is perhaps new c.1660, and in this social milieu, is the tendency to record or exemplify the virtuous domestic affections in art. Before Flatman painted Charles Beale, his darling wife, her father and the two boys, together with their close friend Samuel Woodforde and possibly his new wife, there are very few such visual documents of bourgeois domesticity. By the early eighteenth century they are normal. \n\n1 Letter of 17 December 1951 in department files. \n2 <i>Connoisseur</i>, CXXXI (March 1953),pp. 3-8 and CXLIX (April 1962),pp. 248-52; and Walsh and Jeffree 1975-6. \n3 Foster 1914--16, vol.I, pI.
