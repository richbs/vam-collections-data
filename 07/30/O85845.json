Abrams, Inc. with The Baltimore Museum of Art, 1997, cat. no. 61\nLike the gilt bronze figure of Meleager (cat. 59), this expressive head was acquired by John Pope-Hennessy, who recognised its significance as one of the few surviving models by Benvenuto Cellini, the most celebrated of Italian Renaissance sculptor-goldsmiths. In Greek myth, the Gorgons Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa (the only mortal of the three) were hideous sisters, winged and snake-haired, who turned all who looked at them to stone. Cellini's famed monumental statue of Perseus (fig. 91) shows the hero holding the head of Medusa, with hair of writhing snakes, after he had beheaded the Gorgon with the aid of a reflection in the polished bronze surface of his shield (the gift of the goddess Athena) so as to avoid her deadly gaze.\n\tThe Perseus was commissioned by Cosimo I de' Medici in 1541 when Cellini returned to Florence from France but was not finished until 1554 when it was placed in the Loggia dei Lanzi in the Piazza della Signoria in the centre of the city. Because of its prominent site it is familiar to every visitor to Florence but its fame, and its position as the sculptor's masterpiece, were assured by the vivid account of its commissioning and casting given in Cellini's autobiography. Cellini reported in his Life that Duke Cosimo responded enthusiastically to the artist's suggestion of Perseus as a subject (the hero Perseus was a dynastic emblem of the Medici, first adopted by Cosimo's predecessor Alessandro de' Medici). When presented with a model in wax (now in the Museo Nazionale in Florence) Cosimo declared: \"If you could translate this little model, Benvenuto, into a full-scale work, it would be the finest piece in the Piazza.\" This was a high compliment - as well as a purposeful challenge - to Cellini since the dominant works then on the Piazza della Signoria were two acclaimed masterpieces, Michelangelo's David and Donatello's Judith (with the head of Holofernes), the latter positioned as a pendant to the site Cosimo designated for Cellini's Perseus.\n\tThe finished statue rose an imposing seventeen feet from the bottom of its base to the top of Perseus's left hand gripping the head of Medusa, with gore hanging from its severed head and blood spewing from the headless body's neck. Pope-Hennessy writes convincingly that Cellini's \"purpose was to depict not a dead but a newly decapitated body, with blood pouring from its neck and still coursing through its veins, an Amazon so powerful that the magnitude of Perseus' achievement stood in no doubt.\" Contemporaries were astonished at the fearsome realism of these details of the Perseus, one reporting that \"Though metal, it seemed like human blood, and one stood aside for fear of being splashed by it.\" The new sculpture was an unqualified success with the populace (it was a tradition of the time, based on classical precedent, to \"test\" public work on its public audience and, depending on the response, modify the work accordingly before committing it to permanent installation); and Cellini was praised by fellow artists, scholars, and poets, one of whom declared that \"the bronze Perseus turned the onlooker to marble,\" while another compared Cellini \"to a star which in the star-strewn sky outshone the other stars.\"\n\tBetween the making of the first wax model shown to Cosimo and the casting of the full-scale bronze, Cellini made many other models - almost all now lost - some of which, rather unusually, were in bronze. One of them (now in the Museo Nazionale) was for the head of Medusa - for which the artist's mistress Dorotea was the model - and, sharing some features of the early wax and others of the finished statue, had long been accepted as a model by Cellini. When a second model of Medusa's head with the hand and wrist of Perseus appeared in the 1960s, Pope-Hennessy recognised its similarities to the bronze head in Florence, suggesting that this newly discovered piece might be the \"head of Medusa, of bronze\" recorded in the inventory of Cellini's studio at the sculptor's death. His rigorous analysis of the material and documentary evidence led him to conclude that this was \"not only an autograph sculpture by Cellini but . . . a sketch-model for the head of Medusa in his masterpiece, the Perseus.\" It was acquired by the Museum and placed alongside the Italian Renaissance sculptors' models purchased by J. C. Robinson almost exactly a century earlier. Subsequent thermoluminescent testing of the clay \"core\" within the head established that the bronze must have been cast between 1415 and 1570, a period that spans the ten years when Cellini is known to have been working on the Perseus.\n\nLit.
