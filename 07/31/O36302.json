It is cast in two halves down the length and held by tongue and slot joints. The rider is separately attached to the back of the horse and has painted oriental features which are very unusual. It is white with red; green yellow and orange trim. The\nbody contains the mechanism and when wound the tail of the horse and the lasso both spin. The key bar protrudes from the left side. \n2. ring of metal; with a coil in the centre which sits on the post; it is painted yellow. \n*There are no marks on the toy; but the obvious 'Japanese' look of the rider suggests the country of origin. Most of these toys were destined for the west and rarely had such facial characteristics.",
