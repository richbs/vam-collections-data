The devastation caused by the Paris Commune, the heavy reparations demanded by Prussia, and the loss of almost 15,000 square kilometres of territory, including Alsace and Lorraine, made the resumption of normal jewellery production seem frivolous.  Instead many silversmiths turned their hands to patriotic jewellery.\n\nThis locket mourns the loss of Alsace-Lorraine.  The two shields bear the coats of arms of the two regions, linked by the chains which now confined them.  The ivy leaves stand for remembrance, and the anchor for hope.  The broken edge of the plaque with the word \u2018France\u2019 is a visual expression of an incomplete and damaged nation.  There could be no better souvenir to put on show at the International Exhibition in London in 1872 by the French Commissioners, where it was bought by the Museum for 17 shillings.",
