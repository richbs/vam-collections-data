It was probably intended for fruit or other sweet foodstuffs served during the dessert course.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Bow factory's engraver copied the figure scene from A New Book of Chinese Designs (1754). This was published by the engraver, designer and 'Professor of Ornament' Matthew (Matthias) Darly (1741-1780), together with the ornithologist George Edwards (1694-1773).  It was reported in the Art Journal in 1869 that a personal copy of this book along with various papers associated with a Bow factory employee named John Bowcock were known to have survived together. The book has since disappeared and the papers scattered to private and public collections.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Bow factory made a type of porcelain strengthened with ashes from animal bones. The result was a comparatively durable ceramic material, one that was suitable for utilitarian wares. The factory made large quantities of inexpensively decorated porcelain, which was aimed at the middle-ranges of the market. Most of this was painted in underglaze blue, but some was overglaze printed, as here.",
