He was Deputy Clerk of the Houses of Parliament and Clerk Assistance of the House of Lords. \nChantrey excelled in the carving of drapery, as well as in conveying the character of the sitter, seen here in the thoughful facial expression. The drapery evokes the toga worn by the citizens of ancient Rome, suggesting Cowper's role as a public servant.\n\nSir Francis Legatt Chantrey (1781-1842) was an English sculptor, painter, and patron. He was probably the most successful portrait sculptor of his day. Together with Flaxman Chantrey can be ranked as England's greatest sculptor engaging in portrait busts and statues. He was particularly skilled in carving drapery. On his death he left a fortune of \u00a3150,000 which was later bequeathed to the Royal Academy to be used for the 'Encouragement of British Fine Art in Painting and Sculpture'.",
