It is simply carved and partly painted in green and black with black lines on the `sheet'. The facial\nfeatures are indicated by two pink cheek dots; black dot eyes and a red mouth. The figure appears slightly bent with a pointed hat and a triangular shape. It has been varnished and nailed to a roughly carved base. \nA N Varganov is a well known and internationally known maker of these toys. His work is represented in other museums in the USA; Australia; Japan and Germany. He comes from a traditional craft family making these types of toys; both wooden and papier mach\u00e9; from before 1900.",
