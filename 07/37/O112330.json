            "public_access_description": "The effectiveness of French artillery during the Napoleonic Wars was due in large part to the standardisation of calibres, carriages and equipment by Jean Baptiste de Gribeauval in the mid 18th century. The 'Gribeauval system' was adopted throughout the European states subject to French rule, including Holland. French military theory and equipment remained influential throughout the mid to late 19th century and cannon following this system continued to be produced up to ca. 1860.\n  \nDutch cannon from the trading ship 'de Liefde' were used by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogunate appreciated the effectiveness of European artillery and periodically purchased guns and mortars from the Dutch from the 1600's onwards, though they were used more for defensive purposes. The transmission of Western science and technical studies to Japan came via the Dutch trading enclave established on Nagasaki, so much so that it came to be known as 'Dutch learning'. \n\nThe design of this cannon may well have come to Japan through such channels. It has none of the characteristic marks indicating that it is of European manufacture. That, together with the metal composition, suggests it must be a Japanese copy. There is no date, but the lack of a tangent rear sight and the small calibre suggests that it is based on an example cast around the 1820's which had been phased out of French military service by the 1860's.",

This system was applied in other state arsenals under French control, and allowed French Napoleonic armies to dominate the battlefields of the early 19th century.",
