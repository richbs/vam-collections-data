Walpole collected the ivory plaques for this cabinet while on his Grand Tour in Italy."

It was conceived as a miniature 'Classical Temple of Worthies' supporting ivory figures of  three of  Walpole's artistic heroes, the architects Andrea Palladio (1518-1580) and Inigo Jones (1573-1652) and the sculptor Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy (about 1594-1643).\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe cabinet was commissioned by Horace Walpole on his return from the Grand Tour to incorporate a series of ivory plaques representing classical authors or derived from antique gems. The pediment top is unusual for a small-scale cabinet and was inspired by contemporary Palladian architecture. J.F. Verskovis, a Flemish sculptor, supplied the ivory statuettes and also carved the ivory eagle heads and the adjacent festoons of fruit and flowers in padouk wood.\n\nPlaces\nThe cabinet was originally displayed in Horace Walpole's house in Arlington Street, London. In the early 1760s it was moved to his country residence, Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, where it formed the centrepiece of the Tribune, a room in which some of the most precious small objects in his collection were displayed.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis richly decorated cabinet was made to house the portrait miniatures collected by the connoisseur Horace Walpole and, through both its original contents and the images of artists represented on its exterior, was from the start conceived as a statement about the history of art in England. Its own later history, including its acquisition and use by the Museum, reveals not only how English art has been revalued in the twentieth century but also the symbolic role accorded to Walpole in this process. As well as gathering together some of the most informative sources about eighteenth-century and earlier English art, Walpole was an important patron and collector, his most notable achievement being his Gothic Revival house at Strawberry Hill and the works displayed there.\nThe cabinet was described by Walpole in 1743 as a \"new\ncabinet for my enamels and miniatures,\" designed by himself, possibly with the assistance of the architect William Kent. It is decorated with the owner's arms and surmounted by ivory figures of three earlier artists whom Walpole held in especially high esteem: the Flemish sculptor Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy (1594-1644), flanked by two architects-Andrea Palladio (1508-1580) and Inigo Jones (1573-1652)-whose designs formed the basis for the neo-Palladian style in mid-eighteenth-century England. The ivory figures were carved by the otherwise unknown Verskovis after models by Michael Rysbrack (cat. 137). Most of the ivory reliefs of classical subjects were by Andrea Pozzo, who worked in eighteenth-century Rome mainly for British patrons on the grand tour, and these were probably acquired by Walpole himself in Italy in 1740. The Judith relief was erroneously, if significantly, thought by Walpole to be by the seventeenth-century English sculptor Grinling Gibbons, who carved the cravat also in his collection (cat. 135).\n\tThe cabinet was first placed in Walpole's London house in Arlington Street around 1743 but was moved to Strawberry Hill in the early 1760s (fig. 114). As E. Edwards's drawing of 1781 shows, it there formed the centrepiece of a room in which some of the most precious small objects in the collection were displayed; these included miniatures by Hans Holbein and Isaac Oliver. Through both its contents and its external imagery, the cabinet was used in this context as a statement about English art and aesthetic ideals. The English miniatures inside were presented as the equal of the works of ancient art reproduced in ivory on the outside.\nThe piece, sold with Walpole's collection in 1842, was purchased by the V&A in 1925 at a period when new interest was being shown in Walpole and his collection. This parallels the enthusiasm for eighteenth-century English culture at this date in Britain and the United States, one notable outcome being the beginning of the forty-eight-volume Yale edition of Walpole's correspondence. Employed by Walpole to frame his collection of earlier English works, the cabinet has been used in evolving Museum settings to exemplify eighteenth-century English taste.\n\nLit.
