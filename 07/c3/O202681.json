A pincushion was potentially useful as well as symbolic, because even baby clothes in the UK were often fastened with ordinary pins until the successful marketing of the safety pin in the 1870s.  \n\nIn some areas it was considered very unlucky to give the pincushion before the birth: not only was this over confidence that the outcome would be successful, but there was a superstition about pins and birth pain. 'For every pin a pain' and 'More pins, more pain' were traditional sayings, and some women would remove all the pins, no matter how elaborate the pattern.",
