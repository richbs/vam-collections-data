The only dated evidence is a drawing for the elevation by Edward Stevens, dated 1769, in Stockholm (Harris 1970, pl.127). Chambers's designs were not used, and the palace was extended by Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz between 1770 and 1773. Chambers's only reward was to be made a Knight in the Order of the Polar Star in 1770. Chambers did, however, exhibit a design for the palace at the Royal Academy in 1775. Early in 1774, Chambers was given the commission to design the park, and sent proposals to the Swedish Envoy in London and, later the same year, directly to Sweden. It seems that little or nothing of those schemes was executed, although a garden in the English taste was made. This design is probably drawn by an office hand.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
