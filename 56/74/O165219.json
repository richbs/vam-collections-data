Although there was a long tradition in England of embroidering bed hangings in wool, this example shows the influence of painted cotton textiles from India which were imported during the seventeenth century.  The characteristic hillocks along the bottom of the curtain derive from rock motifs common to these Indian textiles.  Despite their novelty, and the long distance they had travelled, such cottons were affordable and were often used for bed hangings.  Curtains made from linen, with wool embroidery, however, would have been warmer and more hard-wearing.  A curtain like this shows how fashion was rendered practical for everyday use.\n\nThe range of colours used in the embroidery is limited, but texture and interest are created with a wide range of filling stitches, including chain, feather, button-hole and coral stitch.  None of these stitches is difficult, but the masterly way in which the embroiderer has selected different techniques to enhance the design shows considerable skill.",
