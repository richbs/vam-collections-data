The materials for playing this Game are, a Teetotum, which is to be numbered with pen and ink; twelve letters, or markers, to place on the numbers at which each player stands in the Game; and two dozen fish or counters for each, which may be pieces of card, or any other substance.\nII.  Let the letters be placed on the table, face downwards; and each player draw one, which is to be his marker.  Whoever has the earliest letter in the alphabet, is to spin first, and the others follow in rotation.\nIII . Each player must put six counters into the pool.\nIV.  Let the first player spin, and, placing his marker on the Game according to the number turned up, refer to the Chronology of Events, and observe the directions there given.\nV.   Whenever a player is directed to read the history of any event in another page, he shall have the privilege, after so doing, of spinning again, and be rewarded with a counter from each player.\nVI.  The fines placed on any number are only to be taken by those who arrive at it by spinning; and not when sent from another number; neither are the directions to be then observed.\nVII. If two persons arrive at the same number, the last comer shall return to his former place, and receive two from the first for so doing. (This is the opposite to that of Game of Human Life)..\nVIII.After the Game has gone once round, the first player is to spin again, and add that number which turns up to his f ormer one.  Thus, if he were at 8, and at his second spin turn up 6, he moves to 14; and in this manner proceed till some one arrive at 139; but whoever goes beyond that must return to his former place, till some one arrive at the lucky number, who takes all the counters and wins the game.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWithin the booklet is a list of the squares; their titles and the dates applied to each, for example ANNO MUNDI 1 The creation of the World and  AM 1656 The Universal Deluge..\n\nAlso within the booklet are the OUTLINES OF HISTORY given for some but not all the squares.  These also contain some rewards and forfeits instructions and in general are meant to be read aloud by the players who land on the chosen squares.\n\nRules placement: booklet, 34 pages with two pages of advertisements",
