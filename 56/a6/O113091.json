Between 1856 and 1860 he made three expeditions to Egypt and the Holy Land, and the resulting photographs were widely circulated and popular for their topographical and architectural content. In 1857, he wrote: \u2018The decay or demolition of ancient remains, and the changes now at last destroying Eastern art and national peculiarities, make the present time of the highest value for taking such views.\u2019\n\nFrith used wet collodion-on-glass negatives, which were introduced in 1851. Collodion is a light-sensitive solution of ether and guncotton (cotton steeped in nitric and sulphuric acids). It was poured onto glass pates and had to be exposed in the camera while still wet. This process yielded a high level of detail in the image but using wet plates proved difficult in the intense heat of Egypt.",
