            "public_access_description": "In 1710 Meissen, near Dresden in eastern Germany, became the first European factory to make \u2018true\u2019 porcelain of the type made in East Asia, sometimes known in the West as \u2018hard-paste\u2019 porcelain. The discovery was made by an alchemist, Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger (1682-1719), who had been imprisoned by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland (1670-1733), and who achieved this working in collaboration with scientists and geologists at the Saxon court in Dresden. The earliest Meissen porcelains were made with kaolin in combination with alabaster, which replaced the china stone (petuntse) used at Jingdezhen; they are a distinctive cream colour and are often known as \u2018B\u00f6ttger porcelain\u2019. \n\nUntil about 1720 comparatively little \u2018B\u00f6ttger porcelain\u2019 had painted decoration: the factory struggled to master the enamelling technology, and painting in underglaze blue was not achieved until 1717, when a small bowl painted in blue was presented to Augustus the Strong. Instead, most \u2018B\u00f6ttger porcelain\u2019 featured the combination of sparingly applied relief decoration set against large areas of undecorated porcelain, as here. Some time before 1730 the factory changed its formula (eliminating the alabaster), making it whiter and closer to the material made at Jingdezhen. \n\nThis vessel is based on the shape of a Japanese sake bottle, which was reproduced in both B\u00f6ttger\u2019s porcelain and his red stoneware or 'Jasper porcelain', which was inspired by Chinese Yixing pottery, and which had been in production at Meissen since 1710. It would have been intended solely for display. The applied figure decoration is copied from reliefs by the sixteenth-century German medallist Peter Fl\u00f6tner.",
