            "public_access_description": "This poster was designed by design duo Michael English and Nigel Waymouth, known as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. In the late 1960s they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nThe Crazy World of Arthur Brown was an English psychedelic rock band formed by singer Arthur Brown in 1967. Their song \"Fire\" (released in 1968 as a single and on the group's only album) was one of the one-hit wonders in the UK and U.S. of the 1960s, although Arthur Brown followed up this song with three albums with the band Kingdom Come. The band toured the US with Jimi Hendrix and Arthur Brown was notable for his theatrics, including setting a specially made helmet on fire, and stripping off naked on stage.",
