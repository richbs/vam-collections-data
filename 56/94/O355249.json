Flat shoes of red  and yellow leather. Semi-pointed toe and round  heel. Turned technique with rand. Sole straight.  Upper: Possibly coated post-excavation with  unknown substance as discoloured and sticky to  touch. Vamp elaborately decorated with cut out, red  leather, floral and bird in the tree motif stitched onto  a separate layer of gold covered leather. The birds  have a short beak and look backwards over their  shoulder.  Instep decorated with diamonds and  stripes where leather has been cut away to leave  raised design. This band of decoration is V shaped.  Quarters' top turned over and sewn with running  stitch. Quarters have two incised, horizontal lines  running round to the heel, where it meets four  incised vertical lines either side of the back seam.  High throat ends over instep with round knop.\n\nCoptic footwear was generally made of leather, primarily using the turned technique to produce a slipper or shoe with a straight sole. Slippers often included a rand at the vamp and a fibre padded sole sewn together with prominent stitching or insole tab. They show variation in the form and height of the instep. Shoes were generally slip-ons and also show variation in the form and height of the instep. Footwear was highly decorated in geometric and floral designs. Often a variety of techniques were used in combination with the most popular being dyeing, gilding, openwork and appliqu\u00e9.",
