Consisting of the album cover hanging from a printed card, it would have been designed to display in record shops to bring attention to the new release.\n\nNew Boots and Panties!! was recorded by Ian Dury before he had a record contract. He recorded it in his manager's studio during 'dead time' - when the studio was empty, usually late at night. His management company tried to shop the album around, but could not find anybody to publish the album due to Dury's lack of commercial appeal, even during the year that punk broke. It came down to recently formed label Stiff Records, who had also just signed Elvis Costello, to licence the album and release it to great acclaim. Although it never reached the top 10, it gained platinum sales status in the UK.",
