            "public_access_description": "These are two components of a steel water-pipe. The bowl contained the burning tobacco, and the base was filled with water, which was used to cool the tobacco smoke. They were connected by tubes. The tube attached to the side of the base ended in a mouth-piece for the smoker. The verses in gold compare the smoke of the pipe to the lover\u2019s sigh.\n\nIranian water-pipes made of steel invariably have this form, i.e. ovoid with a pointed projection on the base. This is a particularly fine example.",
