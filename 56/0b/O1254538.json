The demand for 'antique' vases was so great that, in addition to copying surviving Classical antiquities, manufacturers copied designs from prints of the 17th and 18th centuries.  This vase whose shape derives from classical Greek pottery, is decorated with 'The Dancing Hours', personifications of the hours of the day, a design which also derives from Antiquity.  It is thought that John Flaxman junior (1755-1826), the talented young sculptor who worked for Wedgwood, adapted the design from a print by Bartoli of 1693 published in 1722.  This decoration of elegant classical ladies dancing in different poses proved to be very popular and was used by Wedgwood on various kinds of pottery, including plaques for chimeypieces and teapots.\n\nMaterials &amp; Making \nThe vase is made of Black Basalt, one of several types of pottery that Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) introduced or refined. The black colour came from 'Carr', an oxide of iron suspended in water that had flowed through coal seams and mines.",
