One of 12 drawings in an album for neo-classical boxes in the 'gout grec' (Greek taste) style by the same hand; their Museum Numbers are: E.897:32,33,36,37,38,93,94,95,98,99,100-1988.  Such designs were possibly for elite clients of the Court of Louis XVI, King of France from 1715 to 1774, at Versailles.\n\nThe drawings are from an album of designs, dating from about 1735-1820, for a range of objects including snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached). \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
