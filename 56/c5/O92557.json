At his back is the same person dying, his figure emaciated, with ribcage visible beneath the skin and an open mouth as if gasping for breath; on a fillet the words 'VADO MORI'. The third figure appears to be a devil, or imp with bulging eyes and lolling tongue, the stomach filled with a hideous head. This figure has locked arms with the dying figure as if to pull him away; underneath is 'SEQUERE ME'. The fourth is a skeleton holding an hourglass; underneath is 'EGO SUM'. A snail and snakes crawl over the skull. The pendant is pierced vertically for suspension.",

For example, in one such poem, the physician and logician say respectively -\n\n\"Vado mori medicus, medicamine non redimendus,\nQuid quid agat medici pocio.Vado mori\"\n\"Vado mori logicus; aliis concludere novi.\nConclusit breviter mors michi: vado mori\"\n\nApproximate translation:\n\n\"I the doctor hurry to die, no medicine will help me,\nWhatever potion I take, I hurry to die.\"\n\"I the logician hurry to die; I have learned to 'conclude' in a different way.\nDeath ends me quickly: I hurry to die\" \n\nLike the 'Dance of Death' motif, these poems stress death as the great leveller , which will come to us all.",
