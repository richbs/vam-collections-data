A member of the Magnum photo agency since 1979, he has produced an extensive and wide-ranging body of work since setting up as a photographer in 1971. \nThis photograph is from his ongoing photographic exploration of Japan, where Steele-Perkins has worked extensively since marrying his second wife, Miyako Yamada. Shot in colour, rather than his more usual black and white, Steele-Perkins' photographs of Tokyo revel in the unfamiliar and the unknown of the Japanese cityscape.",
