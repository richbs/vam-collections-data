Lely (Lugt 2091); J. Bernard (inscribed on the verso with inv. no. 51; Lugt 1420); B. West (Lugt 419); Dr H. Wellesley (sale, Sotheby, 10 July 1866, lot 2407, bought by J. C. Robinson for the Museum) The royal saint (whose septre is tipped with a fleur-de-lis) is probably St Louis, but he might be Edward the Confessor or Hermengild. A painting by Annibale Carracci of Christ in Glory in the Pitti Palace, Florence, shows the two latter saints kneeling in worship, and Odoardo Farnese praying beside St Edward, his patron. See the catalogue of the Carracci exhibition, Bologna, 1956, no. 104, pl. 104.",
