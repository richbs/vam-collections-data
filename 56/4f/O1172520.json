Drury Lane Design Collection.\n\nA production of Puss in Boots was first performed at Covent Garden in 1817-1818, but was not a success. In 1832 another version entitled, Puss In Boots: or Harlequin and The Millers Son was also performed at Covent Garden in which Eliza Povey who played the role of the Miller\u2019s Son was one of the earliest Principal Boys. These early productions were chiefly Harlequinaides rather than the pantomime versions which are more familiar to modern audiences. \n\nDrury Lane first produced Puss In Boots: or Harlequin and the Fairy Of The Golden Palms in 1859, and in 1868 the theatre produced Grimalkin The Great: or Harlequin Puss In Boots and The Miller\u2019s Son. They had more success with their sumptuous 1887 production which as its title (Puss in Boots) suggests followed the \u2018rags to riches\u2019 storyline of the traditional fairytale. \n\nThese designs come from a production performed at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in December of 1915 entitled Puss in Boots, (A fairy tale). The script was written by Geo.R.Sims, Frank Dix and Arthur Collins featured music composed and arranged by J.M.Glover. It starred Miss Ren\u00e9e Meayer as Puss in Boots and Mr. Eric Marchall as Florian (the Miller\u2019s Youngest Son and the Principal Boy role). All the costumes we \u2018specially designed and supervised\u2019 by Comelli. The production was mounted during World War One when business was understandably poor for the theatre, with the result that the cast were actually asked to accept a half salary for the run. Fortunately the subsequent success of the show meant that it ran from December until Easter and the cast were eventually presented with cheques making up their salary to the full amount.",
