(ie. 3 (Z3S) S) but they are not - this is the result of cutting threads under tension. The single threads spray out and can wind themselves around their neighbour. 24 threads per inch (100 per dm).\n\nWEFT: white cotton; Z6S; 1 shoot after each row of knots; 12-14 rows of knots per inch (47-48 per dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: both sides: one cord oversewn with red wool.\n\nEND FINISH: lower: 2.5 cms. plain weave with white cotton weft and 1 shoot of dark blue wool, to either side of which is 1 shoot of light blue cotton. Warp ends grouped in 6 and knotted. Fringe 9 cms long.\nUpper: loose warp ends after 4 shoots of white cotton and 1 of blue wool. Fringe 9 cms long.\n\nDESIGN: Field with a red ground with very small Herati pattern with light green diamonds and variously coloured rosettes, the pairs of pink/blue leaves outlined in yellow.\n\nMain border: dark blue ground with single meander linking blue and yellow star rosettes to blue and brown stylised blossoms. The rosettes have a pair of stems terminating in a white serrated leaf. There are small motifs scattered on the ground.\n\nGuard stripes, from field outwards:\n1) blue ground with floral meander of dark brown stem with pink blossoms.\n2) yellow ground with small buds, pink or white, in an alternating direction.\n3) as (1)\n4) main border\n5) as (1)\n6) as (2)\n7) as (1)\n8) outermost an undecorated red.",
