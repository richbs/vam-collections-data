To this is hand stitched the blue border - W. 36 cm. Made of unbroken lengths mitred at the corners. Decorated with eighteen fabulous lion like creatures similar to the Chinese \"qilin\" (each 24 cm x H 20 cm. framed with recurring tendrils, leaves and flowers. The beasts represent the four species of mythological lions, such as the herbivore and bull-like \"tena\", the omnivorous \"kala\", also bull-like, the fawn coloured \"pandu\", and \"katheraza\", the king amongst them, each beast is different in design and colour. While some are shown with a thin black mane, others sport a mixture of red and white stripes. The snarling lions prance and clutch at the scrolling vegetation. \n\nThe subject in the central field is taken from the Ramakien (Ramayana). The lively figures are arranged in two registers in the red central rectangle, and with the action contained within five panels. At the top are alternating pairs of armed \"myauk\" (monkeys) and \"belu\" (demons) locked in single combat. At the end, on the right, is Indragit riding his \"tein-yett-htar\" (cloud-chariot). Although he is usually depicted throwing \"nagapat-kyawkwin\" (serpent lassoes in the form of naga-dragons; another version calls them serpent darts) in this interpretation he is holding a swirling scarf, which presumably transforms itself into these deadly instruments of death. In the bottom left register is Rama (identifiable by his green-coloured face), who, guided by (Phiphek? Thai version) the astrologer brother of Ravanna who had come over to his side, aims an arrow at a flying demon threatening the pair. Beyond them is the white monkey Hanuman, engaged in a fight with a demon. He aims a globe-like weapon at his apponent crouching at his feet. Besides them, a striped snake emerges from a hollow tree and looks on. Lethana (Lakshmana) the younger brother of Rama, recognizable by his golden face, is aided by a monkey in shooting an arrow at Indrajit, who is an adept at using a magic mirror to hide in the clouds and ambush his victims by burning them with its rays. Beyond a rocky outcrop of Chinese design, a monkey and a demon fight. Small striped birds flutter amidst all this frenetic activity.\n\nLined with a red and white silk check of the type used for a pah-soe.\n\nLoops at the top for hanging.",

The owner would have used it either as a decorative wall hanging, a room partition, or as a screen hung outside the house on festive occasions. This one is made of red and green brocade silk with additional coloured silk and gold applique and sequins. It illustrates episodes from the Ramayana. This Indian epic, with its story of the conflict between the forces of the god Rama and the demon king of  Lanka, Ravana,  was a great favourite at the court of the Burmese Konbaung dynasty (1752-1885). The kalaga was acquired by the Museum in 1855, and all the characters are elegantly dressed in the court style of the first half of the 19th century. \n\nBritain's control of Burma extended as the 19th century progressed, and the country was  annexed in 1885. The extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the mid 19th century.",
