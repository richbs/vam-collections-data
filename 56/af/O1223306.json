It followed the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that used technically advanced equipment to help those in need.\n\nOriginal Thunderbirds toys are now highly sought after by collectors, and the TV series and associated toys have undergone several revivals amongst subsequent generations of children. This set, made from plastic, features Thunderbird 3 and 5. It was produced in China for the toy distributors Vivid Imaginations to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Thunderbirds first appearing on TV. The models include recordings of famous phrases from these original programmes, activated by pressing a button.",
