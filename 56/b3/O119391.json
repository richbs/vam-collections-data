This roller is made of pearwood, a close-grained wood, which is easier to clean and less prone to absorbing stains and moisture than softer woods like pine. It would been used to flatten the pastry and decorate it at the same time with monsters, heraldic animals  and religious motifs. This example includes the pelican in her piety, who according to legend fed her young with her own blood and symbolized the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The use of a religious inscription in German rather than Latin in 1598 would most likely have indicated a pious Protestant rather than Catholic household.",
