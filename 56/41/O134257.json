As she describes it: 'British army tanks surround Heathrow Airport in response to a terrorist plot to launch a rocket attack on an airliner. However, it is quickly learned that the tanks were not armed, and the popular suspicion is that the Government is seeking to exacerbate the level of anxiety in the lead-up to its planned invasion of Iraq.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
