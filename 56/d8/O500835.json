He tended to choose his subjects from the middle and lower classes, and had a particular fondness for featuring sailors. Here we see a sailor having his portrait painted by a miniaturist. Woodward contrasts the effeminate and fashionably dressed artist with the red-faced, brutish sailor. He offers the artist \u00a310 (a representative price for a miniature portrait by a mid-range artist at the time) if he will finish the miniature in 10 mins, but only \u00a35 if he is slower. He mentions his sweetheart - 'Poll' - to whom he will presumably give the portrait as a keepsake to remember him by while he is away. Much of the humour here stems from his puzzlement that there should be enough room for his 'hulk, head and stern' (all naval terms) on 'that there little bit of ivory'.\n\nThis caricature was first published in 1807, but was reissued (probably because it was popular and not limited by featuring a topical subject) around 1817.",
