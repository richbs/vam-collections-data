Margaret contributed many of the fittings; this panel was made in 1903.\n\nSisters Margaret and Frances Macdonald were two of the most original artists working in Glasgow in the 1890s. They attended evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art together with Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert Macnair (who worked with Mackintosh from 1889 at the architectural practice, Honeyman & Jeppie). They became known as The Glasgow Four, and created a distinctive decorative style that was disseminated internationally.\n\nTheir work became influential through many exhibitions, in particular the fifth exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society in London (1896), the eighth exhibition of the Vienna Secession (1900) and the Esposizione Internazionale d\u2019Arte Decorativa in Turin (1902). Their work was published in contemporary periodicals, notably The Studio, Dekorative Kunst, Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration and Ver Sacrum. In this way, they provided substantial impetus for the development and recognition of a distinctive Glasgow style in Britain and Europe, although they had few direct imitators.",
