He was billed as \u2018London\u2019s Favourite Comedy Vocalist\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums.\n\nBorn Fred Shaw in County Durham in 1867, Sheridan first appeared in northern music halls with a partner as \u2018The Sheridans\u2019. In 1892 he toured in Australia as a solo turn. By 1900 he was well known in London music halls as a singer of chorus songs. These included \u2018I Do Like To Be Beside the Seaside\u2019 and \u2018Who Were You With Last Night?\u2019, which he conducted from the stage with his umbrella. His characteristic costume consisted of a tight frock-coat, a stove-pipe hat, bell-bottomed trousers and the ubiquitous umbrella. He appeared in pantomime, and during the First World War toured music halls with his own burlesque company. He committed suicide in 1918, after suffering from depression.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall comedian Mark Sheridan (1867-1918). Born Fred Shaw in Hendon, County Durham, he first appeared in northern music halls with a partner as 'The Sheridans', and in 1892 toured in Australia as a solo turn.  By 1900 he was well known in London music halls as a singer of chorus songs and music hall classics including 'I Do Like to be Beside the Seaside', and 'Who Were You With Last Night'.  He conducted these from the stage with his umbrella, which was part of his trademark costume of tight frock-coat, high top hat and bell-bottomed trousers. During the First World War he toured the music halls with his own burlesque company, which included his wife, son and daughter. He committed suicide in 1918, suffering from acute depression.The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
