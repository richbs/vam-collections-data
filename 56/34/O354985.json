In the middle, in a small circle, is Joseph's Dream; he lies asleep: above him are the sheaves.  Around are various scenes in his life, among which the following may be identified: - He is sent to his brethren by his father; he is put in the well; he is sold to the Midianites; the departure of the Midianites.  The shoulder-bands contain repetitions of the same scenes, with other groups as well.  The two pendent ovals, still preserved on one side of the tunic, each enclose a group of figures.  The background is red.  The borders all around consist of heart-shaped blossoms and leaves on a white ground, edged with geometrical ornament in polychrome.  One of the two neck-borders has a horseman spearing an animal and another horseman below.  The tapestry threads of the other border have mostly perished.\nThe sleeves and the two roundels and pendents on one side of the tunic are missing.",
