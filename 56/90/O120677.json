It was founded at the Prague non-conformist theatre \u2018Cinoherni klub\u2019 on the evening of the 19th of  November 1989, two days after Ministry of Interior Affairs  special troops made a brutal strike against a non-violent student demonstration on National Street in Prague. The student demonstration began with a meeting in the Albertov district of Prague on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Nazi persecution of Czechoslovak students who had held mass protests during the burial of Jan Opletal (a Czech student from the medical faculty of the Charles University who was shot during demonstrations against theGerman occupation of Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1939). The Albertov student meeting continued with a \u2018march for democracy\u2019 to the centre of Prague.  On the way towards National Street the student demonstration was joined by other, mainly young, people demanding freedom and democracy. \nThe Civic Forum founders were dramatist and writer V\u00e1clav Havel, Catholic priest V\u00e1clav Mal\u00fd, actor Petr Cepek, Charter 77 spokesman Alexander Vondra, scriptwriter Jir\u00ed Kri\u017ean translator and writer Michael \u017dantovsk\u00fd (currently the Czech ambassador in London) who became the Civic Forum press officer. Civic Forum unified independent Czech democratic initiatives \n\nThis leaflet presents the Civic Forum \u2018OF\u2019 logo, designed spontaneously during first days of the student \u2018velvet revolution\u2019 by Pavel \u0160tastn\u00fd, a student of graphic design and painting at the Prague Academy of Applied Arts and Architecture \u2013 which was out on strike at the time.  \n\nHis logo won a one day design competition and was chosen from many student submissions by the Coodination Committee of Civic Forum at its \u2018\u0160pal\u00edcek\u2019 Prague centre. Pavel \u0160tastn\u00fd says \u2018It was time of immediate decisions - there was no time for any marketing strategies!\u2019 The logo in the Czech national tricolour (red, blue and white) showing an \u2018O\u2019 embracing a smiling face was a symbol of political change and a positive future. \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
