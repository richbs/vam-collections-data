The sole, which seems to be a replacement, is plain weave silk.\nThe ground fabric is not visible, being totally covered with embroidery. The shoe is made from two pieces: the top/sides and the heel.\nThe top/side panel is embroidered in a chevron pattern with silver thread alternating with silver-gilt thread. Over this is a design with a pair of long-tailed birds either side of a stylized tulip stem with leafy stems travelling out to the sides.  The outline of these motifs is emphasised by a twisted cord of 3 or 4 couched silver threads, while the motifs have details worked in chenille thread is two shades of green, yellow, blue, pink and white.\nThe heel panel has a chevron ground worked in silver thread with a simple leaf and blossom motif in chenille thread in pink, coral red, grey, white and light green.\nThe side seams were originally emphasised with a black silk and silver cord either side of a couched silver thread interlaced with purple or turquoise threads to create a 'jewel' stud effect.\nThe opening is trimmed with a braid [edged with black and silver cord] of silver-gilt strip over white silk with some chenille spots and, possibly, paint to create the effect of jewels.\nThe lining is crimson silk and the facing is yellow silk. The sole is dark red silk.\n\nMetal thread: [1] silver strip close S-wound on a white silk core; [2] silver-gilt strip close S-wound on a yellow silk core.",
