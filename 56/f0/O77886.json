If so, it would have been to serve cakes or bread and butter. Plates of bread and cakes can be seen set over slop basins in some 18th-century paintings of people drinking tea. The length of time between breakfast and dinner was extending during the second half of the 18th century, and a snack of bread and butter or cakes would have been a welcome addition to afternoon tea.\n\nDesign & Designing \nThe Bow factory's engraver either copied the subject on this plate from L'Amour, a print by the French engraver Charles-Nicolas Cochin the Younger (1715-1790), or from an English copy of Cochin's print. The engraver Robert Hancock (1731-1817) also copied the design for transfer-prints used at the Worcester porcelain factory after about 1759.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlthough the Bow factory concentrated on utilitarian pieces, it made comparatively few transfer-printed wares, possibly because the printed lines often blur and sink into the soft-lead glaze. The printing here is relatively crisp. Sets of 'printed teas' were mentioned in a factory document of 1756.",
