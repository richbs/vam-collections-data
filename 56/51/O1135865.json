It consists of a Wal\u00e9 Adeyemi jacket, Dolce & Gabbana jeans, and an Adidas T-shirt and trainers. The outfit was featured in the 'Black British Style' exhibition at the V&A in 2004. \n\nIt is thought that wearing baggy low-slung jeans may originally have been a critique by African American men on the American prison system. When worn on the street, loose jeans show off designer labels, particularly when worn low enough to reveal the brand name emblazoned on the wearer\u2019s undergarments. Such was the cultural impact of low-slung jeans that in 2004 the British rap artist Dizzee Rascal sang: \u2018I socialise in Hackney and Bow, I wear my trousers ridiculously low.\u2019",
