Its large-scale illustrations represent exotic plants in a melodramatic way. The plants were not always depicted in a convincing habitat but are set in elaborate picturesque landscapes containing clues as to the country of origin. This landscape resembles the landscapes of Cumbria that Reinagle often painted. Reinagle was the most competent of the several artists employed by Thornton to paint the melodramatic oil originals from which his aquatinted plated were derived. Visually impressive, the illustrations are botanically deficient, for the artists were painters of portraits and landscapes, and none of them had any botanical training. \n\nThornton published his great work in parts between 1799 and 1807. At this time there were many competing publications. He failed to sell sufficient copies, and he eventually went bankrupt from the costs of producing the plates.",
