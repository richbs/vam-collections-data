Richardson Sr, as in Lugt 2984 \u2018Tg.62.Ti.<sub>44</sub>\u2019 Inscribed also in pencil in a modern hand \u2018dal Rosa\u2019 Black chalk 10 \u00bc X 6 \u00bc (260 X 158) D.1065-1900 PROVENANCE Padre Sebastiano Resta; Lord Somers (inscribed i.76 as in Lugt 2981); J. Richardson Sr (Lugt 2184); unidentified mark c (Lugt 474); Sir J. Reynolds (Lugt 2364); Dalton Bequest 1900 LITERATURE <i>Dalton Catalogue</i>, p. 19 (as anonymous) The entry against i.76 in the Richardsons\u2019 inventory of Lord Somers\u2019s drawings from the Resta collection reads \u2018Andrea del Sarto\u2019. This attribution by Padre Resta was lost or abandoned before the drawing entered the Museum, and it has little justification, the drawing being a good deal later in date, though it may still be Florentine and in a manner that was handed down from Sarto through Pontormo, Bronzino and the Alloris.",
