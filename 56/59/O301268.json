Chihuly works extravagantly in richly-coloured blown glass, drawing on the historic techniques of the Murano glassworks in Venice.  He was initially intrigued by the space-changing potential of the chandelier form, and has succeeded in massing colour, shade and light alongside a driving sense of movement.\n\nMade by Chihuly and his studio team in Seattle, Washington State, USA, each separate glass element of the V&A Rotunda Chandelier was either free-blown, or was mould-blown into ribbed moulds.  Each element is coated inside with polyurethane adhesive and was tied on individually with stainless steel wire to an armature welded from steel rod.  A team of six started wiring on from bottom to top and took over five days to complete the work.",
