In fact the lights do not form a pair but are different in decorative details and in quality of execution. The boy's torso in the wall-light V&amp;A 975-1882 (the boy has lost one of his pipes) has been cast as a separate section; V&amp;A 975A-1882 (the pipe the boy plays is complete) is much heavier and the figure of the boy has been cast as a single piece. V&amp;A 975A is also stamped on the back with the letters 'FF'. The decorative detail on the underside of the sconces is different on the two wall-lights, and both lights have suffered losses. The acanthus leaves in front of the pipe-playing boys are pierced with two holes, which presumably contained additional ornament or perhaps another holder for a light.",
