Photograph of a photo-mural - 18' x 12', constructed as a hand coloured photographic print. The original photo-mural is displayed on a number of sites. Its aim is to encourage local action against the proposed Canary Wharf office development in London's ex-Docklands. Local objections to the development include: expected increase in the volume of traffic; housing development not catering for local people; jobs created not related to local needs; the amount of public money being used in a speculative venture. 1987.",
