It is unclear what this textile would have been used for, although it is likely to have been part of a burial shroud. The piece was recovered from the site of  Karakhoja, an ancient burial ground where the tombs date from the 3rd to the 8th century AD.   \n  \nThe site is part of an area of Central Asia we now call  the Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia, from China to Europe.  The most notable item traded was silk.  Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed the goods from oasis to oasis.  The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas \u2013 while silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in this way.\n\nThis textile was brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862-1943). The Victoria and Albert Museum has around 700 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein  at the beginning of the twentieth century. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals.",

The Chinese established a military post at Karakhoja in the fourth century AD, but it fell to successive nomadic groups until the Chinese regained it during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). The Turkic Uygurs then made Karakhoja their capital. Stein excavated its Buddhist shrines and cave-temples, finding Uygur text fragments, a cast-bronze knife handle, a quilted shoe of buff cotton, and fragments of stucco Buddha, some of them painted. The V&A holds, on loan, from Karakhoja, two pieces of resist-dyed silks.",
