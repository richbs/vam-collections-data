E.829-1962\n\nKing William staggers, replete with food and drink, encased in a beer mug, which breaks up under fire from a <i>mitrailleuse</i>. The French put great faith in this new weapon, a primitive precursor of the machine gun, which consisted of a bundle of 25 barrels which could be fired either simultaneously or in rapid succession. Unfortunately, because it had been manufactured in conditions of strict secrecy and issued to the troops only a few days before mobilization, none of the soldiers knew how to use it. Nor did the <i>mitrailleuse</i> come up to expectation in the field; it was as unwieldy and vulnerable as Herr Krupp's cannon without the latter's range or accuracy.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
