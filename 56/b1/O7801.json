These are known as tracery lights.\n\nSt Thomas was one of the Twelve Apostles, whom Christ appointed as his special disciples. Thomas is often referred to as \u2018Doubting Thomas\u2019, because he refused to believe the others when they told him that they had seen the Resurrected Christ. His faith was confirmed when Christ appeared and invited Thomas to touch his wounds. After the Ascension of Christ, the Apostles spread throughout the lands of the Roman empire, preaching the new faith. Tradition has long held that Thomas travelled as far as India and that he was martyred at Mylapore, near Madras (now Chennai).\n\nThe saints of the Christian church can often be identified by a device, which is known as their \u2018attribute\u2019. In this panel St Thomas holds a spear. According to the Golden Legend, an influential compilation of saints\u2019 lives written about 1260, Thomas was in Upper India where he was trying to convert the king. He was having great success in converting the people and the royal family, but by doing so he upset the pagan high priest, who killed him with a spear or dagger.\n\nSt Thomas bears a scroll on which are written in Latin the words \u2018He descended into Hell\u2019. This is a line from the \u2018Apostles\u2019 Creed\u2019, a statement of faith in the Christian church. It begins: \u2018I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth\u2019. A tradition dating back at least to the end of the 4th century states that the Twelve Apostles gathered together after the Ascension. The Holy Spirit inspired them to write the Apostles\u2019 Creed, each contributing a line. \n\nThe Twelve Apostles often formed part of large decorative schemes in the Middle Ages. They are the backbone upon which the Christian faith spread throughout the world.",
