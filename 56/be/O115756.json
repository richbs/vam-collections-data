Hip length with a short sack back with pleats caught down with thread at the back and a stomacher, which fastens with buttons made from the ground material over a wooden core. The sleeves have double frilled cuffs and inside at the elbow opening are stitched three buttons. The borders and the hood are trimmed with a gathered band of matching material which is edged with braid and a meandering band. Neat box pleats at each hip, in which are inserted the pocket slits. At the centre back, at the waist and at the sleeves are former pleat marks. The hood is stitched to an extension piece inside the back neck-line and the stomacher is stitched over it. Inside the hood, at the neck, are stitched ties of yellow shaded striped ribbon. The jacket is lined with a number of different silks, all showing piecing. The sides are lined with a pale green ground chin\u00e9, the bottom of the back with pale blue ground chin\u00e9 with a pinked edge, the sides of the front (at the junction of the stomacher) has a cream ground green-patterned tobine, the top of the back has a pale blue silk, and the sleeves are pieced with green silk. The jacket is laced up inside the back through facings of coarse brown canvas. From the sides to the back of the stomacher is stitched with a tape waistband. Most if the stitching is in yellow silk running stitch.",

A shortened version of the formal sack-back dress, the Brunswick became popular in the 1760s for travelling and informal dress. Although this example has a hood, the very fine watered silk suggests it was intended for casual day wear rather than the rigours of 18th-century travel. Some variations have wrist-length sleeves, and buttons at the elbow of this jacket indicate that it might once have had removable extensions of the sleeve to cover the forearms.",
