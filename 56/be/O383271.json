It was worn on the bodice, where it secured the end of the silver chain which crisscrossed the front of the bodice, holding it tightly laced like a corset.  The delicate pierced silver tracery over a gilded back plate is typical of traditional jewellery from the Ulm area.  It was described as 17th century when it was acquired in 1872, but it is more likely to date from the second half of the 18th century.  Traditional jewellery was often mistaken for older work, because of its archaic appearance.",
