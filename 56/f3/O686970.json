London: Victoria & Albert Museum, 1981. p.58.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n'<b>Drawing for utility</b>   \n \n[\u2026]\n   \n<b>DRAWINGS FOR PRODUCTION \nIN OTHER MEDIA</b> \n \n[\u2026] \n \n<b>177.</b> Anonymous; British \nPoint paper of floral design for a Jacquard-woven textile produced by Arthur H. Lee & Sons Ltd, 1899. Dated in ink on the back <i>July 1899.</i> Inscribed in ink <i>Design 115</i> and with number of weft lines (1 to 657) in the repeat of the design and number of dents (3 to 50) (the number of spaces between the vertical bars of the reed through which the warp ends are drawn) in the reed. Inscribed again on the  back with instructions for cutting the  Jacquard cards.\nWith stamp of paper manufacturers Howitt & Son, Nottingham Water- and body-colour on 6 x 9 point- paper. \nSize of sheet 78 x 51.7 cm \nVAM E.1291-1970 \n \nThis working drawing was drawn to scale by a professional draughtsman from the original artist\u2019s design. It gives information to the  weaver for setting up the pattern to the loom;  each square of the point-paper contains six vertical lines corresponding to the warp and  nine horizontal lines corresponding to the weft, signifying that the warp thread will be lightly thicker than the weft. It also gives instructions about the cutting of the cards for the Jacquard loom on which the design is to be woven: each painted rectangle within the squares denotes the appearance in the weft line of the appropriately coloured thread, and thus is a precise guide to the holes which are to be punched in the cards to allow this thread to be raised in weaving.\u2019",
