Like all Italian traditional jewellery, they usually had amuletic, as well as decorative, meaning.\n\nThis ring, with a cluster of stones of the same colour, is typical of those from the central region.  Pearls were very popular in all kinds of Italian jewellery.  They were always pierced, and attached by a fine wire.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 4s as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
