This poster depicts Imam Husayn with his son Ali al- Asghar at the Battle of Karbala in 680AD. \n\nThe majority of Iran\u2019s population are Shi'ia Muslims. The Shi\u2019ite sect began in the 650s,  when Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and Husayn\u2019s father became Caliph (leader of the Muslim people). The supporters of Ali became known as the Shiites, which means \"the followers of Ali\u201d. However Muhammad had not named his successor and the years following his death were marked with rival claims to power. In 680 the rival Umayyad Caliph killed Husayn, along with most of his male family and followers at the Battle of Karbala in Iraq. Shi'ites consider Husayn a martyr.\n\nIn this poster Husayn, shown holding his son, has ridden out in front of the enemy army to appeal for water for his family. Moments later he and his young son were killed. Shi'ites remember the death of Husayn every year during the month of Muharram. Posters such as this one are a visual reminder of Husayn's martydom.",
