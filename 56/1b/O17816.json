            "public_access_description": "Alphonse Legros (1837-1911) was born in Dijon where he entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts before attending the \u2018Petite Ecole\u2019 of Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897) in Paris and then Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He started exhibited at the Salon in 1857. In 1863, Legros visited London where he found admirers and patrons, notably the Ionides family, and was ardently promoted by the brothers Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. An etcher, a painter and a sculptor, he succeeded Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) at the Slade School in 1876 and was naturalized as a British citizen in 1880.\n\nThis work is a fine example of Legros\u2019 genre paintings of the 1870s. It depicts a French tinker repairing one of his cauldrons in an open landscape. The subdued palette and earthen tones dominated by blue and green hues as well as the subject matter are indebted to the French Realist movement and in particular to the art of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875).Legros\u2019 genre scenes were particularly praised at the time by British collectors with at the front line C. A. Ionides who purchased many of his works.",

Legros also copied Old Masters, such as Holbein and Rembrandt, whom he admired throughout his career. From 1857 he exhibited mainly religious pictures and modern life subjects. Although critics, including Baudelaire, recognized his early promise, the independent Legros found it hard to make a living. With Whistler's encouragement and in the hope of financial security, he moved to London in 1866 and began teaching art. \n\n<i>The Tinker</i> is a fine example of Legros' particular brand of Realism. The Realist movement, from the 1840s on, was a reaction against the earlier Neo-classical and Romantic styles. Artists painted in a contemporary manner, recording the world about them with sincere feeling. Mere literal representation was not enough, warned the Realist theorists: artists should seek out the truth and evoke a picture's particular emotion or mood to create a valid work of art. \n\nRural and peasant life, already threatened by the industrial revolution, was favoured as subject matter. Traditional craftsmen whose skills were passed on - tinkers, blacksmiths, woodworkers - were depicted. Courbet saw the propagandist value in such subjects, whereas Legros' concern with labourers and peasants is that of an agnostic humanist, similar to Millet's.\n \nWith sharp observation, bold draughtsmanship and solid modelling, he portrays the itinerant tinker, absorbed in his work and surrounded by his shiny pots and pans. His style shows that he had learnt much from de Boisbaudran's teaching methods, stressing the essential details and three-dimensional effect of the figure. He emphasizes the tinker's presence by placing him in the frontal plane, recalling Courbet's technique. Legros in the 1860s had been among the first Realists to work and place his subjects outdoors. The group of trees in the background is characteristic of his style, as can be seen from his numerous etchings of the French countryside. The bright colour of the metal vessels offsets the other duller tones. The <i>Times</i> wrote (1 May 1877), 'Here we have realism in its naked strength'. Yet it is an ennobled realism: the man and his work are dignified by the artist's evident affection and respect for his subject, especially apparent in his treatment of the lined face.\n\nSarah Postgate\"\n<u>The Athenaeum</u>, 9th May 1874, p. 638.\n<u>The Art Journal</u>, 1874, p. 162.\n<u>The Times</u>, 1st May 1877.\n<u>Summary Catalogue of British Paintings</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 80-81.\nB.S.

Legros in Ionides' inventory of November 1881, valued at \u00a3600; bequeathed by C.A. Ionides, 1900.\n\nRef: Basil S. Long, <u>Catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection.Vol. 1, Paintings in oil, tempera and water-colour, together with certain of the drawings,</u> London : Printed under the authority of the Board of Education, 1925.\nC. Monkhouse, \u2018The Constantine Ionides Collection\u2019 in <u>Magazine of Art,</u> vii, 1884, pp. 36-44, 208-214.\n\nThe collection formed by Constantine Ionides includes works of a wide variety of schools, periods and artists. His collection includes Old Masters, 17th century works, contemporary British works and French 19th century works. Constantine formed friendships with artists of the day, especially Legros, who, having spent 17 years in Britain, became a naturalise British citizen. Constantine proved a stable and generous buyer of Legros work, while Legros, in turn, became an advisor in the matters of art to the attentive Constantine. Under the influence of Legros Constantine developed a keen interest in French 19th century paintings purchasing works by Delacroix, Degas, Millet and Rousseau.\n\nConstantine\u2019s plans concerning his collection conformed to a more \u2018public-welfare\u2019 vein of thought than his father or brother. He decided to donate his collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum, instead of privately distributing it or disposing of it in a Sales room.\n\nHis will states:\n\n'All my pictures both in oil and water colors and crayon or colored chalks (but subject as to my family portraits to the interest herein before given to my said Wife) and all my etchings drawings and engravings to the South Kensington Museum for the benefit of the nation to be kept there as one separate collection to be called \"The Constantine Alexander Ionides Collection\" and not distributed over the Museum or lent for exhibition. And I desire that the said Etchings Drawings and Engravings shall be framed and glazed by and at the expense of the authorities of the Museum so that Students there can easily see them.'\n\nThe collection bequeathed to the museum in 1901 comprises 1138 pictures, drawing and prints, to which a further 20 items were added on the death of his widow in 1920. The works are listed in the V&A catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Legros' genre scene. It was originally titled <i>Le chaudronnier ou le r\u00e9tameur de campagne</i>. It depicts a French tinker repairing a cauldron in an open landscape. This subject matter is typical of 19th-century French Realist paintings based on the impartial observation of contemporary life and popular imagery.\n\nT. Wilcox suggests that this type of paintings responded to a double concern in Legros' career. On one hand, it reflects his interest in the ideas of Thomas Carlyle (whos portrait he engraved twice) and in socialism; it also draws upon Millet's famous peasant scenes which were often exhibited in London from 1870 onwards.  \n\nIt is difficult to assess to what extent Legros' painting conveys his own political concerns. Depiction of humble everyday activities were Legros' main themes during the 1870s: see for instance <i>Le Repas des Pauvres</i>, 1877, Tate Gallery, London (N02898) and <i>La tomb\u00e9e du jour ou le promeneur fatigu\u00e9</i>, 1878, Museum and Art Gallery, Sunderland.",

            "historical_context_note": "'Genre painting' describes scenes of everyday life set in domestic interiors or in the countryside, especially those produced by 17th-century Dutch painters such as Gerard ter Borch, Jan Steen, and Pieter de Hooch. These subjects were not particularly popular with Italian and French artists before the 18th century. Even then, Italian genre painting is mainly restricted to works produced by Northern artists active in Bologna and the Veneto such as Giuseppe Maria Crespi (1665-1747), Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (1682-1754), Pietro Longhi (ca. 1701-1785) and Giacomo Ceruti (1698-1767). In this pre-Enlightment society, issues of social class, the legitimacy of power and the needs of common people were beginning to be discussed in Holland, England and France and the debates were slowly filtering down to Italy. Bolognese intellectual life was particularly active and Crespi, who was corresponding one of the most notable academics, Antonio Muratori (1672-1750), appears to have created a visual response to these debates. The works of the <i>Bamboccianti,</i> mostly Netherlandish painters specialising in low-life paintings, painted in Rome in the mid 17th century, may also have provided a source for Italian genre painters while the <i>commedia dell'arte</i> profoundly inspired Crespi and the development of this new Italian version of genre painting. From Bologna the genre spread to Venice thanks to Venetians artists such as Piazzetta and Longhi. They drew the attention of foreign collectors, most notably Joseph Smith the British Consul in Venice, who amassed an impressive collection of such artworks and of Venetian art in general and contributed to the growing taste for these in England. In France, the genre was mainly introduced in the second quarter of the 17th century by the Le Nain brothers, especially Antoine and Louis, whose works still pose problems of individual identification. Genre paintings would be reactivated during the 19th century when artists such as Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) whose art was based on the impartial observation of contemporary life.",
