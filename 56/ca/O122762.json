The panel is not an accurate depiction of nature - the golden pheasant in the centre lacks long tail feathers, the fruit in the foreground are the shape of peaches but the colour of plums, while the small bird on the left appears to be a creation of the designer's imagination.  \n\nAlthough the panel bears the name Danthon in the bottom right corner, we cannot be certain which member of this family of weavers made the tapestry.  The Danthon family were originally from Aubusson in central France which is famous for its tapestry production.  The family were Protestants, and were forced to flee religious persecution in France in the 1690s.  Like many other French Protestants, known as Huguenots, they settled in Spitalfields in East London.  Members of the Danthon family worked at a tapestry manufacture in Soho, and later in Fulham.",
