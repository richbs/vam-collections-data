            "public_access_description": "This poster advertises a film on the life and art of the dancer Anna Pavlova (1881-1931).  Released in 1936, the film is a  compendium of film material put together after Pavlova\u2019s death in 1931. It was directed and edited by Edward Nachimoff under the supervision of Pavlova's husband Victor Dandr\u00e9, with a French commentary by Albert Grehan. Dandr\u00e9 had the film edited in English, French and German for world-wide distribution.\n\nThe image on the poster is based on a painting by Valentine J. Hugo (Valentine Gross), showing Anna Pavlova in Mikhail Fokine\u2019s ballet  Les Sylphides, in which Pavlova danced in 1909. She is depicted in a white romantic tutu in an arabesque on pointe. In the background is the Benois-designed set with the ruined abbey, created for Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes in 1909. For the poster Pavlova\u2019s hairstyle is changed from being drawn back with a chaplet of pink roses to a headband and ringlets, evoking the ballets Christmas, Invitation to the Waltz or Dragonfly. \n\nThe film was one of Victor Dandr\u00e9\u2019s homages to Pavlova after her death and falls into three parts with an additional staged tribute by members of her former company coming together to  perform one last time. It draws on the home movies Pavlova made as she travelled round the world and on her experiments in the USA with Lee Forest and Douglas Fairbanks and with her own technical crew in Australia to record some of her repertoire. As Dandr\u00e9 wrote in The Sketch in 1936, \u2018We filmed in Java, tried slow motion in Australia, and sound in Hampstead. \u2026for my wife had theories about the films which made them her first hobby in life. The concentration on detail would, she believed, make the film the ideal medium for teaching the dance.\u2019 \n\nThere was a Gala viewing of the film in London at the Regal Cinema, Marble Arch, on 23 January 1936 at 8.45pm.",
