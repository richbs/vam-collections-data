It would have been designed to hang in record shops to bring attention to the new release.\n\nThe Raven album was The Stranglers' transition between their earlier punk origins and a more melodic and complex sound. Released during the demise of punk, the band's change in direction helped the album sell well, reaching the top five in the charts. The lyrical content is steeped in Nordic imagery, reflected in the album's artwork, including photography of the band on the prow of a Viking longship. The original cover of the album featured a lenticular print of a raven; in Norse mythology ravens are considered an attribute of the Nordic god Odin, whose two ravens Hugin (Thought) and Munin (Memory) served as his ears and eyes.",
