Designer Maarten Baas developed this method for his graduation collection at the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2002.\n\nLike much contemporary Dutch design, Baas's 'Smoke' furniture provokes us to think about the history of the objects, and encourages us to value something which might otherwise be discarded or overlooked. The making process is destructive as well as creative, bringing into question the role of the designer as a creator of new objects.",
