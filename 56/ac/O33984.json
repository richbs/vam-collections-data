            "public_access_description": "The dish by Wakao Toshitada (b.1932) is a further example of contemporary Shino ware by a leading Mino-based artist. A member of the Japan Crafts Association since 1970, Wakao has made a speciality out of so-called Grey Shino wares. Grey Shino wares were a relatively unusual product made at only a small number of Momoyama period kilns. The original technique involved the application of iron slip over a white stoneware body and the subsequent cutting away of areas of the slip coating to reveal the underlying clay. When covered in Shino glaze and fired, the revealed areas would show white and the areas coated in iron slip would show grey. When the glaze was thin the grey tended towards red.\nWakao has developed this basic technique into a highly sophisticated form of resist decoration. His use of liquid latex as a resist material is crucial to his work, for it enables him to achieve an intricacy and clarity of line that would not be possible through more traditional means. \nAlthough in technical terms Wakao's work makes reference to Momoyama period tea wares, his imagery derives from Japanese literary traditions celebrated in the work of artists and designers of the Rinpa school. The combination of motifs on this particular dish is suggestive of autumnal melancholy and a sense of impending loss and desolation.",
