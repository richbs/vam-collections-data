The arch is usually taken to represent the mihrab or decorative panel in the wall of a mosque which indicates the direction of Mecca. The pile of this carpet has been left relatively long and, as a consequence, the edges of the design are not very sharp. Cotton has been used for the white pile because it gives a clear white, whereas wool tends to have a more creamy colour.",
