The firm was in the forefront of the art furniture movement, and the superb quality engraved ivory inlay was designed and possibly executed by Stephen Webb who worked for them from about 1885. The Museum already possesses a small table (W.32-1954) by Collinson and Lock and Webb. They were taken over by Gillows in the early 1890's.\n\nWebb wrote extensively on ivory inlay in various contemporary art periodicals and though he was a member of the arts and crafts movement, the arabesque Renaissance detail of the inlay shows the impact of the teaching of the School of Art at South Kensington.",
