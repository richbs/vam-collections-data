It was used at first floor level (proper left side) to conceal access to the internal, wainscotted space behind the house front. As the return wall was visible to the public in that setting, a period door was apparently preferred (whereas the equivalent at second floor level was fitted with a painted partition jib door) although there was no internal door at this point in the original room. The door was retained for display in gallery 48 presumably for convenience, although there was no practical view of the return wall in that position.",
