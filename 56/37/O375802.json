In the centre a ring engraved with the months and times of the rising and setting of the sun. Around this, a ring engraved with saints' days and, in the upper section of this, days of the week.\nAround this and concentric with it, a ring engraved with twelve roundels each containing a figure or figures emblematic of the activities associated with the month. That emblematic of December (a woman warming her hands over a candle) is dated 1667. In the upper part of this ring, the plate is pierced with an aperture showing a ring engraved with days of the month and phases of the moon.\nIn each of the four spandrels a figure emblematic of the elements: fire (Jupiter), water (Neptune), earth (Demeter), air (a god or goddess to be identified).\nWithin a cartouche cut in the lower part of the plate, a plaque of silvered copper, engraved with the date 1667 against a hatched ground.\nAlong the upper and lower border of the plate, the signs of the zodiac.\nThe rings engraved with the phases of the moon and the days of the month were originally geared to the mechanism that operated the clock and were turned by it.",
