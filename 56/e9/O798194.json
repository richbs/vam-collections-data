It shows a broom plant in a circle, a star and a crescent in a circle of which half is shown. The broom plant is the emblem of Henry I, and the star and crescent that of Richard I. It is not known how much of this scheme was originally carried out and in 1980 only one section of the Lords Library Corridor had painted ceiling panels.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
