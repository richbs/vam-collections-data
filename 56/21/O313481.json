The present medal and one showing France in a state of readiness, but not engaged actively in combat, Gallia. France was aware of the dangers in the current political climate and through the medium of commemorative medals the State sought to raise national consciousness and stir patriotic feeling. Henri Classens, an authority on French medals, praised Morlon as a sculptor, and naming Aux Armes as being amongst his finest medals. The dynamic composition and close viewpoint, diagonal accents of arrows and plaits, and the cropped shield, stand in marked contrast to other French medallists' more static and highly detailed compositions.",

France was aware of the dangers in the current political climate and through the medium of commemorative medals the State sought to raise national consciousness and stir patriotic feeling. Henri Classens, an authority on French medals, praised Morlon as a sculptor, and naming <i>Aux Armes</i> as being amongst his finest medals. The dynamic composition and close viewpoint, diagonal accents of arrows and plaits, and the cropped shield, stand in marked contrast to other French medallists' more static and highly detailed compositions.",
