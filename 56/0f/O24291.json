Along with other members of the Japanese Folk Craft movement, in which he played a leading role after first meeting Yanagi Soetsu (1889-1961) in 1927, Serizawa was much influenced by the perceived simplicity of style and colour of the folk crafts of Okinawa (the former kingdom of Ryukyu), a group of islands to the south of Japan. Serizawa was especially attracted to the Okinawan textile art of bingata, a distinctive and very colourful form of stencilled resist-dyeing, which he first encountered at a regional products promotion exhibition in 1928. The map is of the main island of Okinawa, and the vignettes around it depict different aspects of Okinawan life and trades.",
