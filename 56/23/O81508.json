It was probably made to furnish one of a suite of parade rooms in an aristocratic house. The original decoration seems to have been brown paint with gilt details, so it was perhaps used in a saloon rather than a drawing room (which in an important house would typically have fully gilded furniture). \n\nThe suite is similar to furniture made for several great Palladian houses designed by the architect William Kent (1685-1748), whose distinctive style was inspired by 16th- and 17th-century architecture and interiors that he saw in Italy. Kent was the first British architect to concern himself as much with the design of furnishings as with the architectural shell of a house. The scrolled legs and the bold naturalistic carving of this settee - with cornucopiae, scales, swags of fruit and shells - are typical of his style.",
