Early in his career Mallary came in contact with the famous Mexican muralist Siqueiros and his art and technology ideas. (Mallary studied at the Escuela de Las Artes Del Libro, Mexico City, 1938-39 and at the Academia San Carlos, Mexico City, 1942-43). In 1967 he began to experiment with computer sculpture. For this he developed a computer sculpture program together with other collaborators, called TRAN2.\nRobert Mallary considers the computer to be an amplification device for both information and intelligence, which coupled together with human intelligence will surpass either the human or the machine capabilities.",
