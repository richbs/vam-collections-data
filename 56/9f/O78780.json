Their wealthy owners engaged in few commercial exchanges requiring cash.  In addition to serving as 'sweet bags' or 'gift wrapping', purses sometimes contained mirrors for grooming.  Others functioned as sewing kits, holding needles, thread and tiny scissors.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMother-of-pearl, the iridescent lining of the shell of the pearl oyster, was considered an exotic material in the 17th century.  It was used as an inlay for furniture and weapons, and carved into small objects such as jewellery, medallions, cameos or in this case, a purse. Here it has been incised in a floral pattern with two Tudor roses, a popular motif during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I.  Drilled around the edge of each shell is a series of holes, which allow it to be sewn to the silk lining of the purse.  The drawstring of the purse is made of plaited silk, with a pearl-shaped tassel of silk and silver-gilt thread.",
