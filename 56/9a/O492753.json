            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of Raijin and Fujin. \n\nIn Japanese mythology Fujin, the God of the Wind, and Raijin, the God of Thunder, are depicted, as within this netsuke, as a horned demons with humanistic features. Fujin is illustrated carrying a large bag on his back containing windy weather and Raijin holding a thunder drum. Japanese and Chinese mythology and folklore provided a rich source of inspiration for Japanese carvers due to the rich diversity and fantasy of the subjects.",
