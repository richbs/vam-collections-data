The panel is hand-woven in cotton brocaded with cotton, wool and silk.\n\n1931 Description: Panel (possibly from a skirt) of silk and cotton on brown cotton, darning stitch. The panel is embroidered with two wide bands of zigzag pattern in red, green, dark blue and mauve cotton and white silk.  The rest of the ground is powdered with rosettes, arrow-heads and spots.\n\n1975 Description: One panel of a huipil. T.33 and T.34-1931 are not panels from a skirt but two halves of an Indian blouse from the village of Totonicapan or the surrounding area. They would have been sewn together with a hole cut out for the head and slits left in the side seams for the arms. It is not uncommon to have the two halves of a huipil as different in size as these two are, as they were woven separately.  A similar garment made up of two such different sized panels is illustrated in L M O'Neal's 'Textiles of Highland Guatemala' plates 95a and 95b; see also p.304.\nPlain weave ground made of natural undyed cotton known as CUYUSCATE or IXCACO (Gossypium Mexicanum). This cotton has always been highly valued by local weavers.  The woven design is both single faced and double faced brocade weaving done with white and mauve silk and several colours of cotton.  Several pattern yarns are used together in each pick so the pattern stands out from the ground cloth.  These pieces are woven on a backstrap loom and therefore have 4 selvedges each.\n\nDye Analysis (Carlsen and Wenger, undertaken 1988, published 1991):\nThe red cotton was dyed with Alizarin, the red silk was dyed with cochineal and the purple cotton with purpura.\n\nTechnical Details (1995)\nWarp: 46 threads per inch; brown cotton; Z-spun, unplied.\nWeft: 24 threads per inch; brown cotton; Z-spun, unplied. there is some red cotton weft (Z2S), loosely spun, which has relaxed and looks like 2 parallel threads along the lower and upper edges.  There are loosely packed weft threads about 1\" from the lower edge as numbered.\nLower Edge: 9 passes of red cotton.\nUpper Edge: 10 passes of red cotton.\nBrocading: 11 different types/colours of thread: red cotton (Z4S and Z7S and Z9S); red wool (cannot determine spin, ply and twist); yellow cotton (Z5S); yellow floss silk (faded to cream); light green cotton (Z8S); dark blue cotton (Z4S); light blue floss silk; purple cotton (S3Z - probably machine spun, tightly and regularly twisted); light purple floss silk; black floss silk; white floss silk.\n\nPossibly these two panels were not intended for the same hiupil; there is a difference not only in the size but also in the design, number of colours, types of thread and ground colour.  Perhaps, however, this did not matter to the purchaser.",

Huipils are hand-woven by the women themselves, usually on a portable 'back-strap' or 'belt' loom, which is secured around the waist of the weaver, enabling her to continue weaving when opportunity and time permit. Huipils are very simply constructed; they consist of a woven cotton or wool rectangle with an opening left at the top for the head, much like a tunic. The weave is either plain or brocaded, which can then be embroidered or appliqu\u00e9d if further decoration is desired. Patterns are often particular to the weaver's village or region and are therefore a useful clue to the huipil's origins.",

Maudslay's two panels are either from San Martin Jilotepeque or San Antonion Aguas Calientes - two villages whose work remained very similar up to the 1930s.\"\nEd Carter, freelance reasearcher (personal communication July 1996): \"In general terms, geographical attribution of huipils of this vintage is a perilous business, and will only be resolved when and if unassailably attributed pieces are found - which is unlikely - or when irrefutable photographic evidence emerges.  On the one hand, Totonicapan may have been either or both a centre of production and export, or a major centre of textile marketing.  On the other, while it was once the dominant fashion among textile scholars to attribute all such early pieces to San Antonio Aguas Calientes, it now seems almso tde rigeur to insist upon a San Martin Jilotepeque origin.\"\nAnn P. Rowe, Curator of Western Hemisphere Textiles at the Textile Museum, Washington DC (personal cummunication 1997): \"There is a similar huipil in the Museo Ixchel published in the Japanese magazine Textile Art No. 28, there attributed to San Antonion Aguas Calientes, I am not sure on what basis (it would certainly be useful to know).  There are documented San Martin Jilotepeque huipils in the Eisen Collection (1902) at the Hearst Museum of Anthropology in Berkeley, published in Margot Schevill's book 'Maya Textiles of Guatemalan'.  Since San Martin huipils are common in other early collections and sometimes also turn up as being worn in other villages, it looks to me as if they were being made for sale and were influencing the weaving of other villages.  The fact that the Maudslay panels are not made up into a huipil suggests that they might have been made for sale.  My theory is that about this time San Antonio copied the huipils of San Martin.  This theory would explain the confusion here.\"",
