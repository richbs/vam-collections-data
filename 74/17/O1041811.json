            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 135, 148, 151\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nPage from a sketch-book, trimmed.\nOn the back (not reproduced amongst the plates) are a few pencil scribbles.  The drawing has been mounted on a small piece of paper (see also Nos. 225, 236, 243, 244 and 245 [839-1888, 797-1888, 798-1888, 840-1888, 793-1888]).\n\nThis drawing, formerly described as \u2018Church and other buildings\u2019 was identified by Mr. G. H. Palmer and Mr. Mansford in 1937.  The identification makes it almost certain that the drawing was made during Constable\u2019s visit to Fisher of November 1821.  Fisher had proposed a visit to Winchester\u2014should that still be your plan\u201d (Beckett, VI, p. 81).  The coincidence of size with that of the sketch-book known to have been used in 1821 (No. 225 [839-1888]), the similarity of style to No. 236 [797-1888], and the autumnal tints, are all corroborative features which link the drawing to an excursion made at this time.  Moreover, No. 238 [609-1888] is dated on the back November 1821 (referring to No. 239 [799-1888]) and also represents Winchester Cathedral.  For discussion of the sketch-book from which the page comes, see note following No. 245 [793-1888].\n\nNote on Nos. 225, 236, 237, 243, 244 and 245 [839-1888, 797-1888, 792-1888, 798-1888, 840-1888, 793-1888]\n\nNos. 225, 237, 243, 244 and 245 [see above] all appear to come from the same sketch-book, with leaves measuring about 84 x 113 mm., which, as the date on No. 225 [839-1888] shows, was used in 1821.  For the reasons given in the note on that drawing No. 236 [797-1888] may be on a trimmed leaf from the same book.  The mounting to which reference is made was probably done before the drawings entered the Museum, and may be duet to the artist of his family.",
