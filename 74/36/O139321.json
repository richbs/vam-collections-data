These parts nailed onto the edges of the round flat lid and base (which are single boards). The bottom plank has shrunk across the grain. The decoration is built up on the wood in the following sequence: pasted linen, gesso, ochre/orange bole and gilding with some paint. The raised rim on the box and lid, and a raised moulding around the box have been formed with applied gesso. \n\nThe lid is decorated with a central lobed medallion with a raised border which is surrounded by floral scrolls and four roundels painted with ladies' heads (one defaced, one with hat, two bareheaded, in simple green or red gowns), which are interspersed with raised flower heads. A beaded border runs around the edge. The side of the box is similarly decorated, but has six roundel heads on black backgrounds (3 with hats, 3 bareheaded, wearing simple red or green gowns) between upper and lower bands with lunettes, and a raised band around the bottom and above the roundels, to seat the lid.\n\nThe underside is plain, gessoed with traces of bole. [check]. There is evidence of three turned feet which are now missing.\n\nFrom visual examination the lid plate is poplar or willow. The box base is softwood. The box side is poplar or willow. A crude lattice work has been glued to the underside of the lid to stabilise it. A strip of filler has been inserted inside the rim of the lid and the exterior gesso patched, to fill the gap between rim and plate, caused by cross-grain shrinkage of the lid plate, and the fixing of the rim with nails.",

Their decoration includes heraldic badges and beasts (particularly leopards, which denoted nobility and luxury), love inscriptions, and well-dressed couples, suggesting that these boxes were used in the context of betrothal rituals between noble families in renaissance Italy. Their shape and size would have made them ideal containers for the fine jewellery and belts that were typically sent to newly engaged brides as betrothal presents.\n\nThe construction used for the box and lid is relatively simple, consisting of a strip of wood bent into a circle and nailed in place around discs of wood for the bottom and lid. In contrast, the decoration is elaborately worked, in expensive materials - with moulded gesso, gilding, punching and some painted details - making the box, as well as the gift it contained, a valued object.",

Their shape and size, however, makes them ideal containers for such finery as jewelry and belts sent to newly affianced brides on the occasion of their betrothal...More work, however, remains to be done.'\n\nVarious similar boxes have been published, and the occurrence on them of heraldic beasts, arms, love inscriptions, and even a meeting of lovers supports the view that these boxes were used in the context of betrothal rituals.
