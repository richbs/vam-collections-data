After a short time in the army, he studied painting in Rome with the painter of miniatures, portraits and copies of old masters G B Canevari. First painted miniatures, but soon specialised in portraits, particularly of ladies of fashion (winning great reputation and patronage), ballet dancers, and also Italian subjects. Exhibited 77 portraits at the RA between 1842 and 1877, 32 Italian subjects at the BI 1850-65, 44 works (nearly all portraits) at the SBA 1840-76/7, and three paintings at the Grosvenor Gallery 1879; also exhibited in Rome. Lived at Cleveland Row, St James's, from 1847 till his death 12 August 1883. A sale of his collections, including his own works, was at Christie's 22-26 February 1873. Maas describes him as 'one of the best and most typical' painters of his kind. \n\nLIT: <i>Vanity Fair</i> 1 September 1883, p119 (obit);] Maas <i>Victorian Painters</i> 1969, pp212-3; B Stewart and M Cutten <i>Chichester Artists</i> 1530 1900 Canterbury 1987, pp3-6 (With full bibliography and portrait photograph); B Stewart and M Cutten 'The Forgotten Genius of Richard Buckner' <i>Antique Collector</i> April 1989, pp34-41 \n\n<b>Portrait of a Boy</b> \nP29-1962 Neg HB2557 \nCanvas, 43.2 x 28 cm (17 x 11 ins) \nSigned 'R Buckner f\u2019 diagonally br \nClaude D Rotch Bequest 1862\"",
