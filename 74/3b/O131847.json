Studied at J M Leigh's art school from 1848, and entered RA Schools 1851 where he won a medal for life drawing. Exhibited 73 works at the RA between 1850 and 1896 (elected ARA 1877, RA 1888), 15 at the BI 1853-65, and four at the SBA 1851-9. His subjects were various, but most famously Spanish: he is supposed to have visited Spain (often with Edwin Long RA) annually for 30 years from 1858; the <i>Magazine of Art</i> commented that he favoured the 'rough, rugged, dirty, sheepskin-clad, parched-up peasantry, gipsies and <i>contrabandistas</i> of the Sierra Morena, with the surroundings of the low <i>venta</i> and <i>posada</i>', offering an obvious comparison with John 'Spanish' Phillip RA. Died 12 November 1897; his studio sale was at Christie's 25 March 1898.\n \nLIT: <i>Illustrated London</i> News 14 July 1877, p37 (with engr portrait); <i>Art Journal</i> 1880, pp297-300; <i>Magazine of Art</i> 1882, pp133-7; <i>Illustrated London News</i> 20 November 1897, p719 (obit with engr portrait); J Chapel <i>Victorian Taste</i> 1982, pp70-1 \n\n<b>Portrait of George Gammon Adams</b> \nP44-1982 \nMillboard, 37.8 x 30.5 cm (14 7/8 x 12 ins) \nGiven by Miss I D Adams 1982 \n\nPossibly the painting exhibited at the RA in 1857 (1119) with the title 'George G Adams, Esq, Sculptor'. A manuscript label on the back, similar to that on the portrait of Adams, P43-1982, states that the sitter is aged 40, dating the painting to around 1861; however, this information - probably written by the donor - may well be inaccurate. For fuller details about the sitter, see the entry on the portrait by J J Adams (P43-1982, pi).\"",
