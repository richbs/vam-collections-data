The shape has been altered and extra pattern invented. Similar wares were made by several Neapolitan firms to cater for the public interest in classicism. The Colonnese family, Salvatore, his sons, Francesco and Gaetano, and a nephew, Alphonso, made a variety of wares from drain pipes to hybrid porcelain.\n\nNineteenth century European designers and craftspeople were greatly inspired by other cultures and historical periods. Fuelled by archaeological discoveries the simple lines and patterns of ancient Greek and Roman pottery were admired throughout the nineteenth century and classical myths and legends lent kudos to objects, imbuing them with the grandeur of the ancient world.",
