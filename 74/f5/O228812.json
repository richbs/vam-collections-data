The ground is undyed cotton. The main border contains inward facing floral sprigs: a vertical stem with 3 pink flowers alternating with two small sprigs, one above the other. In the centre of the cover is a horizontal, thin medallion pointed at either end. It is bordered with a band of green and light green chevrons and contains a central red and light brown rosette, 2 fan-shaped carnations, 2 large irises in pale, faded colours and 2 smaller ones in red and light brown.  The rest of the ground is filled with a floral motif which is repeated in offset bands: an S-shaped green stem with either 3 pink or 3 red flowers in one row and pink or yellow in the other, although there is a little variation. In the lower half of the cover, the flowers face to the right and in the upper half they are upside down and face to the left.\nBacking: pieced; white ground cotton printed with wavy parallel lines of brown branches with flowers in shades of light red and blue.\nFacing: bias cut brown cotton.\nThere is an interlining of white plain weave cotton through which the embroidery has been worked.",
