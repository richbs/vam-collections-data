The annotations on them, although often only partially legible, make clear their position at the centre of the design and manufacturing process - as an archival record but also as a source of ideas for subsequent designs. In this case the cast has been taken before the stones, which will provide colour to the flags, were mounted into their settings. The crest has not been identified and it is not known what event the brooch was made to commemorate.",
