The drawing, probably by John Yenn, shows the left-hand upper portion of a wine cooler of a French type, with a head-on-view of the handle and a ruled ink border. The handle is in the form of a single, naturalistically rendered stalk with a slipped end. From it, on the body, grows a band of heavy scrolling foliage and rosettes running under the gadrooned rim. Below the foliage is a band of ribbon and reed. A line of glue around the edges of the verso indicates that this drawing has been in an album.",

            "public_access_description": "Part elevation of the top of a wine cooler, with another view of its handle, probably by John Yenn (1750-1821) from the office of leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The drawing, probably by John Yenn, shows the left-hand upper portion of a wine cooler of a French type, with a head-on-view of the handle and a ruled ink border. The handle is in the form of a single, naturalistically rendered stalk with a slipped end. From it, on the body, grows a band of heavy scrolling foliage and rosettes running under the gadrooned rim. Below the foliage is a band of ribbon and reed. A line of glue around the edges of the verso indicates that this drawing has been in an album. It is clear that this drawing, which has come down to us as finished presentation drawings by the young John Yenn, is Chambers\u2019s conception.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
