This little stud was one of the pieces provided.\n\nAlthough it was acquired as an example of traditional Portuguese peasant jewellery, it is more typical of the kind of work which was produced (and is still being made) as souvenirs for visitors.  It cost ten shillings when it was acquired for the International Exhibition, London, in 1872.",
