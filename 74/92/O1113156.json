Most theatres and some circuses in the 19th century had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally, more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres. \n\nHarmston's Circus opened in Colombo on Saturday 28th April 1906, having sailed from Calcutta on Thursday 19th April. This programme was produced as a souvenir of their performance on 12th May because of the presence in the audience of  the Governor of Ceylon, Sir Henry Blake and his entourage. The circus stayed in Colombo until 26th May.\n\nHarmston's Circus was founded by the equestrian William Batty Harmston (1844-1893), born in Nottingham. After working with Chiarini's circus in India in 1887, he formed his own circus which toured Australia 1890-1891. After his death in Singapore, his widow carried on the circus with the manager Robert Love, who she married and whose surname can be seen on this programme added to her name and that of her children.",
