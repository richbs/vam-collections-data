This pair of short gloves in white kidskin are of a typical style, with a simple stud button at the wrist. They are reputed to have been worn by a bride in the 19th century. This pair of French gloves is stamped on the inside with the maker's name, C. Courvoisier.\n\nThe kid leather of these gloves remains in good condition, clean and white, although crumpled from years of compression in storage. However, the stitching along many of the seams has burst. Gloves of the late 19th century were often worn extremely tight, with glove-stretchers used to stretch the leather enough to enable the hands to be slipped inside. This tightness put great stress on the stitching of the gloves, and there are contemporary reports of gloves splitting and tearing in wear.",
