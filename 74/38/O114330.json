Black is used to compose a dense shape uncluttered by any decorative details save for the back fastening of two rows of tiny domed buttons and loops (hidden by the bolero). The dress is Princess Line of four main flared panels weighted at the back. In common with most 1930s evening dresses it has a low back neckline.

            "public_access_description": "This is an evening ensemble made of black taffeta. It is composed of a full-length, backless dress and of a short jacket. The dress has two straps at the back of the waist, going over the shoulders. The skirt of the dress flares out in heavy folds. The jacket is worn over the dress. It shows the shape of a tailcoat, opening high under the bust. The leg-of-mutton sleeves end at the elbow. \n\nThis evening ensemble was designed by Edward Molyneux (1891-1974). Molyneux was born in London, England. He opened a dressmaking salon in Paris in 1919. He was based in London from the mid-1930s until the end of World War II, when he returned to Paris. \n\nDuring the 1930s, evening wear underwent tremendous transformations. By 1930, designers of women's fashion had abandoned the linear, gamine look of the 1920s in favour of softer, more sculptural clothes which accentuated feminine contours. Bodices were slightly bloused; skirts were gently flared. Hemlines dropped and for the first time varied according to the time of day. Evening gowns were full-length. \n\nCouturiers also abandoned the costly, labour-intensive decorative techniques of the 1920s, such as embroideries. They focussed on colour combinations, the use of lace, or on the inherent characteristics of rich materials such as taffeta, as in this evening ensemble. \n\nIn the 1930s, the suit for women had become so popular that its concept of a long skirt and short high-waisted jacket was borrowed for evening wear. Short boleros and, as in this evening ensemble, jackets were used to cover backless evening gowns. \n\nAnother strong influence on evening wear came from historical and escapist sources. Designers derived much of their inspiration from neo-classicism and Victorian revivalism. This vogue gave rise to leg-of-mutton sleeves on tailored jackets, and on evening jackets. From 1935 onwards, the skirt grew wider, probably to balance with the new voluminous sleeves.",
