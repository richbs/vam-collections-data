The front \n has a gilt border and shows three little girls in aprons doing the laundry \n out of doors: one, in a yellow dress and hat washing at a large tub; \n another, in a blue dress, hanging an item up to dry; and a third, in a pink \n dress, sitting on the grass.  Beneath the illustration are the words\n \"A Joyful Christmas\"\n The reverse of the card is printed with a verse in brown, beneath an\n illustration of a cherub's head:\n  \"I love the little boys and girls,\n   They back my mem'ry take\n   To happy days of bibs and curls\n   Of candy and of cake.\n   I sang my Christmas carols then\n   As only children may,\n   And this is why I'll kiss them, when\n   The children sing to-day.\n   And wish them all the simple joy\n   That filled my bosom when a boy!\"\nF.
