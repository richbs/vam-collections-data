            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke. \n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Garaku. Garaku was a distinguished carver who worked in Osaka during the 18th century. He was the pupil of Tawaraya Denbei and Garaku's successor, Taguchi, was known as Garaku II. This netsuke is elongated and sculptural in form with the stereotyped features of a dog. Its wide open mouth and animated eyes replicate the quizzical expression of the animal. It is a lively composition while its long neck would have made the netsuke vulnerable to breakages.",
