In this caricatures of fashionable and stylish figures commonly seen around Paris are satirised.  This particular image features Monsieur Poudret a hairdresser.  He is shown tending to his mannequin with a comb and powdering its wig.  Fashion played an important part in the French revolution.  Changes in fashion were as dramatic as the changes in government.  The powdered wig seen in the print became the symbol of the Ancien Regime aristocracy that had been wiped out during the Revoltion.  Considering that this was made after the French Revolution, the decapitated mannequin head and the cruel way Mr. Poudret holds his pins in his mouth and fixes the object of his attention with such a cruel gaze is a reminder of the guillotine and full of black dark humour.  The print is an etching made after Auger and published by Aaron Martinet in 1813.  Martinet was the owner of a print shop in Paris famous for its window displays of satirical caricatures, which changed fortnightly.",
