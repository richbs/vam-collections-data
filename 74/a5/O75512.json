At the end of the 1960s clothes with geometric lines dependent on firm fabrics were abandoned in favour of flowing styles in softer materials. Designers often combined a variety of different printed patterns and tonal colours in one garment or in interchangeable fabrics. Here Bill Gibb assembled textiles designed by Susan Collier and Sarah Campbell for Liberty's to create a romantic dress. The fabrics are 'Tana' lawn, 'Nimbus' voile and 'Country' cotton. The printed designs work well together and are enhanced by the floral leather motifs and streamers.",
