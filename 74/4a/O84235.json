In 1917 his son Alexander joined the business and later introduced Daks (an amalgam of Dad and Slacks) trousers in 1934, which eliminated the need for braces. 1934 was also the year that the company opened their store in Piccadilly and in the late 1930s they  began designing classic womenswear. Designed as part of the DAKS total look, this practical bag has the interior pockets and fittings associated with informal country styling. With its DAKS logo and signature check, this bag has become a British classic.",
