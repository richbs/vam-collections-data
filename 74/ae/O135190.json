Gayer Anderson, 1942\nThis icon is one of six panels donated to the V&A by Major R G Gayer Anderson in 1942 (W.11-1942, W.12-1942, W.13-1942, W.14-1942, W.15-1942, W.16-1942). Major Gayer-Anderson was a keen Orientalist who had lived in Cairo for many years until ill health forced him back to his family home in Suffolk in 1942, the same year as this donation. His vast collection of antiquities and furnishings was divided primarily between the Major Gayer-Anderson Museum in Cairo (composed of his seventeenth-century house and all of its furnishings), and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, which became the beneficiary of his collection of Egyptian antiquities.\n\nHistorical significance: This icon depicts the sixteenth century Saint Gerasimos, the patron saint of Kefalonia. It is in excellent condition and is finely painted. The style of the icon dates it to the nineteenth century. Gerasimos is an apotropaic Saint who is invoked for protection from evil and for healing. A monastery in Kefalonia is named for him. Because of the size and subject of this icon, it was likely produced for veneration in a church. The Feast day for Saint Gerasimos is 16 August.",
