            "public_access_description": "This panel depicts the Old Testament story, from the Book of Kings, of Joab stabbing Amasa. Joab was a nephew of King David and was appointed by the king to be one of his military generals. Joab desired more power and was envious of the favour David bestowed upon his other generals. So Joab killed two of the king\u2019s other military leaders, Abner of Israel and Amasa of Judah. \n\nThis panel is one of many in the V&A\u2019s collections that come from the cloisters of the Abbey of Mariawald in Germany. Mariawald was a Cistercian abbey founded in 1480. The Cistercians were a monastic order established in 1098 in Burgundy at Citeaux. The founder of the Cistercians had broken away from the Benedictines which had been the first monastic order to be established in Europe, in the 6th century.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were \u2018secularised\u2019 and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Mariawald was closed down in 1802 but fortunately its buildings, including the cloisters, remain intact. However, the stained glass windows had been removed and it is believed that they were purchased by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Mariawald panels to various churches and to private collectors. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nThe Mariawald stained glass panels come from ten windows on the west and north sides of the cloister, plus one from the north end of the eastern part. The glazing of these cloisters began about 1510 and seem to have been completed in the 1530s.\n\nAs the cloisters were never dismantled we can reconstruct how the panels were placed in the architectural structure. The window openings in the cloisters were each composed of two openings (\u2018lights\u2019). Each light was composed of three panels. So there would have been six panels to each window.\n\nFrom the surviving stained glass panels we can determine the theme of the cloister glazing. Each window had two panels depicting scenes from the Old Testament and two panels with scenes from the New Testament. Above the biblical story panels, were two smaller prophet (or \u2018messenger\u2019) panels. These contained half-images of Old Testament prophets holding scrolls with text relating to biblical passages connected with the scenes below. At the base of each window were donor and patron saint panels. These donors were the ones who contributed to the financing of the cloister glazing.\n\nThis type of narrative arrangement is known as \u2018typological\u2019. Each Old Testament story was a \u2018type\u2019 or a prefigurement of a New Testament story (\u2018antitype\u2019). For example, the Old Testament story of the \u2018Stabbing of Amasa by Joab\u2019 was a prefigurement of the New Testament \u2018Betrayal of Jesus Christ by Judas\u2019.\n\nThe typological arrangement was popular in the Middle Ages. The stories were reproduced in manuscripts and in engravings from woodcuts and collectively were known as \u2018Biblia Pauperum\u2019 (\u2018Bibles of the Poor\u2019). At the end of the 15th century the Biblia Pauperum were printed in book form and sold in their thousands. These books were used as design sources for artworks including stained glass panels.",
