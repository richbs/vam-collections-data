Morris & Co. were commissioned to decorate Membland Hall in Devon, by George Devey, architect to the banker E.C. Baring, Baron Revelstoke. The squared up pattern and one other panel is at the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, with a note indicating that it was intended for the bathroom.\n\nHistorical significance: It is the only floral pattern for a tile panel on this scale by Morris. Presumably its ambitious size (of sixty-six individual tiles) and the need to produce a matching set suggested that he should turn to the better equipped De Morgan fo its production. The design remained on Morris & Co.'s stocklists until 1912-13 and a number of panels, other than the Membland six, are known to have been made. At least one uses De Morgan's own Fulham Pottery tiles. Far less particular than Morris, De Morgan supplemented his own production by using the Hamworthy tileworks (and other commercial manufacturers in Staffordshire and Shropshire) and the Carter & Co. pottery, also at Poole, to supply blanks for his own lustre- and colour-glaze wares.",
