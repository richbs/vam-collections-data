The image is taken from the familiar map of the London Underground railway system, but with the sites of hospitals where closures are planned substituted for the names of some of the stations. The message on the card makes play with the word 'tube' - London's Underground is often referred to as 'the tube' - and the slang expression 'going down the tubes', used to describe something which is failing or in decline. According to the then Marketing Manager of London Regional Transport these petition forms were handed out at London Underground stations during the 1988 Budget speech.",
