Western pilgrims to the Holy Land frequently passed through Cyprus, and the Cypriot goldsmiths absorbed influences from Western Europe as well as Ottoman Turkey.  Their work is similar to jewellery from elsewhere in the region, but the quality is often higher.  \n\nThese bracelets are Western European in design, with hinged segments and a snap clasp, but the decoration and construction are more Cypriot.  They are made from copper, double plated first with silver and then with gold, so that they would look and wear like silver-gilt.  This was a common technique in the Balkans in the 18th and 19th centuries, when much of the population was desperately poor.  Bracelets were always worn in pairs, one on each wrist.",
