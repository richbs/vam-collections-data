Carl Paul B\u00f6rner, an architect, was employed as one of the principal artists.  They specialised in a form of majolica using transparent glazes on deeply modelled forms.  Within a few years the company was awarded prizes at Melbourne (1880), Frankfurt (1881) and Hamburg (1889) for its ceramics and also began manufacturing glass, metal and leather wares. Bichweiler won prizes at several international exhibitions and this cup would have been acquired as an example of their manufacturing techniques as well as their interest in historic styles",
