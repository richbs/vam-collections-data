It originated in the simple form of a shepherd's crook and referred to the biblical description of Christ as 'the good shepherd'. Some medieval croziers are among the most magnificent of all surviving goldsmiths' work and are richly decorated with architectural and sculptural ornament. This example is in the fully developed baroque style of the mid 17th century and combines naturalistic foliage with religiously significant motifs such as the winged cherub's head and the head of the Virgin Mary at the centre. It is difficult to be certain where such an internationally designed piece might have been made although the prominent beading is typical of Antwerp.",
