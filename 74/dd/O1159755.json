Christie had a good career as an artist, perhaps most famous for his murals and work in Scotland - he studied at the Glasgow School of Art under muralist Walter Pritchard. \nThe period from 1965-75 was spent observing the behaviour and body language of his teenage pupils quickly sketched unposed at school. These studies really capture a sense of the belligerent and awkward teenager, reflected through their body language and their often sullen, apathetic expressions.",
