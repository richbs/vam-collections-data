            "history_note": "Historical significance: China is not known for making glass, historically considering glass inferior to ceramics and jade (as westerners did too). This tendency continued into the 20th century with the encouragement of very traditional styles. Towards the end of the 20th century, Loretta Yang with her husband Chang Yi and five others, set up China's first professional glass arts studio called Newworkshop (by 1998 they employed 100 staff). This was located on the outskirts of Tamsui in Taiwan. Yang, a former actress, went to study glass making in America at Urban Glass and worked with the pate-de-verre technique. She perfected this back in Taiwan, with the help of Taiwanese university professors who had an interest in science and materials. The first sculpture Yang made was one of Buddha and this continues to be her favourite subject. Most of Yang's sculptures are over 2 feet, the largest yet in the history of glass making in China. She creates traditional images of Buddha in a contemporary design and size. Yang consciously recalls Chinese archaic bronze vessels, made by the lost wax method, in her work. She uses the same method in her work, forging the link between past and present.",
