Her left hand is  held out at waist level while the other holds out a bunch of flowers.\n\nShe is dressed in a gold paned transparent <i>peshwaz</i> with a half-drop pattern of golden leaves worn over white <i>paijama</i>.  A full-length golden <i>patka</i> decorated with flowers and scrolls falls from her waist to her hem with a golden fringe at the end.  She is also wearing a golden sleeveless jacket decorated with a pattern of red flowers and lined in green, over which is draped a narrow diaphanous purple-coloured <i>odhani</i> edged in gold with a golden trellis pattern.  She has pearl necklaces, bracelets, earrings and forehead jewellery in addition to a green and red gemstone necklace round her throat.  On her feet she is wearing a pair of crimson and purple slippers with golden-fringed pom-poms on the toes.  Her finger-tips are painted in a deep crimson colour. \n\nThe image has been extended on all sides as it has been centred on a larger piece of paper which has been painted to match the background of the original with  grey streaks at the top to suggest a night sky.\n\nThe extended painting matches that on the opposite page in size and is framed in a similar manner with a pinky-brown inner frame decorated in a scrolling floral pattern ( although different to that on IS.48:25/B-1956) but with similar outlines in gold, white and black with an outer outline in blue.  The ivory-coloured outer border has a similar pattern of gold-outlined red poppies and pink lilies.  The outer margins of collaged strips of buff-coloured paper with an inner white outline also match those on the opposite pageand a similar pale-brown strip of paper has been added as a binding gutter.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade which may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
