Palmer after Sutton Palmer. \nWash 7 7/8 x 12 1/2 \nBequesthed by H. Harrdo \n\nNote: This drawing or a replica was reproduced as Pl.10 to face p.46 of <i>Samuel Palmer, A Memoir</i> by A. H. Palmer, London, 1882; the plate shows a slightly wider composition, and the drawing may have been cut by a later owner when mounting. It is described in the book as being then in the possession of J. P. Heseltine and is entitled \"The Good Farmer\", under which title it was exhibited as No.111 in the Old Water Colour Society's Annual Exhibition, 1865. \n\nIn the Heseltine sale at Messrs. Sotheby's on 29 May 1935, Lot 438 would appear from its description (thought entitled 'To Oakminster', from the name drawn on the signpost), to be this drawing. The size there given 12 x 20 3/4, presumably included mount and frame, and it was said to be signed; there is no trace of a signature on E.1132-1948, nor on Pl.10 of A. H. Palmer's <i>Memoir</i>.'",
