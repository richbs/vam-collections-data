They were manufactured throughout the first quarter of the nineteenth century and were often highly cherished, with some being kept and used at a later date. The earliest datable commemorative panels are those celebrating George III's Golden Jubilee in 1810. \n\nThis example has an excise stamp for 1816 and is inscribed 'John Lowe and Co. Furniture Printers, Shepley Hall', providing the name of the only identifiable manufacturer of these panels, although there are likely to have been others. John Lowe was a well-known firm of calico printers with large cotton factories and extensive bleaching grounds close to the River Tame near Ashton-under-Lyne in Lancashire.",
