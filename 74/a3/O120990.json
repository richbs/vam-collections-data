The text below translates as '1915.  14 roubles a pair.  The customer takes time to choose from a large selection of style and quality'. \n\nThe second image (upper right) shows the same interior, with almost empty shelves, only one assistant, one man trying on a pair of shoes, and three others waiting (one reads a newspaper).  The accompanying text reads, '1917. 75 roubles a pair.  Later during the Revolution, there is no choice'.\n\nThe third image (lower left), shows the exterior of the shop, with a queue of men outside, including a Bolshevik soldier holding a rifle.  The accompanying text reads, '1918.  500 roubles - card carriers only.  In the Bolshevik era, commissars and communists flaunt new shoes as ordinary people queue outside'.\n\nThe final image (lower right) shows the same exterior, but the door is now padlocked.  a group of mainly barefoot men look on, and the related text translates as, '1919.  No problem! In a free country you can work barefoot'.",

Later during the Revolution, there is no choice.\n\n1918.  500 roubles - card carriers only.  In the Bolshevik era, commissars and communists flaunt new shoes as ordinary people queue outside.\n\n1919.  No problem! In a free country you can work barefoot.\n\nThis propaganda poster in the style of a Lubok or Russian popular print, attacks the Communists' economic management.",
