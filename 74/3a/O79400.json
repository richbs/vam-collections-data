The central medallions carry blazons that read, \u2018Glory be to our master the Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Abu'l-Nasr Qa'itbay, may his victories be glorious\u2019. Except for their size, the two inscriptions in inlaid silver in the upper and lower bands are identical. They read:\n\nGlory to our lord the Sultan, the most noble ruler, sultan of Islam and the Muslims, reviver of justice in the world, suppressor of the immoral and rebellious, sultan of the Arabs and Persians, lord of the two seas, servant of the Two Holy Shrines, master of kings and sultans, Commander of the Faithful, Abu'l-Nasr Qa'itbay, may God Almighty make his reign long!\n\nThese triumphs of the calligrapher's and metalworker's art would have been invisible when the light was shining from inside the holder. But we can still appreciate the skill required to create them.\n\nThis lamp holder is very similar to one now in the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo.",
