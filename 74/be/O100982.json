The \"bowls\" are inspired by 17th and 18th century, Baroque and Rococo designs in ornaments - such as on classical ceilings and buildings - and decorations - for example on velvet wallpaper and brocade.  These I repeat until an interesting pattern emerges.  I materialise these patterns by sawing parts from this silver sheet.  This implies choice.  It led to two dishes for each design:  one positive and one negative, that are each other's counterpart.  The dishes are each hand-sawed out of a 0.935 dz. silver plate, that was subsequently forged into shape.  They are 25x25x6 cm.  Each dish took over 100 hours of manual labour.",
