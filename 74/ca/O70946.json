The Virgin was doubtless seated on the upper left of the panel, holding the Child on her lap, who reaches out with his left hand to touch a cup held in the right hand of the bearded king, Gaspar. He wears a loose gown with a low belt from which small bells are hanging, and kneels on his right knee looking up at the Child, holding a crown in his left hand. The leg of another king is to the right and behind him stands the lower half of a king, holding his present in his left hand. The figure of Joseph sits sleeping on the ground in the lower left of the panel, supporting his head on his right hand, a cross-staff held between his legs by his left hand. The heads of the ox and the ass are shown reaching out from beneath Joseph's cloak, presumably towards a manger. \n\nThe whole of the top and right side of the panel are missing. A diagonal break across the centre of the panel has been repaired. The carving is weathered. Very slight traces of green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain at the bottom of the panel. The back of the panel bears four lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

One of the kings is shown on the right hand side holding a cup which the baby Jesus reaches out to touch with his hand. The figure of St Joseph appears on the left of the panel, supporting his head on his right hand with a cross-staff held between his legs. The heads of the ox and the ass are shown reaching out from beneath Joseph's clock. \n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
