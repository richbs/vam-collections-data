The image on the brooch is in reverse from the portrait and it probably  follows a lithograph by Henri Grevedon published in Paris in 1839 which is also in reverse. We think that the French jeweller F\u00e9lix Dafrique showed this brooch at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. There he received a Prize Medal for his 'polychromic cameos'. Dafrique played a leading role in reviving the Renaissance fashion for commessi brooches. A commesso is a type of cameo further decorated with enamelled gold and jewels.",

Available in the gallery and on the V&A website.\nVersion without illustrations:\n\nBrooch with cameo of Queen Victoria\nThis brooch was shown at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, perhaps to attract the queen\u2019s attention during one of her many visits to the exhibition. The image was taken from a portrait that showed the queen in Garter robes.\n\nThe Parisian jeweller F\u00e9lix Dafrique revived a Renaissance style of jewel called \u2018commesso\u2019 (meaning \u2018joined\u2019). The cameo was cut by Paul Lebas, a well-regarded sculptor and gem engraver, who often exhibited at the Paris Salon. His most prominent works included cameo portraits of the French royal family.\n \nBrooch with cameo of Queen Victoria\nParis, dated 1851\nBy F\u00e9lix Dafrique; cameo by Paul Lebas (active 1829-70)\nShell, gold, enamel, emeralds and diamonds\nV&A: M.340-1977\n\n The brooch was shown at the Great Exhibition, where over 6 million visitors viewed more than 13,000 exhibits.\n\nThis view depicts the opening ceremony on 1 May 1851, which some said was even grander than the coronation. The project had been championed by the queen\u2019s husband, Prince Albert, and the royal family visited the exhibition on several occasions. \n\nThe Opening of the Great Exhibition by Queen Victoria\nEngland, 1851-2\nBy Henry Courtney\nOil on canvas\nV&A: 329-1889\nVictoria & Albert Museum, London\n\nIn carving the cameo, Lebas probably followed this engraving [by Grevedon, caption below]. The original portrait shows the queen facing the other way, but the engraving is in reverse.\n\nSully was a society portraitist from Philadelphia. On a visit to London in 1837 he was commissioned to paint a portrait of the new queen. He was delighted with her \u2018sweet tone of voice, and gentle manner\u2019. She, in turn, was pleased with the portrait, which highlighted her best features: her shoulders and the curving line of her neck. \n \nQueen Victoria\nParis, 1839\nBy Henri Grevedon, after the 1838 portrait by Thomas Sully\nLithograph\n[an example of this lithograph is in the collection of the British Museum].",

The cameo is a free adaptation (reversed of Thomas Sully's portrait of Queen Victoria in Garter Robes, dated 1838 (a version of the painting in the Wallace Collection was engraved by Wagstaff and published in 1839). The reverse of the shell is signed : Paul Lebas/Graveur/1851/Paris. The gold mounts struck with the maker's mark of Felix Dafrique and a French export mark in use from 1840 onwards. Dafrique was probably responsible for reviving the Renaissance vogue for commessi, small works or art made from a combination of stones (in this case, shell is substituted for hardstone). The jeweller was awarded a Prize Medal at the Great Exhibition in 1851 for 'polychromic cameos', which probably included this example.",
