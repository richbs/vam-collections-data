The collection consists largely of beakers and tankards, valued in Edwardian England as a Scandinavian \u201cArts and Crafts\u201d tradition. George Jorck, a Danish silver dealer who worked in Hatton Garden in London, acted as agent for dealers in Copenhagen and was instrumental in acquiring many of the objects for the collection. HP Mitchell of the Metalwork Department wrote in 1904, \u201cMr Jorck tells me large numbers are being sold to the American museums; it is pretty clear that the country districts of Sweden are being denuded rapidly and it might be well to make our gaps complete while there is this opportunity\u201d.",
