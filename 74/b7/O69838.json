            "public_access_description": "This bronze statuette entitled 'Comedy and Tragedy' is by Sir Alfred Gilbert, cast 1891-1892 in Great Britain. It is in the form of a nude boy, with mask thrown up on the fore-head. He is holding another and larger mask. The figure is mounted on a black wooden pedestal.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also a medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman and was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used various materials in the same work. Upon his many commissions for monuments and memorials is the celebrated Eros figure as part of the Shaftsbury memorial (1885-1893) on Piccadilly Circus.\n\nAs with the figure of Perseus (77-1904), in his interview given in the Easter Art Annual, Gilbert related this statue to his personal life, as being ' the climax to my cycle of stories...It represents a boy carrying a comic mask. He is stung by a bee - the symbol of love. He turns, and his face becomes tragic. The symbol is in reality fact. I was stung by that bee typified by my love for my art, a consciousness of its incompleteness, my love was not sufficient...I was living a kind of double life at that time, enjoying  the society of Irving and Toole and other famous and pleasant members of the Garrick Club going to the theatre at night, and with Tragedy in my private life, living my Comedy publicly, if not enjoying it'. A one-act play at the Lyceum called Comedy and Tragedy inspired Gilbert, and he furhter states that ' I conceived the notion of harking back to the old Greek stage upon which masks were always worn, and I conceived a kind of stage property boy rushing away in great glee with his comedy mask, and on his way being stung by a bee. This was the only way in which I could present the hidden pain and passion of the boy'.",

He is stung by a bee - the symbol of love. He turns, and his face becomes tragic. The symbol is in reality fact. I was stung by that bee typified by my love for my art, a consciousness of its incompleteness, my love was not sufficient...I was living a kind of double life at that time, enjoying  the society of Irving and Toole and other famous and pleasant members of the Garrick Club going to the theatre at night, and with Tragedy in my private life, living my Comedy publicly, if not enjoying it'. A one-act play at the Lyceum called Comedy and Tragedy inspired Gilbert, and he furhter states that ' I conceived the notion of harking back to the old Greek stage upon which masks were always worn, and I conceived a kind of stage property boy rushing away in great glee with his comedy mask, and on his way being stung by a bee. This was the only way in which I could present the hidden pain and passion of the boy'.",
