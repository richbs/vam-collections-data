The fairy costumes and fantasy elements are set in a 'real' world, inspired by the soaring architectural fantasies of the 17th and 18th centuries and costumes based upon mid-late 17th century fashions, mixing English, Spanish and French period styles. Messel's costume for a Cavalier is in sober brown, thus creating a neutral background against which the principal costumes could stand out, but the vermilion and pink trims, which, conventionally, would be seen as clashing, in Messel's hands add a flamboyant accent.   \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

The production was in the repertory for nearly twenty-five years.  Messel revised the designs several times, with major revisions in 1952 and 1960 and he reworked the designs when the production was mounted in 1959 for the Royal Ballet Touring Company.  Not all costumes were revised, and he made use of the 1946 designs where he did not wish to make any changes.  This design dates from 1946 while the names of the men relate to the 1960 revised production.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel's designed <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> for the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet in 1946.  The production was constantly in the repertory of both The Royal Ballet and, after 1959, the Royal Ballet Touring Company until it was replaced between 1968 and 1970.",
