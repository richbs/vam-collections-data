The village church is seen down the path, and to it are wending their way various members of the good pastor's flock, who smile when a sabbath appears, and put on their Sunday best. In the foreground, we see the village preacher with his walking-stick ; but where his modest mansion stands we are not shown. On the right are some fine trees. The print makes a nice companion to No. 113.'",
