(1815-1884), former Governor of Bombay, in 1877.\n  As John Guy writes in The Peaceful Liberators (see reference below) the high degree of stylistic uniformity suggests that these pieces were collected from a single temple, or at least from sites that were contemporary.  They are related to known Solanki dynasty temples of the 11th and 12th centuries: inscriptions record that endowments were made to the Shatrunjaya temples during the reign of Siddharaja Jayasimha (1095-1142), a Solanki ruler renowned for his patronage.\n  A similar sculpture of Ambika, sitting on a lion  with a second son on her left is at Navgaja,  Alwar, Rajasthan, illustrated in Jain, J. and  Fischer, E., Jaina Iconography, part two,  Leiden, 1978p. 41, pl.
