The Tau cross is said to represent the crutch which he used to control his herd. The resemblance of the Tau to a cross led to it being ascribed a mystical significance. \n\nSt Anthony was believed to cure ergotism, or St Anthony's fire, and to protect the faithful against pestilence and poisoning. He was the patron saint of the poor and sick and of knights, butchers and brushmakers. A ring bearing the symbol of St Anthony would confer the protection of the saint on the wearer. It may also have been used by members of religious orders dedicated to St Anthony, for example the military order of the Knights of St Anthony, founded by Albert II of Bavaria in 1382 before his proposed campaign against the Turks. It is also possible that some rings bearing this emblem may commemorate a pilgrimage to the church of St Antoine de Viennois, Dauphin\u00e9, France where the saint's relics were placed after their transfer from Constantinople in the eleventh century.",

The Tau cross is said to represent the crutch which he used to control his herd. The resemblance of the Tau to Christ's crucifixion cross led to it being ascribed a mystical significance. \n\nSt Anthony was believed to cure ergotism or St Anthony's fire and to protect the faithful against pestilence and poisoning. He was the patron saint of the poor and sick and of knights, butchers and brushmakers. A ring bearing the symbol of St Anthony would confer the protection of the saint on the wearer. It may also have been used by members of religious orders dedicated to St Anthony, for example the military order of the Knights of St Anthony, founded by Albert II of Bavaria in 1382 before his proposed campaign against the Turks. It is also possible that some rings bearing this emblem may commemorate a pilgrimage to the church of St Antoine de Viennois, Dauphin\u00e9, France where the saint's relics were placed after their transfer from Constantinople in the eleventh century.",
