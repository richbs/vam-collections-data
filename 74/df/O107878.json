It is inscribed with the motto of the Order: Honi soit qui mal y pense and set with the portrait of an unknown man. \n\nGarter rings form a very small and as yet, not fully understood group. The earliest ring of this type known dates from 1626 and commemorates the death of Lancelot Andrewes, the Bishop of Winchester and Prelate of the Order of the Garter but other examples date from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. \n\nThe Order of the Garter was founded by Edward III in 1348 and is the oldest order of chivalry in Europe. The insignia of the Order have developed over the centuries: starting with a garter and badge depicting St George and the Dragon. A collar was added in the sixteenth century, and the star and broad riband in the seventeenth century. However, rings were not included in the formal insignia. \n\nElias Ashmole, the seventeenth century antiquary, suggested that the rings were distributed to the friends and relatives of newly inaugurated knights whilst a nineteenth century historian believes them to be gifts to commemorate a deceased Garter King of Arms. As yet, no evidence from wills, portraits or inventories has been found to confirm either use.",

Only seven rings are currently known of, five of which were published by Edward Donohoe in 1990. Their original function and significance are not yet known: certain rings appear to have a mourning function whilst at least one other is an early eighteenth century Jacobite ring. Elias Ashmole refers to their use in the seventeenth century and suggests that they may have been given to friends and relations by newly installed Knights. In 1842, Sir Nicholas Harris described the contemporary use of the rings as mourning rings for the friends of a deceased Garter King at Arms. However, no corroborating evidence regarding their use has yet been found in the portraits or papers of Garter knights or in any wills or inventories.",
