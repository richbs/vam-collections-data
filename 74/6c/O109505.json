As there 'was no Place of Public Worship to which the Children and Servants of the Hospital could conveniently resort' the Governors resolved 'to erect a Chapel adjoining to their Hospital in Lamb's Conduit Fields being earnestly desirous that the children in their care should be early instructed in the Principles of Religion and Morality'. 'They should be taught the Catechism used by the Church of England and heard to read such parts of the holy scripture as are most suitable for their understanding.' The Chapel was erected by public subscription with a contribution of \u00a32000 from King George II and the first stone laid on 1st May 1747. The chapel opened in 1753 with a special performance of music by George Frederick Handel. The altarpiece 'The offering of the Wise Men' was painted by Andrea Casali. The pulpit was given by the architect Henry Keene, The children sat in the galleries on the north and south sides of the chapel, the subscribers and supporters of the charity sat in the main body of the chapel and placed their contribution in the almsdishes",

In 18th-century London, leading citizens founded institutions to assist the poor, sick and isolated. Prevention was better than a cure, and in 1758 the Asylum for Female Orphans was founded to prevent prostitution. In the same year the Magdalen Hospital was established to reform repentant prostitutes.\n\nHospital governors recognised the importance of religion in educating and nurturing those for whom they cared. Regular communion was considered part of the healing process. In poorhouses parish officers saw that communion was celebrated and prayer books distributed.\n\nThe Foundling Hospital was founded by Captain Thomas Coran in 1746 to provide a home and education for orphans and abandoned babies. The governors wanted the children to be instructed in the 'Principles of Religion and Morality' and to go to church on Sundays and other days appointed for public worship. They were also to be reminded of the 'lowness of their Condition, that they may early imbibe the Principles of Humility and Gratitude to their Benefactors'",
