Ring brooches can be circular or heart-shaped, and their design dates from the Middle Ages.  They differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  Ring brooches were worn throughout Norway in the 18th and 19th century.  Their shape and pattern varied by district and use.  They were worn by men, women, and children.\n\nThere are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian.  Each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  \n \nA spores\u00f8lje is a ring brooch with six protruding points, usually shaped like stylised leaves.  Spores\u00f8ljer with projections shaped like faces are called glibbs\u00f8ljer.  They are always made of cast metal, and were mainly worn in the west of Norway, by both men and women.",
