Her arms are supported by an angel, a feature that is often found in ecclesiastical heraldry. It is recorded that the Zurich glass painter Lukas Zeiner received payments in 1488 for glass supplied to the convent, and it is likely that this panel was executed at that time.\n\nLukas Zeiner was both a glass painter and a glazier. He is recorded in the town records of Zurich between 1479 and 1512. At this time, the records are quite specific and glass painters like Zeiner are often recorded by name rather than as simply \u2018glass painter\u2019. In the 15th and 16th centuries it was becoming more common to commission  secular, heraldic, glass. This was especially so in mainland Europe,  where the rules as to who could claim a coat of arms were more relaxed than in England. Zeiner was a leading glass artist in the field of heraldic painting.  His style, which featured a coat of arms with supporters within an elaborate canopy, set the stage for similar work for the next hundred years.",

Her arms are supported by an angel which is often found in ecclesiastical heraldry. It is recorded that the Zurich glass-painter Lukas Zeiner received payments in 1488 for glass supplied to the convent, and it is likely that this panel was executed at that time.\n\nLukas Zeiner was a glass painter and glazier. He is recorded in the town records of Zurich between 1479 and 1512. At this time, the records are quite specifc and glass painters like Zeiner are often recorded by name rather than as simply 'glass painter'. The commissioning of secular, heraldic, glass was becoming more common in the 15th and 16th centuries, especially on the Continent where the rules as to who could claim a coat of arms was more relaxed than it was in England. Zeiner was a leading glass artist in the field of heraldic painting and his style which featured a coat of arms with supporters within an elaborate canopy set the stage for similar work for the next hundred years.",
