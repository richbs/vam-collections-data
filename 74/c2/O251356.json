Under the wide thin shelf is a frieze of marble supported at either end by pairs of female caryatid figures in classical dress. The frieze is carved with a procession scene showing two centaurs, satyrs and two cupids, and at the ends above the supporting figures, rosettes. \nIt came from 4 Carlton Gardens, London, a house that was demolished in 1932. Although 4 Carlton Gardens was built around 1830, the style of this chimneypiece suggests an earlier date of around 1800.\n\nGarrard (1760-1826) was an English painter and sculptor. After serving an apprenticeship with Sawrey Gilpin, later his father-in-law, Garrard became a student at the Royal Academy Schools, London, in 1778, exhibiting his first sporting picture there in 1781. Though his occasional genre paintings were better received than his many animal subjects (Sir Joshua Reynolds purchased his View of a Brew-house Yard from the Academy exhibition of 1784), he initially determined to practise as a sporting artist, probably on the advice of the notorious sportsman Colonel Thomas Thornton (1755\u20131823) for whom he had worked in the 1780s.",
