He wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes he photographed. \n\nBourne\u2019s first sight of the Taj Mahal was overwhelming. He wrote: \u2018The world knows not another building to be compared with the Taj. It rises in its queenly beauty on the banks of the Jumna, and the eye that has once gazed on its snowy whiteness and dazzling splendour can never forget it.\u2019 \n\nShah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in honour of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. She died in 1631 giving birth to her 14th child. Completed in 1643, the Taj is the greatest achievement of the Mughal architectural tradition because of its perfect synthesis of symmetry and simplicity of form. The building of the mausoleum alone was said to cost five million rupees. This did not include the cost of the white marble, which was extracted from Makrana in Rajasthan.",
