With a woven design in pink floral sprigs with a border pattern at the hem of arcaded bunches of flowers supporting bowls of fruit banded by an undulating row of flowers surmounted by a wave-like pattern. Jacquard woven. The dress has a low rounded square neck with pleated bands running from shoulder to waist. The sleeves are fairly full and puffed, and the waistband is at high natural level. The dress is flat pleated at the front and tightly gathered at the centre back. It opens down the centre back where there are tapes at neck and waist. The hook and eye fastening does not appear to be original. The bodice is lined with white cotton, and the skirt with glazed cotton. There is a worked eyelet hole on the right side above the waist.\n\nThere are signs of alteration at the waistband and the sides of the skirt, but these are faint and it is unlikely that they indicate more than a slight contemporary rearrangement, which has been intended to enlarge the bodice.",
