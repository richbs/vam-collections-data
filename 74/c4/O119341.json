There had been a 19th-century craze for Staffordshire earthenware figurines of performers and Agatha Walker's work echoed this tradition. Her figurines, produced as limited editions, were modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 her figurines were exhibited at London's Fine Arts Society.\n\nIt represents Edith Evans (1886-1961) as Mistress Page in Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, Lyric Theatre Hammersmith, 22 December 1923.  Dorothy Green played Mistress Ford, and Agatha Walker produced figurines of both. \n\nEdith Evans made her first professional stage appearance in 1912 and was already acknowledged as a star by 1923. The Merry Wives if Windsor was another succesful production for Sir Nigel Playfair, the owner of the Lyric Theatre who had purchased its lease when it was a derelict building in 1918 and transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",
