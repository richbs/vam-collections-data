Although the design is undoubtedly late medieval, the ring itself may not be as old.  Rings of medieval type continued to be made and worn throughout the Scandinavian region, particularly in Norway, up to the nineteenth century.  It is unlikely to have been made in Iceland itself, as the majority of silver made there was for church use, or for wear with the traditional costume, and rings such as this were not part of it.  The motif of a heart in a ring of roses has Christian as well as romantic connotations.",
