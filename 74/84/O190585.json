E.1635-1990. \nRecordings by European 'chamber jazz' musicians on Manfred Eicher's ECM label were packaged in sleeves that consistently summed-up the rarified, controlled expressionism of their music. This was most often accomplished with photographs of the natural environment which were approximate visual equivalents of the acoustic, meditative sounds within. New Age sleeve design has been much influenced by ECM's approach which in turn ultimately owes something to the photographs of Pete Turner for Creed, the CTI jazz label.'\nLamacraft, J.

This was most often accomplished with photographs of the natural environment which were approximate visual equivalents of the acoustic, meditative sounds within. New Age sleeve design has been much influenced by ECM's approach which in turn ultimately owes something to the photographs of Pete Turner for Creed, the CTI jazz label.",
