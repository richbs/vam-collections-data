Olympic mascots are often chosen through competitions, and in this case the winner was Portuguese designer Pedro Albuquerque. He invented two characters, one male, one female, with heads formed of an ice-cube and a snow-ball.\nThis rather literal interpretation of the winter theme followed from similar pairs of mascots at the Lillehammer games in 1994 (Haakon and Kristen, Norwegian children), and the Calgary games in 1988 (Hidy and Howdy, twin polar bears).\nNeve and Gliz were a visible presence at the games in various forms. There were lifesize characters at major events, they appeared on wayfinding signs and featured on merchandise, such as toys, clothes and key rings like this one.\nThe earliest Olympic merchandising stratgies focused on stamps, coins, and badges that would be collected and swapped among enthusiasts. Small collectable items like badges, key rings and patches continue to appeal to children into the twenty-first century.",
