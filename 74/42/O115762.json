This jacket of the 1750s is styled after a man\u2019s coat, although it has been modified with a waist seam to fit over stays and a wide petticoat. Another masculine element is the mariner\u2019s cuff, with a scalloped flap running parallel to the length of the sleeve. It was a style first seen on the coats of naval officers, although their uniform was not officially defined until 1748. The mariner\u2019s cuff became a fashionable feature of civilian coats in the 1750s and soon began to appear on women\u2019s riding habits.",
