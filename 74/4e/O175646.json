He was married to Eurydice and when she died descended to the underworld in an unsuccessful attempt to bring her back to earth.\n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.\n\nA small gilt bronze box in the Department of Metalwork (2084-1855) is decorated with two complete and two partial repetitions of this plaquette.",
