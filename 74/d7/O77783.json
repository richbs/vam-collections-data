            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis medal was one in a series of 13 celebrating famous contemporaries living in England (others included Alexander Pope, Robert Walpole and Sir Hans Sloane), executed by the Swiss artist Jacques-Antoine Dassier (1715-1759) during his stay in England between 1740 and 1745. These medals were sold at 7s 6d each (37.5p). They were struck in Geneva from dies made in England, according to the contemporary commentator George Vertue, either because the necessary equipment was not available in England, or because it was cheaper.\n\nPeople\nDr Martin Folkes (1690-1754) was an antiquary and collector, who was also to be portrayed by the sculptor Louis Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac in a memorable marble bust of 1749 (Wilton House, Wiltshire). Folkes was a distinguished scientist and antiquarian, serving as President of the Royal Society between 1741 and 1753, and as President of the Society of Antiquaries from 1750.\n\nBorn in Geneva, Dassier  was the son of a medallist, Jean Dassier (1676-1763), and trained under the celebrated Paris goldsmith Thomas Germain (1673-1748). He then travelled to Italy, where he worked and studied in Rome and Turin, and came to London in 1740. He stayed in the capital until 1745, when he returned to Geneva. He later worked in Russia, dying in Copenhagen during his return either to Switzerland or England.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis medal was struck from a die, although it may have originated from a wax model. Certainly the softness and sensitivity of the forms suggest that the original was in wax. Dassier specialised in struck medals, being appointed assistant engraver at the Royal Mint during his time in London. This example is in bronze; other versions are partly gilt bronze.",
