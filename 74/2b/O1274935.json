The full design, furthest to the right of the poster features a circle in the centre, with a kite and football inside, on a green background. around this, in a pink border is 'Erith playscheme, Mon to Fri' written in blue block letters. Outside this border, but still curving around the outside of the circle at the bottom is the phrase 'Open All School Holidays' in red. Coming out of the top of the circle is a juggling clown. Underneath the circle are two children, one running at a vault, and another leaping over the same vault. Next to these children is the phrase 'register at Christ Church-Hall 10am' in red. In the top left corner of the design is '5-15 yrs' written in black. This same design is in the centre of the poster, reduced to yellow and red against a white background. To the left of the poster the design is reduced again, to just yellow against a white background.",
