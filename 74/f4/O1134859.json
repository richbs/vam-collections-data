The silk is woven to shape with two dragons on the front, one on the back and stylised landscape borders, in gold thread and green, yellow, white and red silks on a royal blue satin ground.\n[waistcoat] The waistcoat is made of off-cuts from the banyan, with the decorative brocading in front and carefully pieced in the welt of the pockets. The back and sleeves are made of the unbrocaded parts of the blue satin. The whole is lined with white cotton. There are 13 buttons and buttonholes down the front and one button and buttonhole at each cuff.\n[banyan] The banyan is very wide, following the shape of the Chinese robe. It opens down the front and the traditional Chinese side opening is stitched closed. There is a narrow tie belt at the back and pockets of what appears to be hemp at each side seam. There is a narrow stand-up collar with button and buttonhole closing. The banyan is lined with oyster-coloured Chinese figured silk.",

They are clearly cut, tailored and sewn in a European style. Banyans and nightgowns were popular informal men's garments worn for leisure at home and among friends. The long-sleeved style of the waistcoat is quite old-fashioned, while the shape of the pockets suggests the latest styles of the 1780s.\n\nBoth banyan and waistcoat have been made out of a silk woven especially for the Chinese Imperial Court. There were specific garments known as 'dragon robes' to be worn at court in China, and these were usually not available for export to the West. They were richly brocaded in gold and coloured silks with dragons on the front and back of the robe and stylised landscape borders.  \n\nThe Italian tailor who made the banyan and waistcoat, adapted to the wide, flowing style of the Chinese robe, while retaining the usual European front opening instead of the traditional Chinese side opening. The characteristic cuffs on a Chinese dragon robe have been inverted on the banyan sleeves. Careful piecing of the brocaded design and use of the undecorated parts of the satin ground have made the conventional sleeved style of a European waistcoat.",
