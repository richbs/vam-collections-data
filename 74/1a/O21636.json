Although a common enough material in the manufacture of kitchen implements, it was at that time a new material for tableware. Its use for items suited to a dinner party is probably linked to the interest in 'natural' and unadorned materials suited to the growing habit of dining in the kitchen.\n\nWelch's first range of products in black iron included a set of three candlesticks, pepper and salt mills and a fruit stand as well as this nutcracker. The curved flange forms, and, in this case, the bar-bell screw press, are reminiscent of the bold simple shapes of nineteenth century engineering. They proved to be adaptable to a wide variety of applications which in time formed a large number of related pieces. Interest from export markets, principally Denmark and the USA, was immediate when this range was launched in 1962.\n[Eric Turner, 'British Design at Home', p.179]",
