The hen stands on a pair of wooden legs,painted yellow, with three claws, front and one claw behind.The body contains 5 unpainted wooden balls. They are placed in the hole at the top of the body. When the body is gently pressed, a red wooden lever is released beneath and an egg is \"laid\". The hen's beak opens and the wings flap upwards.\nThere are handwritten instructions on the box in the form of an 8 line poem:\n\nThough my feathers are painted\nand my insides are wood\nI look almost real\nand behave very good\nJust press my back gently\ntill I go down on my legs\ndo it five times\nand I'll lay you five eggs",

When the hen is gently pushed from above, a spring mechanism releases an egg, while at the same time, the wings are raised. The toymaker, Ron Fuller, is one of the most important names in craft toymaking of the late 20th century. His toy designs are artistic and carefully made. He originally trained in stage design and fine art and started to make toys commercially in about 1960. His main influences have been the work of Sam Smith, John Gould and traditional German toymakers.",
