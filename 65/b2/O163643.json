From the Museum Number end: a large zigzag in crimson red [A] of vertical zigzags and incomplete circles, broken at each point by spirals in white and yellow. This is followed by a line of large birds [peacocks?] in profile alternating with a stylized red plant motif in predominantly yellow and blue with green, red, white, orange and black highlights. Above this is a row of smaller bird forms, all facing left in predominantly blue, yellow, pale green, red and white.  This is followed by a large central bush shaped motif in spirals of red, yellow with touches of red and light green[B]. Moving towards the centre, there is a small chevron roundel [C] containing botehs pointing clockwise, surrounded by small horned quadrupeds in various colours, and then a circle of tri-stemmed leaf motifs in 2 variations, each with a spiral root.  This is then framed by 7 spiral 'rosettes' alternating with birds forms [in profile? Peacocks]. The same coloured silks are all used. In the centre, a large zigzag roundel encircling a star chevron and a band of small bird forms.  This is surrounded by a repeat of [A] arranged in a circle in crimson with white spirals.  Around this, a circle of alternately a peacock with fan tail in mainly crimson red, a peacock in profile either side of a large boteh motif in various colour combinations. Again, small occasional motifs of 7 spiral 'rosettes', plant sprays and 2-legged birds complete this pattern zone.\nFrom this section, to another small chevron roundel like zone [C] but with some differences: theroundel botehs point anti-clockwise; the horned quadrupeds are missing; only one variation of tri-stemmed leaf motifs is present alternating with a pair of fish-like irds resting on perches.  This is then framed by a large spiral star and alternately boteh motif.  The same coloured silks are used.\nThe large central bush motif [B] then follows but here it has 5 small quadrupeds around it.  The last pzttern zone consists of a row of stylized and isolated rosette or tri-blossomed plants, followed by a row of 5 tri-stemmed plants alternating with 3 peacocks in profile.  It finishes with a zigzag band of couched black and white silk containing isolated white or orange spirals alternating with red or black infills.  A small bird motif in a variety of colours is placed in each angle of the zigzag.\nAt both outer ends a narrow chevron band of red, black and white leads into the long twisted fringe.",
