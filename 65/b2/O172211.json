These fragments remained as unregistered objects until July 1958. According to the dealer, in a letter on the original RP, all the pieces came from a village called Trounka near Assiut (or Asyut) in the Nile Valley.\n\nHistorical significance: Asyut is the largest town in Upper Egypt and lies about 234 miles south of Cairo.  It is an old city which was first settled in pharaonic times, then the capital of the Thirteenth Nome of Upper Egypt and named Syut.  Later, the Greeks renamed it Lycopolis which means 'city of the wolf'. This was due to the importance of the Jackal gods Wepwawet (Opener of Ways) and Anubis. Although the city was of considerable strategic value in its position between Upper and Lower Egypt, it somehow managed to stay clear of national importance as a capital. Of ancient interest is the Necropolis of Assiut.  Here, tombs of many regional leaders may be found which document the area's historical significance.",
