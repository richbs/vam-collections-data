Innovative methods of kiln design such as the 'climbing kilns' and new production techniques were introduced around Japan, with new kilns sites such as Tateno and Ryummonji being built. Kilns such as Hirasa, which produced Hirasa ware as exemplified by this piece, were constructed in the mid seventeenth century to produce elegantly simple utilitarian pieces for the home, shop or inn. The white glaze of this piece with underglaze blue decoration of bamboo, prunus and pine in delicate brush work, draws the eye around the vessel and to its rounded form. The design is simple and resembles underglaze blue decoration of early Arita potters from nearby Hizen province. Compared to the unglazed utilitarian ceramics produced during the early Edo period, Hirasa ware offered a delicate and more decorative alternative.",
