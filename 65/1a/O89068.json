Its swirling, rhythmic pattern is typical of many Arts and Crafts fabrics of the late 19th century. \n\nDay was a founder member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society and one of the most commercially aware and successful designers of his generation. From 1870 he produced free-lance designs for all kinds of textiles, wallpapers, ceramics and furniture. He lectured on design and wrote many books and articles on the subject for leading publications. In 1881, Day became the Artistic Director of Turnbull & Stockdale, a Lancashire textile printing firm and gave 'a unity to the firm's goods'.  His style is eclectic and often derivative, but his draughtsmanship is excellent. Day also sold his designs to many other fashionable firms and shops.",
