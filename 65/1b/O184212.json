It is probably a 'Little Buffer' chair, the design of which was patented by the Baby Scooter Car Co in 1922, but any original maker's marks have been obliterated in the re-painting.  The donors used it for their children, Mary, Merilyn, Roger and Bridget, who were born between 1943 and 1956; the chair may have been acquired second-hand because such items were scarce during World War Two and its aftermath, and repainted at that time ('Little Buffer' chairs were made in a dark wood stain and varnished), or during the course of its thirteen or so years of usage..\n\nThe inclusion of a head and shoulders image of the Walt Disney cartoon and comic character Donald Duck is likely to be an attempt at producing something cheering in a time of austerity.  Donald was created by the Disney artist Dick Lundy and first appeared in 1934.",
