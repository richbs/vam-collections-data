They especially catered to British employees of the East India Company, the trading firm that, by the 18th century, had acquired a territorial empire in India. Such paintings represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. The British were especially keen to have visual records of the people and places that surrounded them: portraits of local dignitaries and depictions of the various castes and trades, the strange-looking deities and temples, the festivals and ceremonies, animals and means of transport. \n\nCompany painting developed comparatively late in the Panjab in the north-west, since the British did not take over its administration until 1849. This example dating from about 1870\u20131875 was collected by John Lockwood Kipling while he was director from 1875 to 1893 of the Mayo School of Art at Lahore, in present-day north-east Pakistan. In 1917 it was presented to the V&A by his famous son, Rudyard. It depicts a woman carrying a huqqa (hubble-bubble or smoking pipe), through which is smoked \u2018a curious compound of tobacco, spice, molasses, fruit, &c.\u2019, to quote the 1886 Anglo-Indian dictionary \u2018Hobson-Jobson\u2019.",
