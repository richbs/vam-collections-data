It was donated together with a spelling book which she inscribed with her name on February 15th, 1826.\n\nIn the 1851 census Daniel is described as living at Woad Farm House in Skirbeck, Lincolnshire, where he was probably working as a labourer in the production of woad. The dress therefore reveals the type of clothing rural labourers' wives might wear for their weddings. Such objects tend to survive in much smaller quantities than fashionable wedding dress as they would have been worn for Sunday best long after the event, or handed down. \n\nSarah chose a fashionable design for her dress with its full sleeves, low neckline, gathered shoulders and full skirt. It is, however, made of printed cotton which would have been cheaper than the silks and challis fabrics of costlier wedding dresses. The print is a copy of more expensive designs which again adds interest as such textiles do not tend to survive.",

In  the 1851 census the couple were living with their son William at Woad House Farm, Skirbeck. Daniel is described as an agricultural labourer. In the 1841 census Sarah is listed as living with her family at Skirbeck Bank. They include Daniel Wright, aged 38, also an agricultural labourer. Woad was producded in Skirbeck until 1932.\n\nDr. Philip Sykas has dated the block-printed cotton to c. 1840. The 'ribbon' motifs may have been printed from an ombre (rainbowed) block, and could be an example of the use of the toby tub to print several colours at once, thus reducing the cost of the print. It appears to be a  middle-quality print, from the spring season, and no more than one year out of date as ombre styles were being revived around the start of the 1840s.\n\nHistorical significance: This dress is a rare example of a dress chosen by a working-class bride for her wedding.",
