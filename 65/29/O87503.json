            "public_access_description": "In Venice, the production of brass dishes flourished in the first half of the 16th century.  They were very elaborately decorated but not with traditional European linear ornamentation. During this period, Venice traded and fought extensively with the Turkish and Arab empires that bordered the Mediterranean basin. Venetian merchants brought back to the city Near Eastern goods which had a profound influence on local art and design.\n\nUnlike northern European brasswork, near eastern brasswork was almost always engraved and inlaid with silver wire, a technique known as \u2018damascening\u2019. The decoration was extensive, often covering the entire surface of an object.\n\nThe whole upper surface of this dish is engraved with an unbroken series of arabesques radiating out from the central point of the dish. The rim is engraved with arabesques contained by an outer border of interlaced strapwork. The straps containing the arabesque panels on both the dish and the rim were once damascened with silver, now mostly missing. The arabesque pattern, based on a stylised plant with a winding stem, was studied and copied by contemporary Italian artists. By the middle of the 16th century, the arabesque as a form of ornament was beginning to influence craftworkers all over Europe. It became incorporated into the development of European ornamental design until the decline of the Rococo style in the late 18th century.",
