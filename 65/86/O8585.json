Originally, he would have been accompanied by other kings, all arranged one above the other in the centre of the tree. Flanking these kings and standing in the branches, were figures of Old Testament Prophets. The Virgin Mary carrying the Christ Child or the adult Jesus Christ stood at the top of the tree. Jesse, the father of the Old Testament Prophet and King David, lay reclining at the bottom of the panel. The tree rises up from this figure of Jesse. All of these elements formed what is known as a 'Tree of Jesse' window. A Tree of Jesse depicts the geneaology of Jesus Christ and his mother who are said to be descended from the line of King David. This genealogy is depicted, literally, as a tree.\n\nThe original window of which this king formed part is not known but it is believed that it is French and dates to the 13th century. Stained glass windows depicting the geneaology of Christ were very popular at this time.",
