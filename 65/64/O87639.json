Above, the three Magi - wearing Phrygian caps and holding bowls filled with their offerings - approach the Virgin and Child and Joseph. The star guiding the Magi is shown in the foliate border above. Both scenes are set before elaborate townscapes made up of various structures with tiled roofs. The lower scene is framed by an acanthus border on all sides, while the border of the upper scene is confined to the sides and top.\nThe corners are pierced with holes, probably for attachment to a book cover.",

It was often combined with precious metals and usually took the form of relief panels, for book covers, portable altars and caskets. An almost unbroken tradition of ivory carving extends from the Roman and Byzantine empires until the end of the 14th century. From about 1250, Paris became the centre of production for figures and reliefs intended for private devotion. This was originally taken from a book cover.\nThe architectural background subtly emphasizes the actions of the figures. The architecture is very closely modelled on the buildings seen in the Utrecht Psalter of about 820. Plaques as this seem to have served as models for tenth-century manuscript illumination in Anglo-Saxon England and elsewhere.",
