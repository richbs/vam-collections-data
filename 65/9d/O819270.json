Mayor (Lugt 2799; no.327, as Albani, in the catalogue of Mayor's drawings published by J. Hogarth, 1875); bought from Hogarth 1875 According to Mariette (in the catalogue of the Crozat drawings, 1741, p. 58), Albani made fewer drawings than any other pupil of the Carracci. His style as a draughtsman has not yet been accurately defined. For recent discussions of his drawings see W. Vitzthum and M. Mahoney in The Burlington Magazine 104, 1962, pp. 75-9 and pp. 38689 respectively; and Ann Harris, 'Some chalk drawings by Francesco Albani' in Master Drawings, 7, 1969, pp. 152-55; see also the three Albani drawings illustrated in Kurz, Windsor, pl.1 to 3.",
