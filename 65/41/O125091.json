(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, p. 69, 72\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"A label on the stretcher is inscribed in ink <i>17 May, 1811 L.B.C.</i>  This is presumably based on an inscription on the back of the paper on which the sketch is painted.  The initials are those of Lionel Bicknell Constable, the artist's youngest son.\nNo. 45 [831-1888] in the exhibition held at Messrs. Leggatt's in 1899 was an oil sketch called 'At East Bergholt' and dated 16 May 1811: this sketch was made on the following day.  Lt.-Col. C. A. Brooks identifies the scene as the lane leading to Flatford from the present coach park.  The rising smoke marks the position of Flatford Mill or a near-by building, and the trees on the further ridge are on the Lawford Hall estate.  For another version by Constable of the same scne see No. 329 [787-1888] <i>recto</i>, which is here regarded as a much later reworking by the artist in his studio of this study from nature.\"\n\nNotes on Nos. 100-104 [326-1888, 128-1888, 583-1888, 135-1888, 325-1888]\n\nNos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888] are the earliest dated oil sketches in the Museum\u2019s collections to show the full originality of Constable\u2019s mature style, its vivid naturalism of colouring and boldness of handling.  The earliest dated sketch in which these characteristics are applied to Suffolk scenery is probably the \u2018Country road near East Berghold\u2019 inscribed <i>October 13th, 1809 E[ast] B[erghold].</i>  This was Lot 116 <i>recto</i> (on the <i>verso</i> is a sketch of a country house) in the Gregory sale at Messrs.  Sotheby\u2019s, 20 July 1949.  This sketch was reproduced in monochrome in the sale catalogue and in colour as the frontispiece to the Arts Council\u2019s catalogue <i>An Exhibition of Sketches & Drawings by John Constable from the collection of Dr. H. A. C. Gregory, M.C., </i> 1949.  In \u2018Fresh Light on John Constable\u2019 (<i>Apollo</i>, Vol. LXXXVII, 1968, pp. 227-30) Charles Rhyne draws attention to oil sketches dated 27 September 1810 and 30 September 1810 in the John G. Johnson collection, Philadelphia, and a landscape with houses dated 8 October 1810 in the collection of Mrs. Woodman.  The style may be seen in embryo in some of the oil sketches Constable made of Lake District scenery in 1806: for instance in \u2018Keswick Lake\u2019 formerly in the possession of Sir Michael Sadler (L. ed. S., Pl. 32).  The reasons for grouping Nos. 102 [583-1888], 103 [135-1888], and 104 [325-1888] with these two dated oil sketches have not been explained; they do not amount to a conclusive dating.  Sketching in oils from nature was in fact prominent in Constable\u2019s practice in 1811, for he called on nature, and on 17 December Farington called on Constable to see the painted studies of landscapes from nature which he had made during the autumn (Greig, Vol. VI, p. 279; VII, p. 70).  Another set of studies conveniently, though more loosely, grouped here with the appearance of Constable\u2019s completely matured naturalism is to be found in Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888].",
