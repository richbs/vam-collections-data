Niczewski studied graphic design at the Ealing School of Art and the Chelsea School of Art. Soon afterwards he learnt the art of marquetry, moving from furniture to jewellery. \n\nHis jewellery is made from fine layers of natural and dyed wood veneer, often scorching the surface with hot sand and then finishing off with a glossy lacquer. In the early 1980s there was much experimentation in the use of non-precious materials for jewellery, and there was great interest internationally in Niczewski's application of this furniture-making technique to jewellery. His designs are exquisitely drawn and the pieces beautifully made, with careful consideration of the texture and grain of the wood as well as its colour.",
