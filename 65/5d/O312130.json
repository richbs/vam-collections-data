It commemorates Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence receiving the Freedom of City of London. Prince Albert Victor (1864-1892), was the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra and the grandson of Queen Victoria. Prince Albert was presented with the freedom of the City of London at a ceremony in the Guildhall on 29th June.\n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe roundel was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
