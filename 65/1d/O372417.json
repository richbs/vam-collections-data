The somewhat crude decoration indicates a deterioration of quality in their workshop by that date. The Neapolitan mandolin was first developed during the 1750s. It is tuned like a violin, and played with a pick. The Neapolitan mandolin features in works by composers ranging from Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) to Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901).",
