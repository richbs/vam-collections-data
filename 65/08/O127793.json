His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1944, Messel was released from his war duties as a Camouflage Officer in Norwich to work on the Gabriel Pascal (1894-1954) film Caesar and Cleopatra, reputedly the most expensive film made in Britain at the time.  Despite war time rationing and scarcity of materials, he successfully combined knowledge of period Egyptian and Classical style with the liberty that a 1940s audience would understand. \n\nMessel drew an architectural elevation in ink and wash for the banquet scene set in Cleopatra\u2019s palace.  The Daily Telegraph critic said \u2018The sets are gigantic. Oliver Messel\u2019s d\u00e9cor and costumes are richly imaginative in Technicolor, for once agreeably restrained.  Made though it was in difficult war-time conditions, Caesar and Cleopatra is as spectacular as anything the screen has ever given us.\u2019",
