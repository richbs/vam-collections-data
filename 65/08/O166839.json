Their use is thought to derive from the practice of carrying a sword, and from the 16th century they became a popular fashion accessory. Early walking sticks, like this one, stood above hand-height (whereas most 19th-century examples were significantly shorter). Some walking sticks also had secret compartments, which could conceal items such as weapons, money, games or perfumed pomanders.\n\nThis stick is essentially a decorative cane. Its shaft and knob are inlaid with mother-of-pearl in square, circle and trefoil shapes, surrounded by scrolling foliage completed in wire inlay. Bands of chased metal with moresque strapwork alternate with the areas of inlay, adding to the richness of the design. It unscrews in the middle, enabling it to be stored or transported more easily.",

(London, 1969), p. 28\nFrom the 16th century, if not earlier, men of fashion, when having to move among the masses, carried sticks with a pouncet box knob - that is, a hollow knob, with a gold or silver outer cover and a perforated inner one, containing a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar. It was really a stick with a built-in pomander, designed to ward off evil and diseases. Sometimes a second cavity, concealed below the pouncet box, was used for carrying money.\n\nWoods commonly used for walking sticks: ash (and boxwood for ornately carved examples).",
