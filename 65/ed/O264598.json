Register: \"Mr Vandeput said he knew of no other case where a coronet is found above these arms.\"\n\nPart of a portfolio of Spanish, Portuguese, Moroccan and Italian textiles, purchased for \u00a365.\n\n9.12.29 Mr. Wace wrote:\n\n\u2018This portfolio I found in the Warren collection at Lewes when I went to see the things before the sale. I found that Mr. Arditti was intending to buy it for himself and, therefore, made arrangements with him to give us the first opportunity of acquiring it. He secured it at the sale and has offered it to us\u2026 The textiles in the portfolio come mostly from the collection of San Giorgio in Rome, for some of the sheets bear his mark. There are some splendid specimens of Italian silks velvets and two pieces of early Italian silks which would be extremely valuable for Circulation purposes. For this department the important sheets are two superb pieces of 15th century Italian velvet, two pieces of Spanish silks of the 14th and 15th centuries, which will be an excellent addition to our rather small group of this class, and several other fine pieces. \n\n\u2026Mr Arditti offers another piece of Spanish silk which was exhibited at the Munich exhibition in 1909 and represents a well known type of which we have no examples. He asks for this the very moderate figure of \u00a38\u2019.",
