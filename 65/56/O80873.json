Thomas Metcalfe was one of the few Englishmen who settled in Delhi, and the house with its large library and collection of Napoleon memorabilia was a source of great pride for the family. However, in May 1857 the house was destroyed and partially ruined in a single night by local Gujar villagers who regarded the property as theirs, but felt it had been unjustly appropriated by Metcalfe. Since Independence in 1947 Metcalfe House has been repaired, and today forms part of government offices.",
