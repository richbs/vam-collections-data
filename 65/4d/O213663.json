It is in its original artwork black and white, before the more obnoxious fluourescent colours were added in the printing process. The titles of the songs, collaged from newspaper headlines or xeroxed, give some clue as to the content of the songs.\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who was to become the manager of the Sex Pistols. McLaren later employed Reid as Sex Pistols artistic director as he felt his \"style subverted the spectacle and commodification of every day life by being bolder and more shocking\".",
