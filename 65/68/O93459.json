Pictorial themes continued to be used in decoration but the wider bases afforded scope for an increasing use of abstract decoration. A central motif might be bounded by one or two concentric bands of decoration of either interlaced scroll-like waves or lettering. This was not necessarily embossed with punches in the traditional manner but was often cast in the mould at an earlier stage in manufacturer. \n\nThe subject embossed in the central roundel of this dish is St Matthew between two bishops. St Matthew was one of the apostles and traditionally known as the author of the first gospel. He was a tax gatherer of Capernaum who, as he sat in his custom house, was called by Christ to follow him.\n\nThe production of brass bowls was centred in Nuremberg, from where this dish may have originated, though it was not the only place to produce brass pieces of this sort. Other centres of brass production were Dinant in Flanders and its surrounding area, from Bouvignes to Aachen. Techniques and styles were copied with equal facility everywhere so that today it is difficult to assign a place of manufacture within northern Europe to any dish produced during the 16th and 17th centuries.",
