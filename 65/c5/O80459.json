It illustrates and describes the costumes and paraphernalia allowed to Court and Provincial Officials for ceremonial occasions.\n[Manuscript] Manuscript (parabaik) with covers of red lacquer having a raised pattern of concentric foliage borders round a central pointed cartouche. In the cartouche on the front cover is pasted a white piece of paper on which is an inscription written in black in Burmese. All the pages on this side (except the last two) have drawings of regalia  in gouache, most of which are identified by Burmese inscriptions written in black. A broad yellow border runs the whole  way along the bottom, which also, in places, has an inscription in black. The regalia include hats, ear-plugs, coats, scarves, horse harnesses, musical instruments, buildings, weapons, umbrellas, etc. The penultimate page is blank, and the last page has the same pencil inscriptions as the second from the front. All the pages on the back are blank.\n[Manuscript cover] Textile cover in which the parabaik is wrapped. Made from two pieces of repeating wave patterned acheik-luntaya (horizontal wave patterns-one hundred shuttles interlocking tapestry weave) cloth sewn together and then sewn on to a coarse cotton backing to give broad borders on the two long sides. The pattern of the luntaya fabric is woven in lilac, white, yellow, dark grey, light green, and dark green.",
