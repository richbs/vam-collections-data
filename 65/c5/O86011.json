It closes to the side and has a shallow stnad-up collar. The dress is cut along traditional lines with no seams across the top of the shoulders. The closure line is fairly straight and is fastened with press-studs, some missing, to just below waist level. There are no slits at the side.\nThe sleeves are wide and shaped at the cuff end. The cuffs themselves are made from extra sections of yellow silk. The embroidery design does not match across the cuff sewing line. The soft collarband fastens to the side and is cut off at an angle. It is sewn closed. The garment could not be put on unless this sewing line was cut.\nThe garment is faced throughout with yellow silk and these facings are all sewn down. The section beneath the overlap echoes the shape of the outside closure.\nThe dress isdecorated with embroidered flower sprays in pink and lilac on both back and front, sleeves and collarband.",
