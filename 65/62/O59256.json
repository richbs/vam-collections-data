The maker of both tables, Pierre-Benoit Marcion (1769-1840), worked as a cabinet-maker from 1798 to 1817; he was one of the principal suppliers to the household and entourage of Napoleon I, second only in importance to the firm of Jacob.",

The Empire furnishings were probably purchased during his first period as ambassador to Paris (1815--1824), the earlier furnishings during his second embassy (1828--30). The Empire furnishings may have been intended for a London house. He acquired 4 Carlton House Terrace, where improvements were carried out from 1827 to 1831, and he moved in in 1834. Older furnishings were more probably purchased for his country house, Highcliffe Castle, Hampshire (now Dorset), which was remodelled and enlarged in the most ambitious Gothic style from 1830 to 1834, with some work continuing throughout the 1830s. In 1841 the house in Carlton House Terrace was let, and the family moved their London residence to Whitehall Yard. It was possibly at that time -- or in 1845, the date of Lord Stuart de Rothesay's death --  that the Empire furnishings were moved to Highcliffe. \nLord Stuart de Rothesay's collections were inherited in 1867 by his younger daughter Louisa, Lady Waterford (1818--1891), who maintained Highcliffe Castle. She left the house and its collections to her distant cousin Major-General Edward Stuart Wortley (1857--1934). When his younger daughter Elizabeth ('Bettine') married Montagu Bertie, 8th Earl of Abingdon, in 1928, he bought the castle and its contents from his father-in-law. The Abingdons sold Highcliffe and most of its contents in 1949, but retained the present group of furniture and some other pieces. After her husband's death in 1963, Lady Abingdon lived for much of the time with her close friends Mr and Mrs Tahu Hole, to whom she bequeathed all her personal possessions on her death in 1978. Tahu Hole died in 1985, and a year later his widow Joyce approached the Museum and offered the collection as a bequest. She died in December 1986, and in accordance with her will the Museum chose those items that it wished to add to its collections. Other items from the collection were sold to benefit the Museum, and the proceeds added to the funds bequeathed.",

He was one of the principal suppliers to the imperial establishment, including the marshals. Pauline Borghese used Marcion, with others, to furnish the H\u00f4tel Char\u00f4st; and Ney's neighbour in the rue de Lille, Mar\u00e9chal Mortier, also acquired furniture by this workshop. The 1814 inventory of Pauline Borghese's furniture describes several consoles of this type, but the descriptions are not detailed. Marcion's furniture was of fine quality, but lacking the flair of Jacob's best designs. At this period techniques of mass-production were being developed in these larger furniture workshops; and it appears that the veneering of this piece may have taken place before it was dis-assembled to be sent to the carver, for his work on the capitals and at the head of the legs.",
