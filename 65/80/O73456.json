These tiles represent the start of tin-glazed wall tile production in this country. Such tiles were used in a variety of different ways. The most common use was in fireplaces, but occasionally, they seem to have been employed as skirtings, as was popular in The Netherlands. Also, tiles were increasingly used to line the walls of shops, dairies and cold baths.\n\nPeople\nThe first English tin-glazed wall tiles comparable to contemporary Dutch products seem to have produced by Jan Ariens van Hamme. He arrived from Delft  with his family and 16 workmen in 1676 and established a pottery at Vauxhall in London. A warrant allowed him to produce tiles 'after the way practised in Holland'. These tiles are possibly products of the van Hamme workshop and certainly have a strong Dutch look to them. Van Hamme made an important contribution to tile-making in England,  but it was short-lived as he  died in 1680.\n\nPropaganda\nThe tile is one of a set depicting the 'Popish Plot', a fictitious Catholic conspiracy to kill Charles II that the Reverend Titus Oates claimed to have uncovered in 1678.  The second of nine scenes, this tile is inscribed: 'The Conspirators Signeing ye Resolve for killing the King'.",
