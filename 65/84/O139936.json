It is a red silk cocktail dress, and is very typical of Dior at this time as it features and exceptionally full skirt and a bow effect for which Dior is noted.  It is also of a deep 'Dior' red, which he often used.  It is an excellent example f couture construction and pattern cutting.\nThe deep V-neck typifies Dior's Y-line motif, as does the inverted Y shape of the pleats of the skirt.\nIt was purchased at auction in Paris specifically for <i>The Golden Age of Couture</i> exhibition, and its publication",
