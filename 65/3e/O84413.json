From 1874 Crane created wallpapers for Jeffrey & Co, who produced this example. The wallpaper is important because Crane was a leading figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement.  This Movement was an informal association of architects, designers and craftsmen. They shared a dislike of machine-made goods and mainstream commercial manufacturers. \n\nCrane is best known for his paintings and illustrations for children's books.  He also designed textiles, ceramics and stained glass in addition to wallpapers.  He believed that functional objects should be well designed and visually pleasing and published important books on design.  In 1888 Crane helped to establish the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. He was a dedicated teacher and also lectured internationally.",
