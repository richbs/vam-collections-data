It was produced throughout his time with Radley, with subtle variations such as a varying number of buttons on the cuffs and down the front, fuller or less full sleeves, buttons down to the waist, or beyond the waist; various collar shapes, from pointed to rounded to dog-ear; and separate self-fabric sashes, or long sash ends incorporated into the dress itself. This particular example is a true coat-dress, in that it is entirely open down the front when unbuttoned.\n\nIt was produced in a huge range of colours, from darkest black, through jewel tones of red and green, strident yellows, dark purple and plums, subtler duck-egg blues and creams (as here) and sorbet tones of apricot and peach, to pure white.\n\nThese dresses cost between \u00a320 and \u00a325 in the early 1970s, and were one of the most affordable and consistently best-selling, popular designs in the Ossie Clark for Radley range.",
