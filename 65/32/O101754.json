He specialised in sports and genre subjects in mainland Europe. In 1913 Pitcairn-Knowles opened the health resort called \u2018Riposo\u2019 (Italian for \u2018rest\u2019 or \u2018repose\u2019) in Hastings, Sussex, where he adopted among others the \u2018Schroth Cure\u2019. This was based on the idea that most illnesses result from the accumulation of toxins in the body. Patients were packed in wet sheets and prescribed four meals a week, with stale bread in addition.",
