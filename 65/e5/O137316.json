This albumen print, a type of photograph, was made in 1861 from a glass negative in the photographic studio in the factory building of Skidmore & Co., at  Alma Street, Coventry.  This photograph is thus a record of the work done and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm.  Francis Skidmore (1817-1896) was a leading Victorian metalworker in the Gothic Revival style, which was an architectural movement the nineteenth-century practitioners of which sought to revive medieval forms.  Skidmore also produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork of which this screen is an example.",
