It was probably one of a set.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe overall form of the chair relates to designs from Thomas Chippendale's The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director (1754).  The designs in this influential book were imitated and adapted by many chair-makers. In particular, the term 'Chippendale' is often used to describe chairs such as this one, with upswept shoulders, whether or not they were made in the  firm's workshop.  The decorative details, on the other hand, are not like Chippendale's designs. Many of the details, such as the small hanging bells, were thought of  as Chinese, but were not actually used in China at this date.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis chair was later owned by the antiques collector Claude D. Rotch, and was bequeathed by him as part of his large collection in 1962.",
