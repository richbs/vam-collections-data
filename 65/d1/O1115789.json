            "public_access_description": "Costume for a Negro Footman in the Ballets Russes production of The Sleeping Princess designed by Leon Bakst. The choreography for this ballet was based on the version originally created by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet in circa 1890. This choreography was adapted for Diaghilev's 1921 production by the dancer and choreographer Bronislava Nijinska (1891-1972).\n\nThe costume consists of a knee length black velvet skirt decorated with a complex pattern in silver braid. The base of the skirt has been stiffened with a 'hoop' to make it stand out from the loose black satin pantaloons which hang beneath.\n\nThis skirt formed the base of a costume which was dominated by a long-skirted 18th century style coat in peach-coloured velvet trimmed with silver braid. The deep black velvet cuffs of the coat are bordered with silver and gold braid. A rose-coloured silk waistcoat bordered with silver braid is attached to, and forms part of, the centre front of the coat.\n\nThe term 'negro' has been used here to reflect the name originally given to this character in 1912.  This term was used historically to describe people of black (sub-Saharan) African heritage but, since the 1960s, has fallen from usage and, increasingly, is considered offensive. The term is therefore repeated here in its original historical context.",
