Batsford in association with the Victoria & Albert Museum, 1984, p. 145, cat. no. 42\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"<b>42 \nLandscape with church and windmill</b>  \n \nOil on millboard; 8\u00bc x 12\u00bc (21 x 31) \nSigned on lower right <i>J. Varley</i> \n1836-1900\nCONDITION: Good \nPROV: T. Webster; 1890, James Orrock, \nRI; Henry S. Ashbee; collection \nbequeathed to the Museum in 1900\n \nVarley painted very few oils and there is no means of dating them. It may be presumed that he felt no need to venture into this field before the OWCS began to exhibit oil paintings in 1813 and it is unlikely that this painting is earlier than the 1820s, when he began to varnish his watercolours. The composition consists of several disparate elements from his watercolours, in particular the windmill from his low-horizoned views of London, and the church, with its reminiscence of St Nicholas, Chiswick. \n     One of the few undoubted oil paintings by Varley which may be adduced for comparison is the view of <i>Eton Chapel from the river</i> in the Eton College Collection, which has the same pink sky contrasting with a predominantly green tonality.\"",
