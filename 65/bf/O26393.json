Sailing to the coast of Treasure Island, and turning up Chance Cards.\n   2.  Sailing to other Ports, and exchanging Crew Cards for Treasure\n   3.  By Attacking other ships at sea.\n\nThe Play:\nThe Dealer moves first.\nThe first player sails his boat in any of the three directions, from his Harbour, and he is entitled to move his boat in a straight line, any number of squares, up to but not exceeding his Sailing Strength\nAT THE END OF HIS TURN THE PLAYER MUST POINT HIS BOAT I N THE DIRECTION WHICH HE INTENDS TO PROCEED ON HIS NEXT TURN.\nThis constitutes the first player's turn, and the second player moves his ship and so on.\nIf a player does not wish to move any number of squares, but just desires to change his direction, this constitutes a turn.\nShip can only sail in a forward direction.\nFor Further particulars, see the LAWS OF THE GAME.\n\nTHE IDEA OF THE GAME\nThe idea of the game is to collect Treasure to a total value of 20 points made up by adding the value of the last cargo brought to the player's home port to that of any treasure already there whether in the Safety Zone or in the space marked Docks.\nA player collects Treasure by Sailing his ship from his home port to VISIT TREASURE ISLAND where the draw of a Chance Card may give him treasure or crew, or to another port for trading, or to attack another ship.\nOn ATTACKING AN OPPONENT'S SHIP treasure or crew may be taken by the winner (the one with the greater Fighting Value).  Fighting value is therefore important for defence as well as attack.  Kindly read the instructions and Laws very carefully before playing.\n\nPREPARATION FOR PLAY\nOpen out the playing board and place the tray representing the Treasure Island in the centre of the board.  Place all Treausre in the tray.\nShuffle and place the Chance Cards in the slotted grooves on Treasure Island, as indicated.\nPlayers decide at which port they will play (which for convenience will be the one nearest to where they are sitting) and take the boat of corresponding colour, placing it in the square marked Harbour at their home port.  The ports of Amsterdam and Venice are left unoccupied, to facilitate trading, as well be seen later.\nShuffle the Crew Cards and place two cards face up on the docks of each unoccupied port.  In this manner, cards will always be place at Venice and Amsterdam and at any other ports not occupied by a player.\nShuffle the Crew Cards again and deal six cards to each player, placing the remainder of the pack face downwards on Pirate Island.\nBy taking Treasure from Treasure Island, make up the point value to 8 at each of the ports to which two crew cards were previously dealt..\n\nRules placement: booklet, copyright John Waddington Ltd. 38613",
