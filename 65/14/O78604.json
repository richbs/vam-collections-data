            "public_access_description": "This is one of a set of six bowls that were intended for the dessert course of a meal at a banquet. Used primarily on occasions of great display, dessert dishes were usually elaborately decorated and often gilded.\nThe dessert course was a separate and extremely expensive component of a meal, usually comprising fruit and a variety of sugar-based and spiced sweetmeats, such as honey wafers and refined sugar from Cyprus or Madeira. The distinct practice of the banquet took place after or during the intervals of a masque or musical entertainment. Temporary banqueting houses, as luxurious as the foods on offer, were often set up, or rooms were set aside for that purpose.\nThe centre of each bowl of this set is engraved with scenes from the Old Testament story of Abram and Isaac, while the well is engraved with marine creatures, and the rim with birds and beasts in roundels and amid scrolling foliage. These three zones of engraving are entirely unconnected, and are characteristic of ornamental designs by such Northern European masters as Virgil Solis (1514-62) and Adriaen Collaert (about 1560-1618). The central scene on this bowl depicts The Sacrifice of Isaac, based on a work of 1559 by the Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck which circulated as an engraving by Dirck Volkertz Coornhert (1519/22-90).",

Two have been mostly erased and hidden by scrolling foliage ornament, the third is covered by a later coat of arms. Close examination of these traces reveals the original arms to be those of William Cecil, first Lord Burghley (1520-98), Lord Treasurer to Elizabeth I (Schroder: 2004, pp. 3-4). The later arms are those of the Montagu family, and may refer to William Montagu of Oakley, Bedfordshire, fifth son of Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Montagu (d. 1556). This is one of six similar engraved plates, all with Montagu arms, which appear to have remained in the possession of the family from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries, when they were sent to auction at Christie's, London, by Captain Frederick Montagu who had inherited the plates from his uncle, Andrew Montagu of Ingmanthorpe Hall, Yorkshire, and Papplewich Hall, Nottinghamshire. The Museum purchased all six plates at the sale on July 3rd, 1946.\nThe central scene engraved on this dish that shows Abram, sword raised, about to sacrifice Isaac to the Lord (Genesis 22, 9-10) is  based on a work of 1559 by the Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck which circulated as an engraving by Dirck Volkertz Coornhert (1519/22-90) (see Schroder: 2004, p. 8).",
