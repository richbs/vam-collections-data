An oval cartouche in the centre of each of the upper doors is decorated with two crossed 'L's in engraved brass and pewter, inlaid into clear horn with turquoise pigment behind. The cartouches may be a latter addition - it appears that the ovals may originally have been wholly of ebony.\n\nThe cornice is a later replacement, probably English.",

An impressive appearance could be heightened by means of the materials used, as in this example, which is finely decorated with boulle marquetry - veneers (wafer-thin sheets that are glued and then cut out to a design) in ebony, turtleshell, brass, pewter and horn. The Paris workshop of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle (1642-1732) became synonymous with the most important pieces of  furniture of this kind, but this example, although of high quality, is probably the work of another cabinet-maker.",

Jones made his fortune as a military tailor, kitting out the armies of the  British Empire. He was also  an avid collector of French furniture and porcelain, particularly of  items made between about 1660 and 1800. \n\nJones had a large collection of boulle furniture, of which this was the largest piece. He kept the armoire in the dining room of his house at 95 Piccadilly, where it was flanked on both sides by two important boulle pedestals (1025 and 1025A-1882). When the armoire entered the Museum, it was said to have come to Jones from a collection on Carlton Terrace. It is likely that Jones bought it privately sometime before 1882. \n\nThe armoire's distinctive cipher, bearing crossed 'L's, suggests at first glance that it may have had a royal owner. The armoire does not, however, appear in royal inventories of the period. Given the fact that the cartouches appear to have been added at some later date, it is possible that the 'L's represent a 19th-century attempt to associate the armoire wth Louis XIV.",

            "production_note": "The maker is unknown, but it is clearly the product of a highly-skilled workshop working in the manner of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle.\n\nAttribution note: This <i> armoire </i>is exceptional for its monumental scale and fine decoration and especially for the quality of the design and workmanship of the panels of engraved marquetry.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Such large cupboards had long been in use in France before the form was adapted in the late 17th-century as a piece of furniture designed primarily for its impressive appearance in state rooms. Marquetry composed of a combination of turtleshell, horn, brass and other metals is known as 'boulle' marquetry, after Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle (1642-1732), cabinet-maker to Louis XIV. Boulle was only one of several cabinet-makers to develop such marquetry in Paris; his status as royal cabinet-maker is likely to have ensured that it was his name that became synonymous with the technique. Boulle marquetry was termed <i>'premi\u00e8re partie'</i> when the brass decoration was inlaid into a dark ground (usually of turtleshell or ebony) and <i>'contre partie'</i> when the ground was of metal and the decorative inlay of turtleshell or other contrasting material (A. Prad\u00e8re, pp.67-109, see References).\n\nA drawing attributed to Boulle's workshop, and possibly by his hand, shows two alternative designs for a cupboard on this scale. Though a number of <i>armoires</i> of this date are attributed to Boulle (some including panels of marquetry in wood for which he was also noted), the decoration of the panels on the V&A piece shows no similarities to boulle marquetry firmly associated with his workshop.\n\nBoulle marquetry remained high in esteem throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and was one of the first enthusiasms of the early 19th-century collectors of antique French furniture.",
