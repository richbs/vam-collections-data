The glass worker has decorated the body with four wheel-cut drop motifs and cut a double moulding into the shoulder. The neck has faceted sides and a collar around the rim. Glass workers made bottles of this type in the Middle East in the 9th to 11th centuries, and they may have been made in both Egypt and Iran. The discovery of a similar piece in an 11th-century shipwreck found near the Turkish coast has provided new evidence. It suggests that such pieces were more likely to have been made somewhere in the East Mediterranean coastlands. Experts therefore think that this jug was probably made in Egypt in the Fatimid period (969-1171).",
