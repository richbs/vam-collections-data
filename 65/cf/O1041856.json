The pasted sheet can be seen by transmitted light to bear two lines of ink inscription, the upper one of which reads <i>The Revd Archdeacon Fisher</i>. The second is cut and cannot be read. \n\nNOTE ON NOS. 313-319 [206-1888, 315-1888, 210-1888, 253-1888, 254-1888, 205-1888, 227-1888]\n\nConstable used two sketch-books on his visits of 1829 to Salisbury. The smaller one, composed of thin paper, measures about 3 5/8 x 5 ins. (93 x 128 mm.) Nos. 313 [206-1888], 316 [253-1888] and 318 [205-1888] come from this book; the first two drawings were made at Salisbury, and it is possible that the third was made at about the same time. The larger sketch-book measures 9 \u00bc x 13 1/4 ins. (234 x 337 mm.) Nos. 314, 315, 317 and 319 [315-1888, 210-1888, 254-1888, 227-1888] come from this book. There are in the British Museum three drawings from the latter sketch-book: \n\nL.B. 16 Landscape Study. (229 x 326 mm.) \nL.B. 29 Harnham Bridge. (229 x 330 mm.) Dated 23 November 1829. (See also No. 240 [218-1888] above) \n\nL.B. 33 View of Salisbury from the river. (229 x 333 mm.) Dated 19 November 1829. \nThese three drawings were given by Miss Isabel Constable in February 1888. Other leaves from the same book are the drawing of Old Sarum mentioned in the note to No. 322 [163-1888]; the late Mr. L. G. Duke's 'Distant View of Salisbury' (reproduced in L. ed. S., Pl. 121); and Lot 102 in the Gregory sale at Messrs. Sotheby's, 20 July 1949, 'A View of Salisbury Cathedral across meadows', black chalk and pencil, 8 1/2 X 13 ins., dated 23 November 1829.\"\nTimothy Wilcox, <u>Constable and Salisbury.
