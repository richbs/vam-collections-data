            "public_access_description": "The British biscuit tin came about when the Licensed Grocer's Act of 1861 allowed groceries to be individually packaged and sold. Coinciding with the removal of the duty on paper for printed labels. It was only a short step to the idea of printing directly on to tinplate. The new process of offset lithography, patented in 1877 allowed multicoloured designs to be printed on to exotically shaped tins.\n\nThe most exotic designs were produced in the early years of the 20th century, just prior to the First World War. In the 1920s and 1930s, costs had risen substantially and the design of biscuit tins tended to be more conservative, with the exception of the tins targeted at the Christmas market and intended to appeal primarily to children. The designs, generally speaking are a barometer of popular interests.\n\nThe advent of the Second World War stopped all production of decorative tin ware and after it ended in 1945, the custom never really revived.",

Franklin, The Mansfield firm of Barringer, Wallis & Manners became one of the successful metal box manufacturers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Competition amongst box manufacturers for the lucrative market  in packaging biscuits was intense and prompted an ever increasing variety of designs.  Often these designs sought to reflect middle class aspirations.  Here, the tin has been printed to imitate shagreen, a rare and costly material to work which is usually associated with the silversmithing trade.  Manufactured for W & R Jacob and Co.",
