The woman is dressed in a sari of blue/green tones and the girl wears a white dress with green spots. Just nearby on the sand are palm leaves, green coconuts and shells. This is a very affectionate mother and child scene, with the mother gently holding the girl in her arms and both of them looking out to sea. This scene is framed off from the rest of the painting, although the palm leaves in the bottom left hand side extend into the larger part of the painting.\n\nBeyond the framework of this central scene, the painting opens out into a more general beach view, with the sea in the foreground and the trunk of a palm tree in the background. A male figure stands on the right hand side, we only see half of him and his face is not visible. In the bottom left hand corner a boyish figure plays with something he has found in the sand and a bird with a fish hovers above him. This larger scenes is itself framed off and the beach scene extends beyond this frame into the next but in a less specific manner.\n\nThe style of the painting is typical of Nilima Sheikh's work. She has been influenced by Mughal and Pahari painting and this is seen particularly in the figures and the structure of the painting, the way in which the scenes/figures are framed and extending images beyond the frame. Characteristic of her work is the use of  delicate but precise lines with the central characters and gentle colour washes and  faint outlines for the secondary figures. Also notable is the delicacy with which she handles flora and fauna.",
