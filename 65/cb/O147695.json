Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. And gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. \nAlthough at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce.\n\nIt was formerly part of the Bandinel Collection.",
