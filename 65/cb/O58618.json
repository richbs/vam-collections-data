The project never became a reality.  \nOne design for a Flame (S.286-2000) and the sketch for the setting were reproduced in John Percival's article \"When Cyril Beaumont formed a ballet company\", Dance and Dancers, December 1961, p25.  It appears that Beaumont sketched an idea for the set and the costumes were designed by Adrian Allinson.  \nThe design came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
