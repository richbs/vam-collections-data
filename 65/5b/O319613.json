            "physical_description": "Boy's gala costume copied from the national costume adopted by the Greek court after the establishment of the indepenndent Kindom of Greece, which was based on the Albanian/Epirote costume of some of the leading fighters of the War of Independence. It is in no way typical of every day children's clothes in 19th cnetury Greece.\n[Jacket] Jacket of red velvet with hanging sleeves, attached at the back of the shoulders and seamed for about 1.5 inches just above the wrists. The jacket is slightly shorter than waist length, collarless, with unfastened edge to edge front opening, rounded at the bottom. The sleeves end in point over the hands. The whole is elaborately embroidered with applied gold cord in floral and strapwork design, trimmed and finished with applied gold braids. The body of the jacket is lined with fawn silk, the sleeves with a watered fawn silk, and the tops of the sleeves with a patterns silk of purple and yellow woven with metal thread, probably Russian. The same patterned silk is used to make a small pocket inside the left front.\n[Waistcoat] Waistcoat of red  velvet, decorated at the front and on the seams with applied gold cord and braids to match the jacket. The front edges are fastened with hooks and eyes and ornamented with three gold filigree buttons.\n[Fustanella] Fustanella or kilt of white cotton. This garment is cut in the traditional style of the Albanian fustanella. It is composed of twenty-nine gores tapering from hem to waist. Each gore is itself made of two tapering pieces, which are joined at the centre of the gore by a run-and-fell seam finished with fine blanket stitching in yellow silk. The gores are joined to each other by a single seam which, left unpressed, creates a pleated effect. The kilt is attached to a straight waistband through which a drawstring is threaded. The open ends of the waistband and the hem of the garment are finished with an edging of fine needle-made loops. A braid made of twisted and knotted gilt cords is applied to all the vertical seam between the gores, and to the hem above the needle-made edging, with a second row whipped into the edging it self. This gold braid is an elaboration which is not traditional.\n[Belt] Belt with two purses. A narrow belt of brown leather with an applied strip of red leather has a broader rectangle at the  front composed of three layers of leather joined together at the ends only. Each of these strips is faced with velvet, the top and bottom red and the centre strip green. The velvet surfaces, particularly the top strip, are embroidered with applied gilt cords to match the jacket. In the adult costume this wide triple belt was used to hold pistols and knives.\n[Purse] Two small threaded purses.",
