Islamic lustre ware was imported in to Italy and can still be seen in the form of basins, or bacini, embedded in the walls of some churches.\n\nBy the thirteenth century, the lustring technique had spread through the Islamic world to southern Spain from where it gradually spread northward in to Christian territory. Active trade between the ports of Mansises and Pisa introduced lustreware to Italy and by the second half of the fifteenth century, the technique had been mastered by the potters at Deruta and shortly after at Gubbio.
