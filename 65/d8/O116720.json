Both sides are carved with auspicious motifs which means the screen would have been viewed from either side. One side depicts the Eight Daoist Immortals about to cross the sea. There was no boat to take them to the other shore so they had to exercise their supernatural power. On the other side of the plaque is Shoulao, the God of Longevity.",
