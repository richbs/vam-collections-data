            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 187\nThe following is the full text of the entry.\n\n\"MARTIN, John (1789-1854) \nBorn Haydon Bridge, Northumberland, 19 July 1789; according to the artist, 'by birth, my station could scarcely have been humbler' (quoted in Pendered p21). Apprenticed to Leonard Wilson, a coach painter in Newcastle; left after a year and took painting lessons from the Italian immigrant Boniface Musso (father of the miniature painter Charles Muss). Moved to London 1806. Exhibited 84 works at the RA between 1811 and 1852, 37 at the BI 1813-51, and 62 (including watercolours and prints) at the SBA 1824-48. Subjects mainly literary and biblical, but also landscapes. Won prizes at the BI 1817 and 1821. An opponent of the art establishment, especially the RA, he nevertheless became Historical Painter to Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold (receiving the Knighthood of the Order of Leopold) , and Member of the Academies of Brussels, Antwerp, and Rome. Among his other activities, his elaborate plans for London's sewage disposal were diverting in both senses of the word. Most famous for his vast scenes of (usually) biblical destruction, such as 'Belshazzar's Feast', culminating in the 'Last Judgment' triptych (now Tate Gallery), and for his mezzotint illustrations to Paradise Lost (1827) and the Bible (1833). Many of his works were engraved, often by himself. Both famous and notorious in his own day, he was and remains the epitome of the powerfully Sublime type of Romantic artist and personality, dealing with dramas of Nature in conflict with Man. Died Douglas, Isle of Man, 17 February 1854; his studio was sold by Christie's in May and 4-5 July 1854 (see Athenaeum report 27 May 1854, p657). His brothers Jonathan and William were equally if not more notorious, as pyromaniac and inventor respectively.
