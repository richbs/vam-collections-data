Gibus was in charge of the technical side while Margaine, who had been trained in fine arts, was responsible for much of the design. The new company made table services and ornamental wares, some of which were decorated at other factories, including that of Haviland.  They exhibited in international exhibitions in Paris in 1855, where they were much praised for the whiteness of the porcelain and the beauty of its designs, and as was this vase, in 1878. The company became Gibus & Redon in the early 1870s and, when Gibus retired, in 1881, Redon &Cie. However, they were already exhibiting as 'le Maison Redon' in 1878.  In 1914 the factory passed to the conglomerate Porcelaine Limousine. This vase is a particularly exquisite example of  porcelain in the very fashionable 'Japanese taste' by a company that was often thought to rival S\u00e8vres.",
