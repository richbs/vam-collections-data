Evidence of this early style, about 1775-1800, can be seen in the mosaic on this box. The subject, in this case an ancient amphora or storage vase, is seen on a straight ground and the overall image lacks depth. The background is formed of straight rows of tesserae, mostly cut crudely. As the technique developed, the edges of the individual glass pieces become smoother and more curved.\n\nThis particular mosaic has been attributed to Giacomo Raffaelli (1753-1836), a leading figure in the art of mosaics and often credited with having invented the technique of micromosaics. Characteristic of his style is the use of antique subject matters and borders formed of dotted tesserae. Other works by Raffaelli can be seen in the Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Collection.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
