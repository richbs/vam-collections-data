The goal of these advertisements was to promote driving as a leisure pursuit which allowed drivers to sightsee around the British Isles while enjoying a drive - and by extension, filling their gas tanks with Shell brand petrol. Graham Sutherland's abstracted interpretation of Brimham Rock in Yorkshire is similar in style to surrealist landscapes of the period.",
