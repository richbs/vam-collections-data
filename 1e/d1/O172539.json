Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Messina, but the use of drop-shaped pendants was common throughout Italy in the 19th century.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 (the pair) as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
