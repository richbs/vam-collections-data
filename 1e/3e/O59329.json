            "public_access_description": "Designing everyday working clothes is perhaps more difficult than recreating period clothes. There is a danger of overall drabness or similarity of style.  This is especially true in an opera like  Peter Grimes, set in a Suffolk fishing village, where most men would wear traditional gurnsey sweaters and rubber boots and tradesmen and women would wear drab colours.  The designer's problem is to make one fisherman stand out in a community of fishermen.  \nNot all costumes have to be made from scratch.  In this case, the designer has indicated that a set of oilskins already exists in the wardrobe at Sadler's Wells, which can be sprayed to give the right effect.  At the end of the day, oilskins are oilskins, and reusing costumes from stock helps keep down the costs and save money for more important costumes. \nThe attached fabric samples are all of very heavy materials, which help give bulk and weight to the character.",

The design was executed for a production of  Benjamin Britten's opera \"Peter Grimes\", performed by Scottish Opera at the Edinburgh King's Theatre, August 19th 1968.  The libretto by Montagu Slater is based on George Crabbe's poem \"The Borough\".  The production was conducted by Alexander Gibson; directed by Colin Graham; and lit by Charles Bristow.  The cast included Richard Cassilly as Peter and Phyllis Curtin as Ellen Orford.\n\nThe production was later revived by Scottish Opera in the springs of 1973 and 1980, and by English National Opera North in the spring of 1979.",
