Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>129 Perhaps Sir Matthew Hale</b>\n(b.1609 d.1676) \n<b>1670-5</b> \nP118-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 62 X 50mm</b> \n\nFeatures very elaborately hatched and worked over in brown and sanguine with grey, blue and white heightening, on a pale carnation ground; hair over the carnation in shades of brown and grey; cap in black with some pale grey modelling; collar and mantle in grey, modelled in darker grey and white; robe in red wash, modelled in darker colour and white; chain in gold for the filigree over brown for the leather, variegated with white, brown, black and grey between the links; background a brown wash, with some sparse hatching of darker colour especially to the right, and lightened a little to the left; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Marginal abrasions and losses; a little surface rubbing; otherwise very good. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Centre right, in gold; <i>TF</i>. Inscribed on back of support in nineteenth-century hand in graphite: <i>Sir/ Matthew Hale</i>. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> No locket; only the convex glass loose in a glazed morocco case, with a printed entry from a sale or exhibition catalogue: <i>Sir Robert Hyde, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, temp. Charles H., by S.[ sic] Flatman. Signed.</i> \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> George Salting, (1) acquired by him from an unrecorded source and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Edinburgh 1965, no. 117. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 155; Long 1930, p. 28; Davies 1979, vol. I, p. 68; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981,p.21; Murdoch 1981 ,p.152. \n\nLong (2) suggested that the graphite inscription identifying the sitter as Matthew Hale was in Salting's hand, but Salting himself evidently listed the miniature as of Sir Robert Hyde (1595-1665) in the lost manuscript catalogue of the collection. This rival identification as Hyde seems to derive only from the printed catalogue extract preserved in the case, but Long evidently accepted it, possibly on the grounds of evidence recorded by Salting, and it has remained unquestioned. \n\nBoth possible sitters were Chief Justices of the King's Bench, Hyde from 1663 to 1665, Hale from 1671 to February 1675/6. \n\nAgainst Hyde is the date. In terms of handling, the miniature has more in common with the powerful and expressive graphic style of the 167 Os than with the relatively free and blended work of the early 1660s. Also Hyde, though a lawyer, had few other connections with Flatman's circle and shared none of his intellectual interests in art, literature, theology and natural philosophy. Hyde, a man of Sixty-eight in 1663 and dead on 1 May 1665, seems Simply too early to be the subject of this portrait. \n\nAgainst Hale would be the lack of obvious facial resemblance to the portrait by J M Wright in the Guildhall, on the evidence of which Hale certainly looked like a much older man by the time he was Chief Justice in 1671, at the age of sixty-two. But otherwise, Hale would be a plausible candidate. He was an extremely distinguished legal scholar, 'allowed on all hands to be the most profound lawyer of his time', as Roger North noted. 3 North also noticed shrewdly that, although of rigorous puritan simplicity in dress and discourse, Hale was not without personal vanity. He was a friend of Wilkins and Barrow of the Royal Society ecclesiastics and was himself a natural philosopher and 'scientist', publishing papers on gravitation and atmospherics as well as speculative works of traditional scholastic philosophy on, for example, the origins of mankind. Factors such as these tend to place him in the right social group \nfor Flatman, and would help to explain why Hale might have asked him to paint his portrait. But unlike the early likenesses of his friends, this is by no means the portrait of a social familiar; the sitter appears in formal dress, and in pride of office. It is interesting that, nevertheless, Flatman attempts such an evidently personal and analytical image. The treatment of the face has far more in common with the <i>Self Portrait</i> (Cat. No. 130), which provides the extreme point of Flatrnan's graphic frankness, than with, for example, the <i>Richard Price</i> (Cat. No. 128). It suggests a degree of intellectual sympathy between artist and sitter and is another factor supporting the identification of the sitter here as Hale. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4633. \n2 MS note on the Museum file. \n3 In his Life of Lord Keeper Guilford (1742 edn). pp. 61-4.\u201d",
