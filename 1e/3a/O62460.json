Sir James Fleming for whom this casket was made, was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the School of Art and was responsible for selecting and commissioning Mackintosh to design the new building.\n\nPeople\nThe casket has Glasgow hallmarks for 1909 and a maker's mark WAD. The mark presumably refers to William Armstrong Davidson who set up a metalwork and design studio with his brother Peter Wylie Davidson in Glasgow in the 1890s. The Studio magazine described Davidson as a 'rare craftsman' whose 'workmanship is superlative'. In 1919, he moved to Dundee to become Head of the Modelling and Metalwork Department, a post he held for 28 years. He died in 1951.\n\nTime\nAlthough the Glasgow School of Art is now widely seen as one of the important foundation stones of the Modern Movement, it received no publicity when it was finished in 1909.  By then, the distinctive Scottish style which Mackintosh had done so much to develop was becoming distinctly unfashionable and Mackintosh's career thereafter went into a steady decline.",
