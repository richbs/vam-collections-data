            "public_access_description": "A writing box like this would have been fitted with various implements utilised for writing from an ink stick, water dropper, ink stone and brushes. To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took time and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. Lacquer is also a very durable material able to withstand humidity, water and certain chemicals as well as a rich medium for expression. It was an ideal material to be used for items like this writing box. \nThe decoration on this box depicts two samurai, carrying two swords, and their retainers on their way to view some entertainers. The figures are realistically depicted and the lacquer coloured to create various shades, such as green through the use of aokin (gold powder mixed with silver to create a subtle green hue).The box is in togidashi-e (polished out picture), a technique where by the design is covered in successive layers of lacquer. Once each layer has dried these layers are polished down to reveal the design which is now flush to the box. Around the second half of the 16th century screens had begun to depict scenes of figures enjoying excursions and festivals. These paintings inspired later lacquer artists who would create narrative designs such as this writing box of entertainers.\nThe box is signed Kajikawa followed by the usual tsubo (large jar) sealmark. The Kajikawa family is one of the most famous for the production of exquisite lacquer pieces. Founded by Hikobei in the early 17th century the family made numerous pieces for the shogunate. Hikobei's son and pupil Kyujiro continued the business and was considered one of the finest producers of inro. Over two thirds of Kajikawa pieces are signed with the family name.",
