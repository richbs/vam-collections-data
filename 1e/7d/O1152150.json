She joined Lena Ashwell's concert party entertaining the troops in France and Belgium during the 1914-1918 war, where she first performed with the cellist Gwen Farrar. They appeared in leading London and variety theatres between about 1921 to 1924, as well as in the 1921 cabaret show Pot Luck! with Jack Hulbert and Beatrice Lillie; and the 1923 Andr\u00e9 Charlot revues Rats starring Alfred Lester and Gertrude Lawrence, and Yes! at the Vaudeville Theatre, Strand, London. In May 1924 they opened in another Charlot revue, The Punch Bowl, at the Duke of York's Theatre, London, with Alfred Lester, Sonnie Hale and Hermione Baddeley. They worked independently in the late 1920s but came together in 1930 to appear in The House That Jack Built. Their farewell appearance was at the London Palladium in February 1932, although they worked together briefly to entertain the troops during the 1939-1945 war before the death of Gwen Farrar in 1944.\n\nNorah Blaney went on to make a name for herself as an actress, appearing in several roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and spending six months in the television soap opera Crossroads.",
