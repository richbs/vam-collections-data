The pants are elaborately embroidered with stripes and festoons and small balls on a red ground. Swinging tassels decorate the lower part of of the garment. They were collected by Sir James George Scott, the great  British scholar and colonial administrator, during his sojourn in Burma in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe Yinbaw are a  sub-group of the Karens of Kayah State, who farm in the valleys of this rugged mountain region in eastern Burma next to the Thai border. Though now largely  Christian, the Yinbaw were traditionally animists and continue once a year to gather at the spirit festival called Kathowbow, which is celebrated to ensure good luck and prevent famine or illness in the coming year.",
