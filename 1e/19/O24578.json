            "physical_description": "Sleeveless jacket of dark blue plain weave cotton. It is open down the front and has a seam down the centre back. The armholes are deeply cut and there is a vertical slit at either side of the bottom edge of the garment formed by leaving the side seams unsewn for 11 cms.\nDiagonally across the front of the jacket from underarm left up to the right shoulder there is an extra band of blue cotton, 14 cms wide. This band is quilted in double white cotton thread in a concentric diamond design. Another similar band of material is sewn down over the right shoulder to a depth of 20 cms back and front. The only fastenings the jacket has are three buttons - two mother-of-pearl and one plastic (replacement?) - and three blue cotton loops joining this shoulder band to the diagonal band.\nThe main section of the garment is covered with three different designs quilted through a double layer of cotton. This pattern quilting (<i>sashiko</i>) is carried out in double dark blue cotton thread. The hem section is quilted with a zig-zag design, the middle section with a large diamond design, and the top with concentric diamonds.\nThe jacket has a long collar band of dark blue cotton with simple small, all-over <i>kasuri</i> lines in white in both warp and weft. The armholes, lower edge, and front opening are bound with plain blue cotton.\nThis garment is specifically designed for sled hauling, the quilted diagonal band being a special reinforcement where the hauling rope is slung. It is said by the dealer to have come from the Shonai region in the north-west of Honshu (Yamagata Prefecture).",
