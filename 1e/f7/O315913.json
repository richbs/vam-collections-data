Edged with a border of silk bobbin lace. Additional trimming of small bows of non-shiny black silk ribbon have been attached to it. The cuff consists of two gathered scalloped-edged wings, the top-most is smaller than the other one, and mounted over one another, and having an additional gathered heading inside which are fragments of the sleeve to which it was once attached. The 'wings' have been cut so that each is on a different 'lie' of the material. They are also pieced, the larger lower 'wing', in one with the band, in three places and the smaller upper wing in one. The joining seams are very fine. The stitching is small and even and on the surface, where they blend with the arrangement of the gathers, they are invisible.",
