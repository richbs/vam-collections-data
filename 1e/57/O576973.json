Although its specific title and subject are not known, it is clearly based upon the sea, made from sea-green layers of sheer fabric with silver gauze and trimmings and decorated with seaweed, silver shells, branches of red coral, and rushes on the bodice. Partial pencil notes (in French) remain along the bottom of the design which indicate that it was to be trimmed with pearls along with the other sea-themed embellishments.\n\nDuring the 1860s, Empress Eugenie of France threw a number of extravagant masquerade balls which required the guests to wear elaborate and inventive costumes that were made up by Worth and other Paris dressmakers. Worth, a relative newcomer, became the Empress's favoured couturier at the end of the 1850s. This made him extremely fashionable, and the rest of the ladies of Eugenie's court also bought gowns from him - and so too did their husbands' mistresses, and anyone wealthy enough to afford Worth's very high prices. As a result, Worth was under great pressure to produce vast numbers of unique, one of a kind costumes and gowns, often at very short notice. This is one of a large number of similar designs and sketches that were given to the V&A as part of the archive and reference collection of the House of Worth, making it extremely likely that it was originally designed for a guest to wear to one of the Empress's magnificent balls.",
