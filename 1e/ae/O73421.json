Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996, pp.206-207, ill.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n<b>L.3</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Fruit</i> (also known as <i>Pomegranate</i>), 5 \nDesigned by William Morris; designed and first issued c. 1866 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 68.6 x 50.0 cm \nV&A (E.446-1919) \nGiven by Morris & Co. \n\nThis pattern is usually given an earlier date because the serial numbering in the printing log places it between <i>Daisy</i> and <i>Trellis</i>. Mackail, however states (p.176) that Morris was seen at Queen Square working on the design for <i>Pomegranate</i> in 1866. Mackail's notes also show that Campfield, the firm's foreman, recollected the design being made at Queen Square (i.e. no earlier than 1865). There are strong resemblances between <i>Fruit</i> and the painted panels that form part of the decoration of the Green Dining Room at the South Kensington Museum, 1866. A letter from Warrington Taylor, probably of 1867 (NAL 86.SS.57) calls it 'our last new paper'. \n\nThe design is built up of the repetition of four rectangular elements. It appears more complex than <i>Daisy</i> because of the diagonally thrusting branches and because leaves from each rectangle creep into the adjoining spaces. Two versions for the design are recorded (see The Arts Council, <i>Morris and Company Centenary</i>, 1961) but their current whereabouts are unknown.' \n\n\u2018Mackail\u2019 refers to: Mackail, J.
