The original paintings measured 150 x 150 cm and were made in 1969.   \n\nStruycken created the paintings from a series of computer-generated images produced using a computer program, or code, written by the artist.  The first image in the top left corner, entitled 'PROGRAM'  is an example of this code. \n\nStruycken welcomed the ability of the computer to calculate endless visual alternatives for the arrangement of a series of different coloured squares across the picture plane.  These 5 images are from a series of 8 paintings, which were chosen as the final selection from a much larger sequence of images, all of which are versions of one another.  For Struycken, the computer enabled him to investigate the role of chance in the creative process, whilst also retaining some measure of control.",
