            "historical_context_note": "This velvet hat is worn by an unmarried woman of the Palay Palaung. A married woman's hat consists of woven lengths of cotton wound around a beaded skull cap.  \nThe Palaung are descended from Mon-Khmer stock. The Burmans and Shans divide them into Shwe (Gold) and Palay (Silver) Palaungs on the basis of their dress. They live mainly in the mountains of northern Shan State where they are famous for cultivating tea. \nAlthough retaining many aspects of traditional spirit worship, most Palaung practise Buddhism and there are monasteries in almost every village.\nThis hat with the accompanying jacket (see IS 18-1996) came from a village in the mountains above Kalaw in western Shan State and was bought at the Kalaw market where villagers can be seen regularly. Their costume is one of the most colourful of all the hill tribes.",
