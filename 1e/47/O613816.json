His representations \nof the human figure stress the different charac- \nteristics of the sexes. His women are drawn \nwith soft sensuous contours while the men \nhave exaggerated muscles almost giving them \nthe appearance of \u00e9corch\u00e9 figures. Fuseli was \nProfessor of painting at the Royal Academy \nfrom 1801 to 1805 and from 1810 until his  \ndeath, and was appointed Keeper in 1804. \nThe ink used in this drawing has burnt the \npaper.\u2019",
