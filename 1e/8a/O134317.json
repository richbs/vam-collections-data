He began painting landscapes in about 1843; his favourite locations were in Scotland, Ireland, Devon and Wales, although he also made a tour of Switzerland. Oakes began exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1848, and was represented there virtually every year until his death. He was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1876. \n\nOakes was influenced by the naturalistic style of the highly successful landscape painters B. W. Leader and Vicat Cole. He was known for his depiction of atmospheric light effects, as can be seen in this painting, where shafts of sunlight illuminate the river and the bank. \n\nThis painting is probably identical with that exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1872 under the title <u>The foot bridge, border of Dartmoor</u>.",
