This non-violent protest challanged the authorities who responded brutally. It initiated the events which culminated in the 'Velvet Revolution' and the overthrow of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe student demonstration began with a meeting in the Albertov district of Prague on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Nazi persecution of Czechoslovak students who had held mass protests during the burial of Jan Opletal (a Czech student from the medical faculty of the Charles University who was shot during demonstrations against theGerman occupation of Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1939). The Albertov student meeting continued with a \u2018march for democracy\u2019 to the centre of Prague.  On the way towards National Street the student demonstration was joined by other, mainly young, people demanding freedom and democracy. \n\nThis photograph shows demonstrators bravely holding flowers against the truncheons in the hands to the \u2018White Helmets\u2019 (as the special troops of the Ministry of Interior Affairs were known). Photographs of the demonstration were printed and circulated in the shocked aftermath of the White Helmets' brutality.  \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
