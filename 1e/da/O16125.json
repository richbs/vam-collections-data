The decoration, of a firefly watching party, is in togidashi-e (polished out picture) when a design is created in hiramaki-e (low sprinkled picture), covered in several layers of lacquer (the same colour as the background) and polished away to reveal the image flush to the object. This style was very popular amongst the urban merchant class. Around the second half of the 16th century screens had begun to depict scenes of figures enjoying excursions and festivals. These paintings inspired later lacquer artists who would create narrative designs such as this writing box.",
