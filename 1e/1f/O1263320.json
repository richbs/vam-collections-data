It was produced by Bronte Porcelain and commissioned by Mulberry Hall to  commemorate Berwick Kaler's 30th appearance as Dame in Dick Turpin in December 2008 and January 2009, the 30th pantomime at York Theatre Royal that Kaler had written and directed, and in which he starred as Dame.\n\nThe Dame role is traditionally played by a man in British pantomime, but unlike the actors whose Dames are characterised by heavy make-up in the effort to imitate a stereotypically glamorous woman, Berwick Kaler's Dame is always resolutely the portrayal of a man in a frock wearing the boots of a working man.  The boots can be seen in this figurine, hanging behind his back, while in his right had he holds the biscuit known as a Wagon Wheel that he always throws to the audience during his shows. Kaler calls the audience: 'My babbies, my babies', and is always a Yorkshire character, as signified in this costume by the white rose of York that features on his costume.",
