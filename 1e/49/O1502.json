His emblem was a sword, which can be seen in the large roundels. Between the roundels is a quotation from the Qur\u2019an that mentions \u2018the mosques of God\u2019.\n\nBefore the introduction of electricity, lighting was an expensive luxury. Providing lighting in an Islamic religious building was therefore seen as an act of generosity to the community that would be rewarded by God. Donors paid for lamps and the supply of oil and wicks they required. During Mamluk rule (1250-1517) in Egypt and Syria, donors commissioned lamps and lamp-holders of glass and metal that were often large and impressive. Inscriptions recorded the donors\u2019 names.",
