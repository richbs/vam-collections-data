They are known as the 'A-marked' group, as most are marked 'A' underneath. This may have referred to the Duke of Argyll, who supported early experiments to make porcelain near Glasgow around 1749. However, they have also been attributed to Thomas Frye (1710-1762), working in London at a time prior to the establishment of the Bow factory. Most examples are very finely potted and painted. The raw materials in their manufacture probably included china clay (an ingredient of 'true' or hard-paste porcelain), rather than the 'ball' clays used at the other early British factories. This resulted in a much harder material than the 'soft-paste' imitations made at Chelsea, Bow and elsewhere.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMany of the 'A-marked' porcelains are painted with figure subjects copied from prints by the French illustrator and designer Hubert-Fran\u00e7ois Gravelot (1699-1773). The painter copied the figure scenes here from Songs in the Opera of Flora (1737), which was engraved by George Bickham junior (died 1771) after designs by Gravelot.",
