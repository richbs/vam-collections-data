St. Catherine of Alexandria with a donor. Rhenish, c. 1250. The drawing is about one-fifth to one-fourth the size of the original window.\n<i>Signed</i> John Trinick. del. MCMXXXVII.\n<i>Water-colour.</i>\nE.652-1937\n\n<i>Note by the Artist</i> :- \"The strong Byzantine flavour of the whole design is remarkable, and would seem to show a line of succession totally independent of that of French stained glass, deriving much more directly from the East-European source.\nThe painting technique suggests strongly a very advanced use of 'matt.' So far as I am aware, there is nothing like such use of the matt in French glass until a much later period (I know of nothing of 1250, but strong brushline-work, softened by an added wash-line, or by 'smear shading'). Moreover, the elaborate 'stick-work' on the straps of the surrounding ornament would seem to have been picked out, not from stiff black colour, such as one sees so frequently in 13 cent. glass, but from a matt of similar strength to that which has been used for the figure; for the elaboration of the ornament is apparent only on a close inspection - the general effect from a distance being very clear and light. The linen stockings in which the feet of the figure are encased are an interesting evidence as to costume, and only a highly-developed glass-painting technique would have attempted them, and treated them so successfully.\"",

            "history_note": "Note made by John Trinick (1890-1974), the artist who was himself a skilled stained-glass craftsman:\n\n\"The strong Byzantine flavour of the whole design is remarkable, and would seem to shew a line of succession totally independent of that of French stained glass, deriving much more directly from the East-European source. The drawing of the chief figure in particular, suggests the inspiration of a fine period in school of Byzantine art, deceloped and carried to a high point by a local school of draughtsmanship working in the Rhineland. The sensitiveness of the drawing of this figure, with its keen feeling for the grace of the human type, and its obvious attempt to capture the texture of the drapery, is quite unlike anything with which I am acquaintanced in French glass of the same period.\n\nBy 1250 in France, the \"Gothic\" character had already begun to establish itself in the glass, as it had done rather earlier in the sculpture; and one would look far in French glass design, with its strongly stylized brush technique in the painting, and its strongly mannered and lively figure drawing, for a parallel to this.\n\nThe painting technique of the St. Cunibert's glass is highly interesting, and suggests strongly a very advanced use of 'matt.' The tracing is kept fine, and the whole effort of the painter has obviously been to achieve the greatest possible degree of sensitive drawing by means of modelling in the matt. So far as I am aware, there is nothing like such use of the matt in French glass until a much later period (I know of nothing of 1250, but strong brushline-work, softened by an added wash-line, or by 'smear shading'). Moreover, the elaborate 'stick-work' on the straps of the surrounding ornament would seem to have been picked out, not from stiff black colour, such as one sees so frequently in 13 cent. glass, but from a matt of similar strength to that which has been used for the figure; for the elaboration of the ornament is apparent only on a close inspection - the general effect from a distance being very clear and light.\n\nThe linen stockings in which the feet of the figure are encased are an interesting evidence as to costume, and only a highly-developed glass-painting technique would have attempted them, and treated them so successfully. To me, at least, they add a final touch of grace to a singularly appealing figure; the familiar decorated shoes would have been much more easy to paint, but how much less 'right'!\"",
