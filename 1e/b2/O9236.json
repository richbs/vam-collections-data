            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nChairs with backs which can be adjusted on a metal ratchet have been made in Britain since the 1670s. Simpler versions of the same type, like this chair, used a wooden rail and notches in the arms. It combines an ebonised finish, evidence of contemporary interest in Japanese design, with bobbin turning on the legs, a traditional technique in English furniture. The original covers are made of 'Utrecht Velvet', a stamped woollen plush sold by Morris and Company for upholstery and for wall hangings.\n\nPeople\nWarrington Taylor (about 1837-1870), business manager of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., found the country version of this chair in the workshop of Ephraim Colman, a carpenter in Herstmonceaux, Sussex, in 1866. He sent a sketch to Philip Webb (1831-1915) and suggested that it would make a suitable design for the firm. Webb, who designed much of the firm's early furniture, developed Taylor's sketch into the adjustable-back armchair, produced by the firm from about 1869.\n\nTrading\nThis armchair was one of the firm's popular designs and was available both in this black finish and in mahogany. The illustrated catalogue produced by Morris & Co. c. 1912 shows that loose covers could be supplied either in 'Utrecht Velvet' or in chintz (a printed cotton). The commercial success of the design encouraged other firms, notably Liberty & Co. of London and Gustav Stickley, an American workshop, to produce their own versions.",
