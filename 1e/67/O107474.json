            "public_access_description": "Frederick Sommer started photographing landscape around 1939, having bought a large-format camera the previous year. With their flattened compositions and meticulous detail, his desert scenes suggest the plans and maps he would have made when working as a landscape architect. Their patterning, minimal shadow and omitted horizon also have much in common with the \u2018all-over\u2019 field paintings of American Abstract Expressionist artists in the 1940s and 1950s. Sommer\u2019s atomised landscapes, devoid of human presence, can be seen to share with Abstract Expressionism a sense of existential unease in the face of global war.",

In 1939 he created a series of grotesque still-lifes, depicting the heads and entrails of chickens with perfect precision. Sommer\u2019s images are often akin to surrealist paintings, mysterious, tense or foreboding in mood, and suggesting as he said, that \"something metaphysical is happening\".",
