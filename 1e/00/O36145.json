The whole is cast in two halves down\nthe length and held together by tongue and slot joints. The cowboy figure is separate and held to the horse by tongue and slot joints with the shoulders and knees loosely joined. It is lithographed tinplate showing a greenish black body with red and yellow trim and a wide red mouth. The rider is grey; green; blue; red and yellow. The clockwork mechanism is housed inside the body and covered with a metal plate cut away to allow the legs to move. The metal plate looks as if it is a replacement. The integral key protrudes from the body underneath and when wound; the legs move so the horse appears to leap along. \n*The horse and rider may be German but they just appear to be copies See also the US copy of the Bucking Bronco which has the same horse and rider but different legs.",
