Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  When gold, however thin, was too expensive, they wore gilded metal.  The earring shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from the south of Italy.  Earrings like this are called \u2018a navicella\u2019 in Italian, meaning boat-shaped, and are extremely common throughout the southern regions and Sicily.  Coral was very popular with Italian women, who valued it as an amulet as well as for its colour.  \n\nThis earring was bought for eight shillings (the pair) as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
