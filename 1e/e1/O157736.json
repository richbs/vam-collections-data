            "public_access_description": "The motif of the Roman micromosaic plaque on this box is inspired by ancient Roman wall decorations from the first century AD that were discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum in the eighteenth century. Both towns were destroyed by the eruption Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD and buried under ash and pumice. Herculaneum was excavated from 1738, while Pompeii was rediscovered on a larger scale in 1748. These excavations offered an unrivalled glimpse into Roman everyday life in the 1st century AD. Their artefacts and wall decorations were studied, copied and published by artists and scholars such as Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and thus contributed to the emergence of the neoclassical style.\n\nThe composition of a tripod flanked by two further objects was popular on small circular micromosaic plaques for a period of circa twenty years from the late eighteenth century onwards. Numerous examples of various degrees of quality, but similar dimensions, survive and reflect the hunger of the neoclassical period for design inspired by antiquity across society. Such plaques would typically be set in circular boxes, also known as bonbonni\u00e8res, such is this.",

            "history_note": "Provenance: Hoffman and Lowe, Beverly Hills, 1972.\n\n<b>Micromosaics</b>\n\nThe discovery of the <i>Doves of Pliny</i>,  an ancient mosaic described by ancient Roman author Pliny the Younger as the  ultimate example of illusionism in the field of mosaics, in 1737, might have triggered the interest  among Roman mosaicists to create ever more painterly mosaics with ever smaller pieces. By 1800  such micromosaics became particularly fashionable as a technique that expressed neoclassical taste  even in the very choice of its medium. Their portability made them the perfect souvenir to take back from Rome. \n\n<b>The Motif: Tripods from Antiquity to Neoclassicism</b>\n\nA tripod holding a cauldron could be used to warm water or as brazier. In ancient Greece and subsequently in the Roman Empire tripods were also used in a ritualistic way: Ancient authors like Homer or Virgil describe that they were given as rewards to brave soldiers or as prizes to athletes and performers. They were prestigious gifts and sacrificial objects. Tripods were associated in particular with the cult of the god Apoll and the Oracle of Delphi. This religious dimension in combination with the discovery of actual ancient metal tripods and their depictions in the eighteenth century led to the popularity of the tripod as both motif and actual object in the neoclassical period.\n\n\n<b>The Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Collection</b>\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert (1913-2001) and his first wife Rosalinde (1913-1995) formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert moved his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996, since 2008 it has been on long-term loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
