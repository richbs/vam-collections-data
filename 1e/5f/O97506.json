No.B1-3) presented by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy to the Infante, later King of Spain, Philip III, on the occasion of the Duke's marriage to Philip's cousin, Infante Catalina, in 1585.\n\nMany armours in the Royal Armoury in Madrid were broken and removed during the early 19th century. The gauntlets were subsequently in the Bernal Sale of 1855 (lot 2246: where they were attributed to a suit belonging to Philip IV) and later in the Londesborough Collection from which they were sold at Christie's on the 4th July 1888 (lot 305). They were later in the collection of Mr David M. Currie who bequeathed them to the Museum in 1921.\n\nHistorical significance: The gauntlets are remarkable for the richness and variety of their decoration, something for which the armourers of Milan were renowned. The cuffs and fingers are covered with magnificent chased and damascened (inlaid gold) ornament that includes figures of Fame and Victory. Their association with the Royal Armoury in Madrid, and the possibility that they were part of a suit presented in 1585 to the future Phillip III, put the gauntlets in the top echelons of aristocratic patronage. The Spanish nobility, particularly the royal family were the best customers for the Italian armourers in the later 16th century and the decline of Spain as a force after 1600 seriously impacted on the armourers' markets.\n\nThe decoration is in the style of the workshop of Lucio Piccinino (born around 1535, active around 1570-1589), one of the great armourers of Milan. The gauntlets were part of a parade armour, rather than a protective battle suit, and would have created a spectacular display as part of a matching suit of armour.\n\nThe manufacture of arms and armour was for centuries Milan's most famous export. The industry in Milan was centred on a few workshops run by families specialising in armour of great beauty and artistic skill for a wealthy, aristocratic market. Along with Missaglia, the Negroli, Giovan Battista Zarabaglia and Pompeo della Cesa, Lucio Piccinino was the most important.\n\nLucio Piccinino was an armour embosser and damascener. His work represents one of the last last great flourishes of the armourer's art before heavy musket shot put paid to the all-over dress armours. Piccinino had, claimed Paolo Morigia in his <i>La Nobilita' di Milano</i> published in 1595 \"in his ornamentation of iron in relief with figures, animals and grotesque masks, etc., and likewise in his damascened work, produced masterpieces which are among the most choice and precious.\" Piccinino made armour for princes and kings including a parade armour for Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza (1545-1592), now in the Kunsthistorischesmuseum in Vienna.",
