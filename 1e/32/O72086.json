A bamboo grove is generally located at the edge of a village and not frequented by any large animal - hence the proverb: a lesser person will try to take a dominant role if given the opportunity. \n\nA jackal is seated on a string-throne, supporting on a large bolster and smoking a<i> huqqa </i>whilst two jackal attendants wait on him. One is holding a regal umbrella over him and the other a <i>huqqa</i>. Below, the Jackal Raja, now seated in a western-style chair, pronounces judgement on two tied and bound animals which are led before him by a Jackal jailor, dressed in a black sailor's hat and midshipman's uniform. The figures have rounded effect with shading. The clothing and various ornaments have silver linings (executed in tin alloy).",

By the 1830s, artists had arrived from rural villages in Bengal and began to produce paintings that reflected local history, mythology, customs and conflicts of a colonised society. As a popular art form, these artists are recognised for their use of brilliant colour, simplified images and swift brushstrokes that became the hallmark of Kalighat painting in the 19th and early 20th century.",
