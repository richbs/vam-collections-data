It was made using thinnings from plantations, which are the saplings removed from commercially managed forests to allow other trees to thrive.  These are usually too slender to be useful, but the steam-bent frames of this chair exploit their slenderness.  The steaming process simultaneously seasons the green wood too.  The crisp look of the chair, derived from simple geometries, may not immediately evoke a ruralist or environmentalist ethic.  Nevertheless, it is made in the tradition of vernacular furniture-making, brought up to date and wedded to a contemporary ecological agenda for sustainable production practices. Trannon Furniture is the company founded by the designer to manufacture furniture designed with sustainability in mind.",
