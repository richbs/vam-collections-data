The corner-pieces in the wide border has been made to fit by adding a narrow border on two of its sides. Quarter-moon in the corner of the narrow borders. \n\nWide border with harlequin compartments 12 inches by 5.625 inches in pale green, black, white and yellow. Each contains a symmetrical pine with small leaves on stems from the main stem at the base to a height of 3 inches, then large heads of shawl-flowers. The pine is surrounded by small flowers, leaving only an outline empty. Colours are scarlet, red, pink, blue-green, grey, white and yellow.\n\nThe corner piece, on a black ground, is a large pine that has turned into a rectangular bunch of shawl-flowers angled from the corner whence spring two guards of flowers to fill the two outer edges of the square. Outside these are two rows of guard-stripe cresting, turning a proper corner, from possibly a difference source.\n\nGuard-stripes to the wide border and corner-piece, carried around the shawl as the narrow border have a small, fat and angled pine alternating with a sprawl of shawl-flowers filling the spaces between. An outer guard of white carries a floral meander. Colours for the corner piece and guard-stripe are as for the wide border, except that a light brown, stone colour, takes the place of the grey, and there is a lighter intense blue.\n\nThe quarter-moon is applied in the corner between the narrow guard-stripe borders. The black ground of the shawl is cut away behind it. Its pattern is of crossing and interlacing angled pines on a scarlet ground, with a cresting of plants on white. Black cloth with fringe is applied all round the edge of the shawl.",
