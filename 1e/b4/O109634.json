The handle starts right under the rim of the jug and curves slightly inwards before meeting the shoulder of the base.  The lustre is a deep ruby red.  In ceramic production, compounds of copper and silver were used to create the shiny, metallic decoration known as lustre.  It was a two-stage process.  In the first stage, the glazed pot was produced in the normal way by firing in a kiln.  In the second, a design was painted over the glaze using the metallic compounds, and the pot was refired at a lower temperature in a kiln with a restricted supply of oxygen.  During this second firing, the heat converted the  metallic compounds into oxides, and the carbon monoxide produced by the fire then drew the oxygen out of the oxides, leaving the metal as a thin deposit on the vessel.  The result was a surface with an attractive golden glow.  Both these forms of decoration - blue-and-white and lustre - were to have a very long history, and they are both still in use today.",

This is a feature of many lustre wares produced in Iran during the period 1650-1700.\t\t\n\nAround 1650, a group of Iranian potters revived the technique of lustre decoration. First the potter made a glazed vessel or tile with little or no decoration in the normal way. When the piece had cooled, the potter painted a design over the glaze in metallic compounds. The pot or tile was then fired again, this time with a restricted supply of oxygen. In these conditions, the metallic compounds broke down, and a thin deposit of copper or silver was left on the surface of the glaze. When polished, this surface layer reflected the light.\n\nThis technique had not been used on any scale in Iran for three centuries. We do not know how the technique was revived, or where the potters produced their distinctive wares.",
