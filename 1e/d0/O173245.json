            "public_access_description": "Roger Fry, who designed this lamp, was best known to his contemporaries as an art critic and curator.  A passionate advocate of Post-Impressionist artists like C\u00e9zanne and Matisse, Fry founded the Omega Workshops in 1912 in order to promote appreciation of mass, colour and form as seen in Post-Impressionist painting.  He felt that decorative objects could be used to train the eye to appreciate these characteristics, and that greater understanding of Post-Impressionism could be fostered in this way.\n\nUnder the umbrella of the Omega Workshops, numerous artists produced a wide range of objects for the home, including painted furniture and furnishing textiles.  Affiliates of the Workshop were salaried, but were expected to spend only 3 half days a week in the group studio and to devote the rest of their time to fine art projects.  Consequently the Workshop output was very varied, and reflected current trends in art.\n\nThis lamp displays Fry's preoccupation with form and colour, but, more surprisingly, also shows an interest in the geometric shapes and stylised decoration found in the painted vernacular furniture tradition.",
