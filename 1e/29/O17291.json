(some col.)\nExhibition catalogue\n<u>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</u>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 106, 107\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe painting was relined on a larger canvas and provided with a new stretcher in 1893. There are wide bituminous cracks in the brown shadows. \n\nThe painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1815 (No. 215) with the title 'Boat-building'. Holmes, p. 243, plausibly identifies it with No. 59 in the Executors' sale, 16 May 1838, 'View at Flatford, with barge building', bought by Smith of Lyall St. for \u00a351 9s. Whether it passed straight into the hands of Mr. Sheepshanks is not recorded; it was in his possession when the handlist <i>The Collection of Pictures formed by John Sheepshanks, Esq</i>. was drawn up <i>c.</i>I850, and it came to the Museum with his Gift in 1857. \n\nOn p. 57 of sketch-book No. 132 [1259-1888] there is a full-page pencil sketch dated 7 September 1814 for the composition, but with different <i>staffage</i>; p. 56 of the same book has a sketch used for the figure of the boy in the foreground, and pp. 55 and 56 bear other sketches of figures apparently engaged in the operations of barge-building. \n\nLeslie (L. ed. S., pp. 74 and 75) quotes from Constable's letter of 18 September 1814, addressed from East Bergholt to Miss Bicknell: \"This charming season, as you will guess, occupies me entirely in the feilds; and I believe I have made some landscapes that are better than is usual with me, at least that is the opinon of all here\". Leslie comments \"Among the landscapes mentioned in this letter was one which I have heard him say he painted entirely in the open air. It was exhibited the following year at the Academy, with the title of 'Boat-building'. In the midst of a meadow at Flatford, a barge is seen on the stocks, while just beyond it the river Stour glitters in the still sunshine of a hot summer's day. This picture is a proof, that in landscape, what painters call warm colours are not necessary to produce a warm effect. It has indeed no positive colour, and there is much of grey and green in it; but such is its atmospheric truth, that the tremulous vibration of the heated air near the ground seems visible. This perfect work remained in his possession to the end of his life.\" \nThe entry made by Farington for 23 July 1814 helps to explain why Constable painted the picture in the open air and throws light on certain of its features: \n\"Constable called upon me.- We talked abt. filling the vacancies of Associates in November next. I told him the objection made to His pictures was their being unfinished; that Thomson [Henry Thomson, R.A.] gave him great credit for the taste of His design in His larger picture last exhibited, & for the indication shown in the colouring, but He had not carried His finishing far enough.-I recommended to Him to look at some of the pictures of <i>Claude</i> before He returns to His country studies, and to attend to the admirable manner in which all the parts of His pictures are completed.-He thanked me much for the conversation we had, from which he sd. He shd. derive benefit\" (Greig, vet. VII, p. 272). The unpublished extract for 30 July 1814 shows that Constable took Farington's advice: \"Constable called being this day to leave London for the season. He was, by my advice, at Mr. Angerstein's on Wednesday last to study the pictures by Claude, particularly the <i>finishing</i> before he commenced his studies from nature in the country\". Farington recorded on 10 November that he had been told by Constable that his uncle, Mr. D. P. Watts, had seen his painted studies; he had noticed their being more fmished than his other works, and bespoke one of them (Greig, Vol. VII, P.287). The five Angerstein Claudes were among the thirty-eight works purchased from him to found the National Gallery in 1824: they are Nos. 2, 5, 12, 14 and 30 in that Gallery's catalogues. \nNo. 137 [F.A.37] is notable among Constable's work as much for the Claude-like quality of its colouring as for the truth to atmospheric effect noted by Leslie: and the extract from Farington's diary given above shows that this was the result of a conscious intention on Constable's part. Although doubtless painted entirely in the open air, its close dependence on the drawings in the sketch-book No. 132 [1259-1888] shows that Constable took the same pains with it as with a picture painted in his studio, and it is, to that extent, different from his usual open-air oil sketches. Lucas says that Constable told him that when working on this picture \"he was always informed of the time to leave off by the pillar of smoke ascending from a chimney in the distance that the fire was lighted for the preparation of supper on the labourers' return for the night\" (Beckett, I, p. 107).\n<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum</u>,London: V&A, 1985, p.106\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"John Constable 1776-1837\n<i>British School</i> \nBOAT-BUILDING NEAR FLATFORD MILL \nOil on canvas, 50.8 x 61.6 cm \nFA.37. <i>Sheepshanks Gift.</i> \n \n<i>Boat-building near Flatford Mill</i>is a particularly important work in Constable's oeuvre. Exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1815, it sums up those aspects of his art that Constable considered to be most important at a time when he was actively canvassing support to be elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. Its purpose was to gain recognition for his art in established artistic circles. \n\nThe scene is a pleasant summer's day on the banks of the river Stour. A barge is being constructed in Constable's father's boatyard by the mill to carry his flour down the river to Mistley in Essex on its way to London. The unfinished boat is shown with a degree of detail unusual for Constable, but it is not painted with any more care than the surrounding trees. The general effect is of a placid, tranquil and uneventful day. \n\nAs <i>'Boat-building'</i> was so important to Constable he took special trouble over its creation. The composition was carefully worked out in a pencil drawing in his sketchbook of 1814 in the museum and we know that he was advized to study the work of Claude before embarking on the picture in order to attain the correct degree of 'finish' that would make it acceptable to members of the Academy. We also know that he painted the picture almost entirely out-of-doors. According to David Lucas, the engraver of Constable's sketches, Constable knew when to finish a day's work by the smoke that arose from a neighbouring cottage when supper was cooked. The picture thus achieves a remarkable degree of verisimilitude to the visual sensation of a late summer afternoon in the country. The eye is not called upon to focus on the boat alone; it can explore the fields in the distance or investigate the clumps of foliage in the shadows on the right of the picture. The overall consistency of light and shade in the scene has not been equalled until the advent of the French Impressionists. \n\nSad to relate, Constable was unsuccessful in his attempt to be elected to the Academy. It was not until 1819, when his contemporary Turner had been a full member for seventeen years, that he was elected an Associate. \n\nIt is worth remembering that Constable's pictures often depict some kind of industrial or agricultural activity by the river Stour. Those who see Constable's pictures as images of rural calm should remember that the river Stour was navigable and Constable's father's mills formed part of the industrial activity that took place on its banks. Constable's concern for accurately reproducing the day-to-day business of the countryside is such that he has been called an 'industrial landscape painter' as opposed to a purely rural landscape painter. \n\nHoward Coutts\"\nEvans, M., with N.
