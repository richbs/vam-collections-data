            "public_access_description": "In 1969, designer David Walker reconstructed three costumes from the 1653 French court ballet Ballet Royal de la nuit for Ballet For All, the Royal Ballet's educational demonstration group.  He drew heavily on contemporary sources, including the existing designs, which are superb examples of Baroque theatre style.  That style derived from the 17th and 18th century view of 'classical' history and the cut and decoration of the costumes recalls the chased breastplates and kilt of  Roman armour.  This ties in with the idea of the 'noble' being related to Roman militarism and virtues.   \nThe participants in the ballet included many noblemen, dancing being one of the ways of occpuying the time of the large number of aristocrats at the French court.  The Ballet Royal de nuit was an allegory, and the roles included many virtues and vices.  The duc de Joyeuse portrayed Valor, one of the qualites surrounding the Sun (played by Louis XIV). \nWalker\u2019s reconstruction follows the outlines and style of the original designs, but interprets them in 20th century terms.  The costumes are heavy, which helps the dancers get the feel of the dance style of the period; the fabrics are modern equivalents but the decoration is purely 20th century, being furniture trims available from any do-it-yourself store.",
