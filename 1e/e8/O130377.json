It was used for both furnishings and dress in elite circles. It was expensive because it made use of relatively scarce and expensive raw materials (silk and gold), was time-consuming to weave, and required the labour of skilled weavers. Production was organised in a guild system, in which those learning the trade had to serve a long apprenticeship before being allowed to set up their own workshops.\n\nThe main centres of silk weaving in 14th- and 15th-century Europe were in Italian cities \u2014 Venice, Milan, Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Bologna \u2014 although some centres in eastern and southern Spain attempted to compete. Valencia, for example, imported Genoese weavers at the end of the 15th century to set up a guild of velvet weavers with the necessary skills.",

Signed into the Storekeeper's office on 15th December 1894 along with several other pieces of silk and portions of vestments, all damaged, this single number corresponds with the entry for '4 piece green velvet gold embroideries [damaged]' (subsequently, the term 'embroideries' was scored through). Originally offered for \u00a37, the price paid was \u00a36. No other information is available on this object. Louis Marcy offered the museum various objects between 1894 and 1903, both Middle Eastern and European, including many textiles. (Nominal file: Marcy, Louis, MA/1/M765)\n\nHistorical significance: Significant as an example of one of the most complex silks woven in this period, using the most expensive technique and raw materials. Possibly not the best example because of the rather crude seaming and the fact that the full width of the textile cannot be seen.",

            "historical_context_note": "This type of voided velvet was one of the most expensive types of silk on the market in Renaissance Europe, being used for furnishings, secular dress and ecclesiastical vestments in elite circles. It was expensive because it made use of relatively scarce and expensive raw materials (silk and gold), was time-consuming to weave, and required skilled labour. Production was organised in a guild system.\n\nThe main centres of silk weaving in fourteenth and fifteenth century Europe were in Italian cities - Venice, Milan, Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Bologna, although some Spanish centres in eastern and southern Spain attempted to compete. Valencia, for example, imported Genoese weavers at the end of the fifteenth century to set up a guild of velvet weavers (<i>Art de Velluters</i> and the Cofrad\u00eda de San Jer\u00f3nimo (1479-83)).\n\n<b>Select bibliography</b>  \nLisa Monnas.
