They are made of silver-gilt with applied panels of silver-gilt filigree partly enamelled and are hinged near the centre. The anklets can be opened by means of a chained pin at the front which can be removed.\n\nThe anklets bear a French silver standard mark suggesting they were made after the French occupation of Algeria, which began in 1830. The design of such anklets varied from city to city. The donor of this pair reported that these were made in El Golea, a town in central Algeria, but were acquired further north, in Gharda\u00efa.",
