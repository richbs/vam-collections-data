Many textiles of this age have been damaged by light so that their colours are now subdued and appear to be in a limited range of dyes. The valance is particularly important in demonstrating how very bright and vibrant the colours could be in the 16th century.  It is the only known valance  that might have been woven at the Sheldon tapestry workshop.\n\nUse\nThe valance would have been hung around the top of a bed, together with  curtains. Bed furnishings provided warmth and decoration. Many had lively narrative scenes or favourite motifs in bright colours.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe idealised hunting and country scenes, separated by vases of  fruit and flowers, show some of the favoured pursuits of 16th- and 17th-century England. The limited sense of perspective is still provided in much the  same way as it had been in tapestries of the 15th century, with scenes in layers set on hilly slopes. The topmost  layer  showing small trees and castles gives a sketchy impression of  the far distance.",
