They are rare examples  of silver intended for dessert, or 'banqueting', a costly course of fruits and  sweetmeats which came after the main meal and was often enjoyed in a  separate location. At the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Nonesuch, a  select few (perhaps six to eight people) would have had their senses pleased  in an intimate banqueting house where all accoutrements were as luxurious  as the food served. Dessert was an opportunity for hosts to flatter guests  with very expensive rareities such as refined sugar from Cyprus or Madeira.  A silver dish for meat would have been plain, but dessert dishes, like this one,  were elaborately decorated with fine engraving or chasing (designs  hammered into relief) and were often gilded. Sometimes they were made  from another precious material such as mother of pearl, painted glass or  tortoiseshell.\nThe mid 17th century coat of arms engraved on the V&amp;A dishes hides an  earlier erased coat of arms. Faint traces of the earlier one can be seen,  enough to identify the original owner as William Cecil, 1st Lord Burghley, who  was Lord Treasurer and chief advisor to Elizabeth I and one of the richest  and most accomplished patrons of the arts of the 16th century. The lack of  wear on the dishes raises the possibility that while they followed the pattern  of dessert dishes, they may have been used primarily for display on a  sideboard or 'buffet' rather than for use. The exquisite and complex scheme  of engraving on each dish would certainly be seen to better advantage. The  engraver combines a border of fashionable arabesque ornament (scrolls of  pointed leaves) encompassing birds, animals and monsters with fantastical  marine scenes in the well of each dish surrounding a biblical scene in the  centre.",

Two have been mostly erased and hidden by scrolling foliage  ornament, the third is covered by a later coat of arms. Close examination of  these traces reveals the original arms to be those of William Cecil, first Lord  Burghley (1520-98), Lord Treasurer to Elizabeth I (Schroder: 2004, pp. 3-4). The later arms are those of the Montagu family, and may refer to William  Montagu of Oakley, Bedfordshire, fifth son of Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward  Montagu (d. 1556). This is one of six similar engraved plates, all with  Montagu arms, which appear to have remained in the possession of the  family from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries, when they were  sent to auction at Christie's, London, by Captain Frederick Montagu who had  inherited the plates from his uncle, Andrew Montagu of Ingmanthorpe Hall,  Yorkshire, and Papplewick Hall, Nottinghamshire. The Museum purchased all  six plates at the sale on July 3rd, 1946.",
