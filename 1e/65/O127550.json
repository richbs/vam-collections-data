They reflect the popularity of the classical style at the time, derived from the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.  The profile of Alexander the Great is carved in ebony, a hard, close-grained wood, probably chosen here to imitate a hardstone cameo.  The eagle, military trophies, lion mask and floral swags are of boxwood.  \n\nIn 1797 Genoa had been invaded by the French revolutionary army of Napoleon Bonaparte.  On 14 June Napoleon overthrew the Most Serene Republic of Genoa, established in 1005, and replaced it with the Ligurian Republic as a state fully under the control of France. Clearly, Alexander represents the invading Napoleon. The carved fly on the eagle's wing, may have been intended as an insult to the invader.",

The Art Referees Report, by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, written on 29 January, recommended their purchase with the following report: 'These are good specimens of wood carving on a cabinet scale by an Artworkman of the school of Albertolli who excercised so powerful an influence  upon ornamental design throughout North Italy at the close of the last century. There have existed at Milan for the last half century various members of the\"Arrigoni\" family who have continued as dealers in works of Art to show considerable dexterity and good judgments [sic]. These specimens are certainly very delicate and pretty but are somewhat \"mesquiso\" in style.  The touch with the woodcarvers [sic] gouge is better however than usual. I would recommend the purchase of the pair if they could be got for say one hundred and fifty pounds the pair [they had been offered for \u00a3200] but I should be disinclined to recommend them at a higher price.'  They were purchased for \u00a3150 from Mr T.M. Whitehead.\n\nHistorical significance: When this carving and its pair were acquired by the Museum, not only was carving a highly valued skill, but the unification of Italy had only just been completed (in 1871).  This cause, championed by Giuseppe Garibaldi, had been actively supported in Britain.",
