            "public_access_description": "Tea began to be imported into Britain from the middle of the 17th century but remained a luxury item until import duties were abolished in 1784. A fashionable and social drink, during the 18th century it was prepared in front of guests. English tea drinkers differed from their Chinese counterparts by preferring to drink tea hot and with milk and sugar, the latter becoming increasingly available through West Indies sugar plantations which relied on the labour of African slaves.\n\n\u2018The Tea Party\u2019 engraving by Robert Hancock, which appears on one side of this tea pot, is one of the most popular designs to have been used on 18th century English ceramics. It shows a well-dressed couple drinking tea in a garden, attended by a young black male servant who pours hot water from a kettle into a teapot. About 10,000 Africans are estimated to have been living in 18th century England, most working as, often unpaid, domestic staff. For their affluent owners these African servants were status symbols who offered \u2018exotic associations\u2019 like the new beverage, tea.",
