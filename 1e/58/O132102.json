            "public_access_description": "Wilhelm Koller (1829-1884/85) was born in Vienna where he studied at the Academy. He subsequently went to D\u00fcsseldorf and made several trip to Antwerp. He steeled in Brussels in 1859 and moved to paris ten years later. He died near Nancy.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Wilhelm Koller's oeuvre essentially drawing upon the history of 6th-century Germany. Although it is difficult to identify the precise event related here, the costumes suggest a scene set in the 15th century. It is a fine example of the D\u00fcsseldorf school, which combines the Nazarene and Parisian history painting with a taste for Neo-Renaissance imagery.",

In Germany in general and the D\u00fcsseldorf school in particular, this revival constituted a middle road between the early Nazarene and the Romantic French history painting. The work of the Romantic artist Karl Friedrich Lessing (1808-1880) is particularly significant in this regard.\nSimilar compositions included a panel attributed to Gustave Koller but most likely by Wilhelm Koller, sold at Sotheby's Monaco, 21 Jun 1986, lot 299, and another entitled <i>Farewell</i>, dated 1864, in the Kunsthalle, Hamburg (Inv. 3029).\nThe work of Wilhelm Koller is quite rare in the UK.",
