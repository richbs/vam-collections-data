His working life roughly coincided with the golden age of the viol in England. Viols, which came in a number of different sizes ranging from treble to bass, were held between the legs, hence the term viola da gamba, and played with a bow that was held with the palm of the hand turned outwards. This limited the pressure brought to bear on the string and created a softer sound than that made by the violin. By about 1780 viols were almost entirely replaced by violins and cellos. At some unknown date, the base of this tenor viol was hollowed out at the back, so that it could be played from the shoulder, like a violin.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
