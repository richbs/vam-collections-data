The interlocking bricks were one example of his range of \"sensible\" toys that explored the versatile uses for plastic, instead of the traditional wooden toy. Plastic became popular in toy design due to its hygienic qualities as well as the range of colours and shapes that could be made. \nThese bricks were the first time that building blocks had been given the facility to grip together to create more secure structures. The design for interlocking bricks was later developed further by the Danish company Lego who took over the rights to the design in 1949.",

The interlocking bricks were one example of his range of \"sensible\" toys that explored the versatile uses for plastic, instead of the traditional wooden toy. \nPlastic became popular in toy design due to its hygienic qualities as well as the range of colours and shapes that could be made. \nThese bricks were the first time that building blocks had been given the facility to grip together to create more secure structures. The design for interlocking bricks was later developed further by the company, Lego having taking over the rights to the design in 1949.",
