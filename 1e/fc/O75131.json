            "public_access_description": "This monument to Sir Heneage Finch (1580\u20131631), Speaker of the House of Commons, is recorded in the account book of the sculptor Nicholas Stone, who agreed to carry out the work for \u00a350. Heneage Finch\u2019s parents, Sir Moyle and Lady Elizabeth Finch, are commemorated in a large table-top tomb also in the collection (Museum no. A.186-1969).\n\nNicholas Stone (born about 1587, died 1647) was the most important English sculptor of the first half of the 17th century. He trained in The Netherlands, in the workshop of Hendrik de Keyser (1565-1621) in Amsterdam, from about 1607. He married de Keyser's daughter and returned to London in 1613. Although Stone was also active as an architect (he was appointed Master Mason and Architect at Windsor Castle, Berkshire,  in 1626), he is best remembered for the fine marble and alabaster tombs he erected during the 1620s and 1630s. He appears to have stopped work with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642, and the sculptural tradition in Britain generally was not revived again until the late 17th century.\n\nThe Latin inscription can be translated as follows: \n\u2018To Heneage Finch, the radiant knight who served London as Recorder for \ndecades, Member of Parliament, and under King Charles Speaker of the House of Commons. \nTo Moyle and Elizabeth Finch, the latter having survived her husband, and elevated the titles of the Viscountess of Maidstone and Countess of Winchilsea.\nTo the best son, husband, employer and friend, from Elizabeth his second wife. Who came from the ancient family of Cradock. One of two daughters, having survived her husband by two years, two months and seven days.\nHe most serenely gave up his soul into the hands of his Saviour when he was taken away by the dropsy on the 5 September 1631.\nHe lived fifty years eleven months and five days.\nFrancis his brother, and heir (together with Thomas Twisden his brother-in-law) erected this small monument with enormous sorrow and grief. \nAlas, you (O Lord who will never die) have assigned too hastily this burial amongst those still living.\nRenowned virtue never denies death nor does measured faith, unsurpassed zeal and gracious justice.\nAmong those who were best versed in religious text, you were second to none in virtue.\nTaken into the heavens by the Lord, how envious are we who survive. They will hardly see your equal on earth in future times\u2019.\n\nA gold box thought to have been owned by Heneage Finch is also in the Museum's collections: M.61-1990.",
