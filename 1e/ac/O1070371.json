F H A Wallop apparently in 1928 and lent to the V&A, 12 June 1928 until 1949; given to Alan Evans, 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A, 1974. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 226 (as autograph); Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 32.  \n \nThis miniature is now effectively a ruin. It is puzzling because the repainting of the head seems entirely gratuitous. The costume and background are of beautiful autograph quality for Hoskins c.1635 and seem to be in such good condition that it is difficult to imagine how the head could have faded or been damp-damaged enough to tempt the restorer. Also puzzling is the fact that Long did not warn Wallop of the 'restoration', which should in this instance have been clear enough, even though the use of ultra-violet fluorescence to detect anachronistic pigments such as zinc was in its infancy in Long's lifetime.  \n \nAccording to the label on the back of the case, in Wallop's hand, the miniature was 'from Ld Conyers Coll. 1928'. On 2 November 1928 Wallop wrote to Long that the correct description of the sitter was 'the Hon.ble Sir Robert Howard K B (1585-1653), 5th son of the 1st Earl of Suffolk , brother of Frances, Lady Conyers and Countess of Holderness' .There is confusion here.  \n \nFirstly, at the death of George Sackville, 12th Baron Conyers, in 1888, the barony fell into abeyance; it had not apparently been revived by 1928, so Wallop must have been recording a tradition, rather than stating the direct source of his acquisition. Secondly, the barony of Conyers and the earldom of Holderness were in the same family only between 1682 and 1778 (after which Conyers became associated with the dukedom of Leeds). The only incumbent of the titles to marry a wife called Frances seems to have been the 2nd Earl, called Conyers D' Arcy (1621/2-1692). His second and third wives (out of four) were called Frances: the earlier, whom he married on 8 February 1649/50, was the daughter of Thomas Howard, Ist Earl of Berkshire (c. 1590 -1669). He was the second son of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk (1561-1626). Wallop omitted the Berkshire link and confused two Sir Robert Howards: the fifth son of the 1st Earl of Suffolk was Sir Robert (1585-1653), and the sixth son of the 1st Earl of Berkshire was also Sir Robert (1626-98).(1) He, the latter, was Frances's brother, \nbut of course was only about nine years old at the apparent date of this portrait. Thus, to find a sitter who could seem a plausible age and would connect with the Conyers provenance, it was necessary to move the elder Sir Robert (1585-1653) down a generation as Frances's brother instead of uncle.  \n \n1 See DNB.\"",
