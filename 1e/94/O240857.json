His worked is characterised by a quiet humour, and he often incorporates words and text in his prints. From abstract roots, Wiley has developed an eccentric and introspective imagery, rich with self-deprecating humour and a sense of the absurd. His figurative and text-based works are infused with references to popular culture, art history, and literature. Social and political issues, particularly war and environmental concerns, have played central roles in much of Wiley's work.",
