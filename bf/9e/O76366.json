It is an example of the lustre-painted pottery produced in Egypt under the Fatimid dynasty, who ruled there from 969 to 1171. The potter has covered the fritware body with white slip, a transparent glaze and, over the glaze, a design in golden-brown lustre. The decoration on the very rim of the bowl consists of a band of reciprocating triangles separated by a zigzag line. Below this is a band of lustre with spirals scratched through it. Below this is a band that looks like an inscription but is in fact illegible. Finally, you can see the remains of a second lustre band with scratched decoration.  \nThe potter has inscribed the Arabic word Sa'd on the outside of the bowl in the Kufic style. The word means 'happiness' but is also a common man's name. The same inscription appears on many other Egyptian lustre wares. However, it is not clear what it signifies.  It could be a potter's signature, a workshop mark or the expression of a good wish by the potter for the future owner.",
