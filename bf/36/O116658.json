The necklace consists of 11 open filigree plaques each set with a sapphire in the centre in a closed mount.  The surface of each plaque is painted with curls of black enamel with white dots, with two petals of white enamel with a black dot on the top and bottom.  There are four seed pearls wired to the front of each plaque, one in each corner, with a small rosette of granules in the centre of each side between the pearls.  Each plaque is linked to its neighbour by two long gold wire loops, each with a pearl at its centre.  There is a small loop on the lower edge of the central plaque, for a pendant.  At one end of the necklace there is a loop, and at the other a corresponding hook, for fastening.",
