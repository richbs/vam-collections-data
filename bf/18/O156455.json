Educated at Oxford, Drummond was appointed envoy to the court of Naples in 1801. In 1803 he became ambassador to the Ottoman Porte (Constantinople) and received the Turkish Order of the Crescent, which is shown on the left lapel of his cloak. He also wears the badge for the Neapolitan Order of Saint Januarius, awarded to him upon his return to Naples in 1806.\n\nThis is made up of a variety of hardstones or pietre dure.  Hardstone mosaic techniques emerged in Florence, where Ferdinand de\u2019 Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, founded the Grand Ducal Workshop (Opificio delle Pietre Dure) in 1588. It still operates today under the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
