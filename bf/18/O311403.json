The forward hand may originally have held the shaft of a torch.\n\nFerdinando Tacca (1619-1686) was an Italian sculptor and set designer, son of Pietro Tacca.\nHe completed and erected the equestrian statue of Philip IV in Madrid (1640) and completed the satue of the Grand-Duke Ferdinand I begun by his father for teh Capella dei Principi in Florence. He succeeded his father as Grand-Ducal sculptor in 1642. His principal works are a relief of the Stoning of St. Stephen in Santo Stefano in Florence (1656) and the so-called Fontana del Bacchino at Prato (1659-65).\n\nTriton is a sea-god. He was usually thought to be the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea and Amphritete, the goddess of the sea. A daughter, Pallas, was attributed to him. Usually he is represented with a human upper body and a tail of a fish.",
