They were not production line design, but were among a number of such decorative works, some of which were made as commissions or for special exhibitions.\n\nPart of 44 objects, arranged privately by John Clappison, chief staff designer at Hornsea. The selection was made by John Mallet and Jennifer Opie, most of the ceramics then being housed in John Clappison's garage and cellar, the remainder under his care at the Pottery. In 1986 the Pottery was in some difficulties and Mr. Clappison was then alone in seeing the need to save these examples of the factory's production. The titles given are those used in-house by the factory.",
