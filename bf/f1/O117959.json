The design is drawn on papyrus and shows two nude human figures, one probably representing Orpheus, on a circular black field. The main design is surrounded by a white circle with animals in black, the whole included in a black square with four human heads in reserve filling the spandrels. On the left there is a portion of a narrow border with human and plant forms in reserve on black.\n\nPatterns such as this could be re-employed when required for the production of several garments. They could be combined with others, or individual motifs could be interchanged among them. This might explain the almost exact repetition of certain designs, and partly accounts for the recurrence of certain popular motifs over centuries.",
