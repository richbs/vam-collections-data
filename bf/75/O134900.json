To hold each 'lotus' in place, the linking thread is held in place by blobs of red, blue and brown flecked gold wax.\n[Theatre costume] Headdress in form of a fantastic bird with outstretched wings.  The miniature head and body sit proud of the forehead; the 'plumage' is formed of ovals of gilded leather inset with ovals of green stone; the eyes are of green stone.  Rising from centre front are long narrow strips of frosted acetate painted white to simulate feathers with 'spines' of gold paper and three curlicues of pale gold acetate from which are suspended small coral beads tremblant.  Below the body is a semicircle of gilded paper cut into a sunburst from which hang two gold bead chains ending in miniature lotus buds of acetate and gilded leather with stamens of coral beads.  The wings are three rows of gilded leather with zig-zag edges, the second layer decorated with small square-cut 'emeralds', the third with square-cut simulated 'sapphires'; from behind rise three rows of narrow strips of frosted and black acetate painted to simulate feathers with central 'spines' of gold paper.  Fitted across the 'wings' at either side of the head are two small acetate wings, the feathers outlined in gold cut leather inset with green.  Beneath the gold 'feathers' are lines of wired chalky blue moulded leather 'seed pods'.",

            "public_access_description": "In 1944 designer Oliver Messel was released from his war duties to work on the film Caesar and Cleopatra, adapted from George Bernard Shaw's play. Messel was responsible for the costumes and the interior of the sets, imaginatively interpreting Roman Egyptian dress and decor in the context of the mid 1940s. The film cost over \u00a31 million and brought a welcome sense of extravagance and colour into a drab post-war world.  \n\nVivien Leigh (1913-1967) played the role of Cleopatra. Messel designed a number of wigs for her, each in an instantly recognisable Egyptian style. This wig and headdress are designed to look realistic in close-up but only have details on the parts that show. The head covering, made of blue leather 'lotus' shapes, is not separate but is sewn to the hair to keep it in place and the hair itself is divided into three bunches, one hanging over each shoulder and one down the back, which are covered in black net to prevent them catching on the lotuses.  At the forehead the hair is trimmed but not styled as it is hidden by more lotuses attached to the front of the gold headdress.\n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs, informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
