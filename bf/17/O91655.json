Such cups were frequently used as Welcome Cups, since they were composed of two identical halves and made two goblets when separated. When assembled, it would have been displayed with other grand plate on a buffet. The other half of this cup is in the Osterreichisches Museum fur Angewandte, Kunst Vienna.\nA similar example can be seen in an illustration from the Wilkomm Buch Von Kirchensittenbach, Nuremberg 1593 (Germanisches Nationalmuseum) showing the city architect Wolf Jacob Stromer offering the Wilkomm at the inauguration of the Schloss Kirkensittenbach.\nSee The Gilbert Collection of Gold and Silver, Timothy Schroder, LACMA, 1988, p525 for illustration of Durer\u2019s designs for double cups. Also shown in Jamnitzer catalogue.\nSee Works of Art from the Wernher Collection, Christie\u2019s Sale, London 05 July 2000, p136 (lot 41) for similar example by Andreas Bestreich, Nuremberg, around 1570 and p144 (lot43) for similar example by Paulus Flindt the Elder, Nuremberg, around 1565.\nDent in one lobe.",
