Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the &lt;i&gt;katabori&lt;/i&gt; (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a herdboy sitting on a buffalo.\n\nFrom the 18&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Anraku. The child depicted is Chinese as illustrated by his hairstyle while the based of the netsuke is decorated with a Chinese-style key-fret pattern.",
