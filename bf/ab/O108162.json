It is one of only four surviving gateways. \n\nThis photograph shows the damage inflicted on the wall during the uprising of the Indian army in 1857 (or the 'Indian Mutiny' as it was called by the British). It was through this gateway that British soldiers entered Delhi and suppressed the uprising. Behind the gateway, the lantern and cross of St James's Church is just visible. This was the first church to be built by the British in Delhi.\n\nThe road which runs through the gateway leads to Kashmir, hence the name.  The gateways and the walls which connected them enclosed the city of Shahjahanabad and were built between 1651 and 1658. The wall was about 8 metres high, 4 metres thick and about 5 kilometres long. \n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
