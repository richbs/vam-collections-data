It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nLew Lake (about 1874\u20131939) and Bob Morris (1866\u20131945) started on the halls as stand-up comedians. After they teamed up, they toured music halls for seven years as Nobbler and Jerry in their two-act knockabout sketch \u2018The Bloomsbury Burglars\u2019. This was about the attempted capture of two window cleaners-turned-burglars who break into a house in Bloomsbury to recover some incriminating letters. Lake and Morris later wrote and performed two sequels to this, charting the progress of some of its characters. Lake started \u2018Lew Lake\u2019s Colossal Comedy Company of Comedians\u2019, for which he developed the sketch \u2018The Rib-Nosed Baboon\u2019. This featured 150 \u2018extras\u2019. It shows why the company claimed its \u2018colossal\u2019 status!",

Lake and Morris toured for seven years with their knockabout sketch 'The Bloomsbury Burglars' in which they appeared as Nobbler and Jerry. They later wrote and performed two sequels, charting the progress of some of its characters. Lew Lake first appeared in pantomime as a child at the Britannia Theatre Hoxton, and with Bob Morris also ran a boxing booth at fairs. This caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
