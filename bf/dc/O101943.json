The reviews for Gielgud were ecstatic; it was a sell-out, and made him a star. He was besieged by giggling fans and received white harts \u2013 the emblem of Richard II - in every shape and form, embroidered on handkerchiefs, stamped on cigarette-boxes.\n\nThe mediaeval costumes proved inspirational.The Sketch devoted a  page to a photoshoot of puppets dressed as Gielgud and Ffrangcon-Davies and manipulated into poses from the play, and also produced a faux-medieval fashion spread with Ffrangcon-Davies modelling the two-horned headdress.  The play ran for more than 14 months, including a regional tour. After the last performance in a theatre in Golders Green, the police had to be called to keep back the crowd who surged against the stage door.",
