[See E.2033-1921]. The Museum was to be extended in a similar style, so he scribbled his ideas down on a piece of writing paper, knowing that his draughtsmen in the Museum Design Office would turn its content into this attractive presentation drawing.  Their drawing contains and expands all the information in Cole's sketch, and showed how the proposed chimney for the boiler house, with its spiral exterior staircase, would have formed a distinctive and imaginative landmark. Unfortunately, the Treasury did not approve of more expenditure, and the museum extension was finally built much later, to designs by Sir Aston Webb, and not completed until 1909.",
