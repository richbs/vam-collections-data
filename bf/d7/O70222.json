The chronicle of the abbey describes him as \u2018bonus illuminista\u2019 and as \u2018diversis artibus...instructus\u2019 (\u2018a good illuminator\u2019, skilful in many arts\u2019). He was said to have produced several books, including this missal for Johann von Giltlingen, who was abbot of the monastery between 1482 and 1496. \n\nA missal was a service book containing texts necessary for the performance of the Mass. This missal was a sumptuous manuscript, clearly not produced under constraints of time and expense. The border has a ground of burnished gold on which are conventional sprays of acanthus and stylized flowers in rich blues, reds, ochres and greens. The initial contains a scene showing the three kings (or Magi) presenting their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh at the birth of the infant Jesus. The scene, known as the \u2018Adoration of the Kings\u2019, is one of the iconic images of the life of Jesus. In various examples of the 15th century and later, one of the kings is often shown as a black African ruler. In this image he carries a horn, the usual vessel for frankincense, which represents divinity. Gold and myrrh represent kingship and death. These goods were all part of the ancient trade with Arabia and Africa.",
