The intricate pleating across the bodice here is an example of a construction technique that Dess\u00e8s favoured both for early evening and formal occasions. Although the bodice appears to be soft and unstructured, it is supported by the sewn-in boning common at the time. Dess\u00e8s's early evening wear used a subtle palette of creams, beiges and pale pinks, but he later introduced vibrant reds as in this example.",

A strapless red evening dress form around 1953 highlights Dess\u00e8s' virtuoso pleating.  The skirt's delicate drapery envelopes the wearer in softly gathered swags, and a long tie crosses over at the neck, falling to the back.  The intricate pleating across the bodice is an example of the construction technique Dess\u00e8s favoured for both early evening and formal occasions.
