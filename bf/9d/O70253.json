In the early 17th century there was no established custom of using plates, knives and forks as we know them. Even wooden plates and drinking vessels (now almost entirely disappeared) were still in common use.\n\nTrading\nTrade between England (especially East Anglia where this bowl was excavated) and The Netherlands was thriving at this period, at least until the Dutch Wars towards the end of the 17th century.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAfter potters from the Low Countries had established themselves in London in the early 17th century, the import of tin-glazed earthenware rapidly declined. There was, however, no existing native English slipware tradition to compete with these little bowls with their crudely slip-trailed animal designs. Demand continued therefore until the technique was taken up and refined by the potters of Staffordshire in the mid-17th century.",
