The body of the puppet is made of more crudely formed blocks of wood (where the costume covers these) and more detailed solid wooden moulded and flesh coloured painted hands and head. All joints can be articulated through metal joints made with hook screws on the arms and small metal plate insets on leg joints. The feet are made of small wooden cylinders and are painted white.\nThe Duchess' face has made of a solid moulded and carved wood and has been painted  as a caricature with over emphasised lips nose and red cheeks . She wears an elaborate padded and decorated headress made of red and blue fabric with a lace detail overlay and the remnants of what appears to be a train / veil. Her dress is made from a machine printed fabric in cream and two shades of blue and has a small repeating diamond pattern. The dress has a train made of a different floral fabric.\n\nThe duchess has lost most of her original strings  with only one in her back and one on her right arm remaining. Thin cotton has been strung to the sides of the head.There are drilled holes in the hands where operational strings would have been attached.",

From 1947 to the closure of the business in 1993 they made thousands of different characters and ranges of puppets for children including hand and marionette varieties.\nPelham puppets used simple construction methods, materials and influences that reflected the decades in which they were made. Pelham puppets often took influence from popular fairy tales and stories for their puppets. This particular puppet depicts the Duchess, one of the many odd characters taken from Lewis Caroll's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.",
