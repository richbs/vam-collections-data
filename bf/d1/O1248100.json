Part of the \u2018Heritage Collection\u2019 they were inspired by David Morris\u2019s \u2018flexi ring\u2019 of the early 1960s, and were designed in 2012 to celebrate the company\u2019s fiftieth anniversary. In addition to the large diamonds spaced down the centre of the earrings, the surface of the white gold glitters subtly with a fine dusting of diamonds. This effect, termed 'micro-set' by David Morris, owes its success to the precision and density with which these tiny diamonds are set.\n\nDavid Morris, founded in 1962, achieved rapid recognition with two Diamonds International Awards in the early 1960s. A different glamour was reflected in the commissions of jewellery for James Bond films. The company remains a family concern and in addition to London now has stores in Moscow, Dubai and Hong Kong.",
