In this print, a plump baby is shown with an hourglass on the left, and on the right, a skeleton climbs out of a coffin, accompanied by a broken hourglass. The ages are shown here on steps, leading up to the peak of middle age, and then downwards toward the grave. The suitably moral text is in four languages. This image, with updated costumes, was still in use in the early 1800s.",
