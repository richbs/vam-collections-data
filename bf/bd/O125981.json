He had been born in Guangdong, and lived in a village near the Fujian border, near to villages inhabited by 'Teochew' (Chaozhou) speakers, noted in the late imperial period as tea connoisseurs. Mrs Keays' grandfather was a trader, travelling in Guangdong and Fujian provinces. She writes (letters in RP dated 13th June 1990):\n'My grandfather used to entertain his guests with endless rounds of Oolong tea from tiny porcelain cups, infused in his Yixing teapot. Only now I realise my grandfather and his friends were the masters of the old school who believed they could appreciate Fujian teas better than the Hokkiens who grew them.'",

However given that the pot is dated to 1850-1900, the inscribed signature is more symbolic than indicative of the identity of the potter.",
