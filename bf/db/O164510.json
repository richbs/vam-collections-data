Hering significantly changed Baldung Green's interpretation of the Fall in the woodcut. In the present relief Adam is gazing slightly upwards instead of looking at the spectator and places his hand below Eve's breast, rather than delicately touching it as in the woodcut. Here Adam and Eve seem to be in communion, whereas in the woodcut Adam seems to present Eve to the spectator.",
