The distinctive metallic ground was created using bismuth (a lead-grey lustrous material that looks silvery when polished), which gave the painters their name - wismutmalerei, from at least 1511. Inside the box are various painted drawers behind the sliding front.\n\nVarious similar boxes survive decorated with flowers, fruits and symbols of romantic love. Some also depict Biblical scenes, in this example the story of David and Bathsheba (recorded in 2 Samuel chapter 11) is coupled with admonitory verses. Such a scene adds a moral and religious dimension in an object that was probably given to mark a courtship or betrothal.",

The technique is found mostly on small decorative caskets and beech (fagus) boxes, and occasionally on wooden plates and altars. The lids of the boxes show figurative scenes from the Old and New Testaments with couples dressed in traditional sixteenth-century clothing. The remaining surface areas are filled with schematic leaf ornamentation or dense designs of flowers, fruits, and symbols of betrothal and marriage. A number of the boxes that have been examined have inscriptions, and approximately forty are dated. The first boxes appear to have been produced about 1490; however, it was not until 1613 that the governing council of the city of Nuremberg formed an official guild of bismuth painters.' p.166\n\nBismuth is a brittle metal ranging from silver-white to a reddish hue, which is found in the cobalt and nickel mines of Saxony, England and Bolivia, among others. The metal can be pulverized, and oxidizes under humid conditions, changing its warm silvery and blue-red irridescent hue to a dark grey, matte finish.\n\nMicrochemical analysis shows that a ground of two to four layers of glue and chalk was applied to the beech which had been soaked with glue. Bismuth podwer combined with gum arabic is applied to the chalk ground, polished with an agate and usually coated with a transparent layer. Paint layers applied over the bismuth were generally coated with a second varnish. One or both of the varnish layers may have been stained, perhaps to appear gold. Various coloured pigments were used including azurite, vermillion, saturn red, lead white and copper green. There is evidence that a gilded or silvered ground for the painting was also used alongside bismuth on the same boxes.",
