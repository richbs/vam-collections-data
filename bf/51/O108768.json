With his oversized boots, white socks and black tights, the professor spawned a number of impersonators including the comic John Cleese whose 'Ministry of Silly Walks' sketch was inspired by Max Wall. \n\nMax Wall, or Maxwell Lorrimer, born in Brixton, London, was the son of the music hall performers Jock Lorimer ('the Hielan' Laddie', an eccentric dancer) and Stella Stahl, and grew up watching the great Variety stars of the day including George Robey, Harry Lauder, Billy Bennett and Little Tich.  He made his first stage appearance as a kilt-wearing two year old in his parents' act and went on to appear in the West End in the 1920s and 1930s as a dancer known as: 'The Boy with the Obedient Feet'. He gradually introduced comic patter into his act and lbecame known as a comedian. His career spanned nearly seventy years and included playing the role of the comedian Archie Rice in John Osborne's 1974 production of The Entertainer at Greenwich Theatre.",
