Harlequin Tam O'Shanter was based on Robert Burns's famous poem and the inebriated ride that Tam O'Shanter makes on his horse Meg when he is terrified by the witches of Alloway Kirk, and Meg loses her tail.  Fairy Thistledown was clearly a character added for fun, along with Harlequin and other pantomime characters, and although one of the more unusual subjects for a 19th century pantomime, it would have presented ample opportunity for a display of skilled and comic riding.\n\nThe managers of Atley's circus were always keen to make the most of their advertising and the possibilities offered by new typefaces and cheaper paper.  Developments in printing and paper manufacture meant that playbills and posters increased enormously in size in the first half of the 19th century, and Astley's advertising frequently used coloured inks and engraved images to make their advertisements stand out from the crowd.",
