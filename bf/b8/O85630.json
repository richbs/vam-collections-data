Two orange flowers on leafy stems are painted in the two lower corners on a vastly smaller scale.  The main iris flower has petals with a white ground and washes of blue and beige with purple hatched detailing.  The stamens of the flower are shown in yellow, and the stalks and leaves are painted in a pale green colour with darker green hatched detailing.\n      The painting is framed with strips of buff-coloured paper , outlined in black on both sides with a further two ruled black lines on the main ivory-coloured border.  The page has strips of blue-grey paper stuck along its margins with two ruled black lines on its inner edges.  The left-hand side shows the remnants of a beige-coloured paper strip stuck on top of the blue-grey margin, over which a woven textile strip has been added as a gutter for the present binding of the album.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
