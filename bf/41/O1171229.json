It shows three images, two of shepherds in different poses and the third an additional image of a coat. The first image is on the top left hand side and shows a man dressed in an earthy brown jacket and knee breeches over a double breasted fawn coloured waistcoat. He is also wearing a pale red cap, pale fawn coloured stockings and shoes and smoking a pipe. In his right hand (which is gloved) he is carrying a wooden staff. On the left hand side is a further image of a shepherd in a heavy brown coat, blue wide brimmed hat, trousers and gaiters. Over his left shoulder he carries a plain bag and in his left hand (again gloved) he carries the same stout staff. Below this second image is a detail of the coat, showing the four pockets (two on each side) and fastened with a central row of three fabric toggles. The design is signed and dated 1905.",

During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert and Sullivan productions.\n\nThe Prodigal Son was written by Hall Caine and featured incidental music composed and arranged by J.M. Glover. The action in the original text was set mainly in Iceland but a 1906 revival changed the setting to Sicily which created the opportunity for a dramatic eruption of Mount Etna in the final act.\n\nThis design comes from a collection of costume designs, some of which are costumier's copies, which were originally part of the Archives of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.",
