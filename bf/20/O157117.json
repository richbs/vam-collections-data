Using purely abstract, geometric forms, \u2018Op\u2019 artists sought to create patterns which affected the optic nerves to induce sensations of movement or to suggest an intricate three-dimensional perspective on what was in reality a still flat surface.\n\nIn her early work Riley frequently used black and white or monochrome to achieve these effects. Often she produced a series of images relating to a single theme.  In the suite of three prints, \u2018Coloured Greys\u2019, her use of colour is muted and subtle, but integral to the effect of light and movement, which appears to be related to the colour and movement of the sea.",
