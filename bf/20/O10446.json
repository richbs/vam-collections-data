All the outside edges of the stays are bound with pink silk grosgrain ribbon.  The sleeves are made separately and laced into the armholes with pink silk ribbons and points of tinned iron.  There is a band of back-stitched embroidery at the neckline and armholes and a line of couched thread at the waist.  The separate busk is boned vertically and horizontally, at the top, and completely bound with pink silk grosgrain ribbon.\n[Stays] These front lacing pink silk stays have a high back cutting across the top of the shoulders,  with a decolletage and a long pointed waist in front.  Below the waist there are 11 boned tabs with silk gussets between them.  The stays consist of three shaped pieces on each front, two side back pieces and two centre back pieces.  The shoulder straps, each with an eyelet, extend from the back and attach with a ribbon through an eyelet on the front.  The sleeves are wide and cut straight, extending to below the elbow.  They attach to the corset with three ribbons each  through thread eyelets.  Four ribbons decorate the centre back tab.  The stays are backed with linen and stitched with pink silk thread to make compartments of 4 to 5 mm width for the whalebone.  Above the boning at the front, the fabric is reinforced with decorative stitching.  The seams are reinforced with cross stitch and covered on the right side with pink silk grosgrain ribbon.  The upper and lower edges of the stays are edged with pink silk grosgrain ribbon, as is the armhole.  At the lower edge, there is a pink and green silk grosgrain ribbon underneath the pink one.  The sleeves are lined with pink silk taffeta.  The thread eyelets are made with buttonhole stitch.  The ribbons are made of pink silk taffeta and retain their original tinned iron points.\n[Busk] The pink silk busk is in the form of a curved 'T', edged with pink ribbon.  It is made of pink watered silk backed with linen and stitched with pink silk thread into 40 compartments for the whalebone, running vertically.  The centre bone is 8mm wide with two of 7mm either side, alternating with strips of 4mm wide.  The lengthwise boning ends 3.5 cm from the top edge, which area is filled with 7horizontal  compartments of  whaleboning.  The busk is edged with pink silk grosgrain ribbon",

            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nStays (a stiff corset) were essential garments in the fashionable woman's wardrobe throughout the 17th century.  Some sort of stiffening of a woman's gown had been part of dress construction since the early 16th century. Sometimes it was added to the outer bodice; sometimes it was in the form of separate stays worn under the gown.  Originally the stiffening served the purpose of preventing the expensive and elaborately decorated fabric of the gown from wrinkling.  However, because stays could mould the female torso, they became essential for producing whatever shape was considered fashionable.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe stays are made by hand-stitching the watered silk to a layer of linen in long narrow pockets. Thin strips of whalebone are inserted into the pockets to give the stays their shape. Whalebone is in fact not bone, but cartilage from the mouth of the baleen whale. It grows in large sheets in the mouth of the whale and serves as a kind of sieve to filter out tiny krill, the whale's primary source of food, from the seawater. Commercial whaling began in the early 17th century in the North Sea and quickly spread to the waters around Greenland and eventually to the Bering Seas as the whales were hunted almost to extinction. Baleen was used for women's stays and hoops as well as a wide variety of other items such as riding crops, whips, brushes, chair backs and bottoms, carriage springs and fishing rods. Whale blubber was rendered into oil and used for lighting.  Whalebone  was the preferred stiffener for stays because it was firm enough to hold the shape, yet flexible enough not to break when the wearer moved. The ribbons retain their original points, the narrow metal clamps at the ends. They prevent the ribbon from unravelling and help to thread it through the lacing holes.  The points are made of tinned iron; normally they  would have rusted away.\n\n",
