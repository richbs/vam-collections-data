Narrow borders of eight-pointed flowers within a running guilloche between dogstooth enclose a wide border of quatrefoil motifs arranged in a lattice. The underside of the leaves is plain, with four double-bands of pale wood stringing, centred on a circle with a blank shield. Repeated around the edges is a 4-pointed star (bone).\n\nOn both faces of the four legs and on the outer face of the stretchers is a running six-pointed star (bone) within an S-scroll double stringing in pale wood. On both sides of the legs and the top side of the lower stretchers is a dogstoot (bone) between twin bands of stringing in pale wood. \n\nConstruction\nThe trestles formed from four, square profile solid legs joined by rectangular-profile stretchers at both ends, and with a pin hinge at the mid-point of the legs. The stretchers are presumably tenoned to the legs. Two iron chains (of 13 long links) are fixed to one upper stretcher on rings, any link of the chain fitting over an iron hook in the opposite upper stretcher, so as to secure the trestle open and adjust the table height. The two hooks and rings are driven through the stretchers and the split ends bent over.\n\nThe two table leaves are joined by three iron 'butterly' form hinges (each held on 6 iron rivets) that fold 180 degrees. Each leaf is of breadboard construction, presumably with two or three long butted planks braced at both ends by a mitred cross-piece that is joined to the leaf at a long loose(?) tenon. Eigt iron strap reinforcers (one missing) are nailed around the corners of both panels.\n\nThe inlay decoration is created with individual tesserae of box, rosewood and bone inset into the walnut matrix wood.",

A pair of folding leaves, of walnut wood, on trestles of wood, and ornamented with guilloche and stellated patterns in ivory.    Italian.    Early 16th century.    W. when open 3 ft. \u00bc in., L. 5 ft. \u00bd in., H. 2 ft. 7 \u00bd in. Bought, 44l. \n\n\tThe table is of Certosino inlaid work in a series of wide and narrow borders. It is a slab in two leaves hinged down the middle, and fastened to a pair of trestles, like those that support modern dinner trays, held by a chain from separating too widely. By tightening the chain, which is hooked by any link desired to a pin in the top frame, the height can be regulated. The top of the table is inlaid with a great feeling for propriety, in patterns composed of diamonds and square dies of ivory. These are arranged in stars or flowers down the middle of each plank. They form larger spots, set in smaller work so as to contrast the breadth of the evenly distributed work with these salient points. The centre again is formed into a sort of panel by fine lines of holly, box, or other white wood. The edges are also inlaid. Everything in the effectiveness of mere geometrical inlay on this small scale depends on the different contrasts thus presented, and on the proportion between large single ornaments and masses of small ornament collected into flat spaces to give relief and repose. The monotony of the latter is both rich and broad when thus associated, and the stars or patterns are effectively set off. The leaves can be removed, as was not uncommonly done at great entertainments in the middle ages and 16th century, when dinner or supper was ended and the guests were invited to take part in the dances and pageants that followed.\nBurns, Fairburn and Boucher.

I suspect that the table top and  possibly the trestles also have been so dealt with but of course I may be mistaken. Had this marquetry been old I think we should have found it associated with a better class of cabinet-maker's work. It is possible that if the whole is old the price is moderate - but if my suspicion is correct the value would be depreciated fully one half.\nM. Digby Wyatt\nFeb 2 1869\"",

            "historical_context_note": "Folding tables, due to their versatility and ingenious design which allowed them to be easily moved, were extremely popular items of furniture, but rarely survive. Ideally suited for informal meals both indoors or outdoors, or as a support to table games, this example combines practicality with the refinement of its inlaid decoration.\n\nThe removeable, hinged top could of course be placed either way up on the trestle - either to show off the intricate inlaid top, or the plain side for more practical purposes, when it might also be covered with a cloth.\n\nA folding or demountable table was apparently known in Renaissance Italy as '<i>tavola da campo</i>' or '<i>tavola da campagna</i>' (countryside table). They were used while travelling or during military campaigns, but also at home and by women. In the Medici inventory 1553, Eleanora da Toledo is recorded as having had two, <i>una tavoletta da campo con sua piedi </i>(a small camp  table with its legs), recorded in her favourite room in Palazzo Vecchio, and another with legs of walnut <i>con sue catene</i> (with its chains), possibly similar to this table (236-1869). \nQuoted in P.K.Thornton, The Italian Renaissance Interior 1400-1600 (London 1991), p.214.\n\nFausto Calderai and Simone Chiarugi note that \"It is generally thought that this technique and type of decoration was most popular during the fifteenth century in the Veneto, due to the popularity of Islamic goods in this region. In fact, demand for these objects continued into the sixteenth century, both in central and northern Italy including Genoa. Objects with intarsia in the same style have been attributed with certainty to this city, which was particularly receptive to the influence of contemporary Spanish furniture.\"",
