This design was made for the pantomime, Cinderella, at the London Palladium, 21 December 1976. The production was directed by Albert J. Knight. The Ugly Sisters, here called Mildred and Georgina Hardup, were played by Yootha Joyce (Mildred) and Brian Murphy (Georgina). The names derive from the actors' roles in the popular television situation-comedy, George and Mildred, in which they played husband and wife.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of pantomime costume design of the second half of the 20th century and of the work of a designer who specialised in pantomime and variety design. It is also an example of a design for a pantomime dame and illustrates a feature of pantomime in the 20th century: the employment of television stars in leading roles.",
