            "public_access_description": "Public interest in the 1868 Abyssinian (Ethiopian) expedition by British forces extended to individuals associated with the conflict on both sides. In particular, the figures of the orphaned Abyssinian prince Alamayou and his striking guardian, the six foot five, flame-haired and bearded Captain Tristram Charles Sawyer Speedy, caught the public imagination. Julia Margaret Cameron photographed both at her private studio on the Isle of Wight later the same year.\n\nSpeedy was an army officer and colonial official. After an earlier visit to Abyssinia to assist the emperor Tewodros II (Theodore) with military training, Speedy returned as civilian interpreter to the expedition. Speedy felt a strong affinity with the Abyssinian people; he learnt Amharic and adopted native dress. In this image, using props he probably supplied, Speedy is made to appear every bit the Abyssinian warrior, in native dress with his spear poised above an unidentified black man who holds a shield. The name given to Speedy by Tewodros - B\u00e1sh\u00e1 F\u00e9l\u00edka \u2013 meaning \u2018speedy\u2019 or \u2018lightening\u2019 has been included in the photograph\u2019s caption.",
