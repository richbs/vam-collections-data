            "public_access_description": "Author\u2019s name correctly: Nagy, G\u00e1bor Tam\u00e1s [one person, double first name]\nThis poster is a typical example of the FIDESZ (The Alliance of Young Democrats) electoral campaign in 1990 which was characterised by spontaneity and informality. The local electoral offices worked independently from the party\u2019s headquarters and often used ideas from non professionals in their graphic materials. In this case the author of the poster is the young candidate himself.\n\nAn important element of party\u2019s identity is the the graffitti-like lettering of the name FIDESZ (Fiatal Demokrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge/Alliance of Young Democrats). FIDESZ sounds like the Latin word \u2019fides\u2019 (trust). This association is made explicit in the poster through the inclusion of a dictionary entry in the design. The slogan \u2018itt \u00e9s m\u00e1st\u2019 (here and different) provides a further verbal pun recalling the phrase \u2018itt \u00e9s most\u2019 (here and now). \n\nThe colour orange was another fundamental element of the party\u2019s graphic identity.  Orange recalls the expression \u2018Hungarian orange\u2019 from Peter Bacso\u2019s film \u2018A tan\u00fa\u2019 (The Witness, 1969) that criticised the anomalies of the communist regime in the nineteen fifties.  One of the lines from this extremely popular tragi-comedy rapidly became a catchphrase in Hungary: \u2019it is little bit yellow and a little bit sour, but it\u2019s ours\u2019. In this phrase, people saw the essence of life under communism aptly formulated. Magyar Narancs (Hungarian Orange) was the title of a newspaper, founded 1989 by young publicists, several of whom became active members of FIDESZ.  Another point of reference was the Polish opposition movement \u2018Orange Alternative\u2019.",
