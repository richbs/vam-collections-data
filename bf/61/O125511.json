            "history_note": "Given by R. Clarke Edwards, 1918\n\n\nEdward Barton Shuldham was born around 1835. He studied medicine at Trinity College, Dublin and, after qualifying as a doctor, practised medicine in England. He subsequently converted to homeopathy and, following this change, he became a member of the British Homeopathic Society, worked at the Maidstone Homeopathic Dispensary, and became a physician at the St. James Homeopathic Hospital, Doncaster. He also frequently lectured in public on the subject of homeopathy and became the editor of <i>The Homeopathic World</i>. Among examples of his published works are <i>Clergyman\u2019s Sore Throat</i> (1878) and <i>The family homoeopathist; or, Plain directions for the treatment of disease</i> (1883). His interests were not, however, confined solely to medicine and homeopathy. Shuldham lectured and wrote on other subjects such as art. He also wrote poetry and frequently painted. A good example of the diverse nature of Shuldham\u2019s interests is <i>Pictures from Birdland</i> which combined poetry written by Shuldham with artwork provided by his twin nephews. His nephews, Charles Maurice Detmold and Julius Edward Detmold were born 21 November 1883 and, as their father was ill, they were given to their uncle\u2019s care and were raised by him in Hampstead. The pair were to become well regarded illustrators and etchers. Shuldham encouraged them to pursue their artistic leanings by drawing animals and plants from an early age. They sketched animals at London zoo when they were as young as five and also later spent six months studying drawing at the Hampstead Conservatoire. At the age of thirteen they made their debut at the Royal Academy, drawing interest from notable artists, such as Burne-Jones. The pair frequently collaborated until Maurice\u2019s suicide in 1908. Examples of their work include <i>Pictures from Birdland</i> (1899) and an illustrated edition of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s <i>Jungle Book</i> (1903).\n\n<i>Landscape</i> by Shuldham is painted in a sketchy manner and appears to have been executed rapidly. The painting depicts an overgrown garden or field, and despite the presence of a red-roofed cottage in the background, which is suggestive of habitation, it feels profoundly rural owing to the wildness and encroaching nature of the foliage. In a letter dated 13th August 1918 the donor, R. Clarke Edwards, wrote that this painting \u2018was one much admired by the late Sir Charles Holyroyd\u2019 (Director of the National Gallery). He added that \u2018Dr. Shuldham is also an old friend of mine and still amongst the living and now, although over 80 years of age is still producing very good work.\u2019 On the back of the panel there is another similar landscape.",
