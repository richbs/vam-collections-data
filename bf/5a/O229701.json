The factory was a important landmark in industrial architecture because the concept paid particular attention to providing amenities for employees in addition to taking into account the client's need for flexibility. Its rural setting on the River Avon at Bath was carefully considered when designing a building for this sensitive context.\n\nThe structure of the building was based around a simple primary and secondary beam system with columns on a 10x20 metre grid. The height of the edifice enabled it to be used for storing pallets as well as accomodating manufacturing processes. The cladding system was designed so as to be completely demountable, enabling the panels and glazing to be interchanged by unskilled labour to allow the staff to alter the building to suit changing needs.\n\nMany of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and the design of this building made attempts to reflect this. Energy conservation was a prime consideration throughout Grimshaw's design process and the low wall/floor ratio of 1:30 combined with insulation contributed to the low running costs.",
