It was then folded in half and the top firmly stitched to form a tail or tassel, which probably hung downwards at the back of the head. The lower edge of the cap would have been worn on the forehead or brow and at the back of the cap the loops were left when it was removed from the frame.\n\nLinen sprang caps were exclusively produced with open patterns, and sometimes combined with decorative coloured threads of wool. They enjoyed widespread popularity in Egypt but are less frequently preserved due to the combination of the fibres.",
