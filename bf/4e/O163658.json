The sixth panel is only gathered at the front sides, leaving a 25 cm wide flat panel at the front, in which is a cartouche panel of pulled thread work at eye level decorated with a row of chevrons and zigzags and stylised plant motifs. From 25 cm below the skull cap, the front panel is split to the hem and a wide triangular piece 40.5 cm deep is inserted. Below this the garment is open.\n\nThe embroidery is confined to the skull cap and to the triangular insertion, apart from some small sprigs round the pulled fabric panels. The skull cap is divided into concentric circles containing floral sprigs followed by a broken zigzag with floral sprigs in between. This is followed by a band of leaves in double running and pulled thread work. The pieced triangular panel contains two small botehs and three stylised cypress trees with birds and a border of floral sprigs. In addition, on either side of the main cypress trees is an elongated form which might be a fish.",
