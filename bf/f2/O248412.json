A flat shallow box slightly narrowing towards one end, which is rounded and communicates by a hole with the inside of a cockle-shell carved in the round; there is a narrow ridge down the centre and the edge is rebated to receive the metal grater (missing). To the wider end is hinged the flat cover; the exterior of this is carved with a shaped panel representing Hercules draped in the skin of the Nemean lion striking with a club at the rearing Hydra on the left. Above this panel is a rosette between two monsters composed of an eagel's head joined to a dolphin's tail; below it is a symmetrical design, consisting of a scallop-shell, a vase of fruit and scrolling acanthus leaves.",

Above this panel is a rosette between two monsters composed of an eagle's head joined to a dolphin's tail. \nA snuff rasp was used like a nutmeg grater for grating dried tobacco into snuff.  A perforated metal section was fixed inside the ivory cover for grating. Snuff taking was a popular pastime in France for the wealthy and fashionable. There was the rumour that a regular dose of snuff would protect against the plague. The tobacco was grated from the solid tobacco roll known as a \"carotte\".\nThe ivory carving on these rasps is often rather crude, while the subjects depicted, often mythological figures, or exotic ladies, are typical of decorative objects made from a rare and costly material to be sold as lucury good.",
