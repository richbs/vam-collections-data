Some of the scripts look 18th-century, so it may have served this purpose from the start.\n\nFrom the paper catalogue:\nThe curriculum suggests that the table was used in a boy's school. But it is reasonable to suppose that a table of such elegance was made for and used in a private house, where it was used as a 'schoolroom' or 'study' table by a family of boys. \nThat this house was Barton Hall, Suffolk, seems to be shown by the three following inscriptions:\n1. 'BUNBURY': an owners mark\n2. 'C. J. F. Bunbury': rare triple initials found in this family pedigree\n3. 'R. H. Bunbury'/'Novemger 26' with a year likely to be '1826'\nThe father of these two boys, Lieut. General Sir Henry E. Edward Bunbury, K. C. B., 7th Baronet (succeeded 1821) of Barton Hall, Mildenhall Suffolk, who bwas born 4th May 1778, and died 13th April 1860, was the second son of the amateur artist and caricaturist Henry William Bunbury (1750-1811), friend of Garrick, Goldsmith and Reynolds.",
