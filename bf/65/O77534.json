The grooves were then filled  with ink and the image was transferred onto a blank sheet of paper. \n\nDesign\nThe concept of a crayfish, reeds and a shell-like motif was copied from a design by Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier that was published in 1734 in a collection of designs entitled Livre de L\u00e9gumes.\n\nPrints like this, with naturalistic plants and animals arranged ornamentally, had a strong influence on British Rococo porcelain and silver design. In fact, a silver salt cellar in the form of a crayfish, probably based on this print, was produced in 1742-1743 by the silversmith, designer and porcelain manufacturer Nicolas Sprimont. The design of the salt cellar was then repeated in porcelain at Sprimont's Chelsea porcelain factory (see museum no. C.73-1938).\n\nPeople\nJuste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier was a versatile and inventive designer, producing designs for a wide range of items, from table-wares and clocks to firework displays and buildings. He is an important figure in the history of the Rococo style, introducing asymmetry and picturesque irregularity through designs such as this.",

First published Paris, 1801. Later editions 1812, 1827 and 1843.\n\nEtching and engraving. Size of volume 45 x 32 cm\n29564.10; 29564.16\n\nPercier and Fontaine stated in the introduction that their aim was not to provide the public with  models to imitate: 'Our ambition would be satisfied if we could flatter ourselves to have collaborated to spread and to uphold in a matter as variable, as swayed by changes of opinion and of whim, the principles of taste that we have drawn from antiquity, and which we believe linked, although by a scarcely visible chain, to general rules of truth, simplicity and beauty...'.\n\nOne of these rules concerned the suitability of a piece of furniture for its use: 'Among all the forms of a chair, there are some which are dictated by the shape of our body, by the demands of necessity or of comfort ... What is there that art could add? It should purify the forms dictated by convenience and combine them with the simplest outlines, giving rise from those natural conditions to ornamental motifs which would be adapted to the basic form without ever disguising nature'. They went on to say how often they have seen ornament applied to different parts of furniture so that it took the place of the part itself. But the furniture they drew is to our present view so encrusted with ornament and its forms so twisted by fashionable configurations that it belies their fastidious strictures. Concepts of purified form, simple outline and the adaptation of ornament to use have substantially changed in the intervening 170 years or so since the book was published.\n\nSL'",
