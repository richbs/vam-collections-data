The following is the full text of the entry: FONTANA, CARLO (1634-1714) 1006 Designs (2 on 2 sheets pasted together) for the sides (at ground level) of the Emperor Leopold I\u2019s catafalque in S. Maria dell\u2019Anima, Rome E.217 inscribed with a scale Pen and ink and wash 17 x 12 \u00bd (432 x 318) E.218-1969 [the other related drawing: E.217-1969] PROVENANCE The same as no. 1003 [E.216-1969] [Dr. W. M\u00fcseler (whose name is stamped in ink on some of the pages in the album; bought 1969] LITERATURE Braham, pl. 10 [Allan Braham, <i>Funeral decorations in early eighteenth century Rome</i> (Victoria and Albert Museum Brochure no. 7)] Mounted in the same album as no. 1003 [E.216-1969] and connected with the same scheme of decoration. The drawings show the north and south sides of the catafalque, which were slightly different from the east and west sides shown in no. 1003 [E.216-1969]. The battle-piece shown in no. 1005 is studied again in no. 1008 [E.220-1969]. Posterla's account of the decorations corresponds fairly closely with these two designs and may be paraphrased as follows: 'Two putti were seated there, modelled in stucco, covered with a veil, 7 palms high, holding the lictorean fasces, the usual symbols of Justice. Beneath their feet were various Turkish flags, bent towards the ground and trampled on, with two great silver moons inscribed with mottoes proclaiming the defeat of the Turkish crescent, and four large drums similarly inscribed'. The crescent moons are easy to see in the drawing, but less visible in a reproduction. There are more designs in the Windsor volume for this part of the catafalque, notably nos. 9843, 9854, 9852 and 9844.",
