He exhibited at the Salon in Paris and at the Royal Academy in London between 1857 and 1874.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Bonheur's oeuvre and of 19th-century Realist paintings which favours the depiction of rural subject matters resulting from the direct observation of nature. This trend emerged in France in the 1840s in the works of Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875). The present scene was probably inspired by the scenery around the Scottish lakes Bonheur visited during in the 1860s.",

The highland depicted here was probably inspired by the Scottish lakes Bonheur visited in the 1860s. \nTypical of the Realist movement emerged in the 1840s in France is the interest in rural society and the rendering of light, here the sunset light subtly reflecting on the cows' massive bodies. The subject matter is reminiscent of 17th-century Dutch paintings such as Karel Dujardin's \u0153uvre (c. 1622-1678) but also results from the revived interest in direct observation of nature. It was nevertheless probably also bolstered by his sister's success in this field.  Bonheur's refined and detailed brushwork differs somehow from the broad manner developed by the Barbizon painters. \nBonheur specialised in the depiction of cattle set in landscapes and similar works include <i>Le retour de la foire</i>, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux while a similar pastoral scene was sold at Christie's New-York 19 April 2006, lot 204.\nSuch landscape paintings were particularly fashionable during the 19th century and some pre-Raphaelites painters such as William Holman Hunt also produced similar works, notably <i>Our English Coasts</i>, 1852, in the Tate Britain, London.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
