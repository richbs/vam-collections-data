This house was built between 1728 and 1732 by William (Harberry?) from designs by James Gibbs.  They form part of a large number of panels which until the late 19th century were erected (?) in the saloon at Kelmarsh Hall.  In view, however, of their earlier date, they must have come from the earlier house which was demolished when the present one was erected.  \n\nThe carvings were sold to Messrs Oliver of Guildford by the agents of Col. Lancaster, present owner of the house whose father purchased it in 1902.  See Country Life Vol. 73 p.198/203\".\n\nFurther note\n\"A quantity of the carving is illustrated in Messrs Olivers' advertisement in the (?) Nov. 1956 pp.VIII/X .  R Tree 123 E.79th St. N.Y.\"\n\n11/10/56 W.A.J. notes\n\"we want the highest moral quality or first-class documentation for authorship\" and questions whether they are sufficiently higher in quality than the Scott swags (W12-1954) to be worth \u00a3250, and he suggests considering the animal carvings instead.  This suggestion is not taken up \"I think the carvings of pendent decorations, which we chose, will be an agreeable accession to our collection, although I agree I over-estimated their quality and importance in the first place\"\n\nThe following note on file may refer to the animal carvings?\nTheir authenticity is further questioned by (?) whose hand written notes state \"I am pretty\u2026 certain that they are of the date of the reassembly of this piece - mid 19th century perhaps German & of very good relative quality\".  He recommends that the situation had better remain as it was.  \"I think Oliver was himself reasonably convinced of their authenticity & had they been Gibbons they might have been artfully interesting as (life sized?).\n\n8/1/57 Draft letter Hayward to Col. Lancaster\nrefers to the recent acquisition of \"two pendants of limewood carved in the manner of Grinling Gibbons and apparently dating from the late 17th or early 18th century, though now applied to oak panels of later date\u2026..The carving is said to have been removed from the Saloon (at Kelmarsh Hall) some 50 years ago and to have been stored since that date..\"  He refers to the Country Life article and enquires \"whether you have anything of this series of carved pendants and swags, and \u2026.whether any of the carving was in situ when you took the house\".  He notes \"it is of course possible that the whole story of the provenance from Kelmarsh Hall is a fiction.  As the carvings appear to date from about 1700, they can hardly have been made for Kelmarsh Hall which was not erected until 1728-1732.\n\n18/1/57 Further note\n\"Col. Lancaster telephoned 18/1/57 to say that the carvings were installed by Lord Bateman about 1820.  It was not known where he had acquired them.\"",
