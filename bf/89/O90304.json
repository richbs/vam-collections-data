This site dates from the 8th to the 10th century AD and is part of an area of Central Asia now referred to as the Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia, from China to Europe. The most notable item traded was silk. Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed their goods from oasis to oasis. The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas \u2013 while silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in this way.\nThese fragments were brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862\u20131943). The Victoria and Albert Museum has around 700 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein at the beginning of the twentieth century. The textiles range in date from the second century BC to the twelfth century AD. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals.",

It was one of several oasis towns which flourished at the southern edge of the Talamakan Desert, in what was once Kingdom of Khotan. Here Stein excavated the remains of a Buddhist temple and found \nartefacts bearing Sanskrit and other Indian scripts, including an Indian pothi, or religious book, and a wooden tablet. He also unearthed fragments of stucco Buddha heads and elaborate wall paintings, which were similar in style to pieces he had found at the nearby shrines of Khadalik and Dandan-oilik. He concluded that Darabzandong had been occupied at the same time, from the eight until the tenth century AD, when the surrounding land dried out and all three sites were abandoned. The V&A holds from Darabzandong fragments of a string shoe.",
