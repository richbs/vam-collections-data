The top of the table is edged with gilt-bonze and the top surface is set with three boulle panels showing symmetrical scrolls, terms and squirrels, these panels probably originally made wither for a small tripod table or for a large box in about 1690-1710.",

It was first popularised at the end of the 17th century by the French cabinetmaker Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle, but the technique was revived again in the 18th and 19th centuries. Old boulle panels were often remounted in quite different pieces of furniture. \n\nWhat seems to have happened on this table is that some boulle panels made in about 1690 for a small tripod table or a large box were remounted more than a century later. The design of the table, with projecting panels in the centre of the frieze under the top, was one that had been devised by the Parisian cabinetmaker Adam Weisweiler in the 1780s. However, on Weisweiler's tables, the projecting panels, on the front at least, formed the front panels of drawers. There are no drawers on this table and the construction underneath is quite crude. The table was probably made in the 1820s, either in Paris or in London, where there was a flourishing trade in making up pieces in French 18th-century styles.",
