            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of Ashinaga (long legs) and Tenaga (long arms). Ashinaga (long legs) and Tenaga (long arms) were inhabitants of either Long legs Land or Long Arms Land and were excellent fishermen as they worked together to catch fish. In Japan Tenaga and Ashinaga had been based on Chinese books and Encyclopaedias that had been imported into Japan. During the early 18th century there was a fashion for the unusual and the bizarre and netsuke carvers began to replicate these themes in wood or ivory. This fashion continued into the 19th century. The carved compositions of Tenaga and Ashinaga, such as this one, required a skilful hand so as not to break the fine ivory in depiction of their long arms, legs and detailed features. \n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Toshinaga. The artist, Toshinaga was a Meiji period (1868-1912) netsuke carver who mimicked and refined the style of the Edo period (1615-1868) netsuke carver Hojitsu (1790-1873). His piece of Ashinaga and Tenaga is humorous with the animated features of the pair adding a touch of realism and comedy to the piece.",
