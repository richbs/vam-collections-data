He also noted that the style was reminiscent of Hans Kels the Younger.\n\nIt represents the bust of  Johann Hanold the Elder of Augsburg (1479-1540), who was a strong supporter of Lutheranism. The Swabian Reformer Ambrosius Blaurer was preacher of St. Moritz in Augsburg, where Hanold's tomb was situated.\n\nThe boxwood model of this medal (now in Staatliche Museen Berlin-Dahlem, inv. 8194) has the arms of Honold vom Luchs on the reverse.",
