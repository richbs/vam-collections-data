They are inspired by her wallhangings of tower blocks and sky-scrapers created from photographic images. The wallpaper is printed to order.  From about the early 1990s, many people have chosen to live in 'lofts' in converted industrial buildings or city developments designed by architects. Wallpaper is not really suited to these open-plan spaces. However, Sharon Elphick sees the shift towards large living spaces as an opportunity to use wallpaper in a new way. She believes, 'People have got the space to use an interesting paper without it dominating everything.'",
