(Three of them are also in the V&A, Museum nos. T.5 to 7-2006.)\nSuch well-made and beautifully trimmed garments were difficult to find in the aftermath of the Second World War.\n\nThe nightgowns were on sale in a favourite store on Broadway, New York, close to where Adele and her mother lived. Adele believes that these garments were made in Europe and sent to the USA. They might have been samples or perhaps leftover pieces that had not been sold in a particular shipment. The USA did not have rationing in 1949, but beautiful objects that had been made in Europe were very much in demand and could be exchanged for hard currency. \n\nAdele and her mother were overcome by the beautiful workmanship, fine-quality silk, soft colours and very reasonable prices. They put these \u2018glorious gowns\u2019 away for her future trousseau. Adele has never worn them but has treasured them for many years for their beauty and fine details. She has been a volunteer guide at theV&A for many years and kindly donated them to the Museum.",
