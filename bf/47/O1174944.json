This fashion came from the football terraces where rosettes would be sold in your football team's colours; it lasted until punk fashion of the late 1970s replaced the ribbon rosette with much smaller button badges.\n\nGary Glitter was a performer who first came to prominence during the glam rock era of British pop music. He had a long chart run during the 1970s, including twenty-six hit singles. Although he'd been a performer since the 1960s, he became synonymous with the flamboyant glittery suits and platform boots from the glam period. His singing career continued throughout the 80s and early 90s with many greatest hits albums and revival shows, but he returned to major public attention in the late 1990s due to criminal convictions in the UK and Vietnam.",
