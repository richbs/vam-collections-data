The laces are black and thread through seven eyelets on either side. A decorative textured leather patch, with a border of punched circles, is stitched above the toe of each boot. The tongues are arranged in three layers; the one nearest the foot is of plain black leather, and the other two are much narrower and more decorative. The uppermost is textured has a serrated border, and the one in the middle is the same width and is also textured. These two topmost tongues project forwards through a horizontal slit in the toe, and are secured there in place with a line of stitching.\n\nThe heels of the boots are decorated with a strap made from two narrow pieces of leather passed through two loops, one on either side, and secured in place with stitches. The topmost layer of the strip is naturally textured, has a serrated edge, and is decorated with a punched pattern of circles. The strip underneath is naturally textured. They are secured together by four lines of continuous stitches. There is a narrow strip of punched and stitched decoration at the ankle.\n\nThe boots are lined throughout with soft tan leather.",

They were manufactured in 2012 by the Northampton bootmakers originally used by John Moore in the 1980s, using the same components and construction.\n\nThe design fuses elements taken from traditional British work boots with details from the Seditionaries boots which Moore had earlier developed with Vivienne Westwood. The originals were sold through the House of Beauty and Culture in Dalston, a boutique established in 1986 by Moore and several other influential designers, including Judy Blame, Richard Torry and John Flett. Moore was considered one of the seminal footwear designers of the 1980s up until his premature death in 1989.",
