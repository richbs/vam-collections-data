Both ears stick almost straight out from the head and are decorated with toothed fringes.   The back is formed from a lattice of criss-crossed wires replacing the original resin (dhura) model.   Similar, though looped, applied decoration on the trunck, head and throat.  A plume-like pointed conical decoration is attached to the top of the head by a short stem.\nAlthough the elephant has received a cursory filing visible on the ears, trunk and front legs, much of the surface shows no signs of cleaning displaying the grainy surface of a casting fresh from the mould.\nThe work of Kainkuya Mal craftsmen, locally called Dhokras.",
