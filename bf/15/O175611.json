            "public_access_description": "Pentagram was working on the corporate image of the brewery Samuel Webster and decided that pubs needed to be linked by pictorial signs. They commissioned artist Kathleen Lindsley (born 1951) to produce about 180 pub signs at great speed, averaging 5 signs a fortnight (see E.704-1994 to E.709-1994 for examples). The wood engravings were then enlarged by the signmaker, Butterfields in Bradford, to 3 feet by 9 feet and reproduced by screen onto composite boards. It was felt that wood engraving was an appropriate technique as it reflected something of the landscape and heritage of Yorkshire; the imagery itself was based on local research.",
