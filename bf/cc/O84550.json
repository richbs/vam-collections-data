Their Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte successors from about 1900 were doubtless consciously echoing those prototypes. However while Biedermeier products delighted in mother-of-pearl for its simple gaudiness, it seems likely that Hoffmann and his contemporaries also savoured its voluptuous suggestiveness. This taste is nicely exemplified in a painting of 1909 by Oskar Zwintscher (1870-1916), 'Gold and Perlmutter', in which a reclining symbolist <i>femme fatale</i> bedecked only in gold jewellery reclines beside a casket of mother-of-pearl. In 1912 the \u00d6sterreichisches Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst paid 300 crowns to the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte for a cigarette box with very similar decoration to this desk-set. Another matching set is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1977.72.1-5).",
