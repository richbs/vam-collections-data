On the tip of the handle the wood is thinner, allowing it to slip inside the ball which is attached by a piece of thick, white string. \nThe barrell-shaped ball has been painted with green and black paint, and decorated by carving into the painted surface to reveal the wood underneath. On the top of the ball, concentric circles have been carved out, with the words 'Great Britain' in between. Around the sides of the ball the word 'Mexico' is carved at the top, followed by a striped floral pattern in the centre of the ball. Finally at the bottom of the ball there is 'Sept. 2012' carved into the surface.",
