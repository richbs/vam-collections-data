The boxes were not only virtually airtight, to preserve the snuff from atmospheric changes, but also balance evenly in the hand when open or closed. Consequently the making of the hinge, which in many instances is almost invisible, was considered of prime importance. The method of making this box was known as <i>\u00e0 cage</i>, that is to say the panels of stone and miniatures were set in a cagework of gold, a method of construction that was not officially permitted before 1755, although earlier examples are recorded. The gouache miniature in the lid depicts Marie Antoinette with three of her children, the Dauphin Louis, Marie-Th\u00e9rese-Charlotte and Louis-Joseph-Xavier-Fran\u00e7ois. The base shows the Comte de Provence (Louis XVIII), the Comte d'Artois (Charles X) and Madame Elisabeth.
