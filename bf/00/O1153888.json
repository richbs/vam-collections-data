            "public_access_description": "The first Olympic mascot 'Waldi' a Daschund dog appeared at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increases the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n \nThe Sydney Olympic Games 2000 had three mascots of which Syd the Platypus was one the other two were Millie the Echidna and Olly the Kookaburra. All three were designed by Matthew Hattan and  their purpose was clearly outlined by the Sydney Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (SOCOG). It stated 'Syd, Millie and Olly's role [was] to communicate the ideals of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games\u2026 Their mission [was] to inspire, entertain, inform and embrace'. \n\nTogether, Syd, Olly and Millie represent earth, air and water. Syd, the platypus reflects the environment and captures the vigour and energy of Australia and its people. Olly, a kookaburra epitomises the Olympic spirit of generosity and Millie an echidna is a techno-whiz and information guru with all the facts and figures at his fingertips for the new millennium. By providing a historical narrative for the mascots it is hoped that the public will accept and relate to them. The public remained ambivalent to the three official mascots but Waldo, a character from a comedic television programme gained wide popularity.",
