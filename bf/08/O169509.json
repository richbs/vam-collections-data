There were originally two separate panels which decorated the lower inside section of a hanging sleeve. They have subsequently been joined together and backed.\nThe pattern in each half is identical but reversed because of the way they have been joined.\nThe embroidery is tightly worked on a mauve [?] ground.  There is a border down both sides in which white trefoils are linked by a curved line. On the inner side of this border are inward-facing white, red and light green boteh-like trees bending upward [the tree in the point is straight] alternating with a group of 3 small red and pink petals on green leaves and stem.  In the main part of each half is a large floral arrangement with a pink round blossom and small pink buds at the top, 2  blue flowers below, a pair of pink flowers and a blue star-like one below that and finally a small pink bowl.  Below this is a pair of drooping green leaves which come from the tip of an upright cypress tree edged with small white roundels ['pearls'] and filled in concentric lines in many colours.  Two pink birds perched on the sides of the tree and 2 bird heads emerge from its trunk which ends in a downward pointing blue flower.\nColours: green light green, blue, red, pink, white, pale pink, very light blue, silver metal thread is used for some of the stems.",
