By this point the Sex Pistols had split up, but Malcolm McLaren (b.1946), svengali-like manager of the band, continued to use the name hoping to maintain the band with a permanent new frontman. McLaren's first choice was Vicious; to record the My Way single, however, Vicious insisted McLaren sign a paper declaring that he would no longer be Vicious's manager.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as can be seen in this advertisement, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
