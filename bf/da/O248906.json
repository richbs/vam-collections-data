They appear to be more confident in handling than the Derbyshire sketches (Nos. 21-32 [247a-1888, 247e-1888, 247b-1888, 602-1888, 610-1888, 805-1888, 247c-1888, 601-1888, 247-1888, 247d-1888, 247f-1888, 247g-1888] of 1801, which represent the furthest advance made by Constable in this particular manner. The dated drawings nearest in style are No. 35 [239-1888], assignable to 1802, and L. B. 20a in the British Museum, of June 1806. Holmes, p. 240, lists Nos. 58-60 [214-1888, 593-1888, 592-1888] together with No. 56 [599-1888] under the year 1806.",
