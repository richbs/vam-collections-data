He is standing holding out a book in both hands on a grassy foreground set against the plain buff-coloured ground of the paper. A notional sky has been brushed in at the top of the painting in thin blue streaks of watercolour rising to brush strokes of opaque  blue watercolour streaked in gold.  The grass below his feet is shown as two overlapping shallow mounds in a bright green with feathery green grass stalks painted along the base and interspersed with blue irises above. The figure of the man is partly depicted in <i>nim qalam</i>with the decorative details of his <i>jama,</i>, shoes and book cover picked out in gold.  He wears a <i>patka</i> patterned and fringed in gold with floral ends painted in yellow, red and green.  He has a dagger (<i>katar</i>) thrust in the <i>patka</i> at the waist and a sword hanging at his left side with a curved scabbard and <i>talwar</i> hilt minutely detailed in gold and red with coloured motifs in a half-drop pattern in green, yellow and orange on the tip of the scabbard and the hilt, which is further ornamented with dots of white to indicate pearls.  A golden tassel falls from his waist band.  His <i>paijama</i> is fully coloured in bright orange with a dotted design of green leaves outlined in gold. His turban is made of alternate bands of plain white and patterned white bands, the latter sprigged with small pink and gold motifs with a cross binding of red-edged gold bands, decorated with a motif of similar hues as the detailing on the hilt and scabbard tip.\n\nThe painting  is framed with  an inner border of  pinky-buff-coloured strips of paper  outlined in white, gold and black and decorated with a scrolling trefoil design in gold.  The lower part of the frame has a small (3mm.) strip of blue paper decorated with a simple criss-cross pattern stuck above it and below the  lower edge of the portrait. The main outer border has an ivory-coloured ground and is decorated with alternate red poppies and pink lilies outlined in gold, with the lily leaves sticking straight out without their ends tipping over.  The outer margins of the page have strips of  blue paper with white outlines stuck to itches have been laid over the remnants of former red margins which have bled over the border and are visible along the edges of the present blue margins.  A sage-green paper strip has been added as a gutter for the binding along the album's central edge.\n\n\n.",
