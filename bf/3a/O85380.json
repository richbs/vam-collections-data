His luxurious fashions, typified by this hooped evening dress, reflect an abiding passion for historical styles, ornate textiles, and elaborate decoration, all of which he translates in a contemporary idiom.\n\nIn a striking palette of acidic yellow and pastels, the dress forms part of Lacroix's \"18th-Century Haute Couture Collection,\" which draws on a wide range of pre-1968 fashion references. Lacroix describes this collection as elegant and slightly dishevelled: \"Nothing seems to be held in place. The fabric is wrapped. It pirouettes around obstinately asymmetrical necklines.\"",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis spectacular dress - the most recent V&A acquisition represented in A Grand Design - was given to the Museum very shortly after its first appearance on Lacroix's catwalk in the autumn 1996 Paris fashion shows.\nChristian Lacroix opened his haute couture house in 1986. His luxurious fashions, typified by this hooped evening dress, reflect an abiding passion for historical styles, ornate textiles, and elaborate decoration, all of which he translates in a contemporary idiom.\nIn a striking palette of acidic yellow and pastels, the dress forms part of Lacroix's \"18th-Century Haute Couture Collection,\" which draws on a wide range of pre-1968 fashion references. Lacroix describes this collection as elegant and slightly dishevelled: \"Nothing seems to be held in place. The fabric is wrapped. It pirouettes around obstinately asymmetrical necklines.\"\n\nAMY DE LA HAYE",
