            "public_access_description": "This ceramic vessel was originally designed as a vase to display cut-flowers, having a wide neck and four spouted openings on its shoulders, now missing. The form was unique to Iranian pottery from the 12th century, which was revived in the 17th century. The idea of spouted vessels for cut-flowers was evidently exported to Europe and copied in the Netherlands at the end of the 17th century. The decoration, however, imitates Chinese blue and white porcelain. \n\nWhen the object was later damaged, probably through use, it was repurposed as a ewer for serving iced water to the public as an act of charity. This was achieved through the addition of metal mounts, which included a hinged cover and a double walled insert to contain iced water in the inner cavity, which was kept chilled by adding icy water through an opening at the top of the handle that fed into the surrounding cavity.",
