London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"T. SUTHERLAND (1785-1838) after John GENDALL (1790-1865)\nWINDSOR CASTLE as Seen from Eton Playground, 1819.\nLettered with title and <i>J. Gendall Delt./T.Sutherland Sculpt./London Published April 1st 1819, at R. ACKERMANN'S Repository of Arts, 101 Strand.</i>\nEtching and aquatint coloured by hand.\n35.1 X 50.2cm\nE.244-1893\nLit; John Ford <i>Ackermann 1783-1983, The Business of Art</i>, London, 1983.\n\nThe technique of aquatint, which can give the appearance of tone rather than just the individual lines and marks possible in etching and engraving was first used in Britain at the beginning of the 1770s.  Its resemblance to washes of watercolour meant that it was used in combination with hand-colouring watercolour paintings.  Hand-coloured aquatint was used particularly for topographical subjects.  It was introduced to Britain just at the time when watercolour painting was coming to the fore; by the 1830s it was being replaced by lithography as a reproductive medium.\nRudolph Ackermann was a German who set up in business with his own premises in London in 1795.  Operating from his establishment known from 1798 onwards as the 'Repository of Arts', as well as being a book and print publisher, he was also at one time or another, proprietor of a drawing school, of a circulating library of prints and drawings, a dealer in works of art, especially watercolours, and a retailer of artists' materials, decorative papers and fancy goods.  He was responsible for a massive output of prints, books and magazines embellished with hand-colouring, amongst the most famous of which are his magazine, <i>The Repository of Arts</i>, 1809-1928, and <i>The Microcosm of London</i>, 1808-1810.  His books with hand-coloured plates are amongst the most splendid in the history of book production in Britain.  As well as authors, Ackermann kept certain artists in steady employment for a number of years, including John Gendall who went to work for him in 1811.  He must also have had an army of hand-colourers.  In the first issue of <i>The Repository of Arts</i>, January 1809, the anonymous author writes, 'During the period when French emigrants were so numerous in this country, Mr A. was among the first to strike out a liberal and easy mode of employing them, and he had seldom less than fifty, nobles, priests and ladies of distinction at work upon screens, card racks, flower stands and other ornamental fancy works of a similar nature.'\nWe do not know if the hand-colouring of prints was also carried out by these distressed gentlefolk, before the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 encouraged so many of them to return home, but the omission of hand-colouring in the list of their activities may indicate that it was a less  a genteel pastime than merely one stage in the hard-headed business of the mass production of deluxe books and prints.\"\n",
