There is no horse / How to cope?/ Hey Franz, you Austrian/ You will do instead of a horse/ But hurry up so we don't again/ have another Augustus situation./ Cracking his whip, swish, swish/ he forces the old man into a gallop/ But behind Vassya at great speed/ comes someone smartly trotting like a Turk/ He who has for this black day/ Stored another horse \"in exchange\". Should the first one fall and smash his nose/ Vassya will jump on the next one/ But that wonderful hero/ He too will collapse/ somewhere on the way/ then may God give strength to his legs/ For the circle will start anew and he will again be without his cattle.",
