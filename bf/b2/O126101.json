On the boxes, the hair is indicated in brown watercolour and it is shown arranged in a plaited pattern on those that are round.  An anonymous designer drew these designs about 1790 for Marie-Caroline of Hapsburg-Lorraine (1751-1825), sister of Marie-Antoinette and wife of Ferdinand IV of Bourbon, of the two Sicilies. Marie-Caroline was Queen of Naples and indeed the sheet of designs is inscribed 'pour la reine de naples'. \n\nThe designs are from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
