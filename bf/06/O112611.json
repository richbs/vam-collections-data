A stock made of folded and pleated linen or cotton created the effect of a white column supporting the head. \n\nStocks continued to be worn for formal and full dress throughout the 18th century. They were fastened at the back of the neck by a button, tape or detachable buckle. Buckles were commonly used because they were easier to adjust and kept the stock firmly in place with three or four studs inserted into buttonholes at one end, the other end being fastened by prongs. \n\nStock buckles are usually oblong with a distinctive pattern formed by the studs and prongs. Some are very plain but they can be more elaborate. Buckles could also be worn at the front and some fashionable gentlemen such as the dandy Richard \u2018Beau\u2019 Nash chose to be painted with the buckle showing. Also known as clasps, stock buckles were included in clothing issued to officers of the 17th Light Dragoons in 1778.",
