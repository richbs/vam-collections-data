Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958\n\n<b>Woman at a Fountain</b> \nD52 Neg 68570 \nMillboard, 61.5 x 46.3 cm (24\u00bc x 18\u00bc ins) \nDyce Bequest 1869 \n\nUnattributed in the Dyce collection and the 1907 catalogue. According to a note on the Departmental files, Grant in 1914 seems to have been the first to suggest Etty's hand, although he thought the background was by a different artist, W D Kennedy. Farr dates the work to about 1840-5. A correspondent to the museum in 1913 believed the work to be by John Constable, which seems unlikely. \n\nLIT: <i>Gaunt and Roe</i>, repr colour pl 1; <i>Farr</i> no 218 p174\n \nPROV: <i>Drawing and Design</i> July 1928, p180; <i>Connoisseur</i> LXXIX, 1927, facing p168 (colour); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 18 June 1838 (it was the museum's 'Masterpiece of the Week')\"",
