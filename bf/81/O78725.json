In the search for ideas for a new building style British architects studied architecture outside Europe.  These traditional forms were also threatened with obliteration by `the march of progress', and drawings had to be made to record them before they were destroyed.\n\nPeople\nSpiers was an architect better-known  for his teaching and writing on the subject than as a practitioner. In 1865-1866 he toured the Middle East on a travelling scholarship from the Royal Academy.  On his return he exhibited several pictures with Eastern subjects at the Royal Academy of which this was probably one. His aim was to encourage British architects to adopt or be inspired by the very different traditions of architectural practice to be found within Islam.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn 1751 the Governor of Damascus, Assad Pasha al-Azam, commissioned the construction of this khan or secure place for merchants to stay, store and sell their goods. It was completed in 1753. The alternate colours of the bands of stone are good examples of polychrome or multicoloured architecture. Spiers wanted this type of building technique imitated in Britain.",
