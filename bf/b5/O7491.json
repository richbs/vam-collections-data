At that time and until 1907 when he opened his own workshop, Whall did not construct his own windows and instead relied on the skilled glass craftsmen employed by such firms as Lowndes & Drury. \n\nWhall was one of the earliest stained glass artists to make use of 'slab' glass. This had been invented by E.S. Prior in 1889 and is also known as 'Early English' glass. Slab glass is blown into a square mould and then cut into slabs. The resultant slabs are irregular in thickness and in colour (when coloured glass is blown). The light that passes through such glass is broken up, producing a variable effect in each individual piece of glass. Whall was a master in exploiting the qualities of this new technique in glass production.",

At that time and until 1907 when he opened his own workshop, Whall did not construct his own windows and instead relied on the skilled glass craftsmen employed by such firms as Lowndes & Drury. \n\nWhall was one of the earliest stained glass artists to make use of 'slab' glass. This had been invented by E.S. Prior in 1889 and is also known as 'Early English' glass. Slab glass is blown into a square mould and then cut into slabs. The resultant slabs are irregular in thickness and in colour (when coloured glass is blown). The light that passes through such glass is broken up, producing a variable effect in each individual piece of glass. Whall was a master in exploiting the qualities of this new technique in glass production.",
