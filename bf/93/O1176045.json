The costume consists of a full body leotard worn under tightly fitting corset and includes leather boots and a tail. The surface of the orange leotard is digitally printed with interlocking black diamonds and stiff leather covered piping has been attached to the corset, arms and hands. A stiff leather 'cage' is worn over the top of the upper section of the costume. It was designed by Julie Taymor (b.1952) and was worn with a mask co-designed by Julie Taymor and Michael Curry (owner and president of Michael Curry Design Inc).\n\nJulie Taymor is a director and designer and has worked with both stage and screen productions. She received two Tony Awards for her work on The Lion King, one for direction and one for Original Costume design, making her the first woman to win a Tony Award for directing a musical. \n\nThe musical of The Lion King is based on the original 1994 Disney film.  Directed by Julie Taymor, the musical debuted on the 8th of July 1997 at the Orpheum Theatre Minneapolis, Minnesota, before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre on October 15th 1997. The London premiere of The Lion King took place at the Lyceum Theatre on October 19th 1999 and the show is still running. \n\nScar is the primary villian of the story and plots to steal the throne from the hero, and rightful heir, Simba. This costume is a replica of the original Scar costume that was specially made for the V&A.",
