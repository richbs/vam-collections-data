He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Oliver Messel suite at the Dorchester Hotel opened in 1953. The exquisite interior, along with the wonderful views across London from the 7th floor patio, quickly became the favourite place to stay for guests including Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward, Bob Hope, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. \n\nThe photograph depicts a wedding reception which Oliver Messel has designed and dressed with roses and garlands festooned around tables, windows and doors.\n\nThe photographers, Millar and Harris, were a commercial photographic company based in Clapham, South London. Their extensive client base included not only glamorous magazines but also architects, interior designers, construction companies and industrial engineers, government agencies, department stores, hotels and restaurants, as well as private individuals.",
