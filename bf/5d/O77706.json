They were made from thin paper which was first coated with a mixture of whisked egg white and salt, then sensitized with silver nitrate. This print was made from a glass negative.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis view shows the detailed architecture of the town gateway, the Hooseinabad Bazaar in Lucknow, and the stall-holders of the surrounding area.\n\nOwnership & Use\nPhotographs like this were sold at the time they were made as records of Indian architecture and as topographical views aimed at  both libraries and the armchair tourist. Today they are often seen as works of art in their own right.",
