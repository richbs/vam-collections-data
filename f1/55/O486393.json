Embroidered with coloured silks, mainly blues and white with some green and yellow, in satin stitch and split stitch with some couched gold thread. The main feature of the design is a large vase ornamented with dragon, waves, clouds and a 'shou' character, resting on a wooden stand and containing an enormous peony. The rest of the field filled with butterflies, lotus, magnolia, Buddha's hand citrons, peaches of longevity, bats and a large jui-i sceptre which appears behind the vase. At the top of the hanging is a valance of green satin bound with black satin and edged with a faded silk fringe of reds, greens and blues. It has a border of woven braid inside a white satin border embroidered with lotus, bats and butterflies in blues with couched gold thread stems and scrolls. The valance embroidered with a design of a fish pond and lotus blooms with other flowers and assorted symbols, including some of the Buddhist symbols of Happy Augury and some of the eight precious things in silks of many colours and couched gold the thread. The hanging has a backing of faded pink cotton.",
