There is a main border on four sides containing isolated, sinuous floral sprays with one large red blossom and 2 red buds and several green leaves.  Two of the blossoms are partially embroidered in deep yellow. Inner and outer borders: green meandering stem with red trefoil flowers.\nThe central section has a lobed roundel in the centre formed by a red band with green spots.  There is a red flower in the centre enclosed within an 8-pointed star which links 8 large red flowers in 2 designs: a full flower alternating with one in profile.  A pair of serrated green leaves and a small red trefoil flower emerge from the top of each of these red flowers. A quarter of this roundel appears in each corner of the central field.  Around the outer edge of these and the central roundel are small cypress-like trees and small striped birds [one per corner and 4 around the centre].  The ground is decorated with approximately off-set rows of red floral sprigs, large and occasionally small ones.  These all bend to the left in the lower half.  In the upper half the pattern is reversed so that the flowers point to the centre. All the ground is quilting is quilted with deep yellow silk in a scale-like design.\nElements of the design were printed onto the ground, for example the roundels, border sprays and meanders.  These appear on other covers.\nBacking: pieced mauve cotton.\nFringe:  dark green silk from a woven heading.",
