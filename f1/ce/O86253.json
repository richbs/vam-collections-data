It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nJuggling was a popular music hall item. Many jugglers gave their acts a twist by creating characters for themselves, such as Eddie Le Roy, \u2018The Juggling Humorist\u2019, Roy Dove, \u2018The Garrulous Juggledian\u2019, and Boy Foy, \u2018England\u2019s Youngest Juggler\u2019. Hearn was \u2018The Sleepy Juggler\u2019 or \u2018The Laziest Juggler on Earth\u2019. When London\u2019s grandest variety theatre, the Coliseum, opened in 1904, Tom Hearn was on the bill, along with Malcolm Scott, another performer who was drawn by Cooke. Hearn also appeared as Snale in the pantomime The White Cat at London\u2019s Drury Lane Theatre in 1904-05, when he also performed his lazy juggling act. This caricature shows Hearn in pyjamas, in the moment from his act when he has finally got out of bed to start his morning exercises and is looking wistfully at a poster of the contemporary strongman, Eugene Sandow. In March 1910 Hearn gave up his act, which was carried on by his brother under the same name.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the juggler Tom Hearn (1879-1954), billed in the halls as 'The Sleepy Juggler', or 'The Laziest Juggler on Earth'. Juggling was a popular item in the halls, and one that was included on the bill at one of London's grandest variety theatre, the Coliseum, which opened in 1904 giving four performances a day, later reduced to three - at 3pm, 6pm and 9pm. Oswald Stoll, the managing director of the company that owned the Coliseum, prided himself on all the acts being suitable for all the family, although Tom Hearn was on the bill there with Malcolm Scott, who unlike Hearn, was not exactly a children's entertainer.\n\nHearn topped the bill at the Grand Theatre of Varieties during the week commencing 15 May 1905 when he was drawn by Cooke. This caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
