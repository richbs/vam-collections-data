            "physical_description": "This small and somewhat weathered carving of a tutelary seated figure may represent Panchika, the semi-divine warlord of the Yakshas. He has also been identified as Kubera, the god of wealth, but he lacks the usual attribute of a purse and has a military bearing more in keeping with the former identification. The figure is shown seated in a European fashion with his legs akimbo on a throne with a footstool. The sculpture was an architectural adornment as it has a protruding tenon in the centre of the base which would have acted as a structural fixing.\n      The head of the god is encircled with a plain aureole which rises as a semi-circle above the back of the curved back of the throne. He sits in a fully frontal position grasping a lance diagonally between his legs. He clasps the top of the lance in his right hand beneath a pennant while the other arm is held with his elbow in an outward pose and his hand spread out over his left kneecap. Under a cockaded turban he has a broad face and a moustache on top of a full lower lip. There are remnants of earrings and there may have been a clasp on the right shoulder of a cloak or <i>uttariya</i> dipping over a knee-length tunic with long  ruched sleeves and cinched in at the waist. He wears high boots with flaps which are turned over at the top below the knees leaving bare scooped out areas either side of a central rib which is joined to  toeless uppers attached to the soles.\n      His left foot rests on a small footstool with a chevron-shaped apron hanging beneath the seat between two carved legs at the corners, the design of which is now too weathered to identify. The throne on which the god sits has a solid curved back which rises to shoulder height and is decorated with an incised grid encompassing diagonal crosses with raised dots in the triangular sections within. There is a plain seat with turned baluster legs between which there is a draped textile panel. The footstool appears to jut out on the right hand side to the left of which there is a plinth decorated with inverse lotus petals.",
