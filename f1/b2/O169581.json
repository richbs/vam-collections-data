Interlined with woollen twill, backed with plain weave silk and faced with silk satin. There is an outermost border with needle woven lozenges between narrow bands of diamonds [a].\n\nThe outer border has pointed lozenges/cartouches in openwork through which the red interlining can be seen. The spaces between are filled with triangles of straight stitch forming diamonds. In each corner is a square containing a large X-motif. The border [a] is repeated. The main border is slightly wider. It is divided into sections by the needle woven band of lozenges. In each corner is a square with an X-motif against a background of stepped triangles forming squares. The long sections contain large diamonds in pulled thread work. With a lozenge in the centre of each. The background is formed by stepped triangles forming squares. The outermost border [a] and the needle woven bands are repeated. This time the bands divide the border into sections. The large central rectangular panel contains an arch-shape of three bands of pulled thread and embroidery and they are form a zig-zagged outline. At the base they form a wide W-shape with the remaining triangular corner being pulled into an openwork pattern, each with an embroidered rectangle. The spandrels are also openwork and contain a pair of small lozenges and a pair of linked triangles. The arch contains a long elaborate cypress tree balanced on a lozenge. It includes diamonds  and cartouches of openwork, a ground of embroidered triangles forming squares and a border of embroidered stars. A pair of parrots is at the base. To either side is a small cypress tree in finer pulled thread work, each with a parrot on top and above, and close to the tip of the central cypress is a small tree below a parrot. There is a parrot on top of the central cypress tree.\n\nEmbroidery Thread: cream silk; 2S.\nInterlining: red woollen twill.\nBacking: pieced, two different colours of silk, one purple and one more red.\nFacing: bias-cut; green satin.",
