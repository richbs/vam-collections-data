Embossed leather for the seats and backs of chairs had been in widespread use since the early 17th century, fixed with rows of prominent and contrasting round-headed nails. Particularly distinctive features of Portuguese chairs like this one, are the round metal finials on the tops of the back legs, and the elaborate scrolling ornament of the back panel, which is centred on a coat of arms (not yet identified). As in other European countries, fashionable chairs in Portugal became taller in the second half of the 17th century. Chairs like this have traditionally been dated 1650-1700, but the arched form of the back and the front stretcher may derive from early 18th-century English chairs. \n\nThis chair was purchased for the Museum in Lisbon in 1865, some years before London firms began reproducing Spanish and Portuguese furniture during the 1880s.",
