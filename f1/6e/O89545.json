The butterfly above  has wings with stylised  interlaced patterning in black over a pinkish ground merging into brown towards its head.  The wings have wavy edges in black and white and it is shown with two pairs of spindly legs outstretched either side of it.\n      The painting is framed with strips of buff-coloured paper and narrow rulings in black mounted on the main border also of an ivory colour.  The page has dark blue strips of paper stuck along its margins with one inner line in black. A beige strip of woven textile has been attached on the inner side of the page to act as a gutter for the binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
