In the centre is a dancing couple dressed in Hungarian peasant dress, flanked by stylised flowering plants. Made with cotton thread, the roundel is grounded with a decorative net formed of tiny linked semi-circles, each of a single line of thread with a second line of loosely-worked buttonhole stitches depending from it. Other forms of fancy buttonholing are used in the outer edging. The two figures and the flowering plants are worked in a distinctive cloth stitch, which was a feature of Halas lace. Threads were darned in and out of one another to reproduce the effect of a fine tabby weave cotton. The pattern pieces are outlined by a thicker raised thread.",
