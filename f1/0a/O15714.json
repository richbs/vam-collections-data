The painting is probably based on an illustration in a magazine, perhaps one issued to commemorate his coronation on 22 June, 1911 or, more likely, the Delhi durbar, which took place in the following December and was attended by King George and Queen Mary as part of their state visit to India, the first by a reigning British monarch. It was on this occasion that the couple were formally proclaimed Emperor and Empress of India and the decision was announced to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi.\n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
