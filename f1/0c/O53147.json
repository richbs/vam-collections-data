The carver's bill indicates that there were originally palm trees on top of the vases. It describes the decorative carving as a  'middle Modillion with Frames head & a floroon with berries at bottom' flanked by 'mosaic with flowers a top'.\n\nPeople\nJohn (Jean) Antoine Cuenot (died in 1763) the carver was of French origin. Mary, Duchess of Norfolk took a particular interest in the decoration of the interiors of her London house. Many of the details were inspired by French engraved ornament.\n\nPlace\nThis doorway was carved by Cuenot for the Great Drawing Room at Norfolk House.  The room was hung with Gobelins tapestries which illustrated the flora and fauna of the south east Asia (now in the Great Hall,  Arundel Castle).  One shows a black woman carried in a hammock accompanied by monkeys. This provided  the inspiration for the monkeys on the door surrounds. The room was redecorated in 1845 and two additional doorways were moulded in gilded plaster (one is now in the Art Institute of Chicago). The Great Drawing Room was in the south east corner of the first floor of Norfolk House.",
