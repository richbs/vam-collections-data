He came to Britain in 1934 and from 1935 was made controller of design for the Isokon company in London, which specialised in plywood furniture and for whom this design was made. Although it is drawn by another member of the Isokon studio, the table design, complete with dimensions, has the approval of Gropius' signature in the bottom corner. The design clearly shows the simple forms that Gropius promoted in his efforts to bring together art and technology in design. He taught that form should follow function but that products didn't necessarily have eto lack aesthetic qualities. Even mass-produced objects could be beautiful, as well as well-designed, and he encouraged artists and designers to learn and work with each other. \n\nThis type of table was used in small kitchen-diners or living rooms. There is no record of a table with these particular dimensions being made, alhtough other similar models by Gropius were produced.",

E.2822-2824-1995\n\nGropius moved to England in 1934 and from 1935 he\nwas Controller of Designs for Isokon. Plywood was\nthe material favoured by the company, much of whose\nfurniture, including examples similar to these\ndesigns, was made in Estonia. No Furniture of the\nexact dimensions indicated in these drawings is\nknown to exist. One similar type of table was made\nin very small numbers and no surviving examples are\nknown; another variant was made as a prototype\nonly. Although signed by Gropius, the actual\ndrawings are evidently by another hand in the\nIsokon studio. For other Isokon drawings see also\nPritchard, Jack, RISS, Egon, and Breuer, Marcel,\nin the Drawings Catalogue.\n...\n<u>Literature</u>: Catalogue: <u>Isokon Exhibition</u>,\nUniversity of East Anglia, January - February 1975.\n\n           Plywood table Model 2 and 3.
