In a letter to Sir Horace Mann, dated 12 June 1753, Horace Walpole describes the interior decorations of Strawberry Hill: \u201cUnder this room [the breakfast room, now known as the Turkish Boudoir] is a cool little hall where we generally dine, hung with paper to imitate Dutch tiles.\u201d The \u201clittle hall\u201d was Walpole\u2019s first entrance hall; it later became a waiting room. Another complete example of a related pattern at Colonial Williamsburg, U.S.A., appears to have been printed from the same blocks, except that the \u2018tiles\u2019 which are plain in the Strawberry Hill fragment have additional scenes of a flute player and a windmill.",
