Gimson's metal sconces are related to his furniture designs through their use of decorative motifs such acorns and oak leaves and exposed technical features such as rivets.\n\nPeople\nErnest Gimson was a designer and furniture maker closely associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement.  In 1881 he began training with a Leicester architect, Isaac Barradale. In 1886, on completion of his training and with the recommendation of the designer William Morris (1834-1896), he was recruited to the office of the architect J.D. Sedding (1838-1891). It was there that he met Ernest Barnsley (1863-1926). In 1895 he set up a furniture workshop in the Cotswolds with Barnsley and the latter's brother Sidney (1865-1926). He also integrated his work into the life of the local community by training villagers to become fine craftsmen.\n\nMaterials & Making\nGimson's typically 'Arts and Crafts' attitude towards his work involved using local woods. He often highlighted their colour and natural markings by incorporating them prominently into the design, and exposing technical features such as pins and dovetail joints. From about 1902 he began to design a series of sconces, firedogs (decorated iron bars for supporting logs and coal in a fireplace), hinges, etc., in iron or brass which were vaguely reminiscent of a 17th-century style.",
