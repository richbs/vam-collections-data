They most likely date to the 1920s when the firm was established as both a sporting and military tailor.  \nEdward Tautz founded E. Tautz in 1867. Prior to that date Tautz had been head cutter at the venerable sporting tailors Hammond & Co before leaving to establish his own firm. At Hammond he had been tailor to England\u2019s finest sporting gentlemen, including Edward VII, as Prince of Wales. In 1875 Tautz changed his firm's name to E. Tautz & Sons when his son Frederick George Tautz came into the business. The company catered to Europe's sporting and military elite and by 1897 had added the Royal Warrants of the King of Italy, The King and Queen of Spain, and The Emperor of Austria to its letterhead. On February 16 1895, a young Winston Churchill placed his first order at Tautz, and went on to become a regular client for the next twenty years.",
