Brocaded weft: 2 types metal thread; silver strip around golden silk and silver strip around white silk, the silk is z spun.  Brocaded over an average of 4 threads.\n\nPile:  Silk; 8 colours (faded): yellow, light orange, green, dark blue, blue, light blue, black, white; asymmetrical knot open to left, tied around 2 warp threads; 180 knots per sq. inch (3250 per sq. dm.)\n\nSide finish:  cut\n\nEnd finish:  cut\n\nDesign:  Field:  metallic brocading provides the ground.  In the centre of the present gragment are a pair of white  lilies meeting on the horizontal plane.  They are veined in dark blue and were outlined in black.  Yellow/light blue leaves form a square frame beyond which on the lower and upper sides is a large area of orange with a black, multi-curvilinear outline in black, and each supporting a blue palmette containing a blossom of metal brocading with yellow stems.  To the left and right of the central square - and facing inwards - is a large, blossom-like form now grey but perhaps once light purple.  Each extends as a pair of horns towards the centre and each has a scalloped pendant.  These forms contain a white blossom with orange centre and yellow outer decoration, and are supported by pairs of green saz leaves on a stout yellow stem which meanders around much of the field to write the figures described above and form dark blue, five-petalled rosettes placed beyond each corner of the central square, other small blossoms of two-tone leaves all on blue stems.  Above and below the blue palmettes white stems interact with the yellow to form a diamond shape which reinforces the geometry of the total design.  \n\nOutside this whole area stems and their leaves are dark blue and link a crowd of multi-coloured flowers and leaves.  The upper centre has a large, horned blue blossom and wihin it a green palmette, itself containing a flower.  Part of this design survives in the lower centre, and against the side borders are two halves of a large yellow motif inside which appears to be the half of a palmette outlined in dark blue.\n\nMain border:  the incomplete outer borders of the fragment may be the carpet's main border.  The ground is green and a yellow meander links remains of white flowers.\n\nInner border:  a vertical strip showing half only of reciprocal twinned trefoils in white, orange and light blue.",
