This form of helmet was popular from the first decade of the 17th century up to the Civil War of 1642-1646 and large numbers have been preserved in arsenals and armouries.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis helmet was almost certainly made in London. Although the fact that it was made from two separate pieces is usually taken to be an indication of a lack of skill on the armoury's part, it is quite difficult to make the separate halves fit together satisfactorily. \n\nDecoration\nThe decoration consists of formalised leaves and a series of rivet heads arranged in rows. The edge is turned over a wire. The wide turned-down brim was intended to protect the face from sword cuts. The helmet would have had a padded lining held by rivets and two embossed steel ear-flaps attached inside the brim to protect the ears.",
