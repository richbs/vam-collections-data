By the first half of the 19th century it was the main centre of production for small silver items in the region.  The silversmiths specialised in popular and devotional jewellery.  They sold their work at markets throughout the Alpine region, and at major international trade fairs all over Europe.  They also obtained lucrative contracts to mass-produce devotional jewels for the numerous places of pilgrimage in Austria, Bavaria and Switzerland.\n\nThis ring, with the image of the Virgin of Neukirchen beim Heiligen Blut, would have been worn by a Catholic woman in south Germany or Austria.  The Virgin was greatly venerated in that region, particularly at the many places of pilgrimage dedicated to her.  Red glass pastes are typical of jewellery from the south German region, as is the diagonal pattern on the shank.  It is marked on the outside of the shank with the unicorn\u2019s head mark of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, and the silver mark 13.",
