IM.121E-1910), shows that it was made by Nepalese craftsmen. The recovery in 2001 of  further drawings depicting the lineage of the 'Black Hat' (or Karmarpa) order points to its worship in Tibet and probable commissioning by a Tibetan patron. The image also has a face covered with 'cold' or painted gilding (as opposed to the fire gilding seen on the rest of the body). Such face painting is a peculiarly Tibetan consecration practice, and this reinforces the idea that it comes from Tibet. It was obtained during the British military expedition to the country in 1904.",
