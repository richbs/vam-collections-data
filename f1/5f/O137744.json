It was probably made in India for export to Europe and its bold floral design shows a mixture of Indian and European influence.  \n\nThe areas of the pattern worked in chain stitch were done with a tambour hook, instead of a needle.  Similar to a modern crochet hook, the tambour hook was inserted through the cotton to pull a loop of embroidery thread through.  Chain-stitch worked with a hook could be done much more quickly than with a needle.  The technique developed in India and was introduced in Britain in the mid-18th century and further adapted.  Instead of holding the fabric in the hands, British embroiderers preferred to stretch it tightly on a circular frame resembling a drum or \u2018tambour\u2019.",
