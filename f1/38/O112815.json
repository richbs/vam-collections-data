On the flat top of the lid, two shields of arms conjoined above the date 1512.  On front and back, panels of scrollwork flanking blank shields for arms.  On the ends, similar panels without shields.  On the underside, a doubly incised diaper including a rectangular centre panel containing the date 1512.  Pair of hinges, and of hasps filling into eye-plates: Interior lined throughout in salmon-coloured silk (not pristine).  \nSOUTH GERMAN; dated 1512\n\nHeight: 2 1/2 in.  (6.3cm)\nWidth: 7 5/8 in (19.2cm)\nDepth: 5 in (11.5cm)\n\nCondition: Warped\n\nRemarks: Early date in arabic figures for leather.  \n\nGeneral Remarks:  The arms are those of the Nuremberg patrician families of T?cher (dexter shield) and Str\u00f6mer, both shields illustrated by Johann Kaler, Patricii Respubliae Nuremberg (86F 56), pl. 3 and pl. 15 (M.J.P.Harthan's minute dated 15 Jan 1958 in Supplementary Register).  See also Siebmacher, ed. 1605, p. 205.\n\nThe conjoining of the shields points to a marriage alliance (? In 1512) between these families, but none such has so far (1958) been identified.  \n\n5957-1859\n\n<Hand drawn diagram of shields>",
