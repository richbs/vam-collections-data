This included this cabinet, a dining table and chairs, a coffee table and lounge chair.  The furniture was made of plywood, painted in a limited range of colours \u2013 white, red and black\u2014and the chairs were originally upholstered in tweed.  \nThis cupboard was owned by the designer himself since 1965 and was placed  together with other furniture of this range in the living room until it came to the V&amp;A. The cupboard was originally red but was painted grey by Ralph Adron (Clendinning's partner) in 1969 to sit within an orange, grey and pink decorative scheme created for the dining room at Alwyne Road.  The cabinet appears in situ in several articles both before 1969, when it was red, as well as after, when it was painted grey.\nThis is the only known example of the Liberty's cupboard to date, though more were certainly made.",
