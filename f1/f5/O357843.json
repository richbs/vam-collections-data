            "public_access_description": "In the early sixteenth century, damask table linen, characterised by its elaborate reversible patterns, had been reserved for royalty, the church, high nobility and the very rich among the rest of society. As the century progressed, linen damask weaving developed into an important branch of the textile industry, with  its main centres in Flanders in the Southern Netherlands and Haarlem in Holland,  and the use of table linen by merchants, trades people and others belonging to  the middle and upper classes grew. By 1600, most of these households had at least one complete set of table linen, including one or more table cloths, and a number of napkins. Later in the century, evidence from inventories emphasises the  importance of table linen in households. Often there were more napkins and  tablecloths than there were sheets and pillowcases. Stocks of napery could be  built up over many years, and were bequeathed in wills.\n\nThis napkin depicts a view of Amsterdam Town Hall (which is still standing on Dam Square), with the god Mercury and a barrel in front of the building alongside a three-masted sailing ship. Beneath this is the coat of arms of the City of Amsterdam. Mercury was considered the god of travellers and merchants, and his image was frequently used in the City of Amsterdam because of this significance to the merchant community. The barrel and sailing ship are also references to trade, through which Amsterdam's wealth was built.",

In this way, the hems remained hidden inside the napkins or else were placed on the outside. In the 17th and 18th centuries, folded napkins were placed flat beside or on top of the plates when the table was laid. During use, the napkin, either wholly or partly opened out, was laid over the knees.",
