It's circular plaster base is decorated with waves rising over the heads of four sea nymphs. It has been suggested that the group is to be connected with two figures forming part of the decoration of the St Michael on the tomb of the Duke of Clarence. What appears to be the present piece is shown on a photograph taken in 1935 of the interior of Alfred Gilbert's studio in Kensington Palace.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. He epitomised the movement known as the \u201cNew Sculpture\u201d, with a new focus on naturalistic forms. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.",
