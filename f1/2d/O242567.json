            "public_access_description": "Boris Mikhailov\u2019s series 'Cymepk? (At Dusk)' uses twilight to evoke a world undergoing transition and at the same time to refer to childhood memories. The series, which the artist also refers to as his 'blue series', was taken in 1993 in his home city of Kharkov in the Ukraine. As with Mikhailov\u2019s previous series 'On the Ground' (known as the 'brown series'), it records the city at a moment of transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union. With this body of work, Mikhailov proposes a new, monochrome visual language, with tilted horizons and apparently random subject/object positions, a language of \u201crupture, superimposition and alienation\u201d, to deal with this new social reality. Although many of the scenes do appear to be taken at the end of the day \u2013 we see people heading for home in several images \u2013 the 'dusk' here functions primarily as a device to suck the images of light and colour . The images are tinted blue, both to make them appear 'old' and to refer to the 'blue hour' of twilight. The blue registers not as a colour, but as absence of colour (and especially, absence of Soviet red ), and by implication absence of Reason. Conceptually the dusk also refers to twilight of a particular type of society, suggesting a \u2018requiem\u2019 to the declining social order. \n\nAs Mikhailov suggests in the introduction to the book of this series, the blue of 'At Dusk' also refers to the Ukraine's deprivation during World War Two during the artist\u2019s childhood, when as a three year old he witnessed \u201cthe bombings, the howling sirens and the searchlights in the wonderful dark-blue sky. Blue, blue, light-blue\u2026\u201d  As well as recording the post-Soviet moment, the \u2018brown and blue series\u2019 are also part of Mikhailov\u2019s ongoing concern with the obliteration of the Ukraine\u2019s history, and in particular a total absence of photographic history from the Soviet period. Because these histories do not exist, Mikhailov suggests that they can be supplanted by the construction of one\u2019s own history, \u201cit turned out to be possible\u201d, he has stated, \u201cto play with history or substitute it. It was possible to take pictures of those very landscapes, and by doing so, to falsify history.\u201d At Dusk is therefore a hybrid between a documentary and conceptual project, recording but also staging a time of abject poverty and social decay, of unemployment, fuel shortages, disease and lawlessness that might be both 1941 and 1993, or neither.",
