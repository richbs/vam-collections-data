The chart imitates the canvas threads on which the design is to be stitched. Each square indicates where a stitch goes. It is by the German designer Louis Gl\u00fcer who made  hand painted designs for Berlin woolwork including chair backs and seats, 1820-1870.  This design was probably for a border because it could be endlessly repeated.\n\nBerlin woolwork patterns were exported to Britain in large numbers. It became so popular that it became synonymous with needlework. Indeed in 1847, Mrs Henry Owen could begin her book Illuminated Ladies Book of Useful and Ornamental Needlework with 'Embroidery, or as it is more often called Berlin wool work.'",
