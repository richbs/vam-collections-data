It was the country's first daily newspaper strip and was also published as annuals. There was a children's Teddy Tail League club with each member given a badge and on birthdays, sent a coloured postcard.  First drawn by Charles Folkard, then by his brother Harry who designed the badge image.  Herbert Foxwell, the best known of the illustrators, designed many of the covers and illustrations for the annuals and supplements published after 1933 and some of his drawings became the postcards.\n\nThe knot in the tail of the character was said to have been acquired when he helped a friend out of a hole.
