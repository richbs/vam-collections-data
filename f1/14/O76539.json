The poster has running across the top, six portraits of the star cast from the film. Each of the lobbycards is then dedicated to one of those stars, their names being printed across the top left hand side of the card. \n\nThis one is dedicated to Dharmendra, one of the two heroes of the film. His portrait dominated the centre of the card. In the bottom right hand corner is a small scale image of him with Hema Malini. The title is in the top left hand corner.",
