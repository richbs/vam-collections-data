Body and legs are made\nof a combination of wood and composition painted yellow with the legs yellow. Feet, webbed shape, are of composition painted yellow. This character wears a mid blue felt sailor's cap with a white cotton band and a flash of white felt, navy blue cotton shirt with a matching sailor's collar of felt decorated with white stitching and a red felt bow. Large hands shaped and decorated with three black lines to represent gloves. This is a cartoon character developed by Walt Disney Productions and the puppet matches the set design. Because of the colouring of the cap and shirt it looks more like the 1980s version than that of the 1970s.\nParts - head with socket neck; flat sided half dome unpainted wood body with a separate unpainted wood ball beneath; egg shaped lower body painted white with a white felt tail; four wooden bead legs painted yellow; composition feet painted yellow; two plain dowel sticks for arms attached to hands. Parts strung together. Stringing of multicoloured threads - two metal loops on the head; two metal loops on the body; one through each hand; one through each foot. Controls; two plain bars of wood linked by a large metal clip with two metal eyelets each surrounded by coloured plastic caps. \nStamped PELHAM PUPPET MADE IN ENGLAND on the top which has a large metal hanging hook. In 1984 this puppet cost \u00a36.20.",
