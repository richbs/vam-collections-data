Displayed and analysed under glass.\nRigid arrangement of diamonds, each containing a seated figure.  The central one rests with both hands in his lap.  All the other figures have one hand across the body and the other outstretched. There is considerable variation in detail and exact positioning. The diamonds are formed by bands which are divided into diamonds and triangles and there is a pink diamond where these bands join.  The ground of the large diamonds varies in bands: light blue and beige. The border is divided into diagonal stripes in which a stylized and elongated figure alternates with stylized flowers.  These bands form a V-shaped mid-way along each side.\nThreads: 2S silk: black, white, light blue, light green, pink, light pink, dark red, beige, yellow. \nFacing; light pink silk.",
