He was first accepted in the Salon in 1831 and exhibited there regularly from 1834. His most typical works of the 1830s and '40s are Romantic subjects, such as oriental women, and scenes galantes derived from the French 18th century tradition. He first met Rousseau in 1837 and under his influence increasingly turned to landscape. From about 1850, when landscapes begin to predominate in his output, he achieved his mature landscape style, typified by forests and meadows sparkling with light. In 1851 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. His closest follower was Monticelli, but in his use of small dabs of pigment to convey the visual effects of light, he exercised a considerable influence on the Impressionists. \n\n66 \nVIEW IN FONTAINEBLEAU FOREST: EVENING \nSigned lower left <i>H.
