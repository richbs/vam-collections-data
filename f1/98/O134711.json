Exhibited 48 works at the RA between 1846 and 1876, 35 at the BI 1847-67, and 31 at the SBA 1843-86. Subjects predominantly small-scale domestic genre, particularly interiors of cottages and farmhouses; several Brittany subjects 1852-6, 1865-8, and Welsh scenes 1857-8, 1869-72. Submitted paintings from addresses in Chippenham, Wiltshire, 1843-9, London 1850-2, Brentford, Essex, 1853-73, London 1873, and Wantage, Berkshire, 1874-86. Perhaps influenced by the work of the Cranbrook Colony; the <u>Art Journal</u> (1865, p170) listed him among 20 artists who 'follow the varying yet always literal and naturalistic practice of the Dutch cabinet painters'. \n\n<b>Beg! A Dog's Lesson</b> \n1004-1886 Neg 57162 \nPanel, 24.1 X 34.6 cm (9\u00bd X 13 5/8 ins) \nSigned and dated 'A Proviso 1860' bl \nDixon Bequest 1886 \nA label on the back is inscribed 'The Beggar'/No 2 Alfred Provis/Elm's Cottage/Brentford'. Provis exhibited a painting with this title at the RA in 1861, which may be identical with the present work. Other similar subjects seem to be 'Boy and Dog', (BI 1853), 'Sit up!' (RA 1863) and 'Sit up, Sir!' (RA 1865). None of these exhibited works, curiously, were noticed by the critics of the<u> Art Journal</u> or <u>Athenaeum. </u>\nThe vaulted interior, painted in some detail, was presumably studied from an actual location, perhaps the crypt of a monastery in Essex used as a farmhouse. \n\nLIT: W Shaw Sparrow 'The Dixon Bequest at Bethnal Green.
