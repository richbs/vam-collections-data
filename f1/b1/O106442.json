This head is formed of two half-dragons, their bodies conjoined in the centre. On acquisition the object was thought to be German or Scandinavian, and to date from the twelfth century. Later there were also thoughts of it being Rhenish and Spanish. However it was almost certainly made for the Eastern Church, and has been convincingly dated to a much later period. Comparisons can be made with analogous works in the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, known to be from Constantinople, and thought to date from the second half of the seventeenth century. It was perhaps produced at the Ottoman Court. \nTau heads formed the tops of crosses or staffs in the shape of a T, the Greek letter \u2018tau\u2019, hence the name.",

Later there were also thoughts of it being Rhenish and Spanish. However it was almost certainly made for the Eastern Church, and has been convincingly dated to a much later period. Comparisons can be made with analogous works in the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, known to be from Constantinople, and thought to date from the second half of the seventeenth century. It was perhaps produced at the Ottoman Court.",
