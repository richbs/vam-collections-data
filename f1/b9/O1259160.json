These small boxes, sold for a few pence, are bold and colourful, some simple and na\u00efve, others more complex and detailed. The images range from gods and goddesses, women, flowers, fruits, monuments, transport, tools, consumer goods and more. Successful covers are continuously copied and there can be endless variations of one particular image produced by rival companies. Many covers have a \u2018retro\u2019 feel about them because of this copying process, this also makes them difficult to date.  Despite their ephemeral nature, they can convey historical, political and social information.  Matchbox art dates back to the 1920s when India began producing its own matches from factories in Calcutta  in Bengal and Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu. Prior to this, matches were imported from Europe, mainly Sweden, and Japan. Early images reflect themes of nationalism while more recent images include planes, motorcycles and trucks.",
