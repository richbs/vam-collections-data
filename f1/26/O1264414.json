His father was a nuclear scientist and the family traveled extensively during Nick\u2019s childhood.  He studied art at Trent Polytechic and the RCA.  Waplington gained recognition early in his career for the project The Living Room, which documents the daily lives of two close-knit working class families in Nottingham, in the late eighties and early nineties.  He is well known for photographs of his family and friends, of places and events that he has witnessed first hand. Taken as a whole they suggest a personal diary, yet also build up to provide a picture of our times, chronicling life on the streets of East London, or at festivals, street parties and demonstrations.\n\nIn 2008, the British fashion designer Lee Alexander McQueen (1969-2010) commissioned Waplington to photograph the creation of his Horn of Plenty collection for publication as a book.  The photographs of the dress in different states of completion were to be interspersed with images by Waplington of recycling plants, rubbish dumps and landfill sites.  The images were arranged in sequence by McQueen himself before he died.  Waplington\u2019s photographs ensure the historical importance of this dress; it is the last fully documented work and arguably the most poignant of McQueen\u2019s life.",
