His imaginative and lavish costumes and sets informed by historical styles proved an effective complement to many productions, especially Mozart and Rossini operas.  He also designed programme covers, working variations on his designs for the productions on which he had worked that year.  This design, for the 1959 season's programme, features the rose from Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\n\nA proof copy of the design for a Glyndebourne programme cover for 1959, featuring the rose from Der Rosenkavalier, an opera by Richard Strauss (1909-1910),  performed in tribute to Carl Ebert, who retired that year after 25 years as the director of Glyndebourne.",
