Note that single columns and brackets (cut with a right-angle behind) have been used at the corners. \n\nBox and lid have been lined (before 1866, when it was marked with the Museum number) with red paper, with painted gilt marbling. There is no evidence of grooves for internal dividers. The bottom is painted black with gilt marbling of a similar character to that on the paper lining. Underneath this painted layer are traces of similar gilding on the bare wood. There are six small gilt bronze/brass lion-headed handles (two on the front, two on the back of the box, and two on the lid), which are now missing cords.\n\nThe box is relatively crudely constructed, with glued butt-joints (and mitred mouldings). Various areas have been reglued, and some areas have been overpainted.",

Contemporary illustrations show such boxes hung on the wall in a bed chamber beside a dressing mirror with similar decoration. This type of decoration appears to have been a Venetian speciality, found from about 1570 on musical instruments, book-bindings, caskets and frames. The lustrous colours painted on bone (or sometimes mother-of-pearl) emulated the decorated surfaces of imported products which were probably described at the time as alla zemina (in the Persian manner), or petteniera turchesca (in the Turkish manner).",

            "history_note": "Bought from the Farrer sale.\n\nSome evidence suggests that this was a toilette box (cassa da pettenti) used for combs, brushes and other small objects useful for the toilette. A strikingly similar box survives in the Kunsthistorische Museum, Vienna inv. no. 4103-4122, from the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tyrol, with internal compartments (unlike 217-1866) which contain six ivory combs, brushes, a gilt pair of scissors, various iron instruments, a bone earspoon, a mirror and a filigree glass bottle, and is 'veneered with bone pilasters and mother of pearl panels with orientalizing motifs in translucent colour. Silken cord with gold thread and tassel pulled through lion masks on the case and lid.' (WINDISCH-GRAETZ, Franz: M\u00f6bel Europa. 2. Renaissance-Manierismus (Munich, 1982), p.242). A print from Giovanni Andrea dalla Croce Chirurgiae universalis opus absolutum, Venice, 1596 (illustrated in Thornton, The Italian Renaissance Interior (London 1991), fig. 270, shows a box of this form hanging from a high shelf beside a mirror with shutter (cf V&A 218-1866) in a bed chamber, presumably useful for the toilette. Bartolomeo Scappi (Opera Venice, 1570, tavola XXIV) shows a similar rectangular lidded box (without obvious painted decoration) containing implements for the toilette. Hans Huth (1971) p.5 places the V&A box within this class of toilette cases.\n\nThe box is relatively crudely constructed, with glued butt-joints, and it may be that it was constructed by members of the painter's workshop who lacked (or were prohibited from using) more sophisticated construction skills. The same type of construction is seen on a casket in the Metropolitan Museum, New York with painted bone plaques and rosewood veneers (cataloguer to check this)",

            "historical_context_note": "For discussion of this type of painted decoration, see\nHans Huth: Lacquer of the West. The History of a craft and an industry, 1550 - 1950. (Chicago, 1971), chapter 1; Peter Thornton, Form and Decoration (London, 1998), chapter 3; Clelia Alberici: Il Mobile Veneto (Milan, 1980), p.61ff.; Anna Contadini 'Middle-Eastern objects' in At Home in Renaissance Italy, eds.Marta Ajmar-Wollheim and Flora Dennis (London, 2006), p308ff.; Monika Kopplin, European Lacquer (Munich, 2010), pp.23-34\n\nFine lacquerwork was made in Persia during the 16th century. It was commonly decorated with moresques executed in gold: this was done on relatively small items, such as folding book-rests, book-covers, containers for writing materials, etc. Such objects excited the admiration of Europeans whenever they saw them, and early imitations of this work embodying moresque decoration were made in Venice. The technique was deemed suitable for embellishing the covers of highly important government documents, so apparently carried no light-hearted or frivolous connotation in the way that imitations of Chinese artefacts were often to do later. Venetian lacquer was also used for making small objects, such as jewel caskets covered with moresques, although entirely occidental figure-subjects occasionally occupy panels within the imitation Islamic ornament. Sometimes the ground of the panels in such work was made of mother-of-pearl which reflects light back through the painted deocration applied on to it. A similar effect was contrived with a gold ground over which painted decoration was applied; the colours were often applied so as to form \u2018the ground\u2019, leaving the pattern itself unpainted (reserved as it is called).. exemplified on the V&A \u2018Queen Elizabeth virginals\u2019 (about 1570) or a harp ordered for the private orchestra of Duke Alfonso d\u2019Este (1581, Rome). Thornton pp.34-5\n\nHuth says that from the 13th century Venice had been an entry point to Europe for goods (earthenware, metalwork, textiles, jewelry and lacquerware) from the Levant and Orient. A Venetian document of 1283 consists of rules for the depentores (those working with a brush, involved in the production of varnished caskets, tables and woodwork). The decoration of wares as opposed to simply protecting them with varnishes seems to have begun during the mid 16th century. A Syrian craft which may have inspired Venetian artisans working in lacquer was the practice of damascening metal, known in Milan and Venice as early as 1300. The Italian craftsmen (no oriental craftsmen resided in Venice) who practised this art  were called azziministi. Another Oriental craft introduced to Venice from the late 15th century was the practise of fashioning elaborate bindings for books. Venetian copies or adaptations of lacquered bindings \u2018in the Persian style\u2019 date from the middle of the 16th century (eg Binding, Museo Correr 1570-77). European engravings based on Moresque designs, such as those by \u2018the Master F\u2019, were circulating in Italian workshops as early as 1520. Venetian shields of wood covered with parchment, painted with knotwork and scrolls, and with areas in white, red and green that shone through the varnish, giving the effect of lacquer survive in armeria of the Doge\u2019s palace (Venice ) and from the household of the Bishop of Salzburg. Huth discusses other types of object (probably Venetian) with similar decoration, which may have been what was referred to by Italians variously as \u2018frissi grottesche\u2019, \u2018alla zemina\u2019 in the Persian manner, \u2018petteniera turchesca\u2019 in the Turkish manner: a quiver case, a folding table, small cases (casse da pettenti), caskets (scrigni or possibly what was known as \u2018casse da conzar il cao\u2019, boxes for dressing the hair), mirror frames and frames of architectural form with or without inset marble plaques, cuoridoro shields (described by Contadini in At Home in Renaissance Italy eds. Ajmar-Wollheim, and Dennis, pp.319-321), cabinets with leather coverings and musical instruments such as harpsichords and harps.\n\nKopplin notes that Venice traded in shellac, mainly from north-east India, Indochina and Sumatra, and maintains that Islamic lacquered objects (made from as early as the 10th/11th centuries) were undoubtedly present in Venice by the 16th century. Recent studies of the techniques used found that Venetian 'lacquer' was generally made up of linseed oil and colophony derived from pine resin, a composition also mentioned in contemporary writings such as Leonardo Fioravanti (1517-1588) in his 'Compendio  di secreti rationali' (Venice 1562). Turpentine of larch, also known as 'Venice turpentine' was also used, though not sandarac, the most important resin in Islamic lacquerwork but problematic on account of its limited availability and complex preparation. Arabesques were applied in powdered gold on the black-painted wood, and gold leaf employed for gilding larger decorative surfaces which were then given a luminous glow through a lustre finish in a variety of colours. Tempera was probably used as well as oils, and a final coat of glossy varnish applied. These studies suggest that the stylistic imitation of Islamic models was coupled with the use of largely identical techniques (p.24, citing Adriana Rizzo, 'Le \"laque\" v\u00e9nitien: Une approche scientifique', in Venise et l'Orient 828-1797, exh. cat., Institut du monde arabe, Paris (2006), pp. 244-51)",
