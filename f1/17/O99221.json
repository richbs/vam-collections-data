It is extraordinary to imagine them in the  sumptuous Palace of Versailles in the apartments the French princess shared with  her other unmarried sisters, perhaps reflected in a mirror behind a pier table or on  a maneltpiece.  In the S\u00e8vres factory archives today the original ledger recording  her purchase survives,  revealing she paid 420 livres  for them in December 1772.   She was a good customer of the factory and even had a vase shape named after  her (perhaps because she commissioned it), a pair of which can be seen at  Harewood House in West Yorkshire today.  An inkstand with her initials and her  father's portrait is in the Wallace Collection and was probably a gift from Louis XV  to his favorite daughter in 1756.\n\n\tThe vases are in the elegant, but rather austere, neo-classical style which is  characterised by simple shapes and bold motifs taken from classical architecture  and decorative art.  The male and female heads in the medallions are painted 'en  grisaille' , as the grey tones imitate carved marble reliefs found on roundels on  ancient Roman buildings or tombs.  Only three pairs of this model appear to have  been made, suggesting it did not find favour with most aristocratic buyers of  porcelain, the shape being perhaps too severe.",
