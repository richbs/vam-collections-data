The action centres around the ritual celebration of fertility and is a blend of the present with the timeless.   If Tippett's visionary opera is to work, it has to be rooted in reality and in this production the costumes were an important element in creating the right context for the audience's imagination.   \nThroughout Stubbs used colour to suggest the progress of the trials undergone by the young people in the course of the opera. The silvery greys used for the Ancients were in deliberate contrast to the bright, lush greens, suggesting fertility, which were associated with the young people (see S.1140-1982).  The opera was a reworking of Mozart's The Magic Flute and the Ancients replace the parts taken by Sarastro and his priests in that opera, although in Tippett's opera one Ancient is male and one female.  In this design the figures are asexual and the difference would be heard only in the vocal line.  \nThe design is not a clear blueprint, but rather an imaginative suggestion of what the finished costumes should look like. With such indefinite, but impressionistic designs, the makers work closely with the designer to realise the concept.",
