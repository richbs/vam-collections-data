She was the niece of Marie Taglioni, greatest of all the ballerinas of the time and her father, Paul, was a leading dancer and choreographer.  \nMarie Paul is performing a solo based on a Polish dance; red and white are their national colours and the square cap is a feature of their national dress. The yellow flashes on her boot heels are metal trims or small spurs that chime when the heels are clicked together, a characteristic movement in Polish folk dance.  \nNational dances and settings were popular in the 1840s as audiences became increasingly aware of \u2018abroad\u2019 and exotic locations.  Scotland, Spain, Hungary, Poland and the Balkans were all popular settings and some ballets were set as far afield as India, giving the opportunity for balleticized versions of national dances, like the Cachucha, mazurka, polka, polonaise, tarentella or Cracovienne.",
