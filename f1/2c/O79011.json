Images created from cut-out paper are usually set against a background of contrasting colour, and sometimes material too. Here blue silk is the background. The silk is sewn in white thread with small stars. The paper was cut out with a penknife. It was unusual for a professional artist to practice this skill, but Nathaniel Bermingham (active 1740-1774) was also responsible for  promoting the technique as a fashionable female diversion in London.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nFrederick, Prince of Wales (born 1707), the son of George II and father of George III, died suddenly in his mid-forties. The image, based on an engraving, commemorates his death.  The Prince's portrait, framed in a laurel wreath, is mourned over by Britannia, the personification of  Britain. The royal coat of arms, surrounded by the ribbon with the motto of the Order of the Garter, is supported by a seated child. \n\nPeople\nNathaniel Bermingham advertised his skill in obtaining exact likenesses 'with all the shades of the face without the help of colours' in the Dublin Daily Advertiser in 1740. He is recorded in London in 1744, and regularly exhibited his work in the capital in the 1770s.",
