In this particular photograph, the thinness of paper and the dullness of albumen indicate an early example of that process dating from the1850s to the 1860s. It comes from an album of photographs from the Victorian metalworker Francis Skidmore's (1817-1896) firm. It is of  a pair of gates and is inscribed 'Designed and fitted by WF'.  The identity of this designer is unkown. The gates may have been made either in West Orchard or Alma Street, Coventry.  The photograph is thus a record of the work done. Francis Skidmore was a leading Victorian metalworker in the Gothic Revival style, which was an architectural movement the nineteenth-century practitioners of which sought to revive medieval forms.",
