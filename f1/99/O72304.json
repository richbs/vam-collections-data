Richard Hamilton (b.1922), <i>The Critic Laughs</i>, 1968. Offset lithograph, laminated, and retouched with enamel paint, and screen-print with collage. 59.5 x 46.5.</b> \nThis print is a dig at the obsession with originality and technique that was raging at the time of its production. It was made from a photograph, reproduced by photo-offset-lithography, laminated with plastic film to heighten its photographic impact. The margins were screenprinted with a matt white which simulated the effect of a photograph mounted on a matt board. Thick paint was applied to the photographic print prior to reproduction, and more was added to each print after lamination as well as a little piece of collage. The print is therefore a dialogue between photomechanical and handmade marks.'",
