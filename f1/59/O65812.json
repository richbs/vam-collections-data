The two figures holding the body are probably Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both wealthy pious Jews.\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew relates that Joseph of Arimathea was present at the Crucifixion and was given permission to remove Christ's body, enshroud it and lay it to rest in his own family tomb. The Gospel of John records that Joseph was assisted by Nicodemus, who brought myrrh and aloes to preserve Christ's body.\n\nGerhard Remisch was a glass painter and head of a prolific workshop in the Rhineland in the period 1500-1600.",
