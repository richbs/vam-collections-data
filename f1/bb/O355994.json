            "public_access_description": "This scene of idealised rural pursuits in a rustic setting is typical of the pastoral scenes printed on cotton textiles in the late 18th century in various centres of cotton printing across northern Europe, including Nantes. \n\nThe design is known as the Jeu de Bagues or Game of Rings, although it consists of three scenes, including the one showing this game in which people try to life a ring with a narrow stick while seated on a roundabout turned by hand. Several such roundabouts to play this game were set up in Parisian public parks from the 1770s onwards. The fashions worn by the players reveal that this piece dates to the early 19th century, as the women are wearing the high-waisted gowns associated with Napoleon's Imperial Court (hence, the common name Empire styles).The other scenes show Blind Man's Buff at the top and coffee-drinking below, while the main scene is flanked by a couple - a soldier and his lady - strolling in the park",
