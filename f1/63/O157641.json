They are divided into six panels forming three registers, with the horizontally adjacent recessed relief panels relating thematically to one another. Equestrian hunting scenes occupy the top register, a royal couple and floral sprays on punched matted ground the middle, and combatant animals in landscapes the bottom. The panels are framed with wide borders of stylized lotuses and split acanthus leaves; the top panel has corner borders of false brackets with scalloped arches, which are decorated with lotus medallions and tendrils. The centre of the overlapping element is embossed with an elephant-headed deity. A drop-ring handle is fitted to the central panel of each door, each pendant from an applied elephant's head, and a pendant hasp for hooking the door open is applied to the upper right panel. The plain borders on the sides that would be fitted to the door jambs have iron hinge pins at the corners. The backs of the doors are covered with plain silver sheets.",
