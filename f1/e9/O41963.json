The production was directed by William Gaskill.   Herbert's designs had previously been sold by Ifan Kyrle Fletcher in 1963: they appear as Item 128 in the Ifan Kyrle Fletcher Catalogue, number 207, July 1963.\n\nHistorical significance: A design for the world premiere of Brecht's Baal, dating from a period when Jocelyn Herbert's work was exerting considerable influence on British theatre design. The production is significant in the career of its director, William Gaskill, being Gaskill's first essay in Brecht, a dramatist with whom he became closely associated.",
