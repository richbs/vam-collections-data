The central panel shows two young women flirting with a man. One of the women is gesturing with a closed fan alluding to the potential role of a fan in romantic interchanges. The portraits to either side are framed with metal embroidery and imitate portrait miniatures.  The central image is signed 'Rosie Haughton'. We do not know in what capacity this artist painted the fan, or whether she was a professional or amateur. In the 19th century fan painting was considered an appropriate pass-time for genteel women.",
