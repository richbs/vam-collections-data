II, p. 166 (as <i>Ormonde</i> in his list of works by Cooper sold at Christie's; omitted from the main list); Long 1930, p. 92 (Anon., possibly <i>1st Duke of Ormonde</i>, ?seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century copy); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 70 (Anon., perhaps <i>Ormonde</i>, late nineteenth-century copy). \n\nUntil it came to the Museum, the miniature was not questioned as a work of Samuel Cooper. Long first raised doubts on technical grounds (the blue stippling), and pointed out that the word <i>Pense</i> on the George was misspelt with an<i>A</i>, and that Cooper, a linguist, would hardly have made an elementary mistake in such a familiar word. (1) He regarded it as an old copy of a signed miniature by Hoskins in the Beauchamp Collection, there identified as <i>James, Duke of Hamilton</i>, with the motto correctly spelt. Long in fact did not see this miniature out of its case and it was therefore difficult for him to recognise certain technical features that point strongly to a date in the later nineteenth century. The absence of a carnation ground under the very broad bright blue stipple, the extreme transparency of the washes, especially in the armour where the lights are washed out rather than added in opaque grey or white, and the lavish use of gum to obtain depth and lustre in the dark passages, are regular characteristics of nineteenth-century fakes. The card on which the vellum is laid is clearly machine-made, and the condition of the whole assemblage, in its pristine cleanliness, is incompatible with an early date. In many respects the technique resembles that of the so-called <i>Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex</i>, (2) which may be by the same hand.  \n \nFakers sometimes leave an obvious mark, visible to those willing to see it, showing that the work is a fake: the misspelling of Pense on the present miniature may be such a mark.  \nSeveral apparently related images exist, and they all derive directly or indirectly from a picture attributed to Egmont at Claydon House in Buckinghamshire. (3) According to Piper,(4) the Claydon picture is the only pre- Restoration portrait of Ormonde, and since this miniature has always been known as Ormonde, whoever painted it must have known the Egmont as well as the Beauchamp miniature by Hoskins. Other related miniatures, which seem to be genuine seventeenth-century works, differ quite widely from one another and from the Egmont; in their diaspora they have picked up many different names and attributions, and some have been further transformed by restorers. Examples are: \n\n1  <i>Gentleman</i>, 'in oil', said to be by Flatman, Christie's 9 July 1925 ,lot 321, repro.; very similar to the Beauchamp miniature. \n2  <i>Lord Effingham</i>, attributed to the school of Peter Oliver, Pierpont Morgan Collection, Williamson 1906-8, vol. I, no. 73; Christie's 24 June 1935, lot 195; Christie's 24 June 1975 , lot 54 (illus. pl, 3 as William, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, perhaps by Des Granges). \n3  <i>Richard Cromwell</i>, signed in gold SC, in a nineteenth-century frame (Williamson, 'Miniatures belonging to the Earl of Mayo' , Connoisseur, XXIII, (April 1909), p. 262, repro. p.261; said by Williamson to be 'probably Henry Cromwell'). \n4  <i>Ormonde</i>, signed in gold SC, but in a plain silver scroll-hanger locket; ex-Hickson \nCollection, now collection of Mrs Hamilton; possibly the same as 3. \n\nMrs Hamilton, to whom I am indebted, especially for the reference to 3 rightly regards the identity of her miniature as clinched by the Egmont, but argues that others of the miniatures, although they may be of Ormonde, are 'not the same portrait'. She sees no connection between her miniature by Cooper and the Beauchamp Hoskins citing differences in hair colour, the elaboration of the armour, and the fact that her miniature lacks the landscape background and the insignia of the Garter as evidence that they were from different sittings, and may even be of different people.  \n \nThis is possible, but the physical similarity between the sitters and their poses suggests rather a different relationship between the several images, - and the Cooper, which lacks the George (and is therefore pre-September 1649, when Ormonde was nominated to the Order by Charles II at St Germain) would be the earliest. If so, the Egmont would be a rare example of a portrait in large being derived from a miniature (see discussion of this under Cat. No. 35). The Hoskins type would then follow as a variant, produced from the same face-mask, and similarly updated to take account of the Garter, in circumstances in which Ormonde himself, in France during the 1650s, was not accessible for a new sitting.  \n \n1 MS note in departmental file. \n2 Fitzwilliam Museum; Bayne-PowellI985, pp. 57-8, as by Des Granges; personal communication, V J Murrell. \n3 National Trust; Lady Burghclere, <i>Life of James, 1st Duke of Ormonde</i> (1912), vol.1, repro. frontispiece; C V Wedgwood, <i>The King's War</i> (1958), p. 160. \n4 Piper 1963, p. 259.\"",
