Visually impaired from birth as a 'high myopic' she also developed cataracts in mid-life, but an operation at Moorfields Eye Hospital in 2007 left her sight much improved. After years of 'living in thick brown gravy' as she described her visual ability, colours came back. \n\nIn much of her work she uses the barcode as motif and signifier. In a barcode, each sequence of bars, while looking quite similar to the next, is unique, and the key to very specific information. While Brendon is unable to attain the detail and precision of image making that fully sighted artists might, she can still make works that refer to the significance of coded messages.Much of her work uses actual photographs of the eye, taken by herself as well as a professional opthalmic photographer.\n\n Two of her prints in the Sightlines series are dedicated to her surgeon, Jonathan Dowler. In 2008 Moorfields Hospital hosted an exhibition of her work in their foyer.",
