It was commissioned as a vehicle in which he could star with Ellen Terry as Guenever, written by James Comyns Carr, and was performed on a spectacular scale, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nThe sets, costumes and props were designed by Edward Burne-Jones, who had worked on numerous art works with an Arthurian theme, including paintings, murals and his stained-glass panels for Harden Grange, in Yorkshire. Comyns Carr asked Burne-Jones to design the production whilst the artist was working on his magnum opus, The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon. \n\nThe property sword itself is based on the 'Sword of Saint Maurice' from Austria. This was a sword used by emperors of the Holy Roman Empire in coronation ceremonies, forged in the 12th Century, and now kept at the Weltliche Schatzkammer in Vienna.",
