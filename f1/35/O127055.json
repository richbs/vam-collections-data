Samuel Joseph (1791-1850) was one of the founding members of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1826, and exhibited there from 1827 until 1844. He worked in London as well as Edinburgh. He specialised in portrait busts, but also executed funerary monuments, such as the one to William Wilberforce in Westminster Abbey.
