It was worn by the nomadic tribes of Central Asia, in the present region of Turkmenistan and parts of northern Iran and Afghanistan.  Although individual pieces rarely date from any earlier than the 19th century, many of the designs and symbols used are much older, often pre-Islamic in origin.  \n\nThese lozenge-shaped breast ornaments, sparsely decorated with applied gallery wire and cornelians, were sewn to the garment in pairs, and often have a hook and eye so that they can be used to fasten the front opening.  The name chanjuk (or gondshuk) derives from a Turkic word meaning flat.\n\nThey were acquired in Turkestan in 1884-5, during an Anglo-Russian conference to define the north-west frontier of Afghanistan, and were given to the Museum in 1900.",
