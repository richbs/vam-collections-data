She was born in St Petersburg in 1876, studied at St Petersburg Theatre School and graduated into the Maryinsky Ballet in 1895, a year later marrying the famous character dancer Jozef Kshessinsky. She subsequently danced with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes from 1909 to 1911.  She later opened a school in London where her pupils included Alicia Markova, Anton Dolin and Margot Fonteyn. The bust by Mrs Haskell dates from about 1927.\n\nSerafina Astafieva died in 1934 and there is a blue plaque outside The Pheasantry, her former studio at 152 Kings Road, where Diaghilev was a frequent visitor. The Pheasantry currently (2005) houses apartments, shops and a restaurant which has retained Madame Astafieva's mirrors and practice barre as a feature on the first floor.",
