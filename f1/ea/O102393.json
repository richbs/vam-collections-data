Elssler stands on her right leg, the foot turned out, with her left leg pointed forward; her head is turned to right and her right arm is down, holding Taglioni's hand, and her left is raised, holding Cerrito's hand; she wears a stylized Spanish dress, with off-the-shoulder pointed bodice and short sleeves, trimmed with 'gold' and black lace; the calf-length tiered skirt has a pleated top tier trimmed with a deep flounce of black lace held by 'gold' ribbon; the underskirt is trimmed with black lace and gold ribbon.  Her stockings are patterned and her hair is centrally parted and pulled back into a 'coronet' and trimmed with a knot of flowers.  Taglioni stands on point on her left leg, her body turned in profile; her hair is pulled back into ringlets at the back and over the front a double band of roses; she wears an off-the shoulder costume with loose frills over the upper arms, a ribbon around the waist and a knee-length skirt.  Cerrito stands on point on her left leg, her right raised off the ground, her body arched away from the centre and her head turned towards the viewer under her raised right arm; she wears a fitted, short-sleeved bodice decorated with bands of flowers at back and sleeves; around the body is a sash decorated with stars and her above-the-knee skirt is similarly decorated.",

The costumes symbolise the characters: Taglioni's diaphanous and insubstantial dress symbolises the Sylph as a creature of the air and imagination.  Elssler's dress is in mid-19th century style, but hints at Spain in the headdress and the lace flounces; her performance of the Cachucha was so overwhelming that, when she danced in Washington, Congress decided not to convene when she was dancing.  Cerrito's short tunic dress is typical theatrical Grecian costume while the crescent moon headdress and bow and arrow identify her as Diana, goddess of the hunt and the moon.",
