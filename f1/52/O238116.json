            "historical_context_note": "Ilmari Tapiovaara (1914-1999)\n\nInterior designer\n\nIlmari Tapiovaara graduated in 1937 as interior architect from the department of furniture design of the Central School of Arts and Crafts. After graduating, he travelled to France to visit the Paris World\u2019s Fair. On this trip, he obtained an assistant\u2019s position for six months at the office of Le Corbusier.\n\nIn 1938, Tapiovaara was engaged by the Asko company, Finland\u2019s largest furniture factory, as designer and artistic director. In the autumn of 1939, a housing fair was staged in Helsinki, which, however, had to be closed before long because of the risk of war. The exhibition featured a multipurpose set of furniture designed by Tapiovaara for Asko. In 1941, Tapiovaara became the artistic and commercial director of the Keravan Puuteollisuus furniture company. In 1946-47, he and his wife Annikki Tapiovaara designed furniture for the new Domus Academica student-housing complex in Helsinki. One of the best-known items among those designs is the Domus chair, which began to be produced in series. Tapiovaara\u2019s Lukki chair was meant for the student housing facilities of the Helsinki University of Technology, which were built in the early 1950s. The innovation of this chair design was its combination of form-pressed plywood and curved metal tubing. In 1951, Tapiovaara and his wife established their own office and the couple designed for several firms and companies.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Tapiovaara served in East Karelia, where his work included the planning and realization of construction work and the mechanical production of structural elements. He designed dugout shelters, canteens, saunas, furniture and utility items for the Finnish army. In the late stages of the war, he guided crafts activities among servicemen by designing models.\n\nIlmari Tapiovaara also worked abroad in various capacities. In 1952-53, he was a professor at the school of design of the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago and he worked for a while in the office of Mies van der Rohe. In the late 1950s, Tapiovaara went to Paraguay in connection with a UN development project to design furniture and in the mid-1970s he worked on a similar project in Mauritius. He also served in an expert capacity in former Yugoslavia in developing a furniture and joinery industry centre. Tapiovaara also designed furniture for Italian and Swedish clients among others.\n\nTapiovaara admired the works of Alvar Aalto and wanted carry on Aalto\u2019s ideas in his own design work. This was evident in applying wood to the idiom of functionalism and industrial production and in the fact that Tapiovaara adopted the principle of social equality of functionalism. In his designs, Tapiovaara always sought to create a humane, well-lit and warm dwelling environment. The furniture designed by him were always part of a whole, with the architecture as their starting point\n\nAlongside dozens of chairs and other furniture, mostly for public premises, Tapiovaara also designed interiors for numerous banks, offices, hotels and shops since the 1940s. These works included eleven business premises for the Kaivotalo building (1957), the Olivetti showroom (1954), the Hotel Marski (1960), as well as Lauttasaari Church including lighting and ecclesiastical objects (1957) and the Hotel Intercontinental (1971). All these projects were in Helsinki.\n\nExhibition design was one area of Tapiovaara\u2019s extensive oeuvre. In 1957, Finland\u2019s first exhibition of industrial design was held along with the annual exhibition of the Finnish Society of Craft and Design. The exhibition design was by Tapiovaara. Other exhibitions of industrial design planned by Tapiovaara were the rare showings held in Moscow and Tallinn in 1961. His solo exhibitions were Kuutio (Cube) 73 and Muoto (Form) 78.\n\nTapiovaara was head of the department of interior design at the Institute of Applied Arts and senior instructor at the department from 1951 to 1954, and teacher of industrial design in 1954-1956. He sought to reform teaching towards industrial product design with the aid of international and American examples. Tapiovaara also taught interior design at the Helsinki University of Technology from 1964 to 1968.\n\nIlmari Tapiovaara was awarded a total of six gold medals at the Milan triennials of 1951, 1954, 1957, 1960 and 1964. He received Good Design Award in Chicago in 1951, the Pro Finlandia medal in 1959, the Finnish State Design Prize in 1971 and the Furniture Prize of the SIO Interior Architects\u2019 Association of Finland in 1990.\n\nAuli Suortti-Vuorio\n\n\nBibliography:\nIlmari Tapiovaara.
