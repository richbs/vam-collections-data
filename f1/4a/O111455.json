He was born into an artistic family; his father, Henry Weekes, was professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy from 1868-1876 and  his elder brother, Henry, was also a genre painter.  Herbert William Weekes spent his working life residing at 21 Oppingdon Road, Primrose Hill, London.  He delighted in anthropomorphising animals in such paintings as 'You are sitting in my nest', 'Prattlers and cracklers', 'The patient and the quacks' and 'A snap for the lot', and his work demonstrates a sensitive understanding of his subject matter.",
