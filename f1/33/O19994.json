They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars. \n\nThis Company painting is part of an album, now known as the Gentil Album, of 58 paintings commissioned by a French infantry colonel, Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gentil (1726-1799), who served under Shuja ud-Daula of Oudh from 1774 until 1786. It shows various pieces of Indian women's jewellery, including necklaces, bracelets, ear-rings, rings, and what are perhaps hair-ornaments and brooches.",
