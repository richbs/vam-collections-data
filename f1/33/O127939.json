Among the major developments was the introduction of a new method of refining cobalt. This resulted in much brighter and more intense shades of blue and allowed more subtle expressions of light and shade to be effected. The painterly style of decoration seen on this vase could not have been achieved before these changes.\n\nThe use of large scale landscape designs, covering the whole surface of a piece became widespread among popular wares during this period. As well as classical landscape scenes, popular dramas and stories were also commonly depicted on ceramics at this time.\n\nA proliferation of new shapes, including mallet and square shaped vases and very large vases like this one came in to fashion at this time, though they were rarely seen among imperial wares.",
