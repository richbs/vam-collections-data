The most obvious application is in the context of medicine and pharmacy, but they were also essential pieces of equipment in the household, where they were used not only to prepare food, but also simple medicines and cosmetics. Similarly they would be found in the studios of artists and craftsmen, as well as the laboratory of the alchemist. This example is a common type of mortar. Its profile and well as the level of wear suggests that it dates from the sixteenth or early seventeenth century and was produced in a North Italian centre.",
