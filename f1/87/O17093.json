On his left is Babur\u2019s son Humayun, the second Mughal emperor (r.1530\u20131540 and 1544\u20131545), who briefly lost the throne and was forced into exile in Iran. All are seated on jewelled thrones beneath parasols, an emblem of royalty. Before them stand their chief ministers, all identified in minuscule Persian inscriptions: on the right  is Bayram Khan, with Mirza Shah Rukh and Mirza Rustam in the middle and on the left  respectively. \n\nThe painting was done for Shah Jahan (r.1628\u20131658), perhaps to mark his accession. It came from a group of paintings now divided between the V&A and the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, popularly known as the \u2018Minto Album\u2019 from its association with a former owner, Lord Minto.",
