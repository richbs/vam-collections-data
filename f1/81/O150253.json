The Doulton firm began life making utililatarian stoneware products, such as pipes and water filters, before branching out into more decorative pieces to cater for the growing demand for stoneware inspired by past styles. This jug is in a loosely Italian reniassance style, although other pieces by the firm are closer in inspiration to German renaissance wares, such as Rhineish wine jugs.\n\nDoulton boatsed that every piece of its 'art' ware was unique, as decorators were given creative freedom. This jug is decorated with applied beading which, by its very nature, is difficult to make uniform across a large number of products. As testimony to Doulton's ethos of promoting the worker, most Doulton pieces were marked with the decorator's monogram, and the individuals who worked at the firm are well documented. Frank Butler, who decorated this vase, was one of Doulton's longest serving employees, spending nearly forty years at the firm, during which time he produced many thousands of vases, jugs, bowls and other pots.",
