The nawab was a distinguished chief who gave assistance to the British during the Second Maratha War of 1802-1803. He was the agent of the Alwar Raja in his dealings with Lord Lake, and in gratitude the British granted him the district of Loharu in hereditary rent-free tenure as well as Firozpur, one of the little states surrounding the British territory. \n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
