It was made in the nineteenth century when numerous finely crafted models of Indian monuments were created for English patrons who wanted a memento of the their service in, or trip to, India.  The marble was quarried in the Macrame mines near Jaipur, Rajasthan, and the hardstones used for the inlay were obtained from various imported and indigenous sources.\n\nThe pietre dure technique used for the model was originally taught to Indian artists in the seventeenth century by Florentine craftsmen lured to the Mughal court by accounts of its fabulous riches by returning travellers.  A number of Italian artists are known to have worked in India during the period and there are surviving records of trade, royal gifts, and missionary and diplomatic exchanges between the Mughal court and the Medici family of Florence.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
