The pieces in this drawer were used for liturgical purposes. Ivory carvings appeared on book covers, reliquary caskets, antependia (the panel in front of an altar) and religious icons.\nThe panel originally formed the back of a small casket. Holes at the top indicate the position of the hinges, and further holes at the bottom held metal pins to secure the base plate with mounts.\nThe figure style relates most closely to Lower-Rhenish carvings: The beasts on the panel may be compared with those on tablemen from Cologne of the second half of the 12th century.",
