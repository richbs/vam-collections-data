            "history_note": "Historical significance: Giambattista was one of the most renowned painters of eighteenth-century Italy. He studied in the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini. However Tiepolo moved away from the classicising style of his master, creating instead works with a focus on tonal qualities in the manner employed by his contemporaries Giambattista Piazzetta and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. This follows in the tradition of the sixteenth-century artist Tiepolo. Tiepolo began his career painting a series of canvases depicting <i>Prophets</i> and <i>Apostles</i> for S Maria dei Derelitti, Venice, in 1715-16. He is documented on the register of the Venetian confraternity of painters in the following year. \n\nBy the 1720's Tiepolo's success at home brought many commissions from outside Venice. Between 1725-6 he worked in Udine, on a scheme of frescoes for the Patriarchal Palace (now the Archbishop's Palace) for the Patricarch Dionsio Dolfin. In 1730-31 Tiepolo worked in Milan producing works including frescoes for five ceilings in the Palazzo Archinto. During the 1740s, Tiepolo was at the height of his fame. He produced paintings indcluding  the <i> Family of Darius before Alexander</i> (1743) and the frescoes of <i>The meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> for the Palazzo Labia, Venice. From 1750-3 Tiepolo worked in W\u00fcrzburg on a commission for frescoes of the ceiling and walls for the Kaisersaal of the Residenz at W\u00fcrzburg. Again in Venice, Tiepolo became the president of the Venetian Academy in 1756. In March, 1762, Tiepolo was summoned by Charles III of Spain (reigned 1759-88) to paint three ceiling frescoes in the Palacio Real, Madrid. He travelled that year with his sons, Giandomenico and Lorenzo, to work on the project. He was to remain in Spain until his death in 1770. Tiepolo's works ranged from frescoes and paintings on canvas of histories, mythologies and religious subjects. As well as these works, which were the result of commissions from patrons, Tiepolo also produced a series of etchings. Tiepolo was an expert printmaker. His output can be seen in the two main groups of etchings that he produced, the <i>Capricci</i>, a group of ten prints, and the 24 <i>Scherzi di fantasia</i>. Stylistically these works probably date to the 1730s or 1740s.\n\nThis is one of three drawings for figures in the <i>Stanza dell' Olimpo</i> in the <i>Foresteria</i> of the Villa Valmarana near Vicenza. These drawings are studies for mythological figures for the scheme of the <i>Stanza dell' Olimpo</i>. The drawings have been made on sheets of paper of approximately the same size (the present drawing measuring 20.7 x 16.3 cm). In each work the figure occupies the entire sheet. The drawings are executed in pen and wash over black chalk. The wash is applied to create the sharp fall of light and shade on the figures and drapery. This observation of light is characteristic of Tiepolo's work. \n\nIn this drawing the figure of Apollo is presented seated on a cloud, looking down. It is a study for the fresco of Apollo and Daphne. In his right hand he caries his lyre and in his left a quiver. Quick dashes have been made to create the impression of the halo which appears in the final work. The posture of the figure, with the head turned down and to the left, is very close to the final version, which shows Diana to the right, seated behind the sun god. In the fresco, Tiepolo places the left arm closer to the figure's body making Apollo appear to embrace it.",
