In the days of wet collodion on glass negatives (1850s-1870s) setting up a photograph was a complex procedure. It was rather like setting up a cinematic shot. For this reason John Szarkowski has described the period as photography\u2019s \u2018conceptual\u2019 era, because every photograph had to be planned in advance. Thus, Hawarden\u2019s photograph of this apparently spontaneous childhood moment was deliberately arranged. It was also very skilfully executed.",

Inscription (verso): No 81 105 x 81 mm PH 457-1968:311 Series 42 Literature:  Microfilm: 3.19.195 Comment: In the words of her sister Anne Bontine, Lady Hawarden was a 'great baby lover'. [National Library of Scotland, MS 10289.] Her devotion to her children, so evident in her photographs was praised by her uncle Mountstuart Elphinstone, who wrote that he 'never saw nicer children or better brought up. It seems strange in Clemy who could never keep her own shawl in order & whose devotion to her children seemed enough to spoil a whole generation, but her good sense and regard to duty has kept all right.' [Ibid.] The surreal quality of this image is enhanced by the casual positioning of the shiny button boots as if her feet were still in them'",
