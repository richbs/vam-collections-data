By the 1830s, artists had arrived from rural villages in Bengal and began to produce paintings that reflected local history, mythology, customs and conflicts of a colonised society. As a popular art form, these artists are recognised for their use of brilliant colour, simplified images and swift brushstrokes that became the hallmark of Kalighat painting in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nAcquired by the Museum from Miss M. Steele in 1950. This picture from a series which was being part of a collection inherited from her mother, a scholar in Sanskrit at Cambridge in 1894. When delivering the collection, Miss Steele reported that her grandmother had also lived in India for some time and that it was possible that the pictures were originally collected by her grandmother.",
