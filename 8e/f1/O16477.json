            "public_access_description": "Julia Margaret Cameron's career as a photographer began in 1863 when her daughter gave her a camera. Cameron began photographing everyone in sight. Because of the newness of photography as a practice, she was free to make her own rules and not be bound to convention. The kinds of images being made at the time did not interest Cameron. She was interested in capturing another kind of photographic truth. Not one dependent on accuracy of sharp detail, but one that depicted the emotional state of her sitter.\n\nCameron liked the soft focus portraits and the streak marks on her negatives, choosing to work with these irregularities, making them part of her pictures.  Although at the time Cameron was seen as an unconventional and experimental photographer, her images have a solid place in the history of photography.\n\nMost of Cameron's photographs are portraits. She used members of her family as sitters and made photographs than concentrated on their faces. She was interested in conveying their natural beauty, often asking female sitters to let down their hair so as to show them in a way that they were not accustomed to presenting themselves. In addition to making stunning and evocative portraits both of male and female subjects, Cameron also staged tableaux and posed her sitters in situations that simulated allegorical paintings.\n\nHistorian, essayist and moralist, Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881) was as much a literary hero as Tennyson, winning a large readership with such works as The French Revolution, A History (1837). The portrait made at Little Holland House, London, in 1867, probably at the time Carlyle was sitting for a portrait in oils by Cameron's friend G. F. Watts. A critic noted in 1868:  'The shaggy philosopher appears in every form of picturesque ruggedness, but there is one profile of him which gives the fire and tenderness present in no other famous face as it is in his, and which no painter has caught as well as Mrs Cameron has'.",
