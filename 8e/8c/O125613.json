His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel created a light-hearted pastiche of early Victorian style for Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, presented at the Old Vic Theatre on 27 December, 1937.   Tyrone Guthrie, the director, sought to reconcile Elizabethan comedy with the Old Vic\u2019s early Victorian architecture (1833) and Mendelssohn\u2019s (1809-1847) early Victorian incidental music.  He said that the music was \u2018redolent of crimson and gold opera houses, of operatic fairies in white muslin flying through groves of emerald canvas.\u2019  (Old Vic Theatre Programme, 27 December 1937).   \n\nVivien Leigh (1913-1967) played Titania, one of her first Shakespearean roles.  A. E. Wilson reported that she was \u2018like an exquisite picture from some Victorian lady\u2019s keepsake\u2019.  This costume sketch indicates the flowing lines of her early Victorian style white muslin dress, which Messel decorated with flowers and accessorized with insect wings.",
