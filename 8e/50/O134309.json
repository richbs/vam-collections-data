            "historical_context_note": "This maritime scene shows the Dorset, the royal yacht used by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the British monarch\u2019s official representative in Ireland, arriving in Dublin Bay. The yacht flies the Union flag at its mast head, indicating that the Lord Lieutenant may be on board. Poolbeg lighthouse, situated at the end of the North Bull wall of the Bay, is seen on the right, with its octagonal-lantern top and iron balustrade and gallery.\n\nThe painting, dated 1788, was probably executed as a result of Serres\u2019 trip to Ireland between 1787-88. In all likelihood it derives from a drawing, dated 1787, in the National Maritime Museum (<i>The Dorset yacht leaving Dublin harbour</i>, PAG9727). In contrast to the V&A work, this shows the Dorset heading out of port. However, in terms of its composition with Poolbeg lighthouse on the right, it is remarkably similar. With regard to the V&A painting, Alan Russett believes that the presence of the Union flag suggests that Serres may actually have witnessed the arrival of the Lord Lieutenant on board the Dorset (Alan Russett, <i>John Thomas Serres: The Tireless Enterprise of a Marine Artist</i>, Hampshire 2010, pp. 36-37). He further believes that Serres sent this painting to the Royal Academy (RA) in 1788 in a bid to obtain royal patronage, namely the position of Marine Painter to H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence. As Serres was awarded this position in 1789, the V&A work may have formed a critical part of his success.\n\nRussett also suggests that the currently untraceable <i>View taken from Howth looking towards Dublin\u2019s lighthouse</i>, exhibited at the RA in 1794, may have been executed as a pendant to the V&A painting (Russett, p.37).",
