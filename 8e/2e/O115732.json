He had studied art in his home town of W\u00fcrzburg and in Munich, and travelled widely in the early years of the 20th century.  He had studios in New York and London, and was a member of the Chelsea Arts Club.  His work is in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery, London; Balliol College, Oxford; the Museum of the City of New York; and the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, New Brunswick.  This painting is unusual amongst his work because it shows children: most of his portraits in oils were of adult sitters.  This portrait belongs to the pre-war period, from which much of his work was scattered and possibly lost because under Hitler's government he had to leave Germany.",
