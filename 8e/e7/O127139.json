A rectilinear arrangement can be seen in the figured pattern of vertical stripes and lines of floral and leafy motifs of the dress silk. Instead of curving ruffles of fabric, the gown is decorated with a thick, padded trim arranged in a zig-zag pattern. The white silk bobbin lace was known as \u2018blonde\u2019 and featured as a popular embellishment in 1770s fashion.",
