It forms part of the section 'Who are seats for? Eating and pooping', which explores how highchairs and potties help a young child exist in a larger world where chairs are adapted for their smaller bodies. It was acquired to show the development of potty design next to older examples.  \n\nThe Jane Winner potty is an example of imaginative design to encourage children to enjoy potty training. This design is a motorbike for the child to sit on. There are now numerous designs on the market that have developed in style far beyond the older wooden and ceramic potties.",
