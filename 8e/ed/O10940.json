This perforated sheet is then used as a stencil, and placed over another sheet of paper and pounced - that is dusted with powdered pigment to transfer the stencilled pattern onto the paper below. The resulting image will be uneven and unpredictable, and has an organic character, which is enhanced in the case of Judge's drawings by her choice of concentric patterns which suggest tree-rings, petals, seeds and similar natural forms.",
