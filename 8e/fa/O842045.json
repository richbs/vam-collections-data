Through a large part of his career he taught at the Royal Academy, and his pupils included architects such as Reginald Blomfield. A notable piece of architecture designed by him was Lord Monkwell\u2019s house, Chelsea which was built in the late Nineteenth century. He came second to Thomas Verity in a competition for the design of the Criterion Theatre in London. His architectural style borrowed from his experiences of archaeological pursuits in Egypt, Syria and the East.  His publications include the new edition of James Fergusson\u2019s <i>History of Architecture</i> (1866), <i>Architectural Drawing</i> (1887), and <i>The Architecture of Greece and Rome</i> (1903).",
