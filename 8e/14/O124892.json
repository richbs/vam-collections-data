It shows him wearing the white hart emblem that Richard adopted, on a chain around his neck. Richard succeeded to the throne when he was ten years old, on the death of his grandfather Edward III, since Richard's father The Black Prince had died a year before Edward.  William Shakespeare wrote his play Richard II around 1595 and this statuette may have been based on an actor who played the part of Richard in the early 1960s.\n\nIt was one of the items in the collection of the actor Robert Eddison which contained a wealth of theatrical items including ceramics of actors and actresses.  Since Eddison himself did not play the role of Richard it is not based on him, but probably collected as a continuation of the 19th century tradition.  Like all statuette of this type, it would have been modelled in wet clay, built up on a metal frame or armature.",
