Another, now headless, is in Munich (Berliner, R, Die Bildwerker der Bayerischen .....Museum, IV, Elfenheim, Augsburg, 1926, Cat. No. 65, Pl. 16).\nAll four chesspieces are similar; probably from the same workshop and possibly even from the same chess set. Comparisons of costume details seen in tapestries and manuscript illuminations support a date in the first quater of the sixteenth century. The Mirror of the Medieval World catalogue entry suggests a Netherlandish origin, noting a particularly striking similarity in the type of hat, skirt and horse trappings depicted in a series of four tapestries which originated in Tournai about 1515 (see Boccara,1971 nos. 30-32). While this is an accurate observation, the fashions of this time were not contained within political boundaries and the clothing depicted could equally be German.\nThe object therefore can currently only be attributed to either Germany or the Netherlands.  \n\nThe game of chess has from its inception carried chivalric and military associations. These qalities made the game a suitable intellectual passtime for the elite of Renaissance Europe. Luxury chess boards and and finely carved chess pieces became common possessions in palaces from Italy to England and as today, colour was used to distinguish between opposing chessmen.",
