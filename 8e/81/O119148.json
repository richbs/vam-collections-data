The whole appears to be some form of narrative as figures and animals are arranged in groups in different poses from each other. At the top of the field, two large heads with long jaws - a cross between baboon and crocodile; between them concentric circles of pattern emanating from a black stem. Below them to the left a circle of squatting figures apparently feasting, to the right a palm tree surrounded by fruits or vegetables sprouting leaves. Below and between them another figure with upturned head, the crown and jaw of which have been stretched into long points on either side of his body. To his left a horizontal figure and below this figure a horizontal crocodile. The crocodile confronts a pig which is stretched across the top of a pot in which squats a defecating figure. The lumps of excrement appear to be turning into fruits with leaves inside the pot. On either side of the pot groups of figures: on the right a diagonal line of them with fruits on their heads and to the right two masked figures and one leaping from the pot. Below this a group of figures in poses of begging or obeisance and others eating fruit. To the left palm trees and crouching figures with offerings. At the very bottom of the field a monkey-like figure with legs spread wide and upturned head.",

            "public_access_description": "Dennis Nona is one of a young generation who have led an artistic revival in the Torres Strait Islands, north of Australia. In 1998 Nona and fellow islanders formed the Mualgau Minaral Artist Cooperative. Most of the group had been to technical college in mainland Australia but returned to the islands. There they developed a particularly intricate linocut technique that combines distinctive woodcut patterns with figures from traditional myths and legends: sharks, turtles, plants, animals and human ancestors. \n\nThe prints are black and white, with some colour added using a \u2018doll\u2019 (\u2018poup\u00e9e\u2019) \u2013 a ball of muslin dipped in ink and then dabbed onto the plate in the appropriate places. The Mualgau Minaral artists re-named this process \u2018kaideral\u2019, which translates as \u2018spirit that creates ripples on the surface of the water\u2019. \n\nThe work of the collective is helping to disseminate information about this unique culture, whose existence has been threatened by multinational industries encroaching on the community\u2019s traditional fishing territories. This print illustrates the central place of fish and sea creatures in local life.",
