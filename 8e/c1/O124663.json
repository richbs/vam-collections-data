His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nCollette\u2019s (1873-1954) story about Gigi, a young Parisian girl tutored in the arts of a courtesan by her aunts but finds true love, was turned into a musical film by Lerner and Loewe in 1958 which they adapted for the stage in 1973.   First performed in San Francisco and then presented on Broadway, New York, critical reaction was lukewarm. Messel designed the costumes only, his last designs for the theatre.\n\nMessel used rich colours and gold and silver for the evening dresses on show at Maxims, a legendary Parisian restaurant at the turn of the nineteenth century.  The extremely elongated figure and neck of Madame Dumard caricatures Parisian sophistication.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first presented by Arnold Saint-Subber and Edwin Lester in San Francisco on 15 May 1973, then toured to St. Louis, Detroit and Toronto before being performed on Broadway at the Uris Theatre, New York on 13 November 1973.  It was directed by Joseph Hardy and featured Daniel Massey as Gaston Lachailles and Karin Wolfe as Gigi.   Roger Pinkham has said \u201cThe costumes are very much in the idiom of the turn of the century and are endlessly inventive bringing back much of the tenderness found in Renior and Bonnard.\u201d (Pinkham, ed., 1983). Lord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel's last commission for the stage.",
