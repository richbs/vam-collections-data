The head and body are in one piece with the limbs jointed at the shoulders, wrist, hips and ankles.  The body is generally pear shaped, smoothed to flat surfaces at articulation points with limbs.  There is a circular section inserted into the stomach with indented navel, in a lighter colour and different grain to the rest of the body.  The head is a reverse socket on the neck and glued to the body.  It has a stylized monkey face, with the back part of a darker wood.  To show the upper part of the face, a long curved section of lighter wood has been inserted.  Two black eyes, possibly glass, has also been inserted.  Slightly overlapping and below the insert are two panels of dark wood which form the lower half of the face with the lower jaw thrust forward.\nThe arms are long cylinders of wood, rounded at the shoulders.  The jointing is be means of a rubber band through metal pins which allows rotation and some lateral movement.  The hands are of lighter wood and hook shaped.  The wrist joints allow the hands to rotate.  The legs are shorter and slightly thicker than the arms; the feet are similar to the hands.  The hip jointing is like that of the shoulders and the ankles like the wrists.\n[Box] A window box, card printed in colours to show the title, maker's details and a jungle scene  by Henri Rouseau.  The window allows the monkey's face to look out from between leaves. It opens with a flap at the top.",

A number are on display in Museum of Decorative Arts.  He also designed children's furniture.
