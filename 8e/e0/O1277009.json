The image has been signed by the artist, Cedric Whyte, and dated 1927.\n\nFred Flexmore was a librettist and dancer who was active between circa 1890 and 1927. He was associated with a range of productions including Burlesque, Pantomime and Light Opera. Among the institutions he worked with were: The Royal County Theatre, Kingston on Thames, (1898, 1899); The Grand Theatre, Islington, (1903); The Theatre Royal, Huddersfield, (1919 &amp;1920); The Grand Theatre, Wolverhampton, (1921); The Opera House, Middlesbrough, (1921) and Kennington Theatre, (1924). \n\nThe 1894 production of Ali Baba attracted large audiences with its spectucular scenery, costume and stage effects. One of the highlights of the production was an aerial ballet, which exploited new developments in the technology available to enable performers to \"fly\" and \"dance\" across the stage. The popularity of the style of 'leg-dancing' shown in this illustration was relatively short lived, but required a high level of athleticism from the performer concerned.",
