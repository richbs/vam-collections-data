The main building is still standing.  It is probable that the mould was one from the factory.\n\nHistorical significance: The opportunity of having a mould is rare.  If not actually destroyed they were used as building rubble.  Most of the doll producers were in the German Democratic Republic and the buildings with the moulds did survive up to 1990.  With reunification, many of the buildings were 'modernised' and even the rubble destroyed.",

It is still possible to see the moulds in the upper storeys of houses in the towns.  Not only doll moulds were used but you could see jugs, cups and other ceramic shapes.",
