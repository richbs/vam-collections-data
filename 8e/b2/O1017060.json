            "public_access_description": "Sketches of decorative details by leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The small sheet had been cut into four unequal parts but has now been re-united. It shows a series of rapid pencil sketches including a tall vase with ornamental spray; a tall, possibly winged figure; a smaller vase with rinceaux; a sitting winged sphinx; a griffin; an ornamented structure topped with a ram's head; part of an elaborate frame with an oval medallion (linked to smaller circular one by band of foliage); and part of a complex decorative motif, possibly for furniture (partly shown). In spite of the free design-like character of these sketches they should probably be seen as showing details of wall decorations in paint or plaster.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
