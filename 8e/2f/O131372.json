            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 136\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"LANCE, George (1802-1864) \n\nBorn Little Easton, near Colchester, Essex, 24 March 1802, son of an army officer. Pupil of B R Haydon, with Charles Landseer, from 1816, and entered RA Schools 1820. Exhibited 38 works at the RA between 1828 and 1862, 135 at the BI 1824--64, and 47 at the SBA 1824-35. Most of his paintings \n\nwere still-life, usually fruit, but he occasionally showed portraits and subject pictures. Called by the Athenaeum critic (17 May 1856, p622) 'the very prince of fruit-painters'. Died Sunnyside, near Birkenhead, Merseyside, 18 June 1864. His studio sale was at Christie's 27 May 1873. There is a miniature portrait of him by Thomas Carrick in the V&A (Pl-1953). His daughter, Miss E Lance, was also a painter of fruit, exhibiting at the RA 1859-61; Sir John Gilbert and William Duffield were his pupils. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1847, p96 (with engr portrait after G Clint): Art Journal 1857, pp305-7; Illustrated London News 21 December 1861, pp647-8 (with engr portrait); Art Journal 1864, pp242-3 (obit) \n\nThe Rev William Harness D82 Neg 72357 \nPanel, 18.5 X 15.2 cm (7 \u00bc X 6 ins) Dyce Bequest 1869 \nIn the 1874 catalogue of the Dyce collection by Samuel Redgrave, the work is listed as anonymous and as 'Portrait of a Gentleman in an English Clerical Dress'. The artist and sitter were identified in the 1907 catalogue of oil paintings. \nThe Rev William Harness (1790-1869) was ordained in 1812. He is best-known as a friend of Lord Byron and author of an edition and biography of Shakespeare published in 1825. The sale of his collection of pictures at Christie's 19 March 1870 included Eastlake's painting of 'The Trajan Forum, Rome' (now in the V&A collections). The donor of the portrait, the Rev Alexander Dyce, also owned a pamphlet by Harness, The State of the English Bible (1856), a presentation copy signed by the author; presumably they were friends. \nAnother portrait of Harness, by John Prescott Knight, was exhibited at the RA in 1838 (10). The present painting may be dated to the 1820s, judging from the apparent age of the sitter. \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
