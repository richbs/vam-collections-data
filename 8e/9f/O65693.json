The sultan's successor, Abu Bakr, dismissed Aqbugha and confiscated his property soon after, on 16 July. Aqbugha later held posts in Syria, but was arrested and sent back to Egypt in March 1343. He was executed some time in AH 744 (AD 1343-4).\n\nAccording to Mayer, the blazons were changed after the confiscation of Aqbugha's property in 1341. Three still bear traces of the original design, which had a napkin on the middle field. The replacement blazon has a cup on the middle and lower fields, which are merged. Mayer thought this was the blazon of Amir Qawsun, who was himself arrested in AH 742 (AD 1341-2) and executed later that year (March or April 1342).",
