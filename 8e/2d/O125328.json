The distinctive and meticulous technique that she has evolved has lead to minimalist, sculptural work of great beauty and subtlety where pattern and form are completely integrated.  The extraordinary flexibility and movement within her work, and its changing visual qualities depending on the viewer's angle give it an interracting appeal to sight, touch and contemplation.\n\nShe graduated in 1956 from the Academy of Fine Arts, Arnhem, and originally worked with textiles. It was not until 1981 that she created her first jewellery made of folded paper, which has today become her trademark. Linssen draws her inspiration from structures and rhythm found in the botanical world.",
