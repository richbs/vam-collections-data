However, unlike the more extravagant Palladian and Rococo examples from the 1720s onwards, those of the Neo-classical period  were smaller and more restrained. Here the abundance of Neo-classical ornament indicates that the chimney-piece was destined for a fairly important room, but the use of wood instead of marble suggests a need to economise.\n\nPeople \nThe chimney-piece comes from a house in the Adelphi (No. 5) that belonged to David Garrick. The Adelphi  (Greek for 'brothers') was a speculative development on the banks of the Thames, off the Strand, by Robert Adam and his younger brother James. However, the exorbitant cost of building the foundations, as well as the high tides and pollution of the river, brought the venture at one stage close to bankruptcy.\n\nGarrick was the greatest actor of the day. He was a friend of Robert and James Adam, whom he addressed as 'My dear adelphi'. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe lintel of the chimney-piece is decorated with griffins, back-to-back, holding festoons in their beaks. Other motifs include small circular ornaments known as paterae, also rosettes, husks, sacrificial altars and panoplies (trophies of ancient weapons).",
