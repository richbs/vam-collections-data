Peter Le Heup was a banker and his wife was the daughter of William Lowndes, Secretary of State to William III.\n\nThe design incorporates the bees and skeps (bee hives) which feature in the Le Heup family coat of arms 'gules three beehives between eleven bees volant or'. Portraits of Peter and Clara Le Heup demonstrate their taste for silver and jewellery. Painted by John Giles Eckhardt in 1747, the portraits are now in the collection of the French Hospital, Rochester Kent). Peter Le Heup is shown with a silver standish (inkstand); Clara is wearing an elaborate pearl stomacher. The couple were married in 1722. The Le Heup family had close associations with the Huguenot community; Thomas Le Heup was one of the original directors of the French Hospital, a Huguenot charity incorporated by Royal Charter in 1718. This, situated in Bath Street, Clerkenwell, provided shelter and care for the sick and elderly. Paul de Lamerie sponsored one of his fellow goldsmiths for admission in 1737.\n\nHistorical significance: The design of these candlesticks is inspired by the work of Juste Aurele Meissonnier, Dessinateur du Cabinet du roi, as published by Huquier in <u>Livre de Chandeliers de Sculpture en Argent</u>, 1728, figures 73 to 75. Meissonier showed all three sides of the design making the goldsmith's task more straightforward.  A pair of candelabra made in France to Meissonnier's design were in the English collection of the Duke of Kingston by the late 1730s. A pair of ormolu candlesticks at Woburn Abbey inspired by Meissonnier's designs date from the 1740s and a carved wooden model of the same design,  perhaps used as a tool for casting,  is in a private English collection. De Lamerie copied this design in 1742-1743 -  a pair of candelabra are now in the Untermeyer Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The design was also copied by the London goldsmith Thomas Gilpin 1744-1746.",

A Huguenot (French Protestant), he came to London with his parents, fleeing persecution in France. His success lay in his own exceptional creativity in producing stunning objects, but also in his ability as a businessman, retailing some astonishingly spectacular silver using the most effective and innovative suppliers in the trade.\n\nThese candlesticks are associated with de Lamerie\u2019s most brilliant craftsman, whose identity is still a mystery, who worked from 1732 to 1744. He is known as the Maynard Master, named after the dish made for Grey, 5th Baron Maynard now in the Cahn family collection.",
