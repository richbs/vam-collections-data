Although variations are known, the design is characterised by a grid-like arrangement of stylised octagons and crosses in red and yellow.\n\nTrading\n'Lotto' carpets were woven in commercial workshops in western Turkey, probably near the port of Smyrna (modern Izmir), from about 1516 to about 1700. They were exported in large numbers to central and western Europe along two main trade routes: across the Mediterranean to Italy and Spain, and along the rivers Danube and Rhine to the Low Countries.\n\nMaterials and Making\nIn a pile fabric, such as this carpet, the foundation consists of two sets of threads,  warp and weft, which interlace at right angles. The pile is created by tying a knot of coloured thread around two adjacent warp threads, building up the design row by row while the foundation is being woven by the insertion of weft. It requires only a simple loom and is easily done by hand.  In this carpet there are 1,474 knots per square decimetre.",
