Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThis folio shows 'Gautama-jnana', the attainment of perfect knowledge by Mahavira's eldest and principal disciple, Indrabhuti Gautama, himself a renowned teacher. When Mahavira died, Gautama realised that affection even for Mahavira was misplaced and thus overcame the final obstacles to gaining omniscience. Gautama is shown wearing the white robe of a Shvetambara Jain monk. He is seated on a throne, and an honorific umbrella shades him.",
