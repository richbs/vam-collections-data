Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>107 Unknown Woman</b> \n<b>c.1670</b>\nEvans 33 \n\n<b>Oval 58 x 48 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine, hatched with long diagonal strokes with blue-grey and white, and heavily impasted, some touches of white and of gum in the eyes, on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched over in darker colour and with the lights in pale gouache, also over the carnation; dress in blue wash, modelled with darker colour and with the lights in white; chemise in a pale grey wash, modelled in white; pearls in white over grey; background a plain brown wash; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Very good. \n\n<b>Signed</b>: Not Signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century gold locket, the convex back set into straight sides with a Single narrow channel, flaring out to the bezel, which holds a convex flat-backed glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger of D-section, channelled down the middle, and bifurcating into diminishing spirals of flat wire of three turns. Inscribed in black paint, inside the case: <i>15 - 3 -.</i> \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Mrs Hugh Gurney, said to have been sold at Sotheby's, March 1922 (but no record of the sale found) and acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop; lent to the Museum 1927-49; given to Alan Evans, June 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24; Murdoch and Murrell 1981, p. 289, fig. 23. \n\nThe miniature was attributed by Wallop and Long, and perhaps by the Gurneys (who were collectors of English portraits and patrons of the arts in East Anglia in the nineteenth century), (1) to Nicholas Dixon. Reynolds observed: 'This resembles the style of R Gibson and it was decided ... to re-attribute it to that artist'. (2) The date, on costume and hairstyle, is c.1670. \n\nThe inscription inside the case is interesting. It is presumably a price and shows that there was a retail trade in made- up gold lockets, as well as a trade generated by ad hoc commissions. The figure is somewhat high: compare the \u00a38.3s.4d. charged to Pepys in 1668 (entry for 10 August), the \u00a39.55.3d. charged to James Sotheby by the goldsmith James Seamer in 1705/6 (see Cooper, Cat. No. 85), and the sum mentioned in an account preserved at Ashtead Manor, Surrey, 18 April 1694: 'Paid Mr Cross for a gold Case, Cristall and Chagrin Case ... 9.155.' (3) The year 1694 happens to be the year in which the price of monetary gold stabilised against the silver currency, having risen fairly steadily since 1663; so the price of a gold case bought at the date of this miniature should be at the lower end of the range (see note on the price of gold, Cooper, Cat. No. 85). \n\n1 See their sale, Sotheby's 10 December 1925. \n2 20 August 1949; MS note in the Wallop Loan Book. \n3 Quoted from a note in the Cross nominal file, department records.\u201d",
