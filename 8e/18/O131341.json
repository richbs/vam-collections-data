He travelled to Italy and France from around 1649 and specialised in landscape painting although he also executed few history painting and portrait. He had moved to The Hague by 1656, where he was a founding member of the confraternity Pictura. He was back in Amsterdam in 1660 where he spent the following 15 years as a respected and established artist, sought after by distinguished collectors. He apparently only had two apprentices, Martinus Laeckeman and Erick van der Weerelt or Wilkes (ca. 1648-1715), about whom nearly nothing is known. Around 1675, he left for Italy where he died 3 years later.\n\nThis painting showing cattle and animals in an imaginary landscape, either northern or southern, is a 19th century copy in the manner of Karel Dujardin. Although it bears many similarities with Dujardin's stylistic trends, the execution is far less refined and the composition lacks of fluidity. The only human figure on the right hand side is hardly visible and the cows stand awkwardly on the pond's edges. The trees' foliage is also very blurry and the textures are crudely rendered whereas Dujardin was extremely attentive, as well as the majority of Dutch painters, to details and atmospheric effects.",

            "history_note": "Bequeathed by John M. Parsons, 1870\nJohn Meeson Parsons (1798-1870), art collector, was born in Newport, Shropshire.  He later settled in London, and became a member of the stock exchange.  His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.\n\nHistorical significance: Originally catalogued as by Karel Dujardin (1893 Catalogue), this work is probably a 19th century exercise in his manner. Although it has similarities to autograph paintings such as <i>Landscape with cattle</i>, in The Hermitage, St Petersburg, it lacks the refinement of Dujardin's brushwork and the composition lacks fluidity. The cool colouring recalls his work from before his departure to Italy, after which his palette assumed a golden tonality. The composition is also reminiscent of the work of Paulus Potter (1625-1654), famous for his paintings of bulls. Dutch paintings of animals were still appreciated in the early 19th century in England.",

            "historical_context_note": "Karel Dujardin (1626-1678) was born in Amsterdam and may have trained with Nicolaes Berchem (1620-1683) and Pieter van Lear called Bamboccio (1599-ca.1642), and worked with Paulus Potter (1625-1654). He visited Italy and France around 1649 and specialised in landscapes, but also painted history paintings and portraits. He had moved to The Hague by 1656, where he was a founder of the confraternity Pictura. In 1660 he returned to Amsterdam in 1660 where he enjoyed considerable success. He had only two apprentices, Martinus Laeckeman and Erick van der Weerelt or Wilkes (ca. 1648-1715), of whom little is known. Around 1675 he returned to Italy where he died.\n\nLandscape and animal paintings were extremely popular in the Netherlands during the 17th century and encompassed a wide range of forms and genres.",
