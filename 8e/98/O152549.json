Colours include pale green, vivid blue, wine red, bright orange, salmon pink, jade green, pale pink, lime green, light, bright yellow, green-ish buff and white. \n\nThe field is full of asymmetrical plants arranged with no repeat in the height of the fragment; repeating symmetrically around the axis at the right of the fragment. The bright colours (faded at the front) are on a very pale green ground which looks white from the front.\n\nA border has a bright yellow ground with wine red certouches containing three small buds, separated by blue flower heads. This border is extremely pieced. The only attached parts are at the top and to the left of the lower part, which has been cut and joined. One fragment of the border on the right side shows shaping; it is sewn on, but seams likely to have come from the carpet.\n\nAnalysed through glass:\n\nWARP: white silk; Z2S; depressed; 44 threads per inch; 176 per dm\n\nWEFT: light yellow silk; ?3 shoots between row of knots; 40 per inch, 160 per dm.; knot asymmetrical open to the left; silk; colours: 6: red, orange, yellow, dark yellow, green, blue (as seen from front, under glass).\nFrom back as analysed in 1976: 3 greens, blue, red, orange, 2 pinks, light brown, yellow, white\n\nSIDE EDGES: cut and rejoined except lower left.  Not possible to determine.\n\nENDS: lower - cut and rejoined\n           upper - cut\n\nDESIGN: Field: pieced across lower third, appears to be yellow, contains isolated shrubs and trees, predominately yellow and red with blue elements.  Above a cypress tree is a bird form (lower third).\nBorder: heavily pieced ( see 1976 diagram), but appears to be two cartouche patterns, one with 3 buds on a red ground, the other with 3 flowerheads/leaves on a red ground, interspersed with a 4-petalled rosette.",
