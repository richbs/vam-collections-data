Marshall specialised in children's books, maps and educational games. His innovative products combined miniaturisation with bright colours and popular subjects such as animals and geography. \n\nThe Dolls' Casket is a small wooden box, with a lid that slides open to reveal a set of miniature teaching aids. There are hand-coloured prints of animals and landscapes, as well as a world map and alphabets known as battledores. Young girls were encouraged to use these to teach their dolls how to count, spell and read, giving rewards and punishments using white and black pins on the pincushion. By these means, Marshall wrote, the children would learn skills and morals while enjoying themselves.",
