He would have known Alick Johnstone's scene painting studio very well. Johnstone established his studio in 1922 and for the next 50 years was responsible for the scenery for major West End productions. \n\nIrving's painting emphasises the space and light required for the painting of scenery and shows two large backdrops stretched over the paint frames. It brings together two  productions that actually took placed at different times.  The two figures in the centre are Alick Johnstone (on the right) and the designer Charles Ricketts who is looking at the drop curtain on the left hand paint frame. This is the backdrop for the final scene of Shakespeare's Henry VIII which opened at the Empire Theatre in 1925. The right hand backdrop is for Laurence Housman's play, Victoria Regina, staged at the Lyric Theatre in 1937. It is being examined by its designer, the artist Rex Whistler (wearing the suit) with one of Alick Johnstone's assistants. In the foreground, stirring a bucket, is John Bryan, another assistant, who went on to become a successful film designer .",
