A tobacco box survives, attributed to Obrisset, that has a portrait of Queen Anne in pressed horn taken from the same source as this medallion. A closely related medallion, similarly signed 'O.B.' and dated 1705, that forms the top to a tortoiseshell snuff box in the Museum (inv.no. 305-1875) is thought to have been taken from a die cut by Obrisset. Medallions depicting Queen Anne taken from Obrisset's moulds are also to be found in silver and tortoiseshell. He probably came from a family of artists (Aubrisset) in Dieppe, and may have been one of many Huguenots (French Protestants) forced to emigrate to England and elsewhere after 1685 because of renewed persecution in France. Little is known of his life and work; he specialised in pressed horn and tortoiseshell portraits.",
