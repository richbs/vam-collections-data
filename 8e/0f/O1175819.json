A rectangular shelf with a rounded corner at the front edge is connected to four metal (stainless-steel?) tubes at the bottom. At the front of the trolley two metal caps are screwed into the tubes from the top of the glass; at the back a metal rod on each side is connected to the cap and tube. The two metal rods follow the direction of the metal tube but reunite as a handle behind the end of the top shelf for which the rod has to turn towards the back in a right angle. For the handle the rod is slightly curved towards the trolley; the whole handle is painted yellow. The four diagonal supports are connected through the shelf to four similar short tubes which are connected to the casters. Two additional casters in front of the back ones are glued (?) to the bottom of the shelf. The bottom shelf in same dimensions as the top one has a straight end but a round front. A red painted metal rod in front of the bottom shelf repeats the rounded shape and is connected to either side.",

The 'Hilton' Serving Trolley was designed on invitation by Ettore Sottsass for the first Memphis collection. It is tilting back as if travelling at high speed, which can be interpreted as a joke about modernist or Art Deco 'streamlining'. The trolley was designed with the help of Pepe Cortes, who was described by Guy Julier as 'Mariscal's long time friend and technical brain'. His metalworking skills were crucial to enable Mariscal to extend his work into three dimensions. \nMariscal only designed two pieces for Memphis, the 'Col\u00f3n' table and the 'Hilton' trolley, both named for luxury hotels. Though Mariscal never became a core member of the group or a central figure of Postmodern design, his trolley is one of the most memorable designs ever produced by Memphis.",

Like all other furniture in the first Memphis collection, the trolley was named for a luxury hotel. It is tilting back as if travelling at high speed which can be a joke about modernist or Art Deco 'streamlining'. The object features two deft touches of colour and an affectation in the form of what appear to be extraneous wheels. Mariscal designed the trolley with the help of Pepe Cortes, whose metalworking skills were needed to extend the work into three dimensions.\nMariscal did only two furniture designs for Memphis, the Col\u00f3n table and the 'Hilton' trolley; the latter is one of the most memorable designs produced by Memphis.",
