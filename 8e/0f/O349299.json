One of them holds a sketch-pad with an outline drawing of Donatello's statue of St George, while and almost illegible inscription below bears a name and the date 1887 in Latin numerals. \n\nThe unveiling of the new facade of Florence Cathedral in 1887 coincided propitiously with the fifth centenary of Donatello's birth and combined celebrateions took place. An exhibition of Donatello's work was held in the Bargello and plans were made to commemorate the sculptor in more permanent ways. Among other schemes, a monument was commissioned from Urbano Lucchesi for Santa Croce, the Florentine Pantheon, a model was exhibited in the church in 1887 and the finished work was unveiled in 1895. It consists basically of the same elements as the present model, a bust, putti and an insciption, though arranged differently and on a less ambitious scale. It has not yet been ascertained whether the model represents an initial design by Lucchesi himself, perhpas that actually shown in Santa Croce, or a rival entry in some sort of competition. Such a competition was held over the design for the tomb of Donatello in San Lorenzo at precisely the same period, but the present model seems more closely connected with the memorial in Santa Croce, because it lacks the traditional efifgy of the deceased and the Madonna and Child in a tondo above, which ultimatley appeared on the tomb proper. \n\nThe model is a singularly important example of late nineteenth century pastisches of Renaissance works of art, exhibiting precisely the qualities which contemporary opinion valued in Renaissance art.",
