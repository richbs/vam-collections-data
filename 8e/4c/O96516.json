On the upper part the bands of ornament follow the spiral twist of the horn and the designs show plain leaf-scrolls and scrolls with birds and animals among foliage. The horn was originally longer and has been broken and repaired in two places. The pin-holes on the plain surfaces between the band of ornament suggest that these spaces were originally covered with metal strips, possibly of gilded copper. There is a plain area of about 5cm in height that probably was covered with a metal band. At the bottom of the dhatf the carved surfaces have been shaved away, indicating that the tusk was either once mounted on a metal foot or encased in a metal sheath for attaching to a seperately amde lower section.",

The lower part has curling vine scrolls inhabited by naked figures and birds, alternating with bands of grotesque beasts. Above are dragons and foliage. Pinholes for fastening strips of precious metal can be seen on the uncarved areas.\nA close similarity between the decoration of the staff and that of a column to the right of the central portal at the west end of Lincoln cathedral has been pointed out by Fritz Saxl. This portal is to be dated by 1145, its columns strongly influenced by similar columns in St Denis.\nUntil 1958 it appeared that the present tusk was the only medieval example to have carved decoration, but in that year a further piece came to light which allowed a reassessment of the function of the V&A tusk. The two tusks were carved in the same workshop; they share the same dimensions, the decoration is technically identical. Both were embellished with gilt-copper strips - now removed - and have an uncarved area near the middle of the shaft, probably once covered with a metal band or knob, which served to facilitate handling. There is evidence that the tusks may have served as grand processional candlesticks, possibly even as a pair.",

Cutt, London, Camden Town, \u00a3100.\n\nHistorical significance: A close similarity between the decoration of the staff and that of a column to the right of the central portal at the west end of Lincoln cathedral has been pointed out by Fritz Saxl. This portal is to be dated by 1145, its columns strongly influenced by similar columns in St Denis.\nUntil 1958 it appeared that the present tusk was the only medieval example to have carved decoration, but in that year a further piece came to light which allowed a reassessment of the function of the V&A tusk. The two tusks were carved in the same workshop; they share the same dimensions, the decoration is technically identical. Both were embellished with gilt-copper strips - now removed - and have an uncarved area near the middle of the shaft, probably once covered with a metal band or knob, which served to facilitate handling. There is evidence that the tusks may have served as grand processional candlesticks, possibly even as a pair.",
