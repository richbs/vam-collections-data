As a lithogrpaher, from the early 1830s, he drew on average 2 illustrations a week, satirising the law courts and the monarchy.  \n\nWhilst working at one publication <i> Le Charivari </i> under Phillipon, he was imprisoned by King Louis-Philippe for his depiction of him as a Gargantua sitting on a commode.  Phillipon, the printer Delaporte and the publisher Aubert were all imprisoned for their part in satirising the King.  Censorship of the press was brought into force on several occassions, finally forcing Daumier to aim his satire at Bourgeois society instead.\n\nThis study can be atttributed to Daumier, illustrating one of his most known subjects; lawyers. His vigorous style lent to his skill as a caricaturist, which he demonstrated in such progressive publications as <i> La Silhouette </i>,  <i> Le Charivari </i> and <i> Caricature </i>.  \n\nThis image is very similar in composition to other drawings, for example, <i>Deux Avocats </i> (Daumier 1808-1879, Reunion des Musees Nationaux, 1999, p. 370, pl. 219)and <i>Deux collegues (or Les Confreres)</i>(Daumier 1808-1879, Reunion des Musees Nationaux, 1999, p. 370, pl. 220) both showing lawyers walking past each other, a recurrent theme that he used.\n\nDaumier became known as a  painter after his death. During his life he was more known for his satirical and anti-monarchist lithographic illustrations.\n\nMany sketches represent similar subjects of lawyers passing, waving at each other or walking together (Musee des Beaux Arts de Reims; Williamstown, Sterling and Francine Clark Institute).",
