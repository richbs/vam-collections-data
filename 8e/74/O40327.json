Within a pavilion with royal white umbrellas and glass lanterns a prince is seated on a chair (like those in the V&A Indian Collection) with his consort kneeling on his right conversing with Burmese ministers on his left. \n2.  A wooded mountainous setting with embracing male and female kinnaras together with a prince holding a bow and speaking to a young lady.\n3.  Another palace scene in which a prince, accompanied by his attendant, confronts a court lady.\n\nMultiple borders surround the central design:\nThe outer edge a double interlacing wavy pattern (4 cm.)\nNext wavy leafy stems held aloft by eight flying nat-thar (putti) their pasos drawn up to form breeches. (18 cm.)\nThe innermost one is made up of intricately worked acheik textile patterns. (6.4 cm.)\nA fourth inner border on top of the central design is form of continuous wavy leafy stems.

Britain's control of Burma extended as the 19th century progressed, and the country was  annexed in 1885.\n\nKalagas were originally used by the Burmese either as decorative wall hangings, to partition a room or, on festive occasions, to form a screen outside. This kalaga, of red woollen cloth with an appliqu\u00e9 design of shaped coloured fabrics (partly painted) and silver sequins, shows scenes from either a Jataka story or a Burmese legend. The costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay Court of about 1880. The extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the middle of the 19th century.",
