This ivory portrait is probably derived from the so-called Conduit marble bust of Newton by John Michael Rysbrack (1694-1770), and his terracotta bust in the Wren library, Trinity College, Cambridge, signed and dated 1739. Isaac Newton was widely commemorated in busts and other forms of portraiture throughout the 18th century.",
