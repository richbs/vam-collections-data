In 1971 his work was shown at the Electrum Gallery, London, alongside that of German jewellery makers Claus Bury and Gerd Rothmann. All three broke with convention by combining a non-precious material, such as acrylic, with gold. Maierhofer then went on to experiment with an even wider range of materials, including tin and Corian. \n\nIn 1986 Fritz Maierhofer was the first metalsmith to be invited to spend a year at the Sir John Cass Faculty of Arts, London. He lived in the Barbican and had his workshop in the East End at Aldgate. The impression made by the vast construction work and dramatic changes to the urban landscape of London in the 1980s inspired his work of this period, as shown in this pin. The forms are derived from the steel-girders of buildings. The jeweller Wendy Ramshaw said: '...architecture has a place in the historical vocabulary of jewellery, but this could be the first time that its internal structure, rather than its external details, forms the substance of jewellery...'.",
