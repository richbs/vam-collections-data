A pale grey border runs along 4 sides and also around 3 sides of the central panel.  There is an embroidered curving meander with stripy leaves and blossoms in profile.  Along the bottom red ones alternate with green and with a pale one; there are additional blue ones along the sides and top. There is a main border on three sides of the central panel: it has a dark blue ground with a thick white embroidered meander, white star-like flowers and a spray of 5 small red flowers and a pair of round red flowers.  The flowers in the upper corner and along the top have been carefully placed to link the vertical and horizontal patterns.\nThe main panel has been divided into a lobed niche: the spandrels have a yellow ground with curving stems and flowers.  The niche has a dark blue ground with a yellow ornamented vase on a red dish.  There are 2 flowering stems, each with a speckled bird, rising from the dish.  Four white stems come from the vase.  They bear a rich variety of blossoms including hydrangeas.  There are 7 birds perchaed among the flowers.",
