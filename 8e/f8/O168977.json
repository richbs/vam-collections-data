There are rows of right-bending botehs, each with a central pattern of flowers.  A small boteh hangs off the tip of the large one. There is a vase and a spray of flowers between the base of each boteh.  The motifs around the vase could be seen as fish or as leaves, but some of them do seem to have red eyes.\nThe border has a satin ground formed by purple silk warp and white silk weft.  The pattern colours are yellow, green and blue.  There are rows of birds, facing the opposite direction in alternate rows. Each bird is perched on fine, pale stems which seem to be in gently swaying parallel lines with round flowers.\nBacking: pieced; dull yellow ground with offset rows of a white flower with red and purple details and green leaves.  The arrangements bend to the left.\nFacing: stripes: white, red, yellow and blue. The yellow and white stripes contain a green meandering stem, the red and blue stripes have isolated flowers on a stem.",
