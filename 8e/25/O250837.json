It is also close in style to the drawing 'East Bergholt Church from the south-east', No. 324 in the Lady Lever Art Gallery (Pl. 83 of the catalogue of that Gallery by R. R. Tatlock, 1928, and reproduced in colour in the <i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. XC, 1932, p. 105). The latter drawing, which is signed and dated February 1811, was a copy made at the suggestion of Constable's mother of a drawing her son had given her previously. It was presented to Dr. Rhudde in an attempt to weaken his opposition to Constable's courtship of his grand-daughter Maria Bicknell (Beckett, I, pp. 56-9, correcting Leslie's account of the incident).\n\nNote on Nos. 66-71\n\nThese drawings are carried out in a manner which Constable preserved for a number of years when making watercolours of East Bergholt Church, the consistency of which makes the precise dating of uninscribed examples, such as Nos. 68-70, impracticable. An early instance is found in the watercolour 'East Bergholt Church' in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, which is signed and dated 1805, and is virtually identical with No. 70 [200-1888] apart from being two inches more in height. A later example is the drawing of 1811 recorded in the note on No. 70.'\n\nReynolds, pp. 57-58",
