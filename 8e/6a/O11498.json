On occasions they attempted to reproduce actual Chinese techniques, as with this two-handled bottle, which is in a form known as a Chinese 'moon flask' and, unusually, is made from hard-paste procelain (unlike Minton's usual bone china).This is a purely decorative object and demonstrates both the manufacturer's awareness of ceramic history and the potential owner's rarefied taste.\n\nPeople\nL\u201aon Arnoux (1816-1902) was art director at Minton from about 1849 until his death. After leaving Paris in 1848 as political unrest escalated, he travelled around the Staffordshire potteries and was employed by Herbert Minton, of Stoke-on-Trent. Through Minton he became a friend of Henry Cole (1808-1882), first Director of the South Kensington Museum (the V&A).  Arnoux was a designer and chemist and was deeply interested in all branches of the ceramic arts and their history.  His contribution to Minton's success at international exhibitions and in their art production especially cannot be overestimated.  He was responsible for improvements to the ceramic body, the ovens, the colours and glazes, and he introduced majolica, Henry II wares and other Minton specialities.\n\nHistorical Association\nSix examples of Minton's crackled glaze, replicating Chinese originals, were shown in the International Exhibition, London, in 1862.  Although purchased from Minton some two years later, it is possible that this example was among that group.",
