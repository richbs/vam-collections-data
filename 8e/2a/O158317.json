Stewart's popularity in 1978 wasn't reflected in the music press of the time, who were more interested in the punk scene, but his international success on the concert circuit and in the music charts was notable, with Number One albums and singles in both Britain and America. He even kept the Sex Pistols' God Save the Queen from reaching Number One in the British charts.",
