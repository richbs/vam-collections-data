The results are unique works.\n\nWhirlpool is one of a series of prints which have been inspired by the architecture of Rome. Desmet was awarded a Rome Scholarship in Printmaking in 1989, which gave her a travel grant to explore Italy. Her use of collage, and her current subject matter derive directly from that experience. There are allusions to Piranesi both in the subject matter, and in her acknowledged debt to her study of his engraving techniques. The work is cleverly constructed with wit and originality, the architectural forms perfectly contained by the shell form.",
