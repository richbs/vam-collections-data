            "history_note": "Historical significance: The <i>Via Crucis</i> consists of title page, dedication, and 14 plates showing the Stations of the Cross. These are based on a series of paintings by Domenico Tiepolo in the Oratorio del Crucifies (Oratory of the Crucifix) in the Church of S. Polo, Venice. The artist completed the painting in 1747. Plate IX from the series of prints is dated 1748. The title page bears the date 1749, implying that the project was finished in this year. The canvases of the Stations of the Cross are amongst the earliest works by Domenico Tiepolo. They are close in style and composition to paintings by his father, the celebrated artist Giambattista Tiepolo, with whom he had trained and continued to work throughout his life. The fact that prints were made  soon after completion of the canvases, demonstrates the potential it was felt they had for reproduction. The fourteen scenes of the stations of the cross are presented following the Venetian tradition for this subject. Such prints would have been a popular series of devotional images. They were produced in six states. The series in the V&A collection (inventory numbers: E.1287-1907 to E.1301-1907) are second states of the series,  recognised by the inscription <I>In Venezia</I> written at the bottom of the title page.\n\nAccording to Christian legend, Christ falls three times on the road to Calvary. In the Seventh Station of the Cross Christ falls for a second time. Here is shown crushed by the weight of the cross looking up as he tries to rise and continue the walk to Calvary. This scene is often represented with crowds surround the path on which Christ has fallen. Unusually Tiepolo shows only three bystanders. On the left6 a figure helps lift Christ up. The bystanders appear in a variety of dress. In the foreground are two men in robes of patterned fabrics and turbans whilst behind is a man with short hear and a a sixteenth century ruff around his neck. The framing of the scene with a palm tree on the right and the combining of various types of costume echoes the work of Domenico's father Giambattista Tiepolo. It reflects the influence of Domenico's artistic training in his father's workshop.",
