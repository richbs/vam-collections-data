His mother worked in roadside diners and his father drove a gasoline company truck. His paintings incorporate the designs of lettering and other signage that have become an integral part of the American land- and city-scapes. In many works an image or basic shape is duplicated and then slight variations in each introduced to carry punning or enigmatic references to American life and literature.  As an older member of the Pop Artist generation, Indiana preferred to describe himself as a 'sign painter'.  He has been a seminal influence and has also produced one of the most iconic images of his age, LOVE, first as a painting, but rapidly appropriated into a huge variety of graphic applications.",
