It was made by Joachim Henne (active 1663-1707) in Germany, in about 1670-1680, and is probably part of a series of ivory busts of Danish Royal portraits by Henne, the others being at Rosenburg, Copenhagen. Duchess Friederike Amalie von Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf was the daughter of Queen Sophie Amalie and King Frederick III of Denmark. \n\nJoachim Henne (active 1663-1707) was a renowned ivory carver, who worked in Denmark and Northern Germany, specialising in small portrait reliefs and busts. He also executed figure groups, and relief depicting mythological scenes. Comparatively little is known of Henne\u2019s life, including when and where he was born or died, or where he was trained. Although possibly from Jutland or North Germany, he may have trained in South Germany, in Ulm or Augsburg, and was active in Hamburg (1663-5), Gottorf (1665-7), and Copenhagen at the Court of King Frederick III, and then under that of Frederick\u2019s successor, King Christian V, from 1667 until 1691. From 1702-7 he is recorded as court miniature painter at the Brandenburg Court in Berlin, and he is also known to have worked in wood.",
