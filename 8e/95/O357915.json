The panel is decorated at one end only and the design consists of a tall exotic plant with symmetrically arranged leaves and flowers. This stands slightly above a border of swags. Along the bottom of the panel is a narrow border of formal decoration. The silk was presumably intended for a skirt flounce or a curtain. The panel is made up from four loom widths of material. On the right hand side a series of crescents and stars are embroidered in outline in silver thread and there is a narrow border embroidered in similar thread running the length of the textile. \n\n<u>Technical details</u>\nBrocaded gros de tours, the pattern bound in 3/1 twill by a proportion of the ground warp threads (1 in 5). 2 kinds of metal thread are used; fris\u00e9 and fil\u00e9 (2 threads in one shoot).",
