Studied at the life school in St Martin's Lane, and exhibited watercolours at the Society of Arts as early as 1836. Exhibited 164 works at the RA between 1838 and 1902 (and 50 Egyptian studies there in 1869), 33 at the BI 1839-41. His early works were mostly village genre scenes in the manner of Sir David Wilkie (whose works he also copied), but after travelling in Egypt in the late 1850s his work was principally Egyptian and biblical in subject, beginning with the ten-foot long painting 'Arabian Encampment at the Wells of Moses' in 1860. After 1889, he painted some English landscapes and a few portraits. Elected ARA 1852, RA 1863. Travelled in Normandy 1838, 1839 and 1840, Brittany 1841, 1842 and 1845, North Wales 1843, Ireland 1844, Venice 1857, and Egypt 1858-9 and 1870. Died St John's Wood, London, 28 August 1904. Two of his sons, Frederick Trevelyan (see below) and Howard, were also artists. Sales of his collections were at Christie's 25 May 1893 and (in the name of his daughter Ricca) 20 February 1905; there seems also to have been a sale at his house in Avenue Road, because of financial difficulties, in November 1902. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1850, p213 (a short 'autobiography'), 1855, ppl09-12; F Goodall Reminiscences 1902; <i>Art Journal</i> 1904, pp301-2 (obit); N G Slarke <i>Frederick Goodall</i>, RA Peterborough 1981\n\n<b>An Arab Improvisatore</b> \n1000-1886 Neg 58266 \nCanvas, 56.4 x 39.3 cm (22\u00bc x 15\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'F G [in monogram]1872' br \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nNot identifiable with any exhibited works, but typical of his paintings inspired by visits to Egypt in 1858-9 and 1870. Presumably the title plays on the improvisation of the on-the-spot sketch as well as on the Arab's appeal for money.\"",
