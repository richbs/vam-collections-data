His images often combine real and imagined worlds. A retrospective of his work was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, in 2001. Tress said of his work, 'Photography is my method for defining the confusing world that rushes constantly toward me. It is my defensive attempt to reduce our daily chaos to a set of understandable images. My urge to photograph is activated by an almost biological instinct for self-preservation from disorder.'",
