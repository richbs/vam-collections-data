The antenae that issue from the initial I support a monkey astride an ass shooting an arrow at a monkey with a shield and club astride a bull.

The Teutonic Knights were among the more successful military orders. They were given papal approval in 1199 and oversaw the colonization by German settlers and the imposition of Christianity in what is now Poland and Lithuania. Like their counterparts, the Templars, who suffered the brutal suppression and nationalization of their assets by the French crown just after 1300, they operated a system of banking to get money 'to the front line'. This Bible was made in Li\u00e8ge. The ornament in the initials is inhabited by dragons, heads and grotesques that spill over into the margins.",

            "history_note": "This page was bought by the Museum in 1883 as part of a portfolio of manuscript cuttings from the scholar W.H. James Weale. The page is from a three volume Bible which probably belonged to the house of the Teutonic Knights in Maestricht, Nieuwe Biesen, according to an inscription in BL Add. MS.32058, fol.9. No part of the first volume (Genesis to II Chronicles) is known to survive. The second volume was dismantled by the time W.H. James Weale sold individual leaves and cuttings to the Museum in the 1880s. Parts of the manuscript are now in the British Library (Add. MS 32058, ff.9-22), and in the V&A (9036 A-Z, Z.A, F.1 and D.544-1906 to D.599-1906). Volume three, the New Testament, is in Keble College, Oxford (MS 69).\n\nThe Teutonic Knights were among the more successful military orders. They were given papal approval in 1199 and oversaw the colonization by German settlers and the imposition of Christianity in what is now Poland and Lithuania. Like their counterparts, the Templars, who suffered the brutal suppression and nationalization of their assets by the French crown just after 1300, they operated a system of banking to get money 'to the front line'. The Bible was made in Liege for their house of Nieuwe Biesen in Maastricht, where the order owned property. (from 'Illuminated Manuscripts and their makers' by Rowan Watson)\n\nThe illumination gathered by the South Kensington Museum in the nineteenth century represented a new kind of collection. Unlike the encyclopedic historic collections of the British Museum or the Bodleian Library, it aimed to provide examples of medieval illumination and book ornament for students to copy. As with other kinds of artifact collected by the Museum, there was a tension between documenting stylistic traditions and acquiring works of artistic excellence.\n\nFrom the beginning the Museum tended to buy ready-made collections. At the same time, a number of complete medieval illuminated manuscripts began to join the V&A Library's collections.\n\nThe curriculum of art school training at South Kensington ensured that illumination had a place in art education. J.C. Robinson in 1857 described the museum's holdings \"from the smallest initial letter to the splendid pages of grand choral books blazing with gold and colours\" as a mine of medieval ornament \"of great value to the student\".\n\nIn the late 1860s, illuminations were among the most popular works for which the Museum issued licences for copying.\n\nIn 1899, the Royal College of Art appointed Edward Johnston to teach lettering in the Royal College of Art. Johnston was a scribe and lettering artist of genius. He revived the medieval tradition of writing with the pen and decorating the page with illuminated designs. His example was to have a tremendous impact on both lettering and calligraphy in the twentieth century, in Germany and America as well as Britain\n\n(from 'Vandals and Enthusiasts: Views of Illumination in the Nineteenth Century' by Rowan Watson, 1995)",

            "historical_context_note": "Professionally-made books used decorative initials to signal the major divisions of a text. There was usually a hierarchy of intials within any book to designate sections, chapters, paragraphs and other breaks. The initials were added either by the scribe or, increasingly in the later Middle Ages, by a specialist, in spaces left blank by the scribe. The important initials might be historiated or decorated, while the lesser initials were made up of coloured letters on coloured or gold grounds, often with flourishing in ink of a contrasting colour.\n\nGrotesque animals and figures are no strangers to medieval art; they are much in evidence in the Gothic cathedrals and still dominate European city centres, and were much beloved of Victorian restorers. There is occasionally a link between grotesques and text, but often there seems little more than incongrous romping.\n\n'Illuminated Manuscripts and their makers'; Rowan Watson, 2003\n\nData taken from notes compiled by Rowan Watson.
