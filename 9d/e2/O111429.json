Directed by John Burrell with costumes designed by Doris Zinkeisen, this wartime production has a legendary ring to it today, starring great British actors - Laurence Olivier as Richard, Ralph Richardson as Richmond and Sybil Thorndike as Margaret. Critics of the day praised the production, and one described the 'sombre pictures' created by the settings as 'grimly effective'. \n\nThis design was recreated as one of three mediaeval wall hangings for the set.  It was inspired by one of the famous 15th century French tapestries known as La Dame \u00e0 la Licorne.   The flat, decoratively patterned background is typical of  the style of the tapestries, while the birds in the sky, the rabbits and the dog in the foreground are copies of those in the original. The artist Morris Kestelman became better known as a painter than a set designer but he worked on several productions in London during the war including the operas Carmen and Gianni Schicchi for Sadler's Wells.",
