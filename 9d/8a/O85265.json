ISBN 1851773088.\nRonald Traeger trained at the San Francisco Art Institute and arrived in London-by way of Rome and Paris-in 1963. As a result of photographs Traeger had produced in Rome, the art director of British Vogue immediately published Traeger's work, and regular commissions followed to photograph fashion for Vogue, as well as for Elle in Paris. This dynamic image of the model Twiggy riding a motorized bicycle (or moped) was shot for \"Young Idea's Shorts Supply,\" published in Vogue in July 1967. This particular image, however, is an outtake from the series and was not published. Contrasting Traeger's work with that of David Bailey from the same period, critic Martin Harrison wrote that this image is \"much closer to most perceptions of mid-sixties London. Its throwaway exuberance captures exactly the spirit of the time.\" Ronald Traeger died of cancer while young. His work received renewed attention in 1991 when it was shown at the V&A in the exhibition, \"Appearances: Fashion Photography since 1945.\" As is common with the work of fashion photographers, many of Traeger's greatest negatives were lost or discarded by his clients. This print was copied by his widow, Tessa Traeger, from an apparently unique original. She made the print in 1995 using Ronald Traeger's darkroom procedures.\n\nLit.
