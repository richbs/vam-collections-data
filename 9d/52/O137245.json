He won the Painters Stainers Award for printed textiles at the New Designers Exhibition the same year and was awarded a Craft Council setting up grant. Working from his design studio on the Kent coast, Bottle produces hand printed, painted and stencilled unique and limited edition textiles including fashion accessories and interior items such as cushions and wall hangings. His work is concerned with surface decoration and the illusion of depth through the use of pattern, texture and colour.  Over the last 15 years, botantical and architectural influences have given way to abstraction, as the designer continues to explore three dimensional space through layering. Commissions have come from institutions including The British Museum, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, the Royal Academy of Art and the Guggenheim Museum, New York.",
