It is thought that the first shipment of tobacco and clay pipes came to England from the colonies in 1586. It was quickly popularised by people of the upper classes.  \n\nThe bowls on the end of the stems of smoking pipes grew in size as tobacco became cheaper. The pipes were cheap to produce, which was lucky as they were fragile and often did not last long. By the mid 17th Century there was mass manufacturing of pipes in Europe.",
