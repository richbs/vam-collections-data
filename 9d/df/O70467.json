In the Nativity scene the Virgin is shown reclining under a blanket with the Infant Christ swaddled above her. A lamp hangs down between the Virgin and the Infant, behind which an angel supports the Infant. The heads of the ox and ass protrude from the ivory tongue to the right of the Christ Child.\n\nThe Annunciation to the Shepherds fills one side of the shaft of the crozier, with the angel - marked by the inscription 'Angelus' - flying down above the star to the three Shepherd and their six animals. The remaining scenes are from the life of  St. Nicholas: besides the Annunciation to the Shepherds is the Birth of St. Nicholas, and above that is the infant Saint's abstinence from his mother's milk on fast days. The outer curve of the crozier head is filled by the representation of the Saint giving money to the impoverished nobleman of Myra for his three daughters, to prevent their being sold into prostitution. The three daughters are shown asleep and resting at the top of one side, with their semi-naked emaciated father lying beside them, and on the other is the nobleman's wife, also under a blanket, reaching out towards the young Nicholas, who climbs up the curve of the crook to post his bundle of gold.",

            "public_access_description": "This so called  St Nicholas Crozier shows scenes relating to Christ and St Nicholas. Bishops, and sometimes abbots, carry a crozier as a symbol of office. It resembles a shepherd's crook. At the end of the volute or scroll an angel supports the Lamb of God, a symbolic image of Christ. Its head is now missing. On the other side is the Nativity of Christ. The Annunciation to the Shepherds takes place on one side of the shaft.\n\nThe rest of the crozier proper shows three scenes from the Life of St Nicholas. According to tradition, St Nicholas was Bishop of Myra, a town in Asia Minor, in the late Roman period. The first scene depicts his birth. The second shows the infant saint's abstinence from his mother's milk. The Golden Legend, a popular 13th century manual recounting the lives of saints, notes that 'he took the breast only once on Wednesdays and Fridays'. The final scene records the saint's gift of gold to an impoverished and emaciated nobleman of Myra. This was to supply his daughters with a dowry to prevent their being put out on to the streets as prostitutes. The very particular choice of scenes suggests that the crozier was made for a bishop or abbot who was either named after the saint or in charge of a foundation dedicated to him.\n\nThis crozier is one of the most sublime achievements of the medieval ivory carver's art. The awkward shape of the volute has been brilliantly transformed into a fantastic landscape for the two separate but interlinked narratives. You can see evidence of the carver's fertile and creative imagination wherever you look. Perhaps the most striking example is the way in which Nicholas's father emerges from inside the surface of the ivory halfway up the crozier. This is a tour de force of technical and creative genius.",
