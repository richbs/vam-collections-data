The embroidery on the broad ends consists of floral designs against a grey/green ground.\nThe band is lined with dark blue wool and stiffened with an interlining. The two ends are attached to each other by a silver link chain.\nIt seems that headbands like this were worn by marreid Punti women during the cooler months of the year. The were worn high across the forehead and secured aroung the back of the head with a chain. The decorated ones were made as part of the woman's wedding outfit. Plainer ones were used for everyday wear. Headbands were not confined to south China, variations being worn by older women elsewhere.",
