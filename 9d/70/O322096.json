The original inserted rose is missing. Iron hooks fastened to the base of the body receive the strings.

The theorbo-style upper pegbox has a simple rounded finial. The main pegbox is for four double courses of wire, the fourth string course being overspun. The upper head has ten pegs, for ten basses.' - Anthony Baines:<i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-keyboard instruments</i> (London, 1998), p. 47.",
