Educated as a classicist at Edinburgh Royal High School and University, and from 1803 worked as a clerk in the Excise Office. After his father's death, he went to London 1806, and entered the RA Schools with Sir David Wilkie. Returned to Edinburgh 1808, worked 1810-14 as a portrait painter, but soon after settled in London. Exhibited 100 works, mostly portraits, at the RA between 1806 and 1845, 28 (mainly landscapes) at the BI 1818--42, and 15 at the RSA 1836-45. He held a one-man show of 70 works in Edinburgh in 1821. Visited Paris 1814 to study in the Louvre, Italy 1828-30, and Holland 1839. Elected ARA 1832. Mainly known for his portraits, but also for 'fancy' pictures, religious paintings (he painted an altarpiece of the 'Ascension' for the church of St James, Garlick Hill, London ECl) and copies of old masters. He was also an accomplished etcher, particularly landscapes in the style of Rembrandt. Married 1827 Adela, daughter of the miniature painter Nathaniel Plimer. Died Berners Street, London, 5 May 1844. A posthumous sale of his work and collection was at Christie's 8 April 1845. His self-portrait of about 1815 is in the SNPG. \n\nLIT: [Adela Geddes, the artist's widow] <i>Memoir of the late Andrew Geddes Esq.</i> ARA 1844; <i>Art Union</i> 1844, pp291-2 (obit); D Laing <i>Etchings by Sir David Wilkie and by Andrew Geddes ARA with Biographical Sketches</i> Edinburgh 1875; R Brydall <i>Art in Scotland</i> 1889, p232; C Dodgson 'The Etchings of Andrew Geddes' <i>Walpole Society</i> V, 1915-17, pp19-45; W Martin 'Andrew Geddes, ARA', <i>Connoisseur</i> 1935, pp334-8 \n\n<b>Copy of Giorgione's Triple Portrait</b> \nFA76 Neg E30 \nCanvas, 24.7 x 24.1 cm (9\u00be x 9\u00bd ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nGeddes made several copies after Venetian paintings during his 1828-30 visit to Italy, including Titian's 'Sacred and Profane Love' on his arrival in Rome (now RA collection), Titian's 'Flora' in Florence, and the present painting. Adela Geddes recorded that in autumn 1830: 'At Venice we made a stay of several weeks; and there he copied the celebrated picture, sometimes said to be Giorgione's family, three heads, mentioned by Lord Byron. Venetian Paintings it was what he fully appreciated and delighted in'. \n\nThat painting, then in the Manfrini collection in Venice, known in the 19th century as the 'Family of Giorgione', 'at this date the picture by which Giorgione was known all over the world, was a Titianesque portrait group now forgotten by all but the most assiduous art lovers' (F Haskell <i>Rediscoveries in Art</i> 1976, ppI5-16, re pr p] 22). Byron had seen it in 1817 and in the same year wrote of it in <i>Beppo</i>, verse xii: \n\nAnd when you to Manfrini's Palace go, \nThat picture (how so ever fine the rest) \nIs loveliest to my mind of all the show; \nIt may perhaps be also to <i>your</i> zest, \nAnd that's the cause I rhyme upon it so: \n'Tis but a portrait of his son, and wife, \nAnd self; but <i>such</i> a woman! Love in life! \n\nThe painting was presumably the 'Triple Portrait' now attributed to a follower of Titian, bought by the Duke of Northumberland in 1856 and still at Alnwick Castle (H Wethey <i>The Paintings of Titian</i> II, 1971, pp178-9, cat no x-90) its size being 73.5 x 77 cm (29 x 30\u00bc ins). \n\nGeddes and the donor, John Sheepshanks, seem to have been friends, perhaps since the artist's gift to Sheepshanks of a portfolio of his etchings in 1826. Laing reproduces a portrait of the collector etched privately, and quotes a letter from Sheepshanks to Geddes in Rome dated 17 May 1830: \n\nI have also to thank you for the inquiries you have been pleased to make with respect to the Cenci, and, though the result of these puts it out of your power to make a copy from the <i>original</i>, I am not the less obliged for the expressed intention to execute this commission had it been practicable. \n\nThe 'Cenci' was presumably the 'Portrait of a Young Girl' attributed to Guido Reni, then as now in the Palazzo Corsini in Rome, which in the first half of the 18th century was thought to depict the tragic heroine Beatrice Cenci, and 'enjoyed a degree of adulation fully as genuine as that now accorded the 'Mona Lisa' (Haskell, p109, pl 236). It seems likely that Geddes, unable to copy the famous 'Cenci', copied this equally famous 'Giorgione' for Sheepshanks instead (but see <i>Prov</i>: below). \n\nSheepshanks also gave many of Geddes's etchings to the museum, including various states of his portrait. Geddes's interest in Giorgione is also shown later in his 1841 RA exhibit 'Giorgione Studying from Nature', which according to the <i>Art Union</i> (1841, p75), depicted a fair woman and a youth. \n\nPROV: ?Geddes sale, Christie's 12 April 1845 (660, as 'GEORGIONE. \nGeorgione and family - in the Manfrini Palace at Venice: the picture quoted by Byron - believed to be the only copy'), bought in \u00a357 15s; Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nLIT: <i>Memoir </i> pl8; <i>Laing</i> ppl7, 24, 32; S Whittingham 'Byron and the Two Giorgiones' <i>Byron Society Journal</i> 14, 1986, pp52-5 (repr)\"",
