The raised foot has embossed ribs chased and engraved with nine bands, alternately textured and burnished. The flange has a ring-punched rim enclosing chased waves. The centre of the shell is pierced by an oval collar, concealed by two die-struck strips, one concave and the other half-round. Above this, the raised spool-shaped stem is embossed with seven ovals within a chased framework. Above a die-struck flange a domed oval chased with two marine monsters and shells in waves supports the body of the ewer. Around the base are four cast leaf-sprays. The body is in two main parts. The tails is in two sections joined longitudinally, chased and engraved to represent scales, and has three fins set into the seam. The hollow tail tip unscrews to allow the ewer to be charged.\nThe mermaid is formed of several sections. Her torso, head and arms are soldered to the two part base. The head and arms are cast and chased, the torso is raised and chased with three necklaces, the lowest with an applied oval pendant frame now engraved with the coat of arms of Sir Thomas Wilson (1560-1629). Traces of an earlier pounced coat are visible. Her applied nipples are pierced for the emission of rosewater. In her right hand she holds a comb; her left, now empty, presumably held a mirror (cf. the set at Toledo Museum of Art). (P. Glanville, <font -u>Silver in Tudor and Early Stuart England</font>, No. 101.)\n[Basin] A single, raised sheet formed as a mussel shell. An applied profiled strip outlines the flange which is embossed and chased in each angle with a sea-horse above a snail in waves. The body of the shell is embossed with radiating flutes, the upper edge of each chased. In the centre an oval cartouche, its guilloche frame broken by scroll ends and shells, encloses a convex oval engraved with the coat of arms of Sir Thomas Wilson (1560-1629). Traces of an earlier pounced coat are visible on the reverse; four semi-circular panels are chased across the ribs and burnished. (P.

Rosewater or other sweet-scented warm water was most commonly used for this purpose. From the 13th century, throughout Europe, a marine theme was considered most appropriate for the decoration of a ewer and basin. Mermaids were particularly fashionable.\n\nHistory & Use\nEwers and basins played an important role in the ceremonial life of the court and were frequently exchanged as ambassadorial or New Year gifts. Sets were usually the grandest items on display on the buffet, or sideboard table. They were made in gold, silver-gilt or plain silver. The great amount of precious metal meant that the acquisition of a ewer and basin represented a considerable financial expenditure and thus emphasised the status of the owner. \n\nSubject & Style\nThis set is typical of the Mannerist style so fashionable at the Jacobean court. The style had originated in the mid 16th century in the courts of mainland Europe. It was characterised by highly sophisticated, fantastical even contorted forms executed in the most precious materials. Other ewers of the period take the form of ships, snails and griffins.",

Throughout early modern Europe, marine subjects were popular also for important ewers and basins, because they were perceived as appropriate given the association between form and function.\nQueen Elizabeth I\u2019s Chief Justice, Sir Edward Coke, had a similar set which were itemized in a 1631 inventory as \u2018One silver Basin in the forme of a scallop shell with the Armes of Denmark\u2019 weighing 59 \u00be ounces  and \u2018One Ewer to the same in forme of a Mermayde with the like armes graven on the Breast\u2019 39 \u00be ounces.
