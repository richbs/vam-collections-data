The earlier examples are often of groups, until the introduction of panoramic techniques led to the production of images which could feature whole schools\n. \nPhotographs not only show the actual wearing of children's clothing, and by whom, but also to help fill a gap where the museum lacks actual garments.  Early school uniform is a fairly rare survival, and in any case the pupils at many nineteenth and early twentieth century schools wore their own individual clothes, as here.\n\nThe photograph also contains information on aspects of children's lives at school, such as the appearance and content of the classroom.",
