He is responsible for some powerful statues of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great as well as various Romantic subjects of which this bust is characteristic. It is derived from a  marble bust of 1875 formerly in the Alexander III Museum, now known as the \"State Russian Museum\" or the \"Russian Museum\", St. Petersburg.\n\nThe here represented Mephistopheles, Satan's emissary, was a central figure in the Faust legend which, following Goethe's drama, became a popular subject in painting, literature and opera.",
