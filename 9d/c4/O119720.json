Several Staffordshire factories specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This shows the actor-manager John Philip Kemble (1757-1823) as Hamlet, holding Yorrick's skull.  Kemble first made his name on the stage as Hamlet in Dublin in 1782 but by the time that he made his London debut in the same role in 1783 his sister Sarah Siddons was already regarded as one of the greatest tragedians ever. \n\nThis is a later variant of an earlier figurine copied from a contemporary engraving published by Tallis in 1852-1853, after a painting by Lawrence. At least seven earthenware portrait figurines are known to have been copied from engravings in Tallis's Shakespeare Gallery.  Known as 'Tallis figures'  they were made in many sizes, probably by the Burslem potters Thomas Parr (who was working from 1852 until 1870), John Parr (who worked from 1870 to 1879), or the Kent & Parr firm, (who worked from 1880 until 1894). These manufacturers passed the moulds to each other and the figures were produced throughout the Victorian period.",
