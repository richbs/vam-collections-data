A lithograph is a picture made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance like chalk. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper.  To make a colour lithograph, a separate printing surface is required for each colour:  this chromolithograph was printed from no fewer than 24 colour blocks.\n\nTrading\nThe trademark product of A. & F. Pears  was its transparent amber soap, which was developed and promoted as a great improvement on the harshness of contemporary soaps by the company's founder, Andrew Pears, at the turn of the 18th century.  In the mid-19th century, the company took on a new partner, Thomas J. Barratt to stave off fierce competition and to improve sales performance.  He devised a series of expensive and original publicity schemes, the most famous of which was the adaptation of John Everett Millais' painting Bubbles as an advertisement for Pears Soap. He also promoted art through the pages of Pears Annual (published 1890-1921, and price six pence until 1915).  Presentation plates like this one were given away as a separate package with the Pears Annual.",
