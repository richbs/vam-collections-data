He was descended from a Lancashire family named Fairclough but changed his name to Featley. This explains the identity of the coat of arms on the chalice.  The chalice and paten are based on the medieval models that Archbishop Laud preferred.\n\nHistorical significance: Dr. Daniel Featley was appointed to the living of St. Mary's Lambeth in 1618-1619. He opposed Archbishop Laud's reforms and resisted his request to restore the high altar, but the chalice is typical of the Laudian style.  Featley stood as a witness against Laud at his trial. In 1642 he was appointed one of the Assembly of Divines by Parliament, but withdrew and was deprived of his living.  He was subsequently imprisoned and died in 1645. He was buried in the chancel of St. Mary's Lambeth on 21st April 1645.",
