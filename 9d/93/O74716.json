His paintings include views of rivers and lakes, both in Britain and abroad, and many of his greatest works are of the shore and sea. The Gurnard seems to belong to a group of studies of fish he made in Margate, Kent, England. These studies are difficult to date. He probably used such studies for the sea pictures that include sea monsters.\nJohn Ruskin was the first owner of this watercolour. He was a leading critic and writer on art. He was also a friend of Turner and vigorously promoted his work.",
