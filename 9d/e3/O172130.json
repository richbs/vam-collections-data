All figures are represented in profile to the left.\n\nPurchased from a sale at Christie, Manson and Woods, held 6 April 1903, the Christie's catalogue described the piece as 'the original plaster model in relief, by Randolph Caldecott; designed for bronze, but never executed'.\n\nA museum paper relating to the acquisition suggests that Caldecott was highly regarded as a sculptor and the then Director, A. B. Skinner commented: 'it's a very interesting specimen of Caldecott's work and I should like to have it to add to our specimens of the work of this very clever artist already in the Museum.'\n\nRandolph Caldecott (1846-1886) was a British artist and illustrator. He first worked as a bank clerk in Whitchurch and Manchester while attending evening classes at the Manchester School of Art. In 1872 he moved to London and studied briefly at the Slade School of Fine Art. \nHe did a lot of book illustrations and skillful watercolours and oil drawings set amidst the vernacular architecture of his childhood, often infused with a sense of humour.\nApparently even Van Gogh and Gauguin admired his work.\nCaldecott's interest in hunting continued throughout his life, thus influencing his artistic work.",
