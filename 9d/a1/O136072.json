Raw wool from England was a major trade substance from 12th century onwards. Wool from England was thought to be the finest available. From 14th England's trade in wool changed significantly. England stopped its trade with neighbouring France and began to trade with Flanders (in the Netherlands). Flanders had excellent domestic production and trade in wool however political unrest was directly affecting manufacure. Wool workers from Flanders were encouraged to move to England to continue their business. This development saw a change in the way in which England traded. The export of raw wool from England diminished considerably and instead, cloth was worked on in England and exported as a finished product. By the mid 16th century England was a major European producer of woollen cloth and exported its wares to Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Germany.",
