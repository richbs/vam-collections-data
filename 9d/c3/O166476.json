            "public_access_description": "This costume for Admiral Sir Joseph Porter was made for the D'Oyly Carte Company and used in one of its productions of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera HMS Pinafore, first performed in May 1878. It is impossible to say when this uniform was made since there is no maker's label. The intricacy of the gold embellishment and details such as the ornamental pockets on the coat tail however indicate that it was made by a firm specialising in naval uniform such as Gilbert used for the original costume, and not by a theatrical costumier.\n\nW.S. Gilbert was fond of introducing uniformed characters into his operas, partly because of his own military background, and partly because their appearance on stage made a striking contrast to the costumes worn by other characters. These costumes would be re-designed over the years, but the uniforms remained true to the originals. Sir Joseph Porter was the earliest uniformed character, followed by the Major General and policemen in The Pirates of Penzance,  the guardsmen in Patience, the Lord Chamberlain and Lords in Iolanthe, and the Yeomen in The Yeomen of the Guards. The splendour of this naval dress uniform appears all the funnier when Sir Joseph Porter sings his famous song admitting that his rise through the ranks of the navy to its highest position was accomplished without ever going to sea.",
