            "physical_description": "REMARK: Mr. Du Bingchen, master Craftsman of Beijing Carved Lacquerware, was born in 1917 and began to work in lacquer workshop when he was a teenage. He was one the top students of Mr. Zhang Bingzhi and established his reputation in the industry in the 30's and 40's.\nIn 1957, Mr. Du, jointly with other famous craftsmen created the Vase with Lady General Mulan design. It is considered the first master piece after the Liberation in 1949 and collected by the National Museum. Mr. Du is specially good at carving flowers and birds. After years of practice and research he and another Master Craftsman, Mr. Liu Jinpo innovated the hollow-out technique which makes the carved lacquerware reach a new age.\nIn 1979, his 15 inch tray with hollowed out basket of flowers was given to the American President as a gift. Please note the differences in the Chinese marked which identify the different techniques he used.\nIn 1984, his 20 inch tray with raised basket of flowers won the gold prize in Lipz Fair and was collected by the Chinese Government as a national treasure after the exhibition.\nIn 1986, he created this superb tray with hollowed out basket of flowers in the unique shape, as the picture shows. Shortly after that, he had a paralytic stroke and can barely move now. So the art work is the last piece he made in his art career. This piece is scheduled to be exhibited in Demark in early September by the Beijing Municipal Government.\nHe was named as Master Craftsman in 1979 by the PRC Ministry of Light Industry. In China he has the same reputation as Mr. Shen Fuwen. People say Northern Du, western Shen.  \n[Tray] Tray with a hollowed out basket of flowers in carved lacquer.",
