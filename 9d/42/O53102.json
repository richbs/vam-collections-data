Each motif has one dark and light pink flower with a metal thread centre and a pair of leaves (in two shades of green) on a silver stem. The motif in which the leaves go up also has a small pointed red petal on its upper left corner.\nThe main border consists of a repeated motif: a large flower with light and dark pink shaded petals and a large green and metal thread centre. a silver stem which grows to one side of the flowers bears two vertical leaves in shades of green.  There are smaller green leaves coming from the stems and growing from theflower.",
