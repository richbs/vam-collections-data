Another version, also signed by the artist and dated 1742, is in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The brilliant red of Nadir Shah's robe stands against the silvery grey background and pale blue rug to provide a powerful image of the man who swept into India from Iran in 1738 and looted the Mughal treasury in Delhi. He removed vast quantities of jewels (including the Koh-i nur diamond and the gem-incrusted throne of Shah Jahan, the 17th century Mughal emperor), and manuscripts from the royal library. The ruler and the artist are identified in the Persian inscription on the right, and a later inscription in Gurmukhi script on the back repeats Nadir Shah's name.\nThe painting was bequeathed by Sir Robert Nathan who bought it 1904 or 1905 when he was private secretary to the viceroy from Moulvi Muhammad Husain, a judge at the Small Cause Court, Delhi.",
