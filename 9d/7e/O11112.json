Popular designs included hunting, sporting, historical and military scenes, biblical and mythological themes, drinking, hop and grape picking, wheatstalks and harvest, flowers and foliage.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMinton's designed the 'Silenus' jug in about 1831 and it proved to be one of their most popular earlier designs, to such an extent that it was copied by Mason and by Doulton.  It was first issued in light green, then dark green. This blue version is model number 235.  Minton even issued the jug in an experimental pre-Parian version though this is quite rare.\n\nSubject Depicted\nSilenus was a god of Bacchus' retinue. A merry, rotund old drunkard, he was nevertheless credited with wisdom and prophetic powers.  He  is usually shown leading Bacchus' triumphal procession, on an ass and supported by satyrs.",
