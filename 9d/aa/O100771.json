They have a white fritware body, which was a distinctive feature of Ottoman ceramics. From the 1550s, potters also used white fritware for wall tiles.\n\nIn the 16th century, the wealth of the Ottoman rulers was reflected in sumptuous decorative arts. Their bold designs rarely included human or animal figures. This feature was deliberately designed to distinguish them from decorative objects produced in Iran at this time.",

The first Iznik tiles were produced, and a bright red was added to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, tiles of high quality were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds. From the 1590s, however, standards declined as court patronage receded.",
