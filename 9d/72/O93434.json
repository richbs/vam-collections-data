            "public_access_description": "Early basins adopted a form which had been popular since medieval times. The diameter was never very large and the rims correspondingly deep. The whole of the inside bottom was covered in relief decoration. The subject matter usually fell into three categories: scenes from classical antiquity, themes from the Old or New Testament or allegorical figures personifying vices and virtues.\n\nThe scene depicted in this dish is 'The Fall of Man' otherwise known as 'The Temptation' (Genesis 3:1-7). God warned Adam on pain of death not to eat the fruit of \u2018the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\u2019. But the serpent, the cleverest of all God\u2019s creatures, persuaded Eve, saying \u2018your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing both good and evil\u2019. Eve ate the fruit and gave some to Adam who ate it too. \u2018Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they discovered that they were naked;  so they stitched leaves together and made themselves loincloths\u2019. The tree is usually an apple or a fig tree. The serpent is twined round its trunk (a type probably derived from a pre-Christian image of the dragon guarding the tree of Hesperides). Adam and Eve stand by the tree, Eve holding the fruit or in the act of  plucking it, or, having taken a bite, offering it to Adam. Medieval typology saw the Temptation as a foreshadowing of the Annunciation in which the Virgin Mary, as the \u2018new Eve\u2019, redeemed the sin of the old.\n\nCentres of brass production in late medieval Europe tended to be situated close to plentiful sources of calamine, the carbonate of zinc which when smelted with copper produced the brass alloy. Thus the brass industry was concentrated between the rivers Meuse and the Rhine, where the most important deposits of calamine lie. The main centres of production were the Attenberg and Holberg mines, both near Aachen, and the Kornelim\u00fcnster and Gressenich which lie between Givet and Li\u00e8ge. The two latter mines were the principal sources of supply for the town of Dinant which was the biggest centre of brass production until the town was sacked by the Duke of Burgundy in 1466.  Refugee brass workers found their way to neighbouring towns such as Brussels, Namur and Malines. Brass production in Nuremberg and Aachen assumed greater importance after the decline of Dinant.",
