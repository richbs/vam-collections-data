On 12th March 1844 it was purchased by the Museum of Economic Geology at 6 Craig's Court, Charing Cross (<u>Proceedings</u> 1844, p.17, and object file in the V&A Metalwork Section). According to the Museum nominal file for the Geological Museum (archive ref. MA/1/G412), the brass was transferred to the V&A on 14 October 1901.\nAn alternative account of the arrival of the brass in England is provided by Boutell (1847, p. 27), who states it 'was brought from the ruined chapel of the castle of Corteville in Flanders'. This unsubstantiated assertion is followed by Macklin (1907, p.99) and Ward (1912, p.144) and Macklin (1913, p. 130). The Museum register for the object details this bibliography, and cites appended documents (now missing) which 'show that the brass did not, in fact, come from the castle of Corteville, but from the church of Watou (now Ypres)'.\n\nHistorical significance: Memorial brass; the Flemish inscription identifies the brass as the memorial to Lodewic Cortewille (died 21st January 1504), and to his wife Dame Colyne van Caestre (died 12th January 1496).\nEngraved brasses were a cheaper form of memorial than stone effigies and were particularly popular in the Netherlands (a brass producing country) and in England.",
