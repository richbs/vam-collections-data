The panel is divided vertically into two halves, both worked with cut and drawn work and with needle lace.\nThe left hand side is divided into 12 horizontal bands of cut work; the first six bands have ground-work grids of squares measuring between <sup>1/4</sup>\" and <sup>3/8</sup>\"; the second six bands have squares of only 1/8\" sq. The top three bands are worked with typical reticella bands of zig zags, 'S' shapes and rosettes. The next three bands contain simple geometric fillings. The last six bands of tiny squares are more densely filled with geometric floral patterns.\nThe right hand side of the sampler is unfinished. It is divided into horizontal bands of varying width; at the top is a 2\" band of 1/8\" squares, prepared for reticella but with only one square filled in. Below this is a 1<sup>1</sup><sup>/3</sup>\"  band of 1\" squares containing three typical reticella fillings. Next are two large reticella \"snow-flake\" motifs based on 1<sup>1/4\" </sup>squares. Below this, the sampler has been divided into nine 1<sup>1/2</sup>\" squares, six of which have been filled in. Next is a 1<sup>1/2\" </sup>band of drawn thread work with a geometric pattern, worked in vertical lines. The remaining five inches are unworked.",
