The most popular buttons were those which appeared to be 18th century.  To meet the demand, many Dutch silversmiths made casts of antique examples, often including their original marks, stamped them using old moulds, or made new buttons in archaic designs.  \n\nAlthough this button looks like one of these late reproductions, with its picturesque image of a pretty milk maid, it is a genuine old button, as the marks prove.  It was described as 18th century when it was acquired by the Museum in 1891.",
