They were worn for show at church on Sundays, rather than for everyday wear.  Women wore them over their outer clothes so that everyone could see and admire them.\n\nMany of these necklaces were betrothal or wedding gifts, and often carry the initials of the bridal pair or the name of the bride, together with the date, on the back of the clasp.  These inscriptions are almost always scratched or stippled by the bride or groom themselves, not professionally engraved.\n\nNecklaces of amber beads, like this one, are earlier than the necklaces of silver beads, and often date from the 18th century.  The natural amber of the beads came from the nearby Baltic coast.  The women who wore them valued size more than regularity of shape or colour.  Although this one was acquired in the Vierlande, it is more typical of the necklaces worn in the Altes Land.\n\nOn the back of the clasp it is inscribed 'JH & DB 1765'.",
