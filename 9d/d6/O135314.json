He is a printmaker of long standing, and his most recent work has focused on the integration of computer technology into fine art practice. His own work involves layering and integrating different techniques, using the computer to manipulate imagery, which is then printed using a mix of traditional and digital methods.\n\nThis print comes from a larger group of prints by the artist in the V&A collection representing key phases in his exploration of fine art printmaking. Place (1995) uses a book motif and is another of Coldwell\u2019s experiments with the layering of imagery to emphasise and explore notions of surface.",
