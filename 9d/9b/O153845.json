There is evidence along the lower edge of a red cotton binding or facing. There are small beads attached.\nCentral blue ground octagon containing two red and two yellow animals [lions?]. This lies within a red ground 8-pointed star in which every second point is blunt [it's a combination of a square and an octagon]. It contains 8 rigid floral sprigs look like tulips.  The 8-pointed star has a white border with red and blue hexagons along a black line.  The rest of the cover has a black ground with large hooked cartouches along either end.  These are outlined in red and contain stylised plant forms.  The border has a red ground with angular blue and  yellow S-motifs and pairs of triangular brackets.\nNOTE: three small green glass beads have been added to the black stem immediately right of the yellow horizontal sprig in the centre of the lower left cartouche.  It is possible that similar beads were attached in the same place in the other three cartouches.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; black, white, red, green, yellow, light brown, dark blue, blue, green.",
