Because We Must was an ironic, irreverent work which challenged the conventions of dance by introducing humour and unexpected interventions - such as a nude female dancer with a chain saw interrupting a trio of woman dancing to Chopin preludes. This crewelwork costume was worn by Leslie Bryant in a section performed to Venus in Furs by the Velvet Underground.  A similar, female, version of the costume (S.102:1 to 3-2010) was worn by Lisa Philips. \n\nThese costumes were based on an earlier clubbing outfit design, made and worn by designer and performer Leigh Bowery (1961-1994). He reworked the existing theme - a structured body with balaclava - using the skills of Paris-based corsetier Mr Pearl (Mark Erskine-Pullin), who made the complex garments. Lines of appliqu\u00e9 were used to create a corseted look which still allowed the dancers freedom of movement.",
