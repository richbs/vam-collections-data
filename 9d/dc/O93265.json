Attached to the underside of the shell are the head and front legs, and tail and back legs units. Both of these are supported by a bridge and bar unit running the length of the body which houses the spring mechanism which operates the toy. From the back of the toy is a long length of tightly coiled wire which ends in a trigger grip handle, painted red. When the handle is squeezed a metal rod system pulls and contracts the springs moving the back legs in opposition to the front legs so that all four legs move as do the head and tail. The \"feet\" are brown plastic wheels.",
