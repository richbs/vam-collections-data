He then travelled through Florence where he was persuaded to stay. He became sculptor to the Medici family and thus became one of the most influential sculptors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He drew attention to many artists  from Northern Europe and disseminated his style mainly through small bronzes. He established an efficient and large workshop.\n\nNessus the centaur is the mythological figure who was shot my Hercules when Nessus tried to ravish Hercules' wife Deianira, while shipping her over the river.\nOn a journey Hecules and Deianira came to a river, where Nessus was the ferryman and tried to delight her. When Hercules realised that he sent his bow and slew Nessus. When dying, Nessus told Deianiera to collect his blood as it would one day help her as a love elixir. Anyone who would wear a garment rubbed with the blood would love her forever.",
