            "history_note": "Historical significance: Fabric shortages during the Second World War contributed to the growth in popularity of head scarves which were colourful and practical and could enhance monotonous uniforms. Ascher initially revived nineteenth century prints in bold new colours and in the 1940's began to commission leading French and English artists to design patterns for his head scarves. Exclusive arrangements were made with some artists such as Felix Topolski and Henry Moore while others contributed on an occasional basis.\n\nThe scarves were then screen printed by hand in the Ascher studio and proved immensely popular. \n\nAn exhibition of the squares was held at the Lefevre Gallery in Paris in 1947. It was the first time that a prestigious gallery had shown a comprehensive collection of modern textiles by contemporary artists.\n\nAs well as the prestigious but commercially unsuccessful artist squares, Ascher continued to produce and sell a wide range of textiles, dress fabrics, scarves and head squares.",
