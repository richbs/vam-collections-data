There is a strip of purple velvet sewn along the upper edge.  \nThere is evidence that a fabric with metal thread was stitched down the right hand side. The lacis panel has been cut and rejoined down the right hand side - the pattern is disrupted. \nRather coarse work. A blue and light blue chevron is either side of the border which contains a pink, light green and green leaf-like motif. This motif is alternately inward and outward facing. There is a line of two white flowers on either side and it alternates with a pink blossom. The central area has a large angled green stem with 2 pink blossoms at the bottom, a group of 3 pink ones mid-way which are outlined with red and with metal thread, the stem bends to the left and ends with a large flower with pairs of lines forming a pair of green and yellow long leaves and then 4 pink petals, ending with a yellow and pink flower outlined with metal thread. This alternates with a striped triangular tree with 2 blue flowers at the base.  The tree is green with pink stripes and 7 yellow flowers outlined in red. There are small white flowers on the ground and 4 downward pointing sprigs coming from the top edge: 3 pink flowers outlined with white. The metal thread is copper strip open S-wound on white silk.",
