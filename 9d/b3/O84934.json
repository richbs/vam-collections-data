The decoration was flush with the surface of the piece.\n\nThis bowl was made between 1300 and 1500. It is uncertain whether it was made in Damascus or in Venice by local craftsmen.",

The popularity of these wares eventually inspired Venetian metalworkers to develop a host of imitation-Islamic brasses of their own.",
