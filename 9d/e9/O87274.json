The obverse is painted with gouache on paper with a silver ground wash. Painted with five scenes, all of which are carried out in a delicate miniature style in the finest detail.\n\nFrom left to right, the scenes show a young girl sitting knitting in an arbour flanked by cactus plants. The next scene is smaller and shows a skittle alley laid out i front of a barn. The central scene shows a shepherd and his dog and a flower or herb seller with a basket on her back. They are surrounded by trees and bushes and in the foreground there is a green lizard watching a butterfly. The fourth scene, which is smaller, shows a little white house or conservatory set within a formal garden. The last scene is of a young man dressed in a red and white striped suit and wearing a tye wig leaning on a mossy bank watching two birds in an open bird cage.\n\nThe borders are painted with scrolls of plants, flowers, insects and birds. On either side of the central scene two bird cages have been cut out of the leaf. The bars are of thread. One cage is open and the bird, a canary, is flying away whereas the other one is closed with the bird inside. The top edge is finished with gold speckled paper.\n\nThe reverse is of plain cream coloured paper. There is one central scene painted in gouache showing a house set within a formal garden with a fountain, and surrounded by fields and plantations of trees. On either side of this scene are cut-out bird cages seen in reverse and still showing one cage open and the other closed.",

One of them was the Swiss fan painter Johannes Sulzer.  He was also unusual in signing his fans.  This typical example of his style shows a couple in conversation, with a young woman knitting in an arbour (left) and a skittle alley (right).  On the reverse of the fan is a house with a formal garden.  Two bird cages, one open, one closed, hang on either side. These too were part of Sulzer's signature and they usually appear on his fans.",
