She is particularly interested in the way black people have envisioned and transformed themselves through hairstyling and popular imagery. \n\nThe motifs in Detective Training come from a series of 1970s advertisements taken from American magazines aimed at a black readership. The adverts promote the company Medalo, which made wigs, corsets, rings and guns. \n\nGallagher collaged several advertisements and traced the results, leaving out the advertising copy so that the image is elliptical and strange, with wigs, guns and corsets floating in undifferentiated space. This drawing was copied by a laser, the drawn lines reproduced by light burning to give a sepia-toned effect. Areas where the artist punctured the paper were cut out by the laser, leaving a pattern of holes that suggest a bullet-scarred surface.",
