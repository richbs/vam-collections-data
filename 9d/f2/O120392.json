            "public_access_description": "Lady Alexandra Howard-Johnston (later Lady Dacre) was the wife of the Naval Attach\u00e9 to Paris at the end of the 1940s. She required an extensive wardrobe for the many formal dinners and state functions that she had to attend.  She dressed exclusively at the French couturier Jacques Fath (1912-54).  \n\nIn 1949, Lady Alexandra commissioned one of Fath's most popular designs of the season, but requested that it be made up in her husband's family tartan.  She purchased the hand-woven and naturally-dyed fabric from Scotland herself.  The design features typical Fath motifs such as a flying panel at the back and decorative buttons and bows.\n\nLady Alexandra wore this dress frequently, especially to lunch, and accessorised it with a black hat and pearls.",

Fath was well known for his daring use of pattern and colour, and the fabric suited his desigs well.\nCecil Beaton gift Registered Papers F/5, November 5 1971:\nMy daughter (who is a very pretty blonde and small, not at all like me!) has seized a Jacques Fath dress, made specially for me, in Johnston tartan which is 'tres a la mode' at the moment!  None of the other dresses would suit her or she would have appropriated them! Love from Xandra\nCecil Beaton gift Registered Papers F/5,1971:\nFired by enthusiasm after seeing the exhibition I have found some more things which I shall be very happy to give.  The tartan dress I wrote about does no suit my daughter at all (she is much too small to wear Fath models) and I will be delighted to give it as I think it a marvellous design.  It probably needs cleaning as it has been hanging in my cupboard for many years, although in a dress bag.  It was made in the autumn of 1949 from veg. dyed Johnston tartan supplied by me from Scotland.",
