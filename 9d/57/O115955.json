With the exception of two works, all of his sculpture at the V&A, including this piece, dates from this period when Dalou had a profound impact on the development of British sculpture. \n\nBack in Paris, in 1889 Dalou started planning a 'monument to the workers' to commemorate their toil and heroism and he worked on this project on and off until his death. This bronze is a reduced version of a full-scale figure (versions in bronze in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay; and, in plaster, in the Petit Palais, Paris) which were sculpted as part of this project. The V&A's small bronze 'Worker with a shovel' (Museum number A.31-1971) was also created as part of this project.",
