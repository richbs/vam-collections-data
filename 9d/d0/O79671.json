In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nFlexible bracelets, like this one, were more common among the settled urban and rural population.  The use of red and green pastes and applied rings of twisted wire are both characteristic of Syrian traditional jewellery, as are the chains of quatrefoil links.  The London retailer Liberty imported large numbers of bracelets of this kind from Syria in the late 19th century, as can be seen from their catalogues.",
