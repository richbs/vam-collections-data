The complete outfit consisted of a red felt hat; a Tonik suit by Haff Tailors Ltd (UK); a cotton shirt by National Sports Shirts (Jamaica); a cotton string vest; the socks (USA); leather loafers; nylon underpants; elastic braces and a silk handkerchief. It reflected a style of \u2018Rude Boy\u2019 dress worn by some British men in the 1960s.  \n\nRude Boy culture originated in the ghettos of Kingston, coinciding with the popular rise of rocksteady music, dancehall celebrations and sound system dances. Young, urban and frequently unemployed, Rude Boys drew inspiration for their cool and smart style \u2013 sharp suits, thin ties and pork-pie or Trilby hats \u2013 from American gangster movies. Increased emigration in the 1960s saw Rude Boy style and music, ska and rocksteady, first influencing UK skinhead culture, then, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the music and fans of the Two Tone ska revival.\n\n\u201cThe Jamaicans were famous for their loud hats and their individually tailored and extravagant mixture of garments. In Britain in the 1970s we picked up on this 1960s style but stuck to more low-key, off-the-peg versions. The suit is original 1960s but I wore it in 1978 with as much gold as we could afford and we used gold cigarette paper on our teeth as a cap\u201d (Gaz Mayall).",
