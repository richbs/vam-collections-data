It is strong and non-porous, and in its simplest form, made in at least three sizes, it would have been in use daily for beer or cider. However, this example, which is elaborately and crisply modelled, would have been comparatively expensive and was probably intended largely for show, or, at most, for use on special occasions.\n\nHistorical Associations\nWilliam Brownfield & Co. exhibited internationally for the first time in the London exhibition of 1862. The design of this jug was registered with the grand name of 'International'.  The female figures depicted in the four oval panels represent themes that were taken up by many mid-19th-century designers. The 'International' jug proved popular and was still in production in 1876.\n\nPeople\nDespite the prodigious production of relief-moulded jugs, relatively little is known about William Brownfield, the owner of the factory from 1850 until his death in 1873.  He registered a large number of designs, and the factory, which under his two sons retained his name, continued to do this after his death. By 1883 at least 27 new designs for Brownfield jugs had been thus protected.  The production of jugs of all types, both relief-moulded and  plain, was clearly a Brownfield staple; there is evidence in a catalogue published in about 1876 of at least 48 different designs.",
