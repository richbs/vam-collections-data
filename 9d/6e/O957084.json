            "history_note": "Jan de Bisschop (1628-1671), also known as Johannes Episcopius, was a Dutch painter and printmaker. He first studied to be become a lawyer but then abandoned the profession in order to study art with Bartholomeus Breenbergh (1598 c.-1657 c.), a Dutch painter specialising in Italianate landscapes. In 1656 de Bisschop took part in the foundation of the Confrerie Pictura, a club of artists, in The Hague. \nHe was particularly interested in the teaching of art and this resulted in his making two series of prints based on classical statues and on sixteenth and seventeenth century artists for students to draw from. The first of these suites is the Signorum Veterum Icones which was published by Nicolaes Visscher in two parts in 1668 and 1669 while the Paradigmata Graphices variorum artificum in 1671. The two volumes of the Icones were subsequently published in one single edition, together with the Paradigmata. The Icones comprises of a suite of 100 plates of reproductive prints of sculptures, including a large number of well known statues of the Greek and Roman period. The second suite, the Paradigmata, consists of 57 reproductive plates of paintings and sculptures by Italian and Dutch sixteenth and seventeenth century artists. \nThis plate was acquired by the Museum along with eight other prints from the Icones (Museum numbers 29627.61-29627.69).     \nThe statue is now housed in the Loggia dei Lanzi, in Florence. It was previously in the collection of the Medici family and it was probably displayed in one of the family\u2019s palaces when Bisschop made this print. The statue dates to 2nd century AD. Thusnelda (10 BC- 17 AD c.) was a German princess who, in 9 AD c. married Arminius (17/16 BC c.-21 AD) a leader of the Germanic tribes fighting against the Roman army during the age of Emperor Augustus (27 BC-14 AD). She was taken prisoner by Germanicus (15 BC-19 AD), grandchild of Augustus and during the imprisonment she had her only child, Thumelicus, who died when he was only 15 or 16. The statue represents Thusnelda as barbarian prisoner, her right arm bended under her face in a pensive mood.",
