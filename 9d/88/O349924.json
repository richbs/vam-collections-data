The gesso has been laid over linen in places where the wood is rough. The face has been naturalistically painted with flesh tones (the lips are red) and there are traces of gilding in the hair underneath a later layer of dark-coloured paint.",

Confirming the figure's localisation in this region of Northern Germany is its similarity to two further standing figures in L\u00fcbeck, St. Peter and St. Paul, presumably from a similar altarpiece. This figure also clearly belonged to an altarpiece; it would have stood, separated from the other figures around it by slender colonnettes, under an elaborate canopy and with a painted and gilded back board behind it. The identity of the saint cannot be ascertained but it is highly likely that this statue once held the small tower connected with St. Barbara.",
