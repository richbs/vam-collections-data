The couple are purified, drink sake(rice wine) and the groom reads the words of commitment before offerings are made to the gods. The bride wears a white under-kimono and heavy white outer-kimono known as a shiromuku, shiromeaning white and mukumeaning pure. This outer-kimono has a design of a large noshi, an auspicious ornament traditionally tied to goodwill gifts, the ribbons of which cascade down the front and back of the garment.  The bride's hair is also elaborately styled and she wears a hood called a tsuno kakushi. This is meant to hide her two tsuno, or horns, to symbolize obedience to her husband.  After the ceremony the bride exchanges the white outer-kimono for a brightly coloured one and joins her family and friends for the reception. She may also change clothes a further time, today often into western-style wedding or party attire.",
