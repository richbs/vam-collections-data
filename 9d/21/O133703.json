This painting showing a young woman drawing water at a well in a board style and earthen palette that reveal the influence of his master Charles Gleyre. This painting was probably made in Vevey where he appeared to have stayed all his life.

Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is typical of the naturalist movement developed in Germanic Europe during the 19th century. Swiss painters in particular received both the influence of the Realist movement emerged in France in the 1840s and the Biedermeier imagery characterised by sentimental domestic scenes. \nSchlesinger is mostly known for his paintings on enamel and this painting is therefore a rare example of his oil compositions.",
