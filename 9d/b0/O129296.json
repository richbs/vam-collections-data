In a statement made in 1988 he averred that printmaking was a seminal activity for him, which significantly affected his development as an artist, particularly  the way he continued to draw and he confessed to sometimes having a longing to make prints. \n\nHis work frequently addresses the brutality of war, and his representation of weaponry, machinery and its other accuoutrements has been  influenced by the early 20th century Italian Futurist artists. In this image a single soldier is discernable against a ground which could be an abstract pattern derived from earlier studies of armour. Much of his work has a memorial theme, looking back to various periods of intense international and global conflict.",
