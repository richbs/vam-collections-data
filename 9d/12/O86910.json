It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nAndrew Melville was the producer of this spectacular pantomime, which starred Margaret Bannerman as the miller's son Jack, and a cast of over 100. Dan Leno Jr was the son of the legendary Dan Leno. His mother was Lydia Reynolds, the comedy vocalist whom Leno had married in 1883 when he was seventeen. Dan Leno Jr is sketched here as the dame, the pantomime role played with such acclaim by his famous father. Dan Leno Jr, went on to write pantomimes himself.",
