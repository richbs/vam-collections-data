In the 19th century their best known product was the Venetian chain.  This was an extremely fine gold chain, with small compact square links which interlocked tightly with each other to form a very strong, supple chain.  This chain was renowned throughout Europe, to such an extent that the name is still often used today as an alternative name for box chains.\n\nThis example comes from Cervaro, in central Italy.  It might have been imported from Venice, or made locally.  The star-shaped filigree pendant is typical of filigree from the south of Italy.  \n\nThey were bought together as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
