The front of the case is engraved with the arms and motto that were granted to Major William Careless.  The back is engraved with a scene showing Careless and Charles II hiding in the oak tree. Inside the locket are a portrait of Careless and an inscription.\n\nHistorical Associations\nAfter the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, the young Charles II and Colonel Careless sheltered at the home of the Penderell family at Boscobel House, Shropshire. It was suggested that they might hide from the searching Cromwellian soldiers by climbing up into 'a great oak', taking with them 'some victuals for the whole day viz. bread, cheese, small beer, and nothing else'. Thus they escaped, to become the subject of legend.\n\nInscription\n'Renowned Carlos! thow has won the day\n(Loyalty Lost) by helping Charles away,\nFrom Kings-Blood-Thirsty-Rebels in a Night,\nmade black with Rage, of theives, & Hells dispight\nLive! King-Loved Sowle thy fame be Euer Spoke\nBy all whilst England Beares a Royall Oake'\n\nHeraldry\nCareless's arms celebrate his service to his king.  The shield bears an oak tree with three royal crowns on a fess (a horizontal band).  The crest has a sword and sceptre in saltire (in the shape of a St Andrew's cross), with a civic crown (a wreath).  The motto is Subditus fidelis Regis & Regni salus ('A subject faithful to his king is the safety of the kingdom').",
