In late 18th- and 19th-century Europe such furniture was believed to be Elizabethan and it was much sought after for houses of that period and for those built in Tudor style. Scholars believe that this table originally sat in Strawberry Hill, the Gothic Revival villa in Twickenham, London, that belonged to the renowned antiquary Horace Walpole. Although its dimensions and description do match a table in the Strawberry Hill inventory, there is nothing to confirm that this is the same piece.",
