It is the traditional triangular form with the back of the body and neck painted red and the head yellow. The front of the body is painted with a floral design in pink; yellow; green; red; orange; purple and black. The neck is black with white stripes and dots. Attached to the head are three string pegs; with metal strings held to the body by a nail. The strings pass over a hole in the body and a small bridge stained blue. The body parts are nailed together but the head is placed on to the neck with a wedge. The whole surface has been varnished. \nThis toy was made to traditional designs and it would have been sold to the Co-operative group for sale. Although the area co-operatives have been replaced there is still no credit given to an actual maker.",
