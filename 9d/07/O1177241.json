Boys' dresses were made and worn as such, and were not a case of 'dressing them as girls': the cut, fabrics, accessories and colours are usually clues to the differentiation of gender.  \n\nThe origin of the younger boys wearing dresses may be simply that before about 1550, both sexes and all ages wore skirted garments such as tunics and gowns, and children's styles were often slow to change. Other theories to account for the custom include the idea that all children of this age were considered more or less as babies and so wore the same type of garments; that it was appropriate for young boys to wear skirts because young children were cared for by women rather than men; that it protected their legs if they fell while learning to walk; that it would be easier to change nappies. In fact the age for breeching suggests that making it easier for young boys to urinate or defecate is perhaps the main explanation. This would be especially true when breeches or trousers had complicated fastenings which took a long time to undo.",

'Our Boys' was first performed in London in 1875 and ran there for several years as well as touring. Its plot is about the relationship of two fathers and their adult sons in connection with the sons' marriages, so the painting does not refer to the play, but no doubt the title was well known and something of a catch phrase.",
