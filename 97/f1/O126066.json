ISBN: 0642541566.\nExhibition catalogue.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 69, 70, 72\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"The canvas has been relined at an unknown date.  A label on the stretcher is inscribed in ink <i>Painted in 1811</i>; this is presumably based on an inscription on the original canvas.\n\nDrawings by Constable of the village f\u00eate at East Berholt in July 1813 are on pp. 85 and 87 of the sketch-book No. 121 [317-1888], and of a village Jubilee f\u00eate of 1814 on p. 13 of the sketch-book No. 132.  Baskett (<i>Constable Oil Sketches</i>, 1966, p. 20 and Pl. I) conclusively identifies the scene as East Bergholt.  The house on the left is West Lodge (now called Stour), East Bergholt.  He suggests that the view is taken from an upper window of Golding Constable\u2019s house.  Another view of the same house (once erroneously called Wooling Hall) is in the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon.  According to William White\u2019s <i>History, Gazeteer, and Directory of Suffolk</i> (2nd edn. 1855, p. 214) a fair for toys etc. took place in East Bergholt on the last Wednesday in July.  The rule earlier seems to have been to hold the fair during the last week in July (see <i>East Bergholt in Suffolk</i>, by T. F. Paterson, 1923, p. 105).\nA small oil sketch showing West Lodge, the red brick house on the left of this composition, was Lot 117 in the Gregory Sale at Messrs.  Sotheby\u2019s 20 July 2949; the sale catalogue wrongly described the house as that of Golding Constable, which is shown in Nos. 102 [583-1888], 133 [437-1888], etc.\n\nNotes on Nos. 100-104 [326-1888, 128-1888, 583-1888, 135-1888, 325-1888]\n\nNos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888] are the earliest dated oil sketches in the Museum's collections to show the full originality of Constable's mature style, its vivid naturalism of colouring and boldness of handling.  The earliest dated sketch in which these characteristics are applied to Suffolk scenery is probably the 'Country road near East Berghold' inscribed <i>October 13th, 1809 E[ast] B[erghold].</i>  This was Lot 116 <i>recto</i> (on the <i>verso</i> is a sketch of a country house) in the Gregory sale at Messrs.  Sotheby's, 20 July 1949.  This sketch was reproduced in monochrome in the sale catalogue and in colour as the frontispiece to the Arts Council's catalogue <i>An Exhibition of Sketches & Drawings by John Constable from the collection of Dr. H. A. C. Gregory, M.C., </i> 1949.  In 'Fresh Light on John Constable' (<i>Apollo</i>, Vol. LXXXVII, 1968, pp. 227-30) Charles Rhyne draws attention to oil sketches dated 27 September 1810 and 30 September 1810 in the John G. Johnson collection, Philadelphia, and a landscape with houses dated 8 October 1810 in the collection of Mrs. Woodman.  The style may be seen in embryo in some of the oil sketches Constable made of Lake District scenery in 1806: for instance in 'Keswick Lake' formerly in the possession of Sir Michael Sadler (L. ed. S., Pl. 32).  The reasons for grouping Nos. 102 [583-1888], 103 [135-1888], and 104 [325-1888] with these two dated oil sketches have not been explained; they do not amount to a conclusive dating.  Sketching in oils from nature was in fact prominent in Constable's practice in 1811, for he called on nature, and on 17 December Farington called on Constable to see the painted studies of landscapes from nature which he had made during the autumn (Greig, Vol. VI, p. 279; VII, p. 70).  Another set of studies conveniently, though more loosely, grouped here with the appearance of Constable's completely matured naturalism is to be found in Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888].\"\nIan Collins, ed. <u>Masterpieces.
