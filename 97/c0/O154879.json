He designed university productions while at Cambridge and continued to produce stage dresses for several theatrical leading ladies after he opened his own fashion house in 1932.  The face, with the heavily emphasised eyes, follows the tradition established by silent-screen star Theda Bara, who popularised the word 'vamp' (a contraction of vampire, which she played in one of her films) to mean a predatory female, whose heavily khol-encircled eyes were her most memorable feature.  \nThe combination of hair and neckband throw emphasis onto the eyes and blood red  lips.  The bare left shoulder is balanced by the weight of the hair being also on the left, while the bare shoulder and leg, at once revealed and concealed by the fabric strips, hint at intention and concealed delights.",
