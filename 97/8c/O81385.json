Donn\u00e9 and subsequently in Geneva under A. Calame (1810-1864), with whom he worked on some of Calame's major compositions. He was a founder member of the Geneva Artists' Circle and of the 'Brunswick'. He exhibited at Geneva between 1845 and 1886 and mainly produced views of the Alps, Savoy and Bern.\n\nThis painting depicts a view of Saint-Jeoire in Savoy, near the Lake Geneva. This painting is characteristic of George-Julliard's style, close to Calame's technique and high degree of finish. The depiction of the grandiose scenery of the Alps enlivened by torrents and very small figures in the middle distance is recurrent in Julliard's oeuvre. This painting is a good example of mountainous landscape painting which developed in Switzerland in the 19th century.",

He painted mainly Alpine scenes and exhibited in Geneva from 1845 to 1886. \n\nAscribed to jean-Philippe GEORGE \n \n92 \nST JOIRE, SAVOY \nSigned lower centre with a monogram <i>HPG</i> \nMill board \n14 x 11 7/8 (35.5 x 30) \nTownshend Bequest \n1603-1869 \n\nThe monogram was identified by Nagler, <i>Die Monogrammisten,</i> iii, 1863, no. 1370, as that of 'Henri Philippe Georges' of Geneva, though he added that he had only seen it on one example of the artist's work, a lithograph of Cape Miseno published in <i>Esquisses d'atelier. Publication du Cercle des Artistes,</i> i, Geneva, 1853. \n1603-1869 entered the Museum as by H. P. Georges and was subsequently catalogued as such (1893 <i>Catalogue,</i> p. 163). Brun's <i>Schweizerisches K\u00fcnstlerlexikon,</i> i, 1905, p. 563, described this artist as Jean-Philippe George 'Quelquefois appel\u00e9 Henri-Philippe'; the entry in Thieme-Becker, xiii, 1920, p. 425 is even firmer: 'Jean Philippe, nicht Henri Philippe'. \nIn spite of this difficulty over the name, it would seem likely that 1603-1869 is by this artist, were it not for the fact that it differs considerably from his paintings in the Geneva Museum and elsewhere: It is painted in an early 19th century style and may be dated ca. 1820-40; Jean-Philippe George was essentially a naturalistic landscape painter, influenced by Calame, whose pupil he was from 1842. If this is by him, it must be a very early work painted when he was twenty or younger, before his mature style was formed. \n\nProv. The Rev. C. H. Townshend; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868.",

By H. P. Georges. In frame. Signed with initials. Swiss. Present century'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: Like his master A. Calame, Julliard used the scenery of the Alps and other mountains to convey the grandiose forces of nature through the depiction of stormy summits and torrents as well as calm and serene lake scenes. This aesthetic is not far from that of the Romantic movement and its use of nature as a mirror of the human and divine mind. The small figures in the foreground, perched on the top of rock are representative of such conception of an overwhelming and omnipotent nature against human fragility.\nThis painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape paintings. It is not unlikely that Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist.",
