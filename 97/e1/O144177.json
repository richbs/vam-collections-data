The two main styles during this time were small, and often very elaborate, skull-caps, or wide \u2018saucer\u2019 hats.  Wide brimmed straw hats such as this would have been worn with a tailored suit or day dress.\n\nThis hat is by the couturier Jacques Heim (1899\u20131967).  Heim introduced his youthful Jeunes Filles line in 1936 and a boutique accessories line from the mid 1940s.  His Heim-Actualit\u00e9 ready-to-wear collection launched in 1950 was sold in outlets in the South of France. Women\u2019s Wear Daily described him as \u2018basically an innovator in business. He didn\u2019t want to be called a designer, but rather an editor of clothes\u2019.",
