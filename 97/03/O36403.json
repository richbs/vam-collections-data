The right horse is tan with black and red trim and the rider is a 'cowboy' in orange; red; blue; yellow and silver. The left horse is the same colouring and the rider is an 'indian' painted purple; pink which and green. Both jockeys are looking to the left and the horses are in a galloping stance. They are mounted on metal supports from the clockwork which move up and down in rotation governed by the twists in the wheel axles. The clockwork is housed in a green metal casing mounted on two large green; yellow and red wheels at the back and a small red one at the front. The key is integral to the mechanism. It is the wheel axles which govern the movement of the horses. \n2. box lid; brown card with staples. On the top is a paper label printed in colours to show the toy; the title and the trademark. The mark; white and red; is a winged O with the letter Y inside it. To the right of the mark is JAPAN. \n3. box base; brown card with staples.\n*see also B139-1994 which is similar but earlier and smaller.",
