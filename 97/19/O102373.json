His hair falls onto his neck and he has a small moustache; his long-skirted reddish brown jacket is belted and trimmed around the skirt with fur, the low V neck revealing the white loose shirt and black knotted cravat; to the back hangs a blue waist-length cloak; his full breeches are red and tuck into knee-high black boots.  His partner is dressed in 'East European' dress, with a small square pale blue cap, fur trimmed, with tassel and cockade.  Her hair is smoothed down and finishes in two long, thin, beribboned plaits.  Her long-sleeved, low-necked, knee-length overdress is pale blue, trimmed with fur and decorated with frogging; beneath is a white calf-length white skirt.  Her fitted ankle-length red boots are trimmed with white fur.  Surrounding the image and title is an elaborate decorative border.",

            "public_access_description": "The polka comes from Bohemia and was first performed in London by Carlotta Grisi and Jules Perrot in 1844.  The print shows them performing the polka's characteristic 'hop' step.  Soon it stormed the ballrooms and became one of the most popular social dances of the century. Grisi and Perrot's pictures were everywhere, not only on prints, but on ceramics and, as here, on music sheets. \nLouis Antoine Jullien, who composed this particular polka, was one of the first star conductors.  He studied in Paris, but his tastes were for light rather than classical music.  Fleeing from his creditors, he came to London, formed an orchestra and established the first promenade concerts.  He was a leading figure in English popular music and played up to his reputation with flamboyant dressing and behaviour.  Ruined by the failure of his opera Pietro ii Grande in 1852, he left London and in 1859 returned to Paris, where he was imprisoned for debt.  Sadly, he developed a severe mental illness soon afterwards and died in 1860.",

The print shows Carlotta Grisi and Jules Perrot performing the Polka, which they first danced in London in 1844.  The Polka comes from Bohemia and the print shows them performing the polka's characteristic 'hop' step.  Before long it was being performed in the ballrooms and it became one of the most enduring social dances of the century.  Grisi and Perrot's pictures were everywhere, not only on prints, but on ceramics and, as here, on music sheets.\n\nHistorical significance: In the second half of the 19th century, no self-respecting house was without a piano and a flourishing music publishing industry fed the need for new music.  The covers were often decorated with lithographed images, which reflect many aspects of Victorian life and culture.  Many performers had their images on related music sheets and thus became well-known names to people who might never see them perform.",
