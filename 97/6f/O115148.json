Only about half the design is shown and the drawing appears to have been cut down at some point in its history. It is possibly a traced copy of a work by the painter and draughtsman, Battista Franco (born in Venice about 1510 and died there in 1561).\n\nNo plate is known to exist to this design, although a fine plate showing 'Hercules and Cerberus' with a similar border of fighting animals does survive. Scholars have speculated that there once existed a whole service depicting the 'Labours of Hercules', designed by Battista Franco and produced at Casteldurante.    \n\nIn 1545-6 Franco had been commissioned by the Duke of Urbino to paint the vault of the choir of Urbino Cathedral. However, the work disappointed the Duke because it failed to equal the quality of the preparatory drawings.  Thinking Franco's skills were better suited to working on a small scale, the Duke commissioned him to make designs for maiolica which was manufactured at Casteldurante.",

They pointed out that 'an excellent maiolica plate survives with 'Hercules and Cerberus'; its borders filled with brilliantly designed and executed fighting animals...' They went on to say that because of the existence of this crude copy with a similar animal border it seems likely that there once existed a service with the 'Labours of Hercules'. The Cerberus plate has on its back a curious inscription with the letters 'CD' and what may be either a coronet or a caduceus.  It is tempting to suppose that these initials stand either for 'Castel Durante' or for the name of the artist (? Camillo Durantino) or workshop; but they could equally stand for the name of the plate's first owner. The subject might have been appropriate for Charles V, whose 'impresa' was the Columns of Hercules'.  See the References tab.\n\nAttribution note: The design was incised with a stylus for transfer to a maiolica dish before painting and firing.",

Thinking Franco's skills were better suited to working on a small scale, the Duke commissioned him to make designs for maiolica produced at Casteldurante.\nMaria Sica. \"Franco Battista\" Grove Art Online.
