The two fountains in the top left corner are situated on top of a stone wall. The furthest left is a sculpture of a human figure with water spouting from it into a circular basin. The other is a sculpture of a merman with water spouting through a conch shell at its mouth into a circular scalloped-edged basin below him. The fountain below these, in the lower left corner, is composed of a sculpture of a horse set on a large rectangular plinth. Water spouts from the horse's mouth into a basin set on the shoulders of a merman sculpture below. A front view of the same horse and merman fountain is included to the right. The top right corner of the drawing consists of two details of sculptural wall pilasters. Each are decorated with a horse's head surrounded by swirling sculptural detail. A final fountain is included in the lower right corner of the drawing. It is composed of a large lower basin with sculptures of a horse and a dolphin within. Several vertical water jets flow from a smaller basin that rests upon the two central sculptures.",
