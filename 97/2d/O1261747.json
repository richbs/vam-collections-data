She now lives in California. She has travelled, taught and exhibited widely and won awards for her work which features in the permanent collections of a number of museums internationally.\n\nDuring the 1970s Diana became interested in reviving the almost forgotten technique of p\u00e2te-de-verre which had been developed in France by Henri Cros (1840-1907) at the end of the nineteenth century. She produced fine semi-translucent vessels of press-moulded crushed glass fired at 700\u00b0C. The Museum has several examples of her finished work. Her presentation to the V&amp;A of her experimental pieces in 2003-04 has furnished the Collection with an invaluable technical context and insight into the artist's methods.",
