There are also small areas of jufti knotting, not for decorative reasons.\n\nSIDE FINISH: Left: has one cord oversewn with red wool.  Right: incomplete but otherwise is as above.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: 1\" (2.5 cms) plain weave, first with white weft and then with red, which has been turned and stitched in place.  Upper: 2 rows of dark blue symmetrical knots over 6 warps and then 1\" (2.5 cms) of plain weave with white weft, turned and stitched in place.\n\nDESIGN: field: a red ground which extends to left and right at the lower end.  There are two large angular medallions also with a red ground; in the centre of each is a dark green and pink star on a dark pink silk ground framed by a dark blue line with Holbein knots.  From the inner rim of each medallion are eight hooked pink motifs filled with stylised flowers or chevrons.  There are also four roundels of eight flowerheads, the roundels have dark pink silk centres.  To either side of the medallions and between are hooked diamonds with a red ground, superimposed upon a rectangle, both outlined in dark green and containing a dark purple silk diamond in a horned pink frame.  There is an incomplete hooked diamond at the outer edge of the field.  There are two bands of six inward-facing paired arches outlined and linked by a band of flowerheads, the bands outlined in white; within each arch is a stemmed and leafed version of the hooked pink motifs filled with flowers within the two medallions.\nThe main border: a white ground with brown cartouches linked by brown diamonds with various coloured fields each containing a two-coloured rosette with some petals of dark pink silk.\n Inner and outer border: a red ground with green 'S' motifs on the inner and light blue on the outer border.\nA lower band of undecorated dark red pile extends one-third of the way up both sides.  Below this is a final band of reciprocal horned pattern in dark blue and pink with white flowerheads.\nAcross the top of the bag face and extending two-thirds of the way down both sides is an overall pattern of diamonds formed by a multi-coloured chequering, predominantly in reds and yellows, with white and dark brown chequered centres.  The side extensions end in one row of symmetrical jufti knots in dark blue wool.\n\nDate catalogued: 14.2.95",

Sometimes, as in this example, one border runs along the bottom and part of the way up each side, while the others expand to form a T-shape. There are sometimes extra borders, such as the narrow one along the upper edge. Perhaps because bag faces are relatively small, time was taken to include many small details. Small amounts of light purple silk have been used in the pile.",
