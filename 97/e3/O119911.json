In architectural ornament the carving is called a terminal figure (or term), a pedestal merging at its top into a human or animal figure.\n\nThe pose of the figure under a canopy suggests an attitude of prayer, while her gown parts around an ornament of fruitfulness. Carved figures about 1600 often carried allegorical or symbolic meanings and would have been understood in that way. The carving is not a highly realistic depiction of women's dress, though the ruff and halo head-dress can be seen in portraits of about 1600. The loose, pleated gown worn by the figure - with punched ornament to suggest a luxurious texture - is not characteristic of court dress at this period, but might represent a costume for a masque or theatrical entertainment.",
