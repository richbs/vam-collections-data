This perhaps followed the late 18th-century tradition of celebrating the exploits of king and country in board games. Strategy games were naturally the easiest to transform into battle games of all types. Men at war, be they soldiers, seamen or pilots, would play games in their spare time, re-enacting famous victories. They often created their own simple boards from paper and pencil.\n\nThis game is a straightforward race game with an unusual pattern of play, set up and down the board around the central illustration, which is the finish.",
