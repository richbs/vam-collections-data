            "history_note": "The bronze forms part of Leon Underwood's last phase of sculptural output. It demonstrates his well known, 'bronze skin' effect which saw him producing lively and complex surfaces with rough texturing (akin to Auguste Rodin) and employing hollow cavities (comparible to Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth). It is a good example of Underwood pushing the boundaries of the tensile strength of bronze to make it look highly flexible and almost weightless.\n\nA version of <i>Gladiators (Combat)</i>was exhibited at the Camden Studios in 1967, the Minories in Colchester in 1969 and at the artist's last ever show at the Archer Gallery in 1969. This version, the first of seven, was acquired at auction in Colchester in 2013. The vendor, who inherited it from his father, recalls it being in the family for approximately 30 years. This suggests that it could possibly be the version displayed at the Minories in Colchester in 1969, from where it then might have been purchased. It may have had previous owners prior to the family from which it was bought, but at present, this is still unknown.",
