Gold earrings, like these, were more commonly worn by urban women, in contrast to the heavier silver earrings, often made in one piece, which were preferred by tribal and nomadic women.  These were acquired by the Museum in 1904 as part of a large donation, when they were described as Syrian, dated 1256 AH.  \n\nThe stamped marks describe the quality of the gold used.  These marks are similar in design and location to those used in Egypt in the second half of the 19th century and it is possible that these earrings were made in Egypt rather than Syria.  They indicate that the earrings are made of 21 carat gold.",
