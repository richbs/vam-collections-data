Syllabub is a rich mixture of cream, typically flavoured with sherry or sack. The spout allowed the drinker to enjoy the liquid ale or sack that had separated below the thick layer of curdled posset or creamy syllabub.\t\n\nThere are several marks struck on the side by the spout and on top of the cover. One is the Norwich hallmark, the castle and lion. The crowned rose hallmark, added in the early 17th century, was changed to a stalked rose at the end of the period 1600-1700. The letter T is the date letter for 1642-3 and there is also the mark of the maker, Timothy Skottowe.\n\nThe scroll handle is formed of a strip between two scrolled plates. The front was engraved at a later date with a coat of arms within a plume mantling surmounted by a crest. Although the plume mantling dates from the 1660s, the coat of arms and crest were probably added in the period 1800-1900.",
