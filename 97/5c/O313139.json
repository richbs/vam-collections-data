The level of detail is consistent with a finished work, rather than a sketch model. Soldani appears to have cast the relief in sections which were then applied to the slab of clay forming the background. Cast line on the surface and finger prints on the back of some sections (visible when the relief was dismantled for conservation) indicate that the clay was pushed into a mould. Other areas were partly modelled. The relief was cut into sections after firing (and rejoined with plaster), with areas of high relief also cur through for removal, presumably to enable a piece mould to be made. There are two other closely related versions in wax (Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Marchese Ginori Lisci Collection, Florence) and the evidence therefore suggests that a bronze was planned, although no known cast survives.",
