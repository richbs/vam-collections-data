On either side are seated Victories and at each end piles of armour. There is a narrow moulded rim.\n\nModerno is the pseudonym of a goldsmith and medalist active in North Italy and later in Rome. He signed certain pieces of his work with OPUS MODERNI (opus is the Latin term for 'work' - which then means 'work of the modern'). The modern here is referring to the Ancient World, in contrary to the Naturalism of the Gothic. He was active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. His earliest works may date around 1485-1490, and his earliest dated work is 1490. There are many different suggestions in literature to whom OPUS MODERNI may refer, and there has never been a clear answer to it.",
