This canvas is painted in the style of Jacob van Ruisdael, regarded as the principal figure among Dutch landscape painters of the second half of the 17th century. His naturalistic compositions and style of representing massive forms and his colour range constituted a new direction away from the \u2018tonal phase\u2019 (ca. 1620\u2013ca. 1650) associated with the previous generation of landscape painters including his uncle Salomon van Ruysdael, Jan van Goyen, Cornelis Vroom, Pieter Molijn. Ruisdael produced several distinct landscape types\u2014mountainous, woodland and river settings, waterfalls, beach and dune scenes, seascapes, panoramas and winter scenes. He was not apparently interested in Italianate landscapes but stands out among contemporaries such as Aelbert Cuyp and Philips Koninck. His oeuvre comprises ca. 700 paintings and ca. 100 drawings, the majority undated.  Around 1650\u2013c. 1656, Ruisdael visited the Dutch\u2013German border region, probably with his friend Nicolaes Berchem, and depicted a number of new subjects, such as half-timbered houses and water-mills similar in feeling and tone to 306/307-1864.  Pictures of large trees constituted another new development for Ruisdael and The Great Oak of 1652 now in the Los Angeles County Museum, shows how he made a wooded landscape monumental through focusing on a single mighty tree. The two artist's may have even collaborated on the Los Angeles picture, Berchem inserting diminutive figures into Ruisdael's monumental landscape.",

His style of representing massive forms and his colour range constituted a new direction away from the \u2018tonal phase\u2019 (c. 1620\u2013c. 1650) associated with earlier landscape painters such as his uncle Salomon van Ruysdael, Jan van Goyen and others. Ruisdael showed unusual versatility:\u2014mountainous, woodland and river settings, waterfalls, beach and dune scenes, seascapes, panoramas and winter scenes. Around 1650\u2013c. 1656, Ruisdael visited the Dutch\u2013German border region, and depicted a number of new subjects, such as half-timbered houses and water-mills similar in feeling and tone to 306/307-1864.",

            "historical_context_note": "Landscape painting became especially popular in Flanders and the Netherlands in the 17th century, and increasingly encompassed a variety of forms. Dutch painters in particular demonstrated careful attention to their local surroundings. Panoramic views became popular in 17th-century Netherlands and Jan van Goyen (1596-1656) developed a broken brushwork technique and used a restrained monochromatic palette of earthy colours. At the end of the 17th century there was a pronounced shift in taste towards more academic and classical Italianate landscapes.",
