Having worked as a commercial photographer, he is conscious of what he calls \"the pervasive technological-consumerist culture\". In response to this, along with other artists of his generation such as Garry Fabian Miller and Susan Derges, he has returned to the simplest photographic means: photography without the use of a camera. Such procedures recall the earliest photographs of the 1830's and 1840's. In Fuss\u2019s work, light is used as a metaphor to illuminate the processes and stages of human life.",
