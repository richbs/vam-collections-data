This cord is thought to have been used as part of a scheme for window drapes at Windsor Castle.  The style of the work is very close to an earlier set of items, also in the Museum's collection, and said to have been used at Windsor in 1853 (see T.269-1965). It was thought to have been manufactured by the London cord and tassel supplier B.A.Clarke.",
