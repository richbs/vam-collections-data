The washing of hands at the dinner table was an important part of the medieval dining process. Hands were dipped into a basin filled with water, or held above a dish whilst water was poured over them. From the thirteenth century in France, gemellions were used for this purpose. One of the gemellions, like this example, would have a small spout from which water would be poured. The second bowl was used to catch the water. Gemellions were commonly enameled and often decorated with chivalric scenes and heraldry. This gemellion depicts the Royal arms of France amidst images of seated kings. The appearance of heraldic arms on such a commonly used object shows to what extent heraldry infiltrated secular art in the medieval period.",

The iconography combines the ideals of chivalry and kingship with heraldry. The appearance of heraldic arms on such a commonly used object shows to what extent heraldry infiltrated secular art in the medieval period. This object, with its strong images of kingship and royalty, may have been intended as an outward show of loyalty to the King. Similarly it may have indicated power by affiliating the owner with the royal arms of France.",

The washing of hands at the dinner table was an important part of the medieval dining process. Hands were dipped into a basin filled with water, or held above a dish whilst water was poured over them. From the thirteenth century in France, gemellions were used for this purpose. One of the gemellions, like this example, would have a small spout from which water would be poured. The second bowl was used to catch the water. Gemellions were commonly enameled and often decorated with chivalric scenes and heraldry.",
