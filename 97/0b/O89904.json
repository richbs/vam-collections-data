The picture is rendered as a line drawing with touches of colour in a soft version of <i>nim qalam</i> on a plain buff-coloured paper ground.  The face is given emphasis with touches of pale watercolour in the white beard, lips and eyes and bolder outline round his facial features in profile.  He is kneeling with his hands outstretched in front of him. He is wearing a flattish turban and long-sleeved robe with a knotted sash at the waist and a shawl wound round his upper body with its two ends falling down his back and to the ground.  He kneels on the ground which is simply rendered in a brownish grey wash that is echoed in a darker shade at the top to suggest a notional sky.\n      The borders of this painting are treated in a similar manner to that of the opposite painting with a series of narrow strips of gold outlined in black, white outlines, a buff-coloured plain border and a narrower marbled one in blueish grey, which is ornamented with gold scroll motifs..  This inner border is finished with a blue line ruled on the ground of the main border.  The main border has an ivory-coloured ground and is decorated with a stencilled row of stylised flowers marbled in blueish-grey and white and outlined in gold.  The margins of the page have strips of beige paper with an inner outline in white with traces of a red line underneath.  A strip of pinkish-buff paper has been added a gutter for the album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
