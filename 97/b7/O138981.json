The sketch from which it was taken was probably painted as far back as 1826, for in that year Cox visited France, intending to make a tour through the country, and was compelled to stay in Paris for six weeks on the account of a sprained ankle which incapacitated him from walking. Cox made the best use of his time by driving about Paris in a fiacre, which he stopped whenever he came upon a subject which took his fancy. He made his sketches either from the interior of the fiacre, or, occasionally, seated on a chair when on the banks of the Seine or the less crowded thoroughfares. Though Cox visited France again in 1832, to see a review at Boulogne, he only stayed in the country for a week and does not appear to have gone to Paris. The Tuileries were burnt down by the Communards in 1871, but have been partly rebuilt.\n\nWater-colour, 15 1/2 in. by 25 3/4 in.\n\nExhibited -\n\nThe Society of Painters in Water-Colour, 1838, No. 78 (?)\nThe Old Masters Exhibition at the Royal Academy, 1892\nFrom the collections of --\nFrederick Nettlefold, 1913\nA.
