They are also known as kanphata ('split ear') yogis as they wear distinctively large circular ear-rings, which are visible in the painting. This group of yogis is shown in a mountainous setting, where they are listening to the preaching of one of their early preceptors. Maharaja Man Singh of Jodhpur (ruled 1803-43) was a devotee of this sect, as he believed one of their leaders had helped him occupy the throne. His court artists were therefore commissioned to paint a great many images of the Naths and their leaders.
