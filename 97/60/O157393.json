Her figure originated in India as the male deity Avalokitesvara, bodhisattva of compassion; after the introduction of Buddhism in China, he was transformed into a female deity associated to motherly virtues of piety.\n\nIn this image, Guanyin is portrayed seated in the pose known as lalitasana, or 'royal ease'. Like other bodhisattvas, she wears jewellery on the head, torso and arms; on the head, the elaborately worked diadem has in the centre a lotus pedestal, formerly meant for an Amitabha figure now missing.",
