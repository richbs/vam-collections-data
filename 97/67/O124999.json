Has a complex panorama of town and sea with ships and sea creatures.\n\nThe engraver has followed Ovid's version of the myth, although here Andromeda's rock by the seashore has become an elaborate domed and turreted island fortress, populated by a host of vividly-carved creatures. In the foreground, the sea is filled with marine animals, both fantastic and real. Andromeda stands beneath an arch, naked and shackled at the wrists and ankles, as the huge sea monster to whom she is offered as a sacrifice ploughs menacingly towards her through the waves. Perseus, in the act of flying past, has seen her and fallen instantly in love. He is caught at the moment he swoops down, armed with his sword and shield, to slay the monster and release the princess. In the finest of details, the anxious faces of Andromeda's parents can just be made out, peering through a window of her tower, and in the far distance we can discern the shore and a city, with a tiny trumpeter sounding the alarm from the battlements.",

            "history_note": "The earliest firm documentary reference to the cameo is found in the will of George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who died in 1603, in which he bequeaths his 'greate Aggate wherein is embossed the Portraiture of Perseus and Andromache' to his wife and thence to his daughter Elizabeth, Lady Berkeley. George Carey's father, Henry Hunsdon, lst Baron Hunsdon was, however, first cousin to Queen Elizabeth I, and at one stage her nearest living relative. She maintained close contacts with him, creating him Baron Hunsdon on her accession and bestowing estates on him. Elizabeth stayed with him at Hunsdon House on several occasions, and the two are recorded as having exchanged numerous gifts. It is possible that the cameo was the subject of one of these royal gifts, although evidence to substantiate this has so far not been uncovered.\n\nPrecious and semi-precious stones carved with portraits or scenes from mythology, prized in antiquity, were again collected in Europe from the mid-15th century, interest only spreading to England from the Continent later. The acquisition of this cameo by a noble English family before the end of the 16th century is an early example of the enthusiasm for carved gems which was later to take such a hold on the English aristocracy during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nHistorical significance: This magnificent cameo is a tour de force of the engraver's art and ranks among the finest examples of the period. All the elements, from the elaborate scale of the design itself, the use of the four layers of light and dark strata in the stone to define the various elements of the composition, the extreme richness and delicacy of detail, the crisp carving and sumptuous ornamentation, indicate the hand of a master in the medium. Masnago originated from Milan, and was one of the foremost gem engravers at the Imperial Court of Rudolph II in Prague. Two cameos carry his monogram, and a large group of others are variously ascribed to him, to his workshop or style.",
