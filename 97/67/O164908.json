Two other medallions are in the Kestner-Museum in Hannover. No version of Patience is known to survive in Solnhofen stone, however, although versions in other materials exist. All the reliefs show the Virtues as seated female figures with a distant landscape and architecture in the background. \nPeter Fl\u00f6tner was born in the Thurgau region in Switzerland, but had settled in Nuremberg by 1522. He was a prolific designer, draftsman, medalist and sculptor and cooperated with other Nuremberg artists in providing models and designs. The function of the Cardinal Virtues series was to serve as models for goldsmiths, but the designs were often multiplied in brass or lead and were widely disseminated. Silver-gilt roundels based on the Faith, Hope and Fortitude of this series decorate the so-called Elizabeth I salt cellar in the Tower of London, which was made in London in 1572-73.",
