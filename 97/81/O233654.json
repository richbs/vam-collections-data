Whilst two men purchase some fish, a small white cat observes the scene furtively. \n\nK. H. Ara (1914-85) was an influential member of the Progressive Artists' Group (PAG). PAG was one of a number of Left-wing groups that were active in the 1930-40s Indian cultural scene. In this context, theatre professionals, writers and visual artists united under the 'progressive' banner and loosely endorsed Left-wing ideals to produce and circulate art together. PAG, founded in Mumbai in 1947, included artists Francis Newton Souza, Krishnaji Howlaji Ara, Syed Haider Raza, Hari Ambadas Gade and Sadanand Bakre. PAG members rejected the nationalist art propounded by the Bengal School and embraced the Surrealist, Expressionist, Primitivist and Cubist styles of the international avant-gardes.",

PAG was one of a number of Left-wing groups that were active in the 1930-40s Indian cultural scene. In this context, theatre professionals, writers and visual artists united under the 'progressive' banner and loosely endorsed Left-wing ideals to produce and circulate art together. PAG, founded in Mumbai in 1947, included artists Francis Newton Souza, Krishnaji Howlaji Ara, Syed Haider Raza, Hari Ambadas Gade and Sadanand Bakre. PAG members rejected the nationalist art propounded by the Bengal School and embraced the Surrealist, Expressionist, Primitivist and Cubist styles of the international avant-gardes. \n\nAra lived in Mumbai and worked as a car cleaner for a Japanese businessman. After the bombing of Pearl Harbour, the artist's employer ran away, leaving the house to his servants. Ara continued living and painting in his servant's room for the rest of his life. The artist did not receive a formal education but was trained by Mr. C. Gerrad the Principal of the Sir. J.J. School of Art and encouraged by the then Times of India art critic, Rudy von Leyden. The artist was a member of the Bombay Art Society and Lalit Kala Akademi Judging Committee. He also acted as Secretary for the Artists' Aid Centre. In 1961 he visited Bulgaria as part of an exchange programme sponsored by the Government of India and the Lalit Kala Akademi.",
