Predominately a household item for day-to-day use Tamba ware was both functional and robust with a rustic elegance that was aesthetically pleasing for the user. The wide base and monumental form of Tamba sake bottles, as exemplified by this piece, was ideal for the storage of the alcoholic beverage; while the delicate neck and rounded lip of the bottle was suitable for pouring. The glossy white glaze and delicate colouration was ideal for a piece that would probably have been used in the inns and homes around Japan. Its warm colour and unadorned appearance was highly admired and suitable for an informal setting.",
