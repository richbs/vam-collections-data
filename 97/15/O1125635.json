Originally Grove Manufacturing Company, the firm was founded in 1895 to make dungarees for workers.  The 'OshKosh B'Gosh' label was in use as early as 1911.  \n\nThe company had always made child-sized versions of its overalls, but apparently did not take its children's clothing range seriously until the late 1960s, and had even thought of discontinuing it.  Inclusion of the garments in a mail-order catalogue led to a huge demand, and the garments began to be stocked by major US department stores such as Bloomingdales and Saks Fifth Avenue.  The company realised that childrenswear was a growing market and the buying of workwear was declining, so diversified into nightclothes, shoes, outerwear and other children's items, as well as a range of maternity clothes, and devoted more of its resources to producing these ranges.",
