            "public_access_description": "Dame Wendy Hiller worked in both London and New York, and in 1951 appeared in N.C. Hunter's play Waters of the Moon which ran in London for two years, after which she joined the Old Vic Company.  In her later career she excelled in her portrayal of Queen Mary in Crown Matrimonial (1972). She also appeared in many films, including Separate Tables (1958) for which she won an Academy Award, and Pygmalion for which she received an Oscar nomination, and A Man For All Seasons (1966).  She was created a Dame in 1975.\n\nThe sculptor Peter Lambda was born in Budapest and turned to sculpture after studying medicine in Vienna.  By 1939 when he settled in London, he had already established the main strengths of his work as portraits, caricatures and figure studies. One of his earlier English busts is probably the last sculpted portrait of Sigmund Freud, a family friend in Vienna. Many of his theatrical busts created in the 1950s were also of performers who became friends including Laurence Olivier, Leslie Banks and Claire Bloom.  Lambda alsoexecuted caricature busts such as those of Lena Horne and John Gielgud. He rarely exhibited and his later years were largely occupied by portraits of his children.  Many of his portraits are in public collections, including the National Portrait Gallery and the British Film Institute.  He was married to the actress Betty Paul, with whom he aslo wrote film and televison scripts.",
