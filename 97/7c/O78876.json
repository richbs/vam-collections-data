Many would have been made in all-wool tapestry which, like canvaswork, was hard wearing.  Few were precious enough to be passed from generation to generation. This pin cushion, however, is made of more valuable materials, silk and metal thread, and has been preserved with care.\n\nTrading\nIn the 17th century shops in London provided a direct retail outlet to the customer and small objects, including tapestry-woven items, could be bought  in this way. Prior to this, it had been the custom to buy directly from the maker or  workshop, or from a travelling merchant who took the manufactured wares to the customer or set up a stall at a fair. The existence of shops made available a wider range of 'consumer' goods, albeit to a relatively small percentage of the population.",
