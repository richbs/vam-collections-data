The upper part shows a man with flowing locks and a helmet topped by a winged dragon with his left arm round a broken column. The lower part shows the legs of a warrior with sword and spear. Immediately above the figure is a crown and the word \u2018Fortitudo'. The figure is flanked by two winged putti in armour supporting architectural pinnacles on their heads. They stand beside ornate columns which continue up to the top of the panel where they support an unrelated architectural frieze running across the top containing male figures, putti and birds. The lower part of the columns have wreaths enclosing a star and the letters \u2018DV'. One of these and its accompanying putto appears to be a 19th century addition. All of the above is in executed in brown enamel and yellow silver stain. Above the central panel is an area of later fragements (mainly 17th century) in red, yellow, blue and black forming a decorative pattern. Below the central panel is a trellis pattern and a chequer pattern in artificial perspective all in blue and white glass. These parts above and below were probably added to the latter part of the 18th century.",
