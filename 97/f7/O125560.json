In 1807 he entered the RA schools, and exhibited his first painting there. Made his name with 'The Disposal of a Favourite Lamb' in 1813; elected ARA 1814, RA 1820. Achieved great popularity with his landscapes and, particularly, rustic genre scenes in the 1820s; Ruskin highly praised his works in the 1840s. Married in 1822 the sister of the portrait painter Margaret Carpenter. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, especially in Italy 1836-38; these visits are reflected in the subjects he painted. Exhibited 124 works at the RA between 1807 and 1846, and 45 at the BI 1808-43. Librarian at the RA 1840-2. Died London 17 February 1847. His studio sale was at Christie's 31 May-5 June 1847. His two sons were the novelist William Wilkie Collins and the painter Charles Allston Collins. There are watercolours and a sketchbook in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: \tWilliam Collins 'List of Pictures and Patrons', two MS volumes 1808-27 and 1827-46, National Art Library, V&A (referred to below as Lists); <i>Athenaeum</i> 20 February 1847, p200 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1847, p137 (obit); W Wilkie Collins <i>Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq</i>, RA 2 vols, 1848 (referred to below as <i>Memoirs</i>); <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, p 141 W.

Previously catalogued wrongly as a sketch for 'a large picture in the possession of the Marquis of Camden'; that picture was exhibited at the RA in 1822 (208) and depicted in the middle distance a celebration of the coming of age of the Marquis's son, Lord Brecknock. \n\nBayham Abbey is an impressive ruined 13th-century monastery and church in Sussex, much admired by seekers after the Picturesque in the 18th century. Collins was there from 1-3 May 1820 sketching at Lord Brecknock's birthday fete; he wrote to his mother from Rye on 14 August that 'Lord Camden will bring the sketch I made of the Abbey to town, as it was not sufficiently dry to be removed when I left him'. \n\nA tinted drawing of Bayham Abbey was lot 720 in the artist's posthumous sale at Christie's 5 June 1847, and another, in crayon, lot 182 on 1 June. \n\nLIT: <i>Lists</i>; <i>Memoirs</i> I, pp166-7, II pp69, 90-1\"",
