It has three tiers of drawers and doors, and is fitted with brass mounts. The top and bottom tier have three drawers each, the middle section with a central door and six drawers. All pietre dure panels depict the motif against a black onyx background and framed with a yellow marble line.\n\nDecorative Scheme\nThe top is set with two rectangular pietre dure panels depicting sprays of campanula in frames with rippled moulding.\n\nThe front comprises the fourteen drawer-fronts and central door, all of them set with pietre dure panels framed with rippled moulding in ebonised wood. The top and bottom row of drawers with a pietre dure panel depicting sprays of campanula at the centre, flanked by panels with a parrot and a panel with a finch at the side. The two panels at the sides are mounted to the same drawer front. The middle section is approximately twice the height of the top and bottom row, and the outer drawer-fronts are set with pietre dure panels of vases of flowers within an arch, the next two drawers flanking the central door with pietre dure panels depicting birds, possibly finches. The central door is fitted with a pietre dure panel depicting a courtyard with a fountain within an arch, and opens to reveal another pietre dure panel on the back of the drawer that depicts a bust-length picture of Saint Catherine of Alexandria with her attribute, the wheel, and a martyr\u2019s palm. Behind the central door are two further vertically arranged drawers, and their drawer-fronts are also fitted with pietre dure panels depicting sprays of flowers.\nTwo pietre dure panels on the bottom row of drawers deserve particular attention: They depict birds perching on branches with cherries. The cherries are made of transparent hardstone with red pigment underneath. \n\nThe sides are each fitted with a large pietre dure and slate panel framed with rippled moulding. The panel is vertically divided in three sections each marked by a yellow marble rectangle around the motif. The central rectangle holds the depiction of a bird perching on a flower, the top and bottom with military trophies.",

            "public_access_description": "This cabinet is probably of Northern European origin, and set with Florentine hardstone mosaics made in the so-called Commesso di pietre dure technique. It is one of two pictorial techniques in stone, the other being intarsia. A pietre dure mosaic is created by cutting slices of semiprecious stones that are cut to shape and assembled face down. In a second step the mosaic is consolidated with resin that is poured over the back and finally backed with a slate tablet.\n\nHardstone Mosaics (Commesso di pietre dure)\n\nThe history of this technique goes back to the sixteenth century. In 1588 Ferdinand de' Medici established the Grand Ducal workshop in Florence, which supported and patronised the specialised art of hardstone mosaics. Many craftsmen were trained in Florence before setting up studios around Italy. Pietre dure mosaics were produced in Florence, Milan and Rome; other European cities, such as Prague also became centre of production later on.\n\nSoon craftsmen were attempting to create the perfect 'stone paintings' through the clever exploitation of the natural variations in pigment of the stones. By the seventeenth century when the plaques for this cabinet were made, the technique was highly refined and allowed the creation of figural pictures. They sometimes included transparent stones, such as those used for the cherries on the two outer pictures one the base row of panels.\n\nA video showing the creation of a hardstone mosaic panel is available on the web site of the Victoria and Albert Museum on: http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/videos/m/video-making-a-pietre-dure-panel/\n\nThe subject-matters of the panels of this cabinet - birds, flowers and even the fountain in a courtyard - are typical for Florentine work of the period, as is the black background. It is likely that the panels were purchased by a traveller and taken home to be set in a cabinet made by a local craftsman. Florentine pietre dure panels were sought-after and luxurious Grand Tour souvenirs and can be found on pieces of furniture from all over Europe.\n\nThe Gilbert Collection on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

            "history_note": "Provenance: Sale, Sotheby's, London, lot 105, 25/07/1969.\n[cabinet] <b>Design</b>\n\nRectangular cabinet decorated on the front, sides and top with ebony veneers and coloured pietre-dure panels on a black stone ground with yellow border, depicting birds (finches and parrots), fruit, flowers, flowers in vases, a large fountain on a balustraded terrace (central door) and trophies (sides), with ebony ripple mouldings and metal mounts. The central cupboard door presents on its inside a pietre-dure panel depicting a half-length female figure facing left, holding a palm. The cabinet front presents 16 pietre-dure  panels as the fronts of 11 drawers, each with a cast metal shell handle along the bottom edge, surrounding a central cupboard door which opens on 2 pietre-dure fronted drawers with turned ebony knob handles in a unit which can be slid forward to reveal four, plain wood, secret drawers. Each side of the cabinet presents a single, large, vertical tripartite pietre-durel panel depicting two trophies flanking a bird on a flower stem, framed with ripple moulding. The top presents two, large pietre-dure panels depicting sprays of campanula (bellflower), each framed with ripple moulding. \n\nThe birds in the lower corners resemble bramblings (Fringilla monifringilla), or Northern European finches; the parrots on the bottom row  have ring necks like the rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri).\n\nAll the corners of the cabinet are fitted with 3-faced, scroll-edged mounts of brassy metal, fixed with metal pins. Similar two-faced mounts are fitted at regular intervals along the front and back arrises (those on the back reduced where they would not normally be visible.)\n\nThe pietre-dure panels contain various types of breccia and coloured marbles with an inlay of lapis lazuli, jasper, Sienese onyx, verde d\u2019Arno and Albarese limestone.\n\n<b>Construction\n</b>\nThe carcase of poplar (and some softwood) boards presumed to be dovetailed, with the dustboards and drawer dividers secured into the sides, top and bottom boards using tenons or grooves. The back is a single wide poplar(?) board, grained side to side, which has been painted black, and nailed within rebates formed by the veneered sides top and bottom of the cabinet. Several splits have occurred due to cross-grain shrinkage. The front (and drawer fronts), top and sides are veneered with ebony (1.5 to 2.2mm thick), into which the pietre-dure panels are inset. \n\nThe drawers, made of fruitwood (possibly cherry or pear), are of dovetailed construction, with the bottoms glued up and the sides pegged to the thick drawer front inset with pietre-dure  panels (x5 pegs on each side, x8 on the tall drawers). Running slips have been glued underneath. Most of the drawers have the sides dovetailed to the back (ie not the standard method), except for the double-height drawers where the backs are dovetailed to the sides. The top edge of the drawer front are veneered, the sides and back apparently stained black. All the drawers are lined with deep red, pasted paper, presumed to be modern. Drawer stops (in various woods) have been glued within the carcase behind the drawers.\n\nThe central cupboard door hangs on two brassy metal hinges (apparently moved and the carcase modified with oak on the hinge side), each held with a very short hand-made screw surrounded by 4 small modern screws. The door opens to reveal two drawers with pietre-dure  panels, within a dovetailed unit in fruitwood. Running around all four sides of the unit at the front is a strip of oiled(?) fruitwood, possibly added when the hinging was altered. This unit was intended to be easily slid out (though the position of the hinges now prevents easy removal), revealing four secret drawers behind. These four drawers are of dovetailed construction in fruitwood, with the bottoms glued up, and each with a single turned ebony(?) knob. They sit on plain dustboards which rest at both ends in grooves cut in fruitwood uprights. There is no obvious evidence that locks were ever fitted to drawers or cupboard door.",
