His earliest works earned him the description of realist, but from about 1830 he concentrated more on Romantic alpine scenery and rapacious wild animals. A member of the Vienna Academy from 1836, his great popularity with both the Austrian aristocracy and foreign patrons is attested by the high prices listed in his account book. His later work tended to be duller and repetitive. \nLit. R.

            "history_note": "According to Gauermann's account book, this picture was painted in February 1834 and paid for by F. W. Fink of the Albertina, who was the intermediary between Sheepshanks and the artist.  \n\nIn 1851 this painting and F.A. 78 were both hanging in the dining room of Sheepshanks' London house, where they were seen by G.F. Waagen.\n\nGiven to the South Kensington Museum by John Sheepshanks, 1857.\n\nHistorical significance: Feuchtm\u00fcller lists two preparatory drawings: (1) pencil and wash, 32.6 x 27 cm., inscribed <i>ausgef\u00fchrt f\u00fcr Fink kam nach London I834 an Schipings</i> [Sheepshanks], Kupferstichkabinett, Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste, Vienna, no. 7039: (2) pencil, 17 x 15.7 cm., Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden. \n\nOn 6 December 1834, Sheepshanks mentioned the present work in a letter to F.W. Fink: 'Mr. Edwin Landseer has already seen the picture and appeared much pleased, he was also greatly surprised at the existence of such high talent, without its beeing better known here - he advises me to allow the picture to be seen at the next annual exhibition of the British Artists, at the Royal Academy, of which Mr. Landseer is a member, and he promises to use his own personal influence, to secure a favourable place, and where it will attract notice - This step, I propose taking, provided it meets with approbation of Mr. Gauermann and yourself. The Gallery is open to the public at the beginning of May and is visited by the Royal Family and generaly by the people of rank and taste - I mention this, that you may not suppose the painters reputation will be injured.' (Original in the Akademie der bildenden Kuenste, Vienna; cited by Feuchtm\u00fcller 1962, p.152)\n\nThis composition was etched by E. Webb and B. P. Gibbon and published by F.G. Moon, 20 Threadneedle St., Ackermann & Co., Strand, and Wyatt and Son, Oxford on 13 March 1837, with the title 'Wolves Attacking Deer (A Scene in the Tyrol)'. Impressions of all four states of this print were given by Sheepshanks to the South Kensington Museum  (Inv. 18614, 18615, 18619, 18620).\n\nWhen the present work and FA.78 were seen by Waagen in 1851 he observed: 'Both these pictures fully display the animated conception and happy study of nature which distinguish this painter in his representation of savage animals. The execution is also careful, though the tone of colouring is somewhat heavy. These are the only pictures in the collection not by native artists'.\n\nGauermann was the only foreign artist represented in Sheepshanks' gift to the Museum (by this work and FA. 78) and when the Prince Consort visited the newly opened paintings gallery in 19 June 1857 he singled out these two pictures: 'In looking through the South Gallery, he noticed two pictures by Gauermann. He seemed to know him and his works. 'He was' said the Prince, 'Court painter of animals and he also painted the late Emperor of Austria and all his family ...' (F. M. Redgrave, <i>Richard Redgrave, A memoir,</i> 1891, p. 174.) There is no supporting evidence for the statement that he painted the Austrian Emperor; perhaps this was a royal joke.\n\nA glass engraved with this composition is in the Niederoesterreichisches Jagdmuseum, Schloss Marchegg, Inv. Nr. 1074  (See exhibition catalogue <u>Jagd Einst und Jetzt</u>, Niederoesterreichische Landesausstellung, Schloss Marchegg 1978, cat. no. 538 & ill.).",
