He also produced costumes for fancy dress and period balls, which were a feature of social life in the 1920s and 1930s.  This wreath may have been produced for such a ball, maybe the famous Chelsea Arts Ball, a famous, somewhat bohemian, annual event at which the guests vied with each other to wear the most extravagant or outrageous costumes.  A vine-leaf wreath, with its overtones of Roman banquets, would have been very much in keeping with the event. The leaves are made of leather, a material that Messel used a great deal, as it is light and can be moulded into complex shapes, which can then be painted to resemble metals or, as here, vegetation.  \n\nGreat Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

It is as likely to have been made for a costume party.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs were sold or given away during the artist's lifetime).  The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981.  The Oliver Messel Collection was purchased from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.",
