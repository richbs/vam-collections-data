Deeply influenced by the stage, his unique style was also inspired by erotica, fetishism and the urban scene. All his garments, whether classical or theatrical, display the same rigour in cut and line. Mugler launched his line for men in 1979, designing clothes simple in form and structure but with striking details, often using pointed angles on collars, hems, sleeves, waist and hips. \n\nThis suit belonged to Mugler's Fall/Winter 1984 Men's Ready-to-wear collection. This signature Mugler was influenced by, and mirrored, his women's couture and ready-to-wear collections. Colour, silhouette, lapel and pocket shapes, as well as button details were part of this link. \n\nIn 2004, Mugler stopped designing both couture and ready-to-wear.",
