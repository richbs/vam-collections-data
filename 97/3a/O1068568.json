The engraving is based on sketches made by the artist and diplomat Dominique Vivant, Baron de Denon (1747-1825) who travelled with Napoleon\u2019s army in Egypt in 1798. While Napoleon campaigned in Lower Egypt, Denon accompanied General Louis Desaix (1768-1800) through Upper Egypt in a campaign against the Mamluk leader Murad Bey. \n\nWhen General-in-chief Napolean Bonaparte (1769-1821) set off for a campaign in Egypt, he took more than 150 engineers, scientists, cartographers, surveyors, architects, linguists, forming a Commission des Sciences et Arts d\u2019\u00c9gypte, to record and study Egypt\u2019s topography, plant and animal life, minerals, and industry. Denon's sketches of Luxor, Karnac, Dendera, Thebes, Esna, Edfu, and Philae promted Napoleon to instruct two teams of people to complete the project. The result of their work was eventually published in the Description de l\u2018Egypte. Meanwhile Denon also used his illustrations in his earlier book Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte, published in 1802.\n\nDenon\u2019s artwork and the resulting publications sparked a renewal of interest in the Egyptian arts and Egyptian motifs featured in French architecture and the decorative arts.",
