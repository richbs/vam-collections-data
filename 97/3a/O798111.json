Crace collaborated on the decoration of Alton Towers for the Earl of Shrewsbury. This design was to be executed by J.G. Crace, perhaps for the chapel, for Lord Shrewsbury.\n\nThis work is discussed by Pugin in a letter to Crace dated 27 March 1844; 'I should recommend the canopies to be hatched with black lines on the gold as you may have seen in some old German works, but I would not have any positive shadow as the panel represents Richard II. The arms should all be the same. I will send up the 2 images in the niches tomorrow with the colour marked'.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
