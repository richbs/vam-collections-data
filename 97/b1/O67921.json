People used candles and candlesticks all over the house and moved them from place to place as required. The small size of this candlestick suggests that it was probably intended for the drawing room or library rather than the dining room. It is made of Sheffield plate, which looks like solid silver but costs less than half as much. Thomas Boulsover developed this fusion of copper and silver in 1742. \n\nThis candlestick consists of die-stamped sections soldered together. Metalworkers used the die-stamping technique to make raised decoration on thin sheets of metal, such as Sheffield plate or silver. They trimmed the stamped sheets, soldered them together and filled them with resin. They 'loaded' or weighted the bases to make them stable. They could assemble the decorated sheets in a variety of combinations. This provided a vast supply of models that differed from each other in only one or two details. \n\nThis candlestick has ornate decoration in the Rococo style.  This was one of the earliest and most important of the historical styles revived in the 19th century. Many crticis deplored the Rococo Revival style for being excessive and lacking in taste. However, by the Great Exhibition of 1851 it was the style most commercial manufacturers favoured.",
