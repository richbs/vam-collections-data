The shop and manufacturer Heal and Son Ltd (Heal's) had, in pre-war years, tended towards the more minimalist forms of International Modernism and chose to stay with the simple, reserved forms as seen here in the rectilinear look of these wall cabinets. Here there was however, no constraint in the use of expensive materials and these units were intended to be madein bubinga veneer and mahogany solids with birch interiors. They are also particularly interesting pieces of living-room furniture, as they have housing for the latest in-home entertainment, including a television, record player and radio with the speakers in the bottom cupboard , bookcases (each with sliding glass doors), a bureau unit and a cocktail cabinet.",
