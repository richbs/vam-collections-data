The lack of movement in the stiff drapery implies that the figure cannot have been made in Spain any later than about 1630.\nPainted wood figures and reliefs of sacred subjects was the most common type of sculpture in Spain from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century. Many were made for large-scale altarpieces, although some smaller figures, like the present piece, were also in demand for devotional purposes.",

The sweet facial features however imply it is slightly later than the mid-sixteenth century, while the colmunar folds of the drapery suggest it cannot be later than the first third of the seventeenth century. It is of painted walnut, although the paint is probably nineteenth century.",
