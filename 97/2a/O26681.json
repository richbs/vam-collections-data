The player on the left hand of the dealer commences the play by asking any other player for a card of any Proverb of which he holds one or more in his hand; if he obtains it he may continue asking until he asks for a card which the player asked does not hold; the right of asking in then transferred to him and he in the same way continues to ask till in like manner disqualified.  When any player has obtained all the cards of a set forming the complete proverb, he turns them up on the table.  The player who first completes all the Proverbs of which he holds cards at the commencement of the game, of of which any cards remain to him as the game progresses, wins.\nN B:-  No player is allowed to ask for a card of any Proverb of which he does not hold one or more in his hand.\n\n\n*Learning the ideals of good behavior came to be regarded as important as the three R's.  The precepts were often found as proverbs on card, and again, the idea of the game is that a group has to be collected.  They are often quite humorous, although it is difficult to tell if this was deliberate or merely a late 20th century interpretation of the sayings and drawings.  Generally, the gambling element of the rewards and forfeits were removed from the rules of these moral games",
