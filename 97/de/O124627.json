His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMozart\u2019s comic opera The Abduction from the Seraglio was one of four Mozart operas performed  at Glyndebourne in 1956 to celebrate the bi-centenary of his birth.  Messel\u2019s exuberant designs are inspired by eighteenth century Western European art and design and its fascination for the Orient, in harmony with the spirit of Mozart\u2019s opera.\n\nThe proscenium arch was a piece of illusionistic scenery which acted as a frame for the set in traditional theatre.   Messel\u2019s design for the arch features decorative wreaths, lattice decoration and round arches, complementing the eighteenth century Orientalist designs of the set.  Messel also created numerous scaled drawings of the arch on  tracing paper, but he wrote on this design that the 'arch is better shown here'.",
