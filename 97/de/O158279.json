Rubini's act involved, primarily, the 'beheading' of a lady, as illustrated in this poster. As well as performing at the Egyptian Hall at Piccadilly Circus, he also toured his act around the country. \n\nThe Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London was originally commissioned by William Bullock as a museum to house his collection. Bullock used the hall to put on various spectaculars, from which he made money from ticket sales. Towards the end of the 19th century, the hall had become associated with magic and spiritualism as a number of performers and lecturers, such as Rubini, had hired it for shows. Coming under the control of the Maskelyne family in the 1870s, the hall became known as England's Home of Mystery. Many illusions were staged including the exposition of fraudulent spiritualistic manifestations then being practised by charlatans.",
