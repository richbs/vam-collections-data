They were made from thin paper which was first coated with a mixture of whisked egg white and salt, then sensitized with silver nitrate. This print was made from a glass negative.\n\n\n\nPeople\n\nCharles Clifford worked under the patronage of Queen Isabella II of Spain and the Spanish court for over ten years. He is best known for his photographs of Spanish architecture and landscapes.\n\n\n\nSubjects Depicted\n\nThe ornate style of the Alhambra was typical of the architecture built by the 'Moors', Muslims from North Africa who occupied most of the Iberian peninsula in the early 8th century, but were driven out of Granada, their last stronghold in Spain, in 1492.",
