It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nElaborate parasols such as this with intricate Chinese embroidery and dense ivory carving on the handle, were best displayed on carriage rides. Ingenious inventions such as the folding stick, enabling the parasol to be folded in half when not in use, and the 'marquise' hinge, used to angle the cover, were developed in line with this ritual, and both are seen in this example. There is no strap provided to hold the cover closed, instead the parasol is held by a carrying loop on the ferrule, with the cover facing up.",
