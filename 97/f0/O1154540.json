The wood has been polished to reveal its grain and indentations of children's teeth are visible on both figures.  The cord is knotted in the middle, and is fraying at both ends.",

It is typical of Vitali's toy designs, which are simple and stylised to encourage a child to use their imagination when playing with them. It has been designed first and foremost with the child in mind, made in a pleasing shape for a small hand to hold. It was produced and sold at a time when the importance of well-designed toys for a child's development was being increasingly appreciated. \n\nIt was sold by Paul and Marjorie Abbatt Ltd., who were known as pioneers and promoters of well-designed toys. It was bought from the Abbatt's toyshop in Wimpole Steet, London for his children by the donor's husband in the 1960's.",

It can be bitten to help the child when teething, and it can be held, waved about and rattled together to entertain a small child. It is a good example of artist-designed and artist-produced toys, and also of the type of toy sold by Paul and Marjorie Abbatt Ltd, which focussed on selling well-designed and well-made toys. All aspects of its design have been influenced through consideration of, first and foremost, the needs of a child.",
