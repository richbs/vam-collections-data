The feet are moulded to stand on a round base; at the bottom of which is a white celluloid ring. Inside the body from the foot end is placed the sharpener. \n2. pencil sharpener; conical shaped soft metal with steel blade. The bottom end; which is visible when in the doll; is painted dark green. The sharpener can be removed so the inside of the doll can be cleaned. \n*mark on back of doll - \n     T within a elongated circle above the word FOREIGN and PAT. 60204. *mark on the sharpener - \n     FOREIGN \n\n*These markings can indicate that the doll was made in Japan or in Germany. IT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE JAPANESE; as the word FOREIGN is generally not used by German companies which actually used GERMANY. Also the quality of the moulding is more of the Japanese type, HOWEVER, the celluloid is heavier than was normally produced in Japan but this may have been used because of the purpose of the doll itself. The thin celluloid would not withstand the placement of the  sharpener nor its eventual use.",
