Various features make this the master's finest medal and indicate that it is his last.. This is the most classical in mood due to the sitter's stoic expression. With this medal Antico reached a true maturity.\nAntico was an Italian sculptor and goldsmith. He was nick-named Antico, because in his work he related heavily to Antiquity. He re-created small scale statuettes of famous antique examples. He was active at the Gonzaga court at Mantua and made many bronzes for the court, notably for Ludovico, Bishop of Mantua and Isabella d\u2019Este, wife of Francesco II  Gonzaga, 4th Marchese of Mantua. He was also a restorer of antique statues and an adviser to art collectors.",
