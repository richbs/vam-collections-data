It shows Tuner's wife, with her back turned, looking towards her sisters Mary and Helen and her son Benjamin Brecknell Turner Jnr. The title 'Our Village' no doubt invokes the Victorian classic text of the same name, with its delighted close observations of country life, published by Mary Russell Mitford in five volumes (1824-32). Perhaps Turner intended the photograph as a tribute to Mitford who had died the year before it was made. 'Our Village' opens with a sentiment we find echoed in Turner's photographs of Bredicot: \n\n'Of all situations for a constant residence, that which appears to me most delightful is a little village far in the country; a small neighbourhood, not of fine mansions finely peopled, but of cottages \u2026 with inhabitants whose faces are as familiar to us as the flowers in our garden.'\n\nThe figures could not have held their poses long enough for the long exposures required on the large paper negatives such as Turner usually used. So here he used the wet collodion on glass negative process that yielded a faster exposure and more detail. The subtitle 'Effect Without Sunshine' may refer then to the photograph having been made on a cloudy day by utilising glass plates. Turner exhibited a print of 'Our Village, Effect Without Sunshine' at the Norwich Photographic Society in 1856. The V&A print was badly damaged by fading, foxing, water staining and losses to the surface emulsion.at some time before entering the collection.",
