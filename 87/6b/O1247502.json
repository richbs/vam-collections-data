The range of clothing shows both the developments in fine quality brands, designs and fashions bought for her and available to many girls in the post war period and, through the increasing size and sophistication of the garments, charts Caroline own developments from a toddler through towards her teenage years. \nThis dress was worn by the donor Caroline to the 1966 Christmas dance at her school when she was 12. It is one of 4 similar shift dresses in this gift. These dresses show a shift in the changing shapes and available printed fabric typically used (whether homemade or off the peg) for a pre-teen and teen fashion during the 1960s.",
