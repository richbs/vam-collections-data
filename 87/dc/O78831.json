Tapestries commissioned by a  particular person or family  constituted only a small part of the total tapestry production. They were at the very top end of the luxury market and made a direct display of the owner's wealth and status. This example, showing the arms of the Dudley family at the centre,  was probably made for Leicester House, the London home of Elizabeth I's favourite Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (about 1532-1588).  \n\nMakers\nThe sophisticated design makes it difficult to confirm that this tapestry was made in the Sheldon workshop in Barcheston, Warwickshire, although this was once thought to be the case. The tapestry shows much greater expertise both in design and execution than most of their products,  for example  the Judgement of Paris tapestry (T.310-1920) produced possibly a decade later and considered to be from that workshop.\n\nMuch of the design was based on prints to be found in a well-known architectural manual, while the birds and flowers are woven in styles commonly seen in the southern Netherlands. Even if this tapestry was made in the Sheldon workshop, it seems very likely that tapestry designers and weavers from the Northern Netherlands must have been very closely involved in its production, because their skills were highly developed and the tapestry was commissioned by such an illustrious client.",
