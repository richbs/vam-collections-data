This print forms part of a portfolio of caricatures, Stage Folk: A Book of Caricatures by Frueh, published by Lieber &amp; Lewis in 1922.  It had been previous published in The World on 27th January 1918, and later exhibited at the Theatre Museum in Theatre Caricatures by Al Frueh: West End Meets Broadway, in 1990.\n\nThis print shows William Courtenay (1875-1933) and Thomas Wise (1865-1928) in the comedy The General Post by J.E. Harold Terry (1885-1939).  Courtenay was an American matinee idol admired for his good looks, and Wise an English-born actor and dramatist, who moved to the U.S. early in his career.  The General Post played at the Gaiety Theatre in New York, and the Haymarket in London in 1917.  It was described by the New York Times as \"a comedy in three acts in which is shown how the English caste system is being undermined by the new war conditions\".",
