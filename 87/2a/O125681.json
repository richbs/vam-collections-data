The Stranger was the main protagonist, who claimed he was Dom Sebastian, King of Portugal.  Critics complained about the four hour length of the play, cut by half an hour after the first week, and about the fact that it was based on an obscure piece of Portuguese history. They praised the spectacular costumes designed by Leslie Hurry and the cast including Pauline Jamieson, Michael MacLiammoir and Robert Speaight, who 'spoke the sonorous lines most nobly'.  Nevertheless the play did not receive a London transfer.\n\nRobert Eddison was well known by 1957 as a leading actor on the West End stage. Although Shakespearean roles were his favourite, including Hamlet and Polonius, he played a wide range of characters throughout his long career and was famous for his resonant voice.",
