Only later, around 1800, was she identified as a \u2018negress lying down\u2019. Rembrandt would have seen black Africans in Amsterdam; he made figure sketches of some individuals and on occasion included black subjects in his paintings, particularly those of historical or religious scenes. However, it is almost certain that the identification of the subject in this work as a black African woman is an incorrect interpretation of the artist\u2019s intention to portray a (white) female nude in a dark interior.",
