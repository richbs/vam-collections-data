            "physical_description": "Arched panel set within an arched and moulded frame with carved upper spandrels, showing two figures standing on uneven ground - a taller man brandishing a stick in the act of grasping a shorter youth, from whose outer garment two plates are falling. Above both figures floats a blank banderole or ribbon-like banner. Although the panel appears to be a door there is no obvious evidence of hingeing on the reverse of the panel.\n\nThe framework consists of 4 elements joined with double-tongued mortice and tenon joints, double-pegged (diameter10mm), with a coped mitre at the top corners. The panel is formed of eight (glued) vertical planks, and it appears that the planks are extended into two tenons (about 7cm high) top and bottom. The arched panel with high-relief carving (all apparently integral, not built up) sits within grooves worked in these stiles and rails. Holes have been cut into both stiles at mid-height and there are remains of iron nails in or close to these areas. A series of holes in the bottom rail may have been used to peg the panel into the frame. The right stile has clinched nails at top and bottom. No evidence for a painted finish has been found.\n\nVarious scarfed-in repairs: bottom left corner of frame; bottom left corner of panel at moulded edge; left middle edge (possibly cut away for a lock); large area between the legs of the man and the youth; small area near right toe of the man. The inner edge double-cavetto moulding at the right side (all of it) and a lower section and a mid section on the left side are replacements. Replacement areas of carving: the knobbed stick (except for the small area behind the man's hand), the sword blade visible between legs.",

The original location of the panel is not known, but weathering towards the bottom of the panel suggests that it was fixed on the outside of a building, perhaps blocking a doorway at a great house or religious building. It may have served as an admonishment to visitors, and an inscription to this effect may once have been painted on the banderole or ribbon banner above. The renaissance ornament around the arch and the dress worn by the figures help in dating the panel to the first half of the sixteenth century.",
