Medieval manuscripts often show chairs with this kind of frame and they have continued to be made since that time. Such chairs were often formal, even throne-like, and this example is certainly made more for show than use. The way that the back panel attaches to the seat is weak and would not stand up to regular wear, though markings under the seat make it clear that this was one of a set of at least eight chairs. Carl Svensson, who put his mark under the seat, described himself as \u2018Upholsterer to the Royal court\u2019. The chair may have been designed and made in his workshops or he may have bought it in for supply to a client. Such a practice was well established by the 19th century. The engraved pewter inlay is an unusual and elegant decorative detail.",
