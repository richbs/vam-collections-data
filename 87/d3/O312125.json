Her head, crowned, is held erect and turned slightly to the left; her left arm rests on the arm of her throne, the right arm is bent, the hand clasping her sceptre, the end of which rests on her knee. She is shown in coronation robes, the full cloak falling in heavy folds over the two steps of the dais, is open to show the simple full length robe bound at the waist by a cord. Her feet rest on a cushion. \nThis is the original study by H.R.H Princess Louise for the figure of Queen Victoria now standing in the grounds of Kensington Palace. The statue as erected by the Borough of Kensington in 1893 in the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Queen's reign.\nPrincess Louise was Queen Victoria's sixth child. In 1871 she married the Marquis of Lorne, heir to the 8th Duke of Argyll. Her interest in sculpture was influenced by two female sculptors, Susan Durant and Mary Thornycroft. Durant was teaching the Princess following her commissions to produce portraits of the royal children. In 1867 Thornycroft was appointed to teach the Princess. Later she trained under Edgar Boehm.",
