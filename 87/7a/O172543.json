Between 1850 and 1857 Stevens was involved in the design and modelling of grates and fenders for Messrs Hoole and Co at their Green Lane Works in Sheffield. Armstrong recorded that 'Messrs Hoole and Robson were manufacturers of stoves, fenders, and other iron work of a similar class, and they had either the good fortune or the sound judgement to retain his [Steven's] services at a fixed yearly salary, with the consequence that soon after the opening of the Great Exhibition in 1851 they found themselves famous as makers of some fire-places of such exquisite design that they stood pre-eminent above all other works of their kind' [Armstrong 1881, p. 11].\n\nA sculptor, designer and painter, Alfred Stevens rejected contemporary distinctions between fine art and design. From 1850 to 1857 he was chief designer to Hoole & Co., Sheffield, where he produced award-winning designs for metalwork, majolica, terracotta ornaments and chimney-pieces.\n\nPerhaps his two greatest works were the decorations for the dining-room at Dorchester House, London (about 1856), for which he made countless drawings inspired by the Italian High Renaissance style, in particular the work of Michelangelo and the monument to the Duke of Wellington for St Paul's Cathedral, London, which was completed after his death. The two allegorical groups from this monument made a lasting impact on the New Sculpture movement.",
