It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nTommy Steele became one of  Britain\u2019s first great rock 'n' roll idols at the age of 19 with hits including \u2018Singing the Blues\u2019 (1956) and \u2018Little White Bull \u2018(1959), and later made his name as an actor, especially in musicals and pantomime.",
