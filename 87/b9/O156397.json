Other hardstones have been selected for patterns that imitate the colours of vegetation. Landscape scenes became increasingly popular in the late 17th century. These were highly valued in the 19th century, when these examples were mounted in this mahogany casket.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
