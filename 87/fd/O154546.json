From the outer edge working in, these are:\n[a]  a white ground patterned with 4-pointed stars in blue edged with red separated  by a floral motif in green either side of which is an elongated boteh with a black centre, and edged in red and green or in red and blue.  All have yellow details.\n[b] a  narrow red ground border with a condensed yellow meander with a green leaf and black and white flower.\n[c] a black ground with an angular red and white meander entrapping a cluster of three predominantly blue flowers and leaves.\n[d] same as [b]\n[e] same as [a] but on a yellow ground and with slight colour variations.\n[f] same as [b]\n[g] same as [c]\n[h] same as [b]\n[I] same as [a]\nThe sequence continues from [a] to form a central series of squares, terminating in pattern [a].\nColours: red, blue, yellow, green, black.\nThe backing is a low quality printed cotton made from two pieces patterned with a series of stripes bearing floral motifs.  It gives the appearance of being over-washed but the predominant colours are blue and beige.",
