It probably came there from the Sainte-Chapelle in Dijon, which was demolished in 1802. (The drawing is in the Biblioth\u00e8que Municipale de la Ville de Dijon.) In the drawing, the standing figure of St Peter presents the kneeling donor in front of him. You can still see part of St Peter\u2019s jewelled sleeve and key in the glass. The drawing also shows the small figure of the donor\u2019s son kneeling behind him, with a shield above that bears the initials \u2018PM\u2019. In a facing panel, the donor\u2019s wife is shown kneeling in prayer with her daughter behind her. Her patron saint, whom we cannot now identify, stands above. \n\nThe donor has been identified as Pierre Michel. He was valet to two dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Good (ruled 1419\u201367) and Charles the Bold (ruled 1467\u201377). He was also conci\u00e8rge of the ducal house at Dijon and capitaine-ch\u00e2telain of the ch\u00e2teau at Vergy. On both sleeves of his fur-lined coat he wears the device of Philip the Good, the Flint and Steel (briquet) with flames. This denotes that he is a member of the ducal household.\n\nThe present panel has been cut down. It is tightly framed by a decorative border of leafy plants entwined with scrolls. These bear the words \u2018ihs\u2019 (Jesus), \u2018mra\u2019 (Mary) and the motto \u2018En bien\u2019 (\u2018In Goodness\u2019). The border was made at the same time as the panel, but it comes from another window at Notre-Dame.",

ISBN 1851774041\nThanks to a drawing of 1837-8 in the bibliotheque Municipale de la Ville de Dijon, is known that this panel then formed part of a window in the church of Notre-Dame in Dijon. In all probability it came there from the Sainte-Chapelle in Dijon in 1802, when the latter was demolished. In the drawing, the kneeling donor is shown being presented by the standing figure of St Peter behind him (part of the jewelled sleeve and key are still visible in the glass); the small figure of his son kneels behind the donor, and above is a shield with the initials 'PM'. In a facing panel, the donor's wife is shown kneeling in prayer with the couple's daughter behind her and with her patron saint (not now identifiable) standing above her. The donor has been identified by Marie-France Briselance as Pierre Michel, <font -i>\u00e9picier-valet de chambre</font -i> of both Duke Philip the Good (1419-67) and Charles the Bold (1467-77), concierge of the ducal house at Dijon and <font -i>capitaine-ch\u00e2telain</font -i> of the chateau at Vergy. He wears the device of Philip the Good, the Flint and Steel (<font -i>Briquet</font -i>) with flames, on both sleeves of his fur-lined coat, denoting that he is a member of the ducal household. The device was subsequently employed on the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece (see nos 58, 60, 63), founded by Philip the Good in 1429, but Pierre Michel was not sufficiently well-born to be a chevalier. The present panel has been cut down and tightly framed by a decorative border of leafy plants entwined with scrolls bearing the words <font -i>ihs</font -i> (Jesus), <font -i>mra</font -i> (Mary) and the motto <font -i>'En bien'</font -i> ('In Goodness'), which is contemporary but comes from another window at Notre-Dame. There are various stopgaps, including part of another steel to the right of the donor's knees. Philip the Good employed the glass-painter Thierry Esperlan of Delft to execute the glazing of the Sainte-Chapelle between 1429 and 1450.",
