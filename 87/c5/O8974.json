            "physical_description": "[Push chair] Folding three-wheeled push chair frame and chassis of tubular steel painted black.  The handle and seat frame are moulded in one piece (with a tubular cover of black plastic foam on the handle for secure handling) which clips into 2 V-shaped sockets joining it to the chassis between the foot rest and the front wheel.  The chassis has a plate of black metal joining the front forks of the handle/ seat frame, and another between the back wheels which carries the foot-operated brake.  A pair of uprights of black-painted tubular steel join this back plate to the handle/ seat frame.  The three wheels have black pneumatic tyres, and black pastic spokes which radiate in pentagonal shapes.\n[Push chair seat] Removable push chair seat of washable red nylon cordura fabric.  The seat is chute-shaped with linear edges, and contains an adjustable safety harness of black nylon webbing with black plastic fittings; it fastens to the frame with velcro and heavy duty chromium-plated press studs.\n[Push chair basket] Removable 'basket' of washable red nylon cordura fabric.  The basket has a stiffened rhomboid-shaped base, with a high back of self fabric, and sloping sides of black nylon mesh, and fastens beneath the seat of the pushchair with black velcro and heavy duty  chromium-plated press studs.\n[Card] Laminated white plastic 'card' to stiffen basket (3), cut in the shape of a rhomboid, with rounded corners.  The card fits between the lining and base of the basket.\n[Leash] Safety leash for extra security of grip by the person controlling the push chair.  The leash is made of a length of black nylon webbing with a loop at each end: the leash is wrapped once about the handle and the end with the larger loop is passed through the smaller loop, with the larger loop then fitting over the wrist.\n[cover (overlying object)] Removable protective cover for use on the push chair in wet or cold weather.  The cover is made of three panels of clear heavy duty plastic sheeting seamed together, bound with grey soft plastic edging, and  mounted on the four arched ribs of a two-hinged  frame of grey plastic. The frame opens out into an ovoid shape, with a back flap which passes behind the occupant's head at the top, and a reinforced foot.  The cover fastens to the frame with a length of grey elastic around the back of the handles, two grey plastic clips at the side, and two grey plastic hooks on elastic at the foot.",

This innovation is really a return to an earlier design: some of the first children's carriages known to have existed in Western Europe were three-wheelers, developed from the basic design of invalid carriages, and later giving rise to one of the most characteristic of the nineteenth century designs, the 'Victoria'.  \nAll these earlier examples were for use by children who could sit unaided: younger ones who needed to lie flat were not catered for until the introduction of the cradle-like bassinet prams in the 1880s.",
