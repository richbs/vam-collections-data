            "public_access_description": "Franco Zeffirelli was born in Florence on 12 February 1923. An Italian stage and film director and designer, he is known primarily today for his adaptations of the works of Shakespeare. He began his career with the Morelli Stoppa Company in 1946-7, performing in both Florence and Rome. During these formative years he met and worked as both a designer and actor for such giants of the Italian cultural scene as Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni and Vittorio de Sica. \n\nIn the 1950s he began to work as a director, starting in theatre and later expanding to film. His work showed influences of early mentor Visconti and great artists of Italy\u2019s past, from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century. His Romeo and Juliet, both stage and film versions, and The Taming of the Shrew shows a great focus on the appearance and aesthetics of the piece and awareness of the \u201cvisual envelope that surrounds the actor\u201d. His works were to become an epitome of escapism and recreation of the past, and have been described as \u201csynonymous with richness and romantic opulence\u201d.\n\n'Caesar\u2019s Victorious Army' is a design for a stage set for Act 2, Scene 5 of the first production of Samuel Barber\u2019s opera Antony and Cleopatra. Zeffirelli acted as stage director, designer and librettist of this adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s play which officially opened the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, New York, on 16 September 1966. It was an ostentatious affair, typical of Zeffirelli's style. Barbara B. Heyman, Barber\u2019s biographer, comments on the \u201csocial glitter of the occasion\u201d. She claims that the massive production values and emphasis on spectacle detracted from the music, referring to the opera as an \u201cinflated production with its complicated and problematic paraphernalia, gaudy costumes and overcrowded stage forces.\u201d The lavish nature of the production is indicated by the staging of a certain scene in which 165 people, three horses, two camels and an elephant all appear on stage at the same time. The generous use of gold paint along with the large number of figures in the design reveals Zeffirelli\u2019s opulent vision whilst illustrating the sheer scale of the production. \n\nReferences: \n\nDouglas A.
