These were small shaped pieces of confectionery consisting chiefly of sugar or chocolate with flavouring or filling.  This example is in the form of three clam shells conjoined on dolphin feet, with central handle in the shape of a bunch of grapes. \n\nThe scallop or clam shell had been a popular form in silver since the 16th century. Since the reign of George I and throughout the remainder of the 18th century, the shell form dish used for serving a variety of different types of food was a particularly popular item of tableware.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
