Italian marriage chests of this type  were frequently decorated with religious and mythological stories and the present chest shows the Meeting of King Salomon and the Queen of Sheba, a popular subject at this time because it exemplifies such sought after virtues as wisdom and determination. \nAlthough certainly executed in Florence in the mid-15th century, and close to Apollonio di Giovanni's (1416 - 1465) style, the present panel was dubiously executed in his workshop. This chest seems to have survived quite substantially in its original conditions.",

On the stays you see naked Amoretti (putti) with wings, also seated on the Trunks which the horses carry. Surrounded by six noble women, the richest Queen of the Orient is getting closer to the wisest ruler, (in front of the Templum Salomonis, there is an altar decorated with a golden) they shake hands. Surrounded by little naked boys holding a festoon above the roof of the temple. The Jews behind Salomon with urban and priests hat, are astonished by the ceremony. On the right there is the palace of Salomo,\nwhere you can see girls looking out of the window.\nOn the upper left side of the picture, there is a little extra scene: where you see the Queen not wanting to cross the bridge because she already knows that this is made of the wood that will be later used for the cross of Jesus/redeemer.- on the side fields you see puttis playing all sorts of instruments.\nC.M. Kauffmann, <u>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings. Before 1800,</u> London, 1973, pp. 106-107, cat. no. 121\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nFlorentine School, third quarter 15th century \n\n121 \nCASSONE, PAINTED WITH: front: \nSOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA; \nside: TWO PAIRS OF PUTTI PLAYING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS; \ninside lid: THREE BUNCHES OF FLOWERS \nTempera on walnut \nH. 38 1/2 (97.8); L. 84 (213.3); W. 31 (78.8) \n7852-1862 (F. & W.)\n\nThe Queen of Sheba is seen arriving on the left, the meeting with Solomon occupies the centre and right hand side of the panel. On each end there are two putti playing musical instruments. \nSchiaparelli attributed this cassone, originally ascribed to Dello Delli, to the follower of Pesellino responsible for the Continence of Scipio panel (5804-1859; no. 9. Workshop of Apollonio di Giovanni) and various other related works. Schubring, however, placed these two in different categories, calling the Scipio panel 'Master of the Tournament of S. Croce' and this one 'Cassone Master', in common with various other Florentine cassoni depicting Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (Schubring, nos. 194-97). Subsequent authorities criticized Schubring's multiplicity of categories, and in his list of 1932 Berenson attributed this cassone as well as the Scipio panel to the studio of the Master of the Jarves Cassoni, subsequently identified as Apollonio di Giovanni. However, although this cassone follows a composition current in the Apollonio workshop it does not exhibit the characteristic features of Apollonio's style. It differs in the modelling of the faces, the gold tooling and the treatment of the architecture and it has therefore, not been accepted by Ellen Callmann in her oeuvre Catalogue of Apollonio's workshop (oral opinion, 1971).\nThe theme of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, the meeting of the wisest man from Asia and the wealthiest woman from the south, was by far the most popular of the relatively few biblical subjects depicted on Renaissance marriage chests. Similar compositions from the same workshop are to be found on the cassoni formerly with Boehler, Munich; in the Jarves Collection, Yale University; belonging to Lord Crawford (Schubring, nos. 194-97, pls, xl, xlii); Museum of Fine Art, Boston and Ellen Callmann collection, New York. The central part of the composition is ultimately derived from Ghiberti's panel on the 'Gates of Paradise' of the Florentine Baptistery (R. Krautheimer, <i>Lorenzo Ghiberti,</i> 1956, pl. 117). It survives in Florentine engravings (A. M. Hind, <i>Catalogue of early Italian engravings ... in the British Museum,</i> 1910, p. 124 f., no. B.III.4; repr. B.III.9) as well as on cassoni. \n\nCondition. Paint surface considerably damaged; cleaned and restored by S. Isepp in 1950. \nProv. Bought in 1862 for \u00a380 (when known as the 'Dini Cassone'). \nLit. J. H.

            "history_note": "Purchased in 1862 for \u00a380\n\nHistorical significance: The front panel of this Florentine <i>cassone</i> (wedding chest) represents the Meeting of King Salomon and the Queen of Sheba who, intrigued by King Salomon's wisdom and wealth, undertook a long journey from Sheba (traditionally situated in modern Ethiopia) until Jerusalem to test him. Two winged putti playing musical instruments are represented on each side. The attribution of this painting has long debated: it was originally attributed to Dello Delli and successively to a follower of Pesellino (Schiaparelli, 1908), to the Cassone Master (Schubring, 1915), to the Master of the Jarves Cassoni (Berenson, 1932) and to Apollonio di Giovanni (Berenson, 1963). \nThe panel is divided into narrative sequels from left to right: after crossing a mountainous landscape, the chariot of the Queen of Sheba with her suit arrives in Jerusalem, King Salomon and Queen of Sheba meet before a tripartite temple with an altar, King Salomon cortege is on the far right.  \nAccording to E. Callmann (1974), 7852-1862 reproduced a compositional idea that belongs to a small group of similar cassone panels among which some were made in the workshop of Apollonio di Giovanni, the leading workshop in Florence in the mid 15th century. Unlike Apollonio's works, E. Callmann retained that the present painting is flatter and is lacking of Apollonio's typical lively movement in space. Compare with the other compositions, the figures are smaller and appear more proportionally adapted to the architectural setting. It seems however reasonable to think that this panel was painted by a contemporary imitator. \nThe inside of fifteenth-century wedding chests was generally decorated with reclining nude figures, respectively a man and a woman in each chest, whereas sometimes there was a textile pattern imitating a cloth lining.  E. Callmann noted that the present inside lid appears rather unique and imitated a textile pattern consisting in three floral sprigs in soft colours and not stencilled.",

            "historical_context_note": "The term <i>cassone</i> stands in Italian for chest and relates to large and ornate pieces of furniture made in Italy from the 14th to the end of the 16th centuries. They were generally made on the occasion of a relatively important wedding and contained the bride's trousseau. Writing in the mid-sixteenth century, Vasari describes <i>cassoni</i> thus:\n\n'\u2026citizens of those times used to have in their apartments great wooden chests in the form of a sarcophagus, with the covers shaped in various fashions\u2026and besides the stories that were wrought on the front and on the ends, they used to have the arms, or rather, insignia, of their houses painted on the corners, and sometimes elsewhere. And the stories that were wrought on the front were for the most part fables taken from Ovid and from other poets, or rather stories related by the Greek and Latin historians, and likewise chases, jousts, tales of love, and other similar subjects\u2026'.\n\n(Giorgio Vasari, translated Gaston du C. de Vere, <i>Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects,</i> vol. 1, London 1996, p.267)\n\nThese lavishly decorated <i>cassoni</i>, often combined with pastiglia decoration, were generally commissioned in pairs. Florence, which specialised in the decoration of the front panel, was at that time the main centre of production, even though Siena and the Veneto also supplied <i>cassoni</i>. The painted decorations usually represented episodes from classical or biblical history or mythology appropriate for the newly wed. \nThe most flourishing <i>cassone</i> workshop in Florence was run by Marco del Buono Giamberti and Apollonio di Giovanni but major artists such as Domenico Veneziano and Botticelli may have decorated cassoni on occasion. Painted cassoni went out of fashion towards the end of the 15th century when carved oaken chests came into vogue.",
