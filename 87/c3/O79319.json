They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nThis type of necklace, called a lazem, is one of the traditional styles made by the Jewish goldsmiths.  Its main distinguishing feature was one or more pendent cylindrical amulet cases.  These amulets were worn by both Jews and Muslims.  In many cases, as here, the case did not open, as the shape alone was considered sufficient to provide protection.",
