The form is a 'baluster' shape, copied from Chinese ceramics of the 18th century. The ground colour suggests Chinese rouge flamb\u00e9, while the decoration is in silver lustre.  Wilkes has decorated the vase with the Japanese imperial flower, the chrysanthemum, thus doubling the emphasis on its oriental influences. This vase would impress as evidence of the owner's knowledgeable and artistic taste.\n\nPeople\nEdward R. Wilkes was proficient in a variety of techniques, including painting in lustred glazes, as in this example. He was employed by the highly respected glaze chemist Bernard Moore (1850-1935) at Wolfe Street, Stoke-on-Trent, as a china painter and designer. Around 1900 -1905  Wilkes contributed to Moore's experiments, especially in the development of the difficult flamb\u00e9 glaze.",
