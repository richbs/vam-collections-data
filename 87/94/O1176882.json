It was designed by the house of Jacques Fath (the designer himself died in 1954).  It was made for the donor by a professional local dressmaker, and worn by her for her wedding on 3 August 1957.  The corset was bought at Dickins and Jones on Regent Street, London. and taken in slightly at the waist by the donor, as it was too big.  The donor is Mrs Vivian Albany Ward (nee Williams).\n\nThe fabric for the dress was also purchased at Dickins and Jones. Vivian had intended to have her dress custom-made by the Harrods Bridal Room, but then discovered the dress pattern in the Vogue Patterns book, and noted how similar it was to her original choice. She decided to have her dress made by a private dressmaker, realising this would cost a lot less than going to Harrods.",
