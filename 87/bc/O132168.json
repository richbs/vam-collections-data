Studied with J V Barber from the age of 11 (according to a note in the Department's MS Register). Moved to London 1824 and studied with the landscape engraver Edward Goodall for a year. Principally known as an engraver, etcher, lithographer and watercolourist, he also exhibited three oils at the RA between 1838 and 1852, 21 works, mainly landscapes, at the BI 1835-58, and 32 at the SBA 1831-47. He engraved plates for many books, including J M W Turner's Annual Tour of 1833 and 1834; two of his engravings after paintings by Turner were exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition. A volume of his prints after his own work was published 1844. This volume, many other prints and four watercolours, are in the V&A collections. Died Campden Hill, Kensington, London, 7 January 1862.\n\n<b>The Priory, Hastings</b> \nFA4 Neg HF137 \nCanvas, 45.7 x 61 cm (18 x 24 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nBrandard exhibited only two Hastings subjects, at the SBA: Hastings in 1836 (40) and Scene near Hastings, Sussex in 1840 (20). Hastings was a favoured site for landscape painters throughout the 19th century, and the V&A collections include views painted by J J Chalon, E W Cooke, Joshua Cristall and J M W Turner. The view in FA4 is looking towards the old town of Hastings.\"",
