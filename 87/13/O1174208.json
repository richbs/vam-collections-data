First seen for one matinee at London's Playhouse Theatre in 1911, it transferred to the Haymarket a fortnight later and ran for a total of 620 performances. Such was its popularity that it was revived again in 1913, 1924 and 1933. The costumes depicted in Reginald Rigby's design suggest that the poster was created for the Saville revival of 1933.  The design is inscribed by the artist, who presented it to Hilda Neal, the great-aunt of the donor. Apparently, Miss Neal had no theatrical connections: she ran the first secretarial agency in London.",
