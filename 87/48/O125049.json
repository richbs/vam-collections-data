Figures walk, skate and hunt on the frozen river Spaarne and beyond it the walled city with the great Church of St Bavo in the centre and numerous other recognizable churches, monasteries and buildings.  While this work has often been attributed to Allart van Everdingen, an attribution to Jan de Vos (II) (ca. 1615-1693) is more convincing. De Vos worked primarily in Leiden and painted views of his native city as well as Potsdam, Delft, Cologne and perhaps Haarlem. In his works, the sky often comprises 3/4 of the composition which is characteristically cool blue-green in colouring and the whole is painted with fairly soft, blurred edges. This overall softness contrasts with the comparably sharper lines and contrasts of Allart van Everdingen's cityscapes. Further, de Vos' figures appear to have been sketched in swiftly and are generally paired off or clustered in small groups as in Dyce.46. De Vos shows a particular predeliction for depicting hunters and their dogs.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 99-100. cat. no. 112\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nAllart van EVERDINGEN (1621-75) \nDutch School \nThe younger brother of Cesar van Everdingen, he was born at Alkmaar in 1621. According to Houbraken he was a pupil of Roelandt Savery at Utrecht and then of Pieter de Molijn at Haarlem. He entered the guild at Haarlem in 1645 and remained there for about a decade. He afterwards settled in Amsterdam, where he acquired citizenship in 1657 and where he died in 1675. \nEverdingen painted mainly rocky mountain scenes with torrents or waterfalls apparently based on what he had seen on a trip to Sweden, in c. 1640. This type of landscape, of which he ails made etchings, was to exert a considerable influence on Jacob van Ruisdael. \n\nAscribed to Allart van EVERDINGEN \n112 \nVIEW OF HAARLEM \nInscribed lower right <i>A v. Everdingen</i> \nCanvas \n15 \u00bc X 25 \u00bd (38.7 X 64.8) \nDyce Bequest \nD.46 [now Dyce 46]\n\nBoth the style of the picture an the form of the signature differ from those usual for van Everdingen.  Yet the picture is clearly a 17th century work and the signature has withstood recent cleaning. A fairly close comparison may be made with Everdingen's 'View of Alkmaar' in the Lugt Collection (though there the handling is much sharper and harder). \n\nCondition. Quite good, though paint thin in places. Cleaned 1959. \nProv. The Rev. Alexander Dyce; bequeathed to the Museum in 1869.\nAlice Davies in collaboration with Frederic J.

With Engravings and Facsimiles</u>.  Published for the Committee of Council on Education by Chapman and Hall, Limited, 193, Piccadilly, London.  1880.  <u>Chapter I.

Bequeathed by The Reverend Alexander Dyce</u>.  London, 1874.  A 'Note' on page v comments, 'This catalogue refers to the Art portion of the Collection bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum by the Reverend Alexander Dyce, the well-known Shakespearian scholar, who died May 15, 1869'.  The <u>Catalogue. Paintings, Miniatures, &c.</u> by Samuel Redgrave notes of the 'Oil Paintings', 'The strength of Mr. Dyce's valuable bequest to Department of Science and Art does not lie in [this] portion ... which is in its nature of a very miscellaneous character.  The collection was made apparently as objects offered themselves, and without any special design.'  Dyce's main interest was in literary subjects, and this is reflected in many of the paintings he bequeathed to the V&A.\n\nHistorical significance: Marijke de Kinkelder has recently suggested (verbal communication) an attribution to Jan de Vos (II) (ca. 1615-1693), based on photographs only, in February 2010. De Vos worked primarily in Leiden and painted views of his native city as well as Potsdam, Delft, Cologne and perhaps Haarlem. In his works, the sky often comprises 3/4 of the composition which is characteristically cool blue-green in colouring and the whole is painted with fairly soft, blurred edges. This overall softness contrasts with the comparably sharper lines and contrasts of Allart van Everdingen's cityscapes. Further, de Vos' figures appear to have been sketched in swiftly and are generally paired off or clustered in small groups as in Dyce.46. De Vos shows a particular predilection for depicting hunters & their dogs and often included a fox in his compositions as a kind of signature a reference to his surname as 'vos' is fox in Dutch.",

Gerson [based on comparison with <i>View of Alkmaar</i> by van Everdingen in Lugt's collection] (28/10/1960)\n\nMore recently, Marijke de Kinkelder has suggested (verbal communication) an attribution to Jan de Vos (II) (ca. 1615-1693), based on photographs only, in February 2010.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Landscape paintings were extremely popular during the 17th century and increasingly encompassed a variety of forms and genres. Dutch painters had a new attention for nature and their familiar surroundings as well as more exotic locales that Dutch travellers encountered, among which the most praised was Italy. In the early 1600s, innovative contributions to landscape paintings were made, especially by the marine painters who concentrate on the effects of light due to atmospheric condition and the sense of depth and had a great resonance on landscape painting. Panoramic views became popular in the 17th-century Netherlands and views of the Dutch countryside developed quickly, especially under the influence of Jan van Goyen (1596-1656) who developed a broken brushwork technique and used a restrained monochromatic palette of earthy colours. The end of the 17th century is remarkable for a shift in taste that came to favour more academic and classical landscapes under the influence of Italianate landscape paintings. Landscapes were then often employed as settings for mythological or historical subjects.",
