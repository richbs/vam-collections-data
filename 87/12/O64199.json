It was hung on a canvas backing in a first floor room and pasted directly onto the plaster in an adjoining passageway. It was the earliest paper in a sequence of four layers of wallpaper found in situ. The blue distemper ground was brushed on, and then the pattern was block-printed. The areas printed in black may have been intended to imitate flocking (a raised pile of powdered wool often applied to wallpaper and designed to look like velvet). So-called 'mock flock' papers were a cheaper alternative to the genuine flock wallpapers.",
