When the Neo-classical style was regarded as the height of fashion, vases were among the most widely used classical ornaments.  In this case, both the vases were fitted with candelabra so they could be placed on pedestals and used for lighting. \n\nPeople\nThe vases were made by the factory of Matthew Boulton, a specialist producer of gilt-bronze ornaments, in Soho, Birmingham. They were based on designs by Sir William Chambers, architect to George III, and were originally made in 1771 for Mrs John Parker of Saltram, Devonshire. A year later they were acquired  by Sir Lawrence Dundas, MP for Edinburgh from 1767 to 1781, for his saloon at 19 Arlington St, London. \n\nMaterials & Making\nBlue-john was a calcium-based stone quarried in Derbyshire. It was highly fashionable in both Britain and France from the 1740s and was often mounted with gilt bronze.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe plinth is decorated with panoplies (trophies made up of all sorts of weapons) and the vase is supported by three 'Persian' figures. This was  a general term of the day for male figure supports, much as female ones were known as 'caryatids'.",
