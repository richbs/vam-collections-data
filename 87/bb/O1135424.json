Action Man was relaunched in 1993 by Hasbro, which is the era that this particular Action Man object falls under. \n\nAction figures are particularly popular with boys because they represent traditional masculine traits and are closely associated with the public sphere which is represented by items such as tools, transportation, garages, machines, and military equipment. The Stealth Jet kit contains miniature Action Man and Dr X figures. Dr X is a villian (a mad scientist) introduced as an arch enemy of Action Man in the mid 1990s.",
