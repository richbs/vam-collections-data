            "physical_description": "The eight-lobed cup rests on a low ring foot that has a slight mistake in the carving so that the circular edge does not meet exactly. It encloses a four-petalled flower head with a multi-petalled flower at the centre. Two leaves carved at opposite sides of the bowl terminate in large flower buds on stalks that recurve to form pierced handles and are worked from the same block of crystal. The base of the sides has a continuous border of dianthus blossoms, each with a small bud on a slender stalk rising upwards on the right. At the top is a border of rounded arches with tassel motifs suspended from the vertical lines between them. The main border design consists of smaller dianthus flowers, buds and tendrils bearing small five-petalled flowers in a seemingly random arrangement but probably disguises imperfections in the crystal. The long leafy tendrils certainly do. \nOne lobe has an old, diagonal crack extending from top to bottom.",
