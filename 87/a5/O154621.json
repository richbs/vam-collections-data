            "public_access_description": "Isamu Noguchi was primarily a sculptor, although he was also known for his collaborations with the American modern-dance pioneer, Martha Graham for whom he created sets for her dance works.  When he was commissioned to design King Lear for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in 1955, he had little experience of costume.  \n\nThe style that Noguchi chose to present his ideas is unusual.  Instead of the usual 2-D figure on paper, he produced little paper dolls, with layers of costumes that could be removed; fixed to each figure was a wire strut so that it could stand upright.  \n\nThis design is for Edmund, played by Harold Lang, showing his armour.  A note indicates that the highly stylised armour should be made in indigo blue, which would impart a wonderful sheen on stage.  The actual information conveyed by the designs is not easy for a costume-maker to interpret.  The armour forms a \"cage\" around the body - what materials will make it rigid yet allow it to fit comfortably on the actor?  The bands are clearly not decorative, but how rigid should they be?  How easy will it be for the actors to carry out the director's moves in the fight sequences?  Unfortunately the director had not taken the costumes into account, and the stylisation which Noguchi envisaged did not blend with the realistic fight moves planned by George Devine.",
