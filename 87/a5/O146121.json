The backing extends beyond the silk and is folded and sewn into place to create a deep band across the top.  The backing and binding were probably added for display purposes rather than for functional ones, but the date this was done is uncertain.\nDark blue ground with large botehs in offset rows, facing alternate directions in alternate rows.  Each boteh is worked in yellow silk which may originally have been metal thread.  Each boteh is packed with small floral and leafy motifs.  In between the botehs are isolated motifs: a roundel of dots with a floral sprig, a lobed compartment with stylised blossoms and a sloping, elongated leaf with floral infill.",
