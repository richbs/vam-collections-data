Its precise identification remained ambiguous until 1971 when the existence of two fragments of a companion figure were identified at the site. Traces of the nagapuspa, the flower symbol of the Bodhisattva Maitreya, identified the newly discovered figure and removed any doubts that the V&A torso represents the other premier Buddhist saviour figure, the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.",
