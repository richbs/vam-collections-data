The sides illustrate life below, with falconers hunting  on horseback and  knights slaying  mythical beasts. The inscription between them, on the side of the lid, names the Ayyubid prince al-Malik al-Adil II, who ruled in Cairo from 1238 to 1240.\n\nIn Islamic art, objects made from base materials were often transformed by sophisticated forms of decoration. Brassware, like this piece, was often decorated with inlaid surface ornament.\n\nFor larger motifs, metalworkers chiselled out small areas of brass and filled them with thin sheets of silver, gold and copper. They added details by chasing the surface of the softer metals and contrast by using a black filler. \n\nThe inlay technique first became popular in eastern Persia (now Iran) in the mid 12th century. It then spread westwards and by 1250 was in use across the Middle East. Its popularity declined after 1500.",
