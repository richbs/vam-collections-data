While making sculpture he also made drawings and prints which reflect the concerns manifest in his three-dimensional work. In many ways this suite of images seems outside his more formal investigations into the nature of space and perception. But at the same time they are a very direct expression of the playfulness usually found more discreetly in his work. This is from a set of eight images which show a very perplexed- looking man, smartly dressed in double-breasted suit who is having a problem with orientation. Each pair of images is a mirrored set, but each set is subtly different from the previous one, so that although one pair may at first seem identical to the last or last-but-one, it then emerges that some slight detail has shifted, such as the positioning of a buttonhole, the direction of the  stripes on his tie or the buttoning of his jacket.",
