The painting shows a group of five children (three boys, an older girl, and a little girl) with trees and houses behind them: each of the boys has a long home-made stick with a flattened curved head, and on the ground between them is a round flat stone like a puck.  The boy in the foreground, who wears a mulberry-coloured suit, appears to have broken his stick, and a boy in a red suit, black hat and light waistcoat in the centre of the group seems to be warning the girls to stand back; beyond him, the third boy, in a buff-coloured skeleton suit, is swinging his stick above his head to strike the stone.  The girls are to the right-hand side of the group: the smaller wears a white frock and mob cap trimmed with blue ribbon; the elder, who has an arm round her, wears a black pelerine over her white dress, with a broad-brimmed straw hat trimmed with blue ribbon.\n\nThe painting has a cut mount with an oval window which is gilded at\nthe edge of the aperture, and a glazed frame of gilded wood with a deal backboard.",
