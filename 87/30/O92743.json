The coloured embroidery shows a woman on a ski tow and illustrates the type of clothing and equipment that was available in the 1930s. The white cross represents Switzerland.\n\nThe badge was bought by Mrs Frances Wisken and her mother on a skiing trip to M\u00fcrren in the Bernese Oberland in 1939. Mrs Wisken was quite young at the time and it was the first time she had been skiing. The badge was later removed and she kept it as a memento.",
