According to popular legend, Atal Rai performed a miracle that restored a close friend to life. Guru Hargobind saw this as defying the law of nature, and his son therefore offered to give his own life in return for breaking the law. Atal Rai died after going into a meditative trance. Although only a child, he was given the title \u2018Baba\u2019, to denote his wisdom. The building was started in 1778 on the south side of the Harmandir complex, and was completed by the end of the 1790s. Its nine storeys represent the nine years of Baba Atal\u2019s life. The photographer Samuel Bourne always sought the most picturesque view, as seen here.",
