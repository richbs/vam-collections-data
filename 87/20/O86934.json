It may have been intended as a vase.\n\nMiddle Eastern potters developed fritware in response to the challenge of the superior wares imported from China. In the 12th and early 13th centuries, potters in Kashan and other centres in Iran produced fine decorated fritwares in an astonishing range of styles. Unlike high-fired Chinese porcelain, low-fired fritware was soft and porous. Like porcelain it was white all the way through and could be used to make convincing substitutes.\n\nFritware was also known as stone paste or quartz paste. The main ingredient was fine quartz powder made by grinding sand or pebbles. Small quantities of white clay and a glassy substance known as frit were added. The clay gave plasticity. The frit helped to bind the body after firing.",
