After a limited competition, in 1963 the Ministry of Works asked David Mellor to design a silver table service for use in British Embassies abroad. The idea was Lord John Hope's, who was Minister of Works in the Conservative Government under Harold Macmillan. He determined that in future British embassies should be built and furnished in an obviously modern style.\n\nMellor designed the entire silver collection, which included this coffee service, a set of cutlery with stainless steel blades, a tea kettle, condiment sets, engraved silver salvers and a range of candlesticks. Unfortunately, only two embassies were actually furnished with the embassy silver, those in Warsaw and Mexico City. The new minister cancelled the project, the result of a cost-cutting exercise.",

As the result of a limited competition, David Mellor was approached by the Ministry of Works in 1963 to design a silver table service for use in British Embassies abroad.  The idea was Lord John Hope's who as Minister of Works in the Macmillan Government determined that in future British embassies should be built and furnished in an obviously modern style.  Mellor designed the entire silver collection which included this coffee service, a set of cutlery with stainless steel blades, a tea kettle, condiment sets, engraved silver salvers and a range of candlesticks.  Unfortunately, the only embassies which were actually furnished with the embassy silver were Warsaw and Mexico City.  A change of minister brought about the cancellation of the project through a cost cutting exercise.\n\nHistorical significance: Winner of Design Centre Award in 1965.",
