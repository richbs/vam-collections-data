The male falconer is wearing typical Safavid costume of almost two hundred years earlier. The costume includes a tight fitted coat with a full skirt, Cuban-heeled riding boots and an elaborately coiled turban, while his features follow the accepted standard of male beauty. The horse wears elaborate trappings with a fringed saddle cloth probably imitating embroidery.  \n\nThis tile may have been installed in a building in Iran as part of a 'procession' theme within a continuous wall frieze; initially they were thought to have been removed from the ruins of the palace of Shah Abbas II (1642-66).  However, this type of tile was also available singly, acquired by Western visitors as souvenirs of a visit to Iran. It was an immensely popular model, pulled from the same mould, evidence of a degree of mass production.",
