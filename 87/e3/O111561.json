He was suspended from the Tory party and a perjury investigation began. This production made the news when it was produced in London since Jeffrey Archer was starring in a court-room drama that he had written, whilst waiting to appear in court charged with perjury.  When the real trial opened, an article in The Times, 30 June 2001, began:\n\n'The real drama in town is not at the West End where a decent ticket even in the most decrepit of theatres costs upwards of \u00a330, but at the Old Bailey where admission is free. The piece de resistance, now in its third week, is the trial of the novelist-turned-politician, Lord Jeffrey Archer, who is accused of telling lies to win a \u00a3 -500,000 libel suit which he brought against a tabloid 14 years ago for alleging that he had had a one-night stand with a prostitute. \n\nSince the trial opened early this month, it has been the most riveting media event holding on to the front page despite competition from weightier matters of state and politics. Lord Archer's private life has been turned inside out by his own confidants who have told the court about his extra-marital affairs, the generous gifts he bought for his ladies, the games he played to ``cheat'' on his wife, the ``completely separate'' lives the couple led, and the diaries he allegedly got his secretary, Ms. Angela Peppiatt, to ``forge'' to support his alibi.'",
