The front shows a boy and girl playing at Indians, peeping through a cut-out space among the trees, with a russet and white puppy (holding an arrow in his mouth) in front of them, with the words\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU\nYOU'RE 7 TODAY\nwith the enlarged figure seven printed in a textured silver pattern is visible to the right, inside the card, as is another boy in American Indian costume.  Inside the card, the first two become a pop-up group, with trees and a teepee in the background; the verse reads:\nTo hope you have the nicest things\nTo do all through the day\nSo that your Birthday's happy\nAnd full of games to play !",
