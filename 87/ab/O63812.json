The collection contains two stage bodices (S.256-1979 and S.158-1979) which would have fitted around the midriff, under the breasts, and worn over a lightweight chemise or blouse.  The the fabric and side laceing of these bodices indicate a non-peasant character, where the laceing would be a feature down centre front.    This bodice came with a note in Margaret Rolfe's hand: \"This white bodice was worn by Marie Taglioni and was given to me Margaret Rolfe by Marguerite Troubetzkoi for my collection.\"  Marguerite Troubetzkoi was Taglioni's niece.  A collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and from Taglioni's niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi, after Taglioni's death.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
