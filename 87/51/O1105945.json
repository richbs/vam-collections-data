I, pl. LIX, no. 149; vol. II, p. 101, no. 69 (as <i>Pepys</i>); <i>Times Women\u2019s Supplement</i>, 1921, repro. in colour; Long 1929, p. 128 (as <i>Pepys</i>); Long 1930, p. 18, fig. 49 (as 'supposed portrait of Pepys'): <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 16 (as <i>Unknown Man</i>). \n\nThis miniature was bought as a portrait of Pepys, but this identification was questioned by S Pepys Cockerell, a student of Pepys' iconography, in conversation with FW Stokes in March 1917, when Long was on active service. After his return, in October 1920, Long looked into Stokes's notes and confirmed the doubts about the Pepys identification, rejecting at the same time an alternative theory that the sitter might be General Monck. In <i>British Mininturists</i>, (1) however, this miniature still appeared as <i>Pepys</i>, and it was not until the <i>Handlist</i> of 1930 (2) that the change was made publicly. \n\nThe miniature was first catalogued as by 'Nathaniel Dixon'. Confusion over the artist's name was set right in the Museum inventories by H M Cundall in February 1910, he having presumably been told of Goulding's work before its publication in the Burlington Magazine of October 1911. \n\n1 Long 1929, p. 128. \n2 Long 1930, p.18.\" ",
