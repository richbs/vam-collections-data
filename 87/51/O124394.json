It is not known why Constable selected this subject but its mountainous subject contrasts with the gentle scale of the landscapes in English Landscape Scenery. The engraver, Henry Dawe, was the brother of George, portrait painter, who employed Constable to paint a background for him in 1815. It is probably no coincidence that Constable chose an engraver who was working for his rival, Turner, on his classification of different types of landscape in the Liber Studiorum.",
