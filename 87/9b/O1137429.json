            "public_access_description": "In the wake of World War Two there was an alarming rise in tuberculosis (T.B) cases. These posters promote a mass radiography (mass x-ray) programme instigated by the Ministry of Health which sent mobile screening units to schools, factories and other local access points. They are evidence of a huge promotional campaign which resulted in a large percentage of the population being tested for tuberculosis. Posters like this which sought to inform and protect the public helped to project the new ethos of \u2018welfare capitalism\u2019 after the war.\n\nThis poster belongs to the series \u2018Caught in time. A Case of T.B.\u2019 The series was intended to be displayed as a frieze and presents a storyboard of photographic stills, following the case of fictional T.B sufferer John Smith (modelled by actor Sam Kydd) from his first cough, through his diagnosis by x-ray to his successful treatment and full recovery. \n\nThe photographic imagery suggests a real life scenario, while achieving a reassuring and optimistic gloss. The posters de-mystify the process of T.B treatment and challenge the public\u2019s attitude towards tuberculosis. By the early 20th century T.B. had become associated in the popular imagination with the \u2018unclean poor\u2019, hereditary taint and miscreant behaviour. Here, however, John Smith is presented as a middle class family man and exemplary employee who submits responsibly to treatment. \n\nThis set of posters was preserved by Dr Joan McMichael who was actively involved in the first mass radiography screening campaigns in Britain.",
