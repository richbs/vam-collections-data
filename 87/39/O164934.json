            "public_access_description": "Patchwork is a needlework technique where small pieces of cut out fabric shapes are sewn together to produce a decorative design.  The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. A pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples. \n\nQuilting is a method of stitching layers of material together and usually consists of a decorative top, a middle layer of wadding or batting which adds warmth to the quilt and a bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric.\n\nThis is one of the few patchwork quilts of completely plain fabrics in the V&A's collection. The design of the quilt mixes early and late traditions, with a formal, framed centre made of repeating six-point stars and hexagons. The use of plain silk dress fabrics for this patchwork quilt has provided a design of vibrant contrasting colours, with surprising combinations such as bright blue and brown. The colours used provide a perfect display of fashionable British taste in the third quarter of the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen the quilt was donated to the museum in 1937, it was said to have been worked by the donor's ancestor, Sarah Tomes (1792-1870), at around the time of her marriage in 1813. The brightly coloured silks are typical of those from the third quarter of the nineteenth century, and it may be that Sarah Tomes made the quilt towards the end of her life.",
