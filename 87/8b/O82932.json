Poplar and softwood with veneers of burr walnut and walnut.\n\nConstruction\nThe carcase supported by a framework of poplar with drawer runners.  The backboard consists of 3 wide softwood boards (grained side to side) nailed on, apparently original. The mouldings nailed and glued. The bottom right skirt moulding a modern replacement. There is no obvious sign of large carved feet (as seen on other examples) but it is possible that restorations to the base now conceal the evidence. The sides with plain walnut veneers. The top formed from 3 planks of wood (identified by Van Geenen as chestnut) now warping and fixed to the carcase with wedged two tenons at both sides; veneered in walnut (measured by Van Geenen 1mm veneer) and cross banding at edges. With old mouldings replaced.\n\nThe stile carvings apparently carved from the solid and nailed, as a facing.\n\nDrawers: the body of poplar and the fronts solid walnut with walnut veneer (measured by Van Geenen c3.5mm); dovetailed at front and back, with the bottoms nailed up. The wooden carved drawer handles probably held on wooden pegs and glued, possibly with some additional nails. Originally fitted with metal internal locks (now missing). The wooden escutcheons 19th century replacing metal ones, the fixing points still visible. \n\nIR Spectroscopy was conducted in 2003 (Istituto Internazionale Ricerche, Milan) on samples of wood from the chest:\npoplar (x5), suggesting a date range 1620-80, and walnut (x3) suggesting a date range 1610-70. Chestnut was not dateable.\n\nCarved figures (from the top), standing on scroll brackets\nFront, top left and right: two nude figures (one male, one female?) with an open book (probably Paolo and Francesca)\nSoldier (possibly Turkish) with two infants \nHercules with lionskin and club, with the Lernaean hydra(?)\nAdam and Eve clasping each other, the serpent entwined around their legs\n\nFront (lateral)\nPutto with horn (fertility?) at top; caryatid at bottom\nFemale figures in Roman dress (possibly Virtues)\nRHS: Justice; and a female suicide (martyr or Lucretia, possibly Love)\nLHS: Fortitude; Faith standing on a block (word of God?)\n\nBack (more crudely carved) - four female figures, possibly four Elements\nRHS - with snakelike creatures\nLHS - (missing head), with fruit (Earth); with hat and fish (Water); \n\nCentral drawer: two horsmen with shields over a fallen warrier, possibly the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, patrons of sailors; (as seen on the cassettone a bambocci, Private collection (100 x 166.5 x 78cm) in GONZALEZ-PALACIOS, Alvar: Il Mobile in Liguria, fig. 51).\n\nDrawer Handles\nBoys on dolphins playing musical instruments\n\nVAN GEENEN, Dirk-Olaf: Italian Cassettone a Bambocci.

(figs. 242-8). The only Renaissance examples we have date from the last decade of the sixteenth century and show a similar decorative treatment. Figure 250 rests on a base with variously carved moulds on which rest the stile decorations of the front and sides. These are composed of figures carved in the round and arranged tier on tier in the manner of those we have seen on the writing cabinets. The drawers, divided by heavily carved horizontal members, are framed with carved moulds and have handles composed of grotesque figures carved in wood. The top section is divided into two drawers, between them a panel decorated with figuresin unusually high relief. In chests of this kind surfaces of the drawers were often veneered while the edges of the tops were invariably carved and moulded. (p.306)",
