            "historical_context_note": "A considerable number of pieces of furniture with trellis marquetry embellished with metal studs was delivered to the Garde Meuble between 1769 and 1774, including a commode that matched the secretaire and that came into the V&amp;A collections in 1895 (see museum no. 464-1895).  The commode was delivered by Jean-Henri Riesener (1734-1806) on 22 June 1774, eight days before Jourbert delivered the secretaire. The commode was delivered for the use of 'Madame' (Madame Marie-Adela\u00efde de France, 1732-1800, the sixth child and fourth daughter of Louis XV and Maria Leszczynska) at the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly. The destination of the secretaire was not recorded in 1774 and no later record of its placement in one of the royal houses has been discovered, although the pairing of a secr\u00e9taire with a commode was a fashionable one.\n\nThe design of both pieces is probably attributable to Joubert, as court cabinet-maker, although others may have been involved in the production of pieces in the same style. \nA second secretaire, of closely similar form  to W.17-1970, and with similar marquetry, was delivered to the Garde Meuble on 1 June 1774 from Joubert's workshop but carries the stamp of another cabinet-maker, Roger Vandercruse (1728-1799), who is known to have made furniture for Joubert to supply to the Garde Meuble. That secretaure was listed as no. 2753 in the Garde Meuvle and was supplied for the <i>Cabinet Int\u00e9rieur</i> of the Comte d'Artois at the ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne. It was sold by Christie's, King Street, London on 5 July 2012, lot 25.  \n\nJean-Henri Riesener, who is said to have supplied the commode of similar design to this secretaire had from 1769 been supplying furniture for royal use and in 1775 became <i>\u00e9b\u00e9niste du roi</i>(cabinet-maker to the king), succeeding Joubert in that office.  At the time that the commode was delivered, Joubert was in the last months of his life and it may be that Riesener was involved in finishing and delivering some of the pieces that he had designed. \n\nSimilar 'studded' marquetry is recorded on a pair of corner cupboards stamped by the maker Louis Peridiez (1731-1795) which was sold at Christie's, London, 25 June 1982, lot 139 and a secretaire with similar studding on a trellis marquetry of serpentine form is in the collections of the National Museum of Scotland, no. 1985.313.  This is stamped by Guillaume Benneman (master cabinet-maker in 1785, died after 1811) and dates from about 1790.",
