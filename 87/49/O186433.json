Soane received the Academy's even more prestigious three-year royal travelling scholarship. The only stipulation attached by the Academy was that the student recipient send back a sample of his work to each spring exhibition of the RA. Not long after arriving in Rome, Soane began preparing the annual submission for the exhibition of the following year. Soane described the project as 'Composed ... without regard to expense ... amid all the wild imagination of an enthusiastic mind animated by the contemplation of the majestic ruins of the sublime works of imperial Rome' (Soane 1835 II, p.71). He enumerated such sources of inspiration as the Pantheon, the Imperial Baths, and he might have added the colonnades at St Peters, which influenced his own forecourt arrangement. With its eclectic references to an ancient and modern Rome, the British Senate House  compares favourably with the visionary schemes of such distinguished Soane predecessors in Italy as Robert Mylne and George Dance. Soane related that his design was criticised at the RA for insufficient 'practical acquaintance with the accommodation necessary' (Soane 1835 I, p. 14). The lighting of the bicameral interior foreshadows Soane's later fascination with what he called 'lumi\u00e8re mysterieuse'.",
