This period coincided with the founding and development of the mass movements for the abolition of the slave trade and subsequent abolition of slavery within Britain\u2019s West Indies colonies. Unsurprisingly, then, slavery and abolitionism were themes addressed by many print satirists whose work featured black people in a number of social and political contexts.\n\nThis etching by Rowlandson shows a black butler enjoying the company of his female colleagues in front of a blazing fire. The group also seemed to have enjoyed a glass or two from a pictured bottle of \u2018Cherry Bounce\u2019. In the 18th century domestic service was the biggest employment sector for both white and black populations. Black domestic workers, however, were usually unpaid and unable to voluntarily leave their employer.   [Helen Mears]",
