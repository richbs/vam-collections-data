The text is as follows: FLORENCE: late 16th century 458 <i>Recto </i>Design for the decoration of a niche Inscribed in a later hand on the mount 'Original design for a niche by Perino del Vaga circa 1530' Pen and ink wash 11 x 6 1/8 (280 x 155) 2235 <i>Verso</i> (on another sheet of paper pasted down) a design by a later hand for an Ionic capital, with title and notes Pen and ink PROVENANCE Transferred from the Art Museum 1861 The old attribution of the recto to Perino is understandable, but not convincing. Francesco Salviati has been suggested as an alternative. But the drawing may be later still. It has some of the characteristics of the late 16th century Florentine school. The ornament over the entablature and the tablet or cartouche over the arch are almost in the taste of Buontalenti.",
