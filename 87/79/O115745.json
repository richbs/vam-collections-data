Immediately below the pile, towards the right, are running stitches in pink wool.  Upper: 1.5 cm. as above, pink wool being used here to oversew the turned plain weave.  [The 2 slits cut for the saddle have been covered with yellow open-work fastening.  A deep fringe has (later?) been sewn around 3 sides and at bottom left, a double tassel has been added].\n\nDesign: field: a dark blue field coming to a point 2.5 cm. from the lower border; the two saw-toothed edges beginning half way down the sides of the field so creating two spandrels.  The area to receive the semi-circular slit, 44 cm. across, in the centre and the 18 cms. downward top slit has angular borders in the inner and outer border design (see below).  Towards the top, on the right, there is a short 9 cm. broken line of single knots in dark pink.\n\nThe spandrels have a red ground with a Herati pattern in which rhite rosettes are framed on the diagonal by green and pink leaves.  Other blossoms are in pink or green and the bands of an intermittent diamond trellis are in dark blue.\n\nMain border: diagonal lines in white and purple (faded) slope outwards from the centre of the lower border.  The first 1 cm. is red, not purple, and so is the upper 19 cm. of the side border and the upper border.  The white stripe has a line of tiny pink florets with dark blue leaves and the purple/.red stripes have yellow florets with green leaves.\n\nInner and outer border and around the cut areas within the field: blue ground with pink flowers on a dark blue meander.\n\nGuard stripes on either side of each border have small white blocks on a dark blue ground.",
