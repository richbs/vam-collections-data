The most clebrated interior at Fontainebleau was the Galerie Francois I, named after the then king, which featured fresco paintings set into elaborate plaster frames. This black and white print translates this idea into a form which was both much more affordable and portable, and thus enabled the influence of Fontainebleau to travel right across Europe.",

Oxford University Press [9/12/05], http:///www.groveart.com/\nThe Flemish painter and draughtsman Thiry worked as Rosso Fiorentino's assistant in the Galerie Francois I at Fontainbleau and later under Primaticcio. He was active as a designer of prints in the 1540s and although he himself died in 1550, his most important work 'Livre de la Conqueste de la Toison d'Or' was not published until 1563. The style of this is dependent on Rosso Fiorentino of whom Thiry was a close follower.As a designer of ornament Thiry was inventive but somewhat monotonous.\nOsborne, Harold /Jordan, Harold <u>Fontainebleau</u> in Hugh Brigstocke, ed <u>The Oxford Companion to Western Art.</u> Oxford University Press 2001. Grove Art Online. Oxford Universiry Press, 2005 [9/12/05], http:///www.groveart.com/\nThe interior decoration of Fontainebleau was the most brilliant expression of the ambition harboured by Francois I to emulate the great humanist princes of Italy to glorify the prestige of the French Crown by bringing about a national revival of the arts under the aegis of  lavish court patronage. Lacking an indigenous tradition of mural painting adequate to his conceptions he brought Italian masters beginning with Rosso Fiorentino in 1530 to lead the work....\n\nAn elegant, refined sensual and highly idiosyncratic style invented by Rosso and Primaticcio. The Gallery Francois I intact but much restored is usually attributed to Rosso, and is one of the two most magnificent examples of the style. It employs a combination of fresco painting set in elaborate high relief stucco frames over a high plain dado ... the overwhelming abundance, high relief, elongated proportions of the figures, fruit garlands and strap work have no direct parallel in 16th century Italy. Prints by Pierre Milan and Boyvin ensured the dissemination of the Fontainebleau style to painting, tomb sculpture and the decorative arts.\nRobert-Dumesnil, A.P.F. <u>Le peintre-graveur fran\u00e7ais</u>.

The artist Thiry, was assistant to Rosso Fiorentino at the French royal chateau of Fontainebleau. Using Thiry's designs, the printmaker Boyvin has successfully translated the formula of a large, fresco painting of figures surrounded by a stucco frame from the Gallery Francois I at Fontainebleau into a small, easily portable multiple object made of ink on paper, that nevertheless conveys something of the essence of its inspiration. The transposition of a design idea from a courtly, rural setting at Fontainebleau to the publishing world of one of Europe's capital cities also ensured it was prints which spread the influence of Fontainebleau internationally.",
