            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter,<u> Italian Drawings Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p.143. The following is the full text of the entry: GANDOLFI, GAETANO (1734-1802) 1015 Studies of five heads Inscribed on the back in ink in an old hand and in pencil in a modern hand \u2018Donato Creti\u2019 Pen and ink 8 \u00bc x 11 3/8 (212 x 290) D.420-1885 PROVENANCE Bought 1885 The old attribution to Creti, recorded in the inscription, is reasonable, since he made sketches of heads somewhat like these. Some examples are illustrated in R. Robi, \u2018I disegni di Donato Creti agli Uffizi\u2019 in <i>Bolletino d\u2019Arte</i>, 47, 1962, pp. 241-50. But Gandolfi also covered sheets with such sketches. There is an example in the British Museum (1869-6-12-593. Photo Gernsheim 4833-1950), and it is obviously by the same hand as our drawing. Gandolfi differs from Creti in using a denser and more elaborate form of hatching, laying the strokes close together and over each other in a fine mesh and shading off by means of dots, like an engraver. He produces stronger contrasts of light and shade. His sulky mouths are characteristic. Creti\u2019s facial expressions are softer, sweeter and more conventional.",
