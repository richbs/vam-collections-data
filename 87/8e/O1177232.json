Each set contains around 19 pieces which can be put together in any order to create unique and strange creations.\n[Magnamorphs] A plastic set of Magna Morphs depciting aquatic creatures, including an octopus, a whale and a dolphin. These different parts are divided up so you have the octopus's tentacles with the fin of a whale. Each part has a magnet in the middle to hold the different parts together. The octopus has six parts and is an orangey red colour. The whale is black and white and consists of five parts and the dolphin is grey with five parts.\n[Box] A boxed set of magnamorphs depicting Aquatic creatures. The box is blue with a clear window showing the product inside. There is a photograph of the animal inside in a blue circle at the bottom left of the box. The title of the product is printed on the bottom left of the box with a magnet replacing the 'n'. A photograph on the back shows a young boy playing with a set of magnamorphs.\n[Magnamorphs] Nine plastic parts of a Magna Morph set depiciting a tiger, a snow leapard and a red panda. Different parts of the animals are broken up: so there is the legs of a panda and the head of a tiger, each with a magnet in the centre to be connected to another part.\n[Box] A boxed set of magnamorphs depicting Asian animals. The box is blue with a clear window showing the product inside. There is a photograph of the animal inside in a blue circle at the bottom left of the box. The title of the product is printed on the bottom left of the box with a magnet replacing the 'n'. A photograph on the back shows a young boy playing with a set of magnamorphs.\n[Magnamorph set] A boxed set of magnamorphs depicting insects. The box is green with a clear window showing the insects inside. There are some photographs of the insects inside in yellow circles surrounded by a purple ring with the names on the insect, such as 'Bee' or 'Tarantula'. The title of the product is printed on the bottom left of the box with a magnet replacing the 'n'. A photograph on the back shows a young boy playing with a set of magnamorphs. The parts are inside the box and held in a clear plastic container. Different parts of the insect are broken up: so there is the legs of a sipder and the head of a bee, each with a magnet in the centre to be connected to another part.",
