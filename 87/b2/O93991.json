In the painting, Holman Hunt provides many clues to help the viewer understand a complicated story that carries a simple moral of redemption. As in most of her photographs, however, Hawarden gives few clues to her meaning and, as always, the photograph is untitled. The vignetting [isolating a portrait from its background] of the photograph during printing softened the edges and obscured the object in Clementina\u2019s hands, which appears to be a die-throwing cup, an allegorical attribute of fate. The snake - a reminder of temptation before the fall [of Adam and Eve] - clasped round her throat further suggests her role as a fateful female.'",
