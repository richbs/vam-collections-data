Inside, the first two pages state 'Francis Hoods Book', written in ink, and the name Francis Hood surrounded by arabesques. \nThe work in the book is divided into sections, each one with a decorated title and introduction. There are references to other pages and sections, perhaps from a text or reference book. Each section consists of a number of worked examples, written in black ink with faded red underlining. Throughout, the work is neat and unblotted, with no corrections or markings, suggesting that working out was done elsewhere and the neat solutions copied into this book.

Francis was a successful tailor, and the enterprise grew to be a flourishing family business. \n\nGeorge (born 1827) was a tailor with his father by the age of 14. He died aged only 24. \n\nElizabeth (born 1830) became a milliner and dressmaker. She married Scottish draper John Train, but was soon widowed, and thereafter is listed is woollen goods trader as well as dressmaker.\n\nFrancis (born 1832) moved to Australia, possibly before his twentieth birthday, where he stayed the rest of his life.\n\nHenry (born 1836) was an apprentice in 1851. Ten years later, at the age of 25, he inherited the family business, and by 1881 was employing 6 men and 2 boys. He was married to Elizabeth from Somerset, and they had six children. He was able to retire in his mid-sixties and move to a country house on the proceeds of the business. Soon after, Elizabeth died, but Henry remarried at the age of 72 to a woman 31 years his junior. His second son George (born 1868) continued the Hood dynasty from the 1890s, though the shop in St John Street, Ashbourne, remained \u2018Henry Hood &amp; Son\u2019 in 1900.\n\nSusanna (born 1838) never married, and lived with Elizabeth. She was also a dressmaker.\n\nThe books were passed down through Henry\u2019s children to the donor\u2019s husband.",
