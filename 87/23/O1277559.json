The image is signed by the artist, E.P.Kinsella, in the left hand corner, 1918.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1938 the Lyceum Theatre was run by the Melville Brothers, Walter (1875-1937) and Frederick (1876-1938). During this period the theatre established a reputation for staging some of the West End\u2019s premier pantomimes, rivalling those staged at the traditional home of pantomime, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nMany of the elaborate pantomimes staged at the Lyceum during this period were written by Frederick Melville.  They were often written in rhyming couplets, with deliberately dreadful puns. As well as seeking to restore the narrative elements of pantomime, the Melvilles recognised the importance of spectacle, investing in stunning scenery and costumes. They also indulged in a great deal of \u201cSlap-stick\u201d and the comedians they employed specialised in plate-smashing, messy cake-making in the palace kitchens, and very messy \u201cpapering the parlour\u201d scenes. \n\nThe 1918 production of Cinderella starred Miss Nancy Gibbs as Cinderella, Miss Alice Lloyd as Dandini (Valet to the Prince), Mr. George Bass as Buttons. The costumes were designed and made by Willie Clarkson and the script was written by Newman Maurice.",
