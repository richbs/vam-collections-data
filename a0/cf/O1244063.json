Inspired by medieval Norwegian legends, they are named after a prince and princess from the 13th century, but were described as \u201cchildren of today\u201d. The characters in their colourful period costumes were intended to represent a combination of tradition and innovation, and promote the idea of modern Norway as authentic and environmentally conscious.\n\nThe original design for H\u00e5kon was produced by Javier Ramirez Camputchano, developed in collaboration with Kari and Werner Grossman.",
