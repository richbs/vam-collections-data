Rodin explored the subject over a number of years, the earliest dating from before 1886, and produced it in several other versions, as well as drawing it repeatedly.\nThis marble version was probably carved by his trusted assistants and technicians, under his supervision, as was normal workshop practice at the time. The contrast of the rough-hewn rock with the smooth surface of the figures indicates Rodin's admiration for the work of Michelangelo.",
