According to the inscription, Taglioni performed two Spanish dances, a Herta and a Cachucha, dances more associated with her rival Fanny Elssler.  \nThe slipper was given to Lady Selina Bidwell, who may have been one of Taglioni's pupils when she was teaching dance in London in the 1870s.\nThe shoe formed part of the London Archives of the Dance.  The Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection was stored with the dance historian Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: Ballet shoes from the mid 19th century are rare and this, associated as it is with Taglioni and the development of pointe work, is an important artefact in the history of ballet shoe construction.  The shoe is unblocked and the darning under the toe and up the sides would have been the only extra support for pointe work at this period.",
