It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe Londoner Sonnie Hale was the second husband of the musical comedy star Jessie Matthews. His father Robert Hale worked in pantomime and musical comedy, and his sister Binnie Hale established herself on the stage before Sonnie Hale played his first West End role in the chorus of the revue Fun of the Fayre at the London Pavilion (1921). Sonnie Hale became one of the favourite stars of the West End in the 1920s, featuring as a light comedian in numerous musical comedies including This Year of Grace (1928), Wake Up and Dream (1929), and Ever Green (1930).  This production of  The Perfect Woman went on tour after its London run at the Playhouse Theatre which opened in September 1948.",
