Its staple products were water vessels made of a fine white clay made even whiter and more porous by the addition of salt. Their decoration is either slip-trailed or created with tools. Juan Fernandez and Antonio Jimenez, whose stamps appear on some of the La Rambla pots in the museum's collection, were just two of the many potters working in La Rambla in the mid 19th century. The principal decorative motifs on these pieces are mostly vegetal, consisting of floral sprays combined with flower-heads, sometimes a kind of sunflower and leaves filled with lattice-work. Minor motifs include twisted spirals, squiggles, S-scrolls and dots, all typical of the slip-trailed technique.",
