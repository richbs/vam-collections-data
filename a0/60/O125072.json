A strong box, such as the present example, would have been used to hold and protect valuable items - jewellery, money, letters or documents. The Lady and the Unicorn tapestry, an object of contemporary date to the casket, shows a similarly sized container, also with an arched lid, being used to store jewellery. In an age before banks, iron caskets, being strong, heavy and relatively fire proof were popular as \"safe\" boxes, some like the present example were in the form of a miniature imitation of the larger chests which stored household items. A great many caskets were destroyed when they had gone out of style or after their owners had died. The present example is therefore fortunate to have survived and retain a relatively sound condition.",
