It can be used to produce three-dimensional elements by use of careful shading. Petit-point is a small diagonal stitch at a 45 degree angle that crosses over the intersection of one horizontal and one vertical thread on a needlepoint canvas. The designs in the album are mounted or drawn on 366 pages of alternate leaves of white wove and blue-toned paper, some with watermarks dated between 1829 and 1834. The album is quarter-bound in leather with cloth boards simulating watered silk and is signed and dated in ink on page 1 'S. Bland. St Leonards. 1836'. The designs are inscribed in ink throughout with notes, and with dates ranging from 1836 to 1854.\n\nBland's collection included her own botanically accurate designs, simplified patterns from accurate botanical observation, patterns traced from magazines, commercial, printed Berlin wool work patterns, gifts of patterns, including commercial ones from friends and relatives. The gift of designs demonstrates connections between relatives of merchant and banking families and is of historical significance in bonding such families. Women tended to work as amateurs rather than professional embroiderers which is problematic as amateur work is often regarded as being less significant. Men tended to be recorded as professional embroiderers of drawn patterns",
