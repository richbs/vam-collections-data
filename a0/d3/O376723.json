Electrotypes were produced as copies of renowned objects in public and private collections so that the design and workmanship of the original could be admired and studied by a wide and varied audience. A number of museums agreed that their collections could be copied, amongst them the Musee du Louvre, and the South Kensington Museum. The firm of Christofle in Paris produced electrotypes of originals at the Musee du Louvre, and many of these electrotypes were purchased by the South Kensington Museum.\nAs with all electrotypes of original objects, the principal mechanical differences are those of the method of fabrication and the materials used. In this electrotype, wax is used to form the coloured background and imitate the champleve enamelling of the original ciborium. It is thought wax was used as it did not require high temperatures for its applicatoin.",
