Falstaff was a popular character in the original productions of Shakespeare's plays, and the productions of the Henry plays at both Drury Lane and Covent Garden in the 18th century had helped re-establish the play as a popular favourite.\n\nThis late 18th century or early 19th century jar was made at Robert Chamberlain's factory in Worcester.  Chamberlain (1737-1798) was an apprentice at Dr Wall's Worcester Porcelain factory and by the 1770s was probably overseeing decoration and gilding of Worcester porcelain. His son joined him at the Worcester factory but after John Flight bought the factory in 1783, the Chamberlains established their own decorating establishment. At first they decorated wares made by other factories but by 1791 or 1792 they were producing their own porcelain wares and the company's reputation increased rapidly. In 1796 they made a dessert service for the Prince of Orange; Lord Nelson placed a large order in 1802, and in 1807 they produced wares for the Prince of Wales who allowed them to style themselves: 'Porcelain Manufacturers to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales'. The company flourished into the 19th century, joining the original Worcester Porcelain company in the 1840s.",
