            "public_access_description": "A pencil and watercolour sketch of a costume for Anne in Richard of Bordeaux. The dress, though medieval in style, is strongly influenced by the fashions and silhouette of the 1930s. It is pale green in colour with a repeated motif of pale blue leaves and has a long, sweeping train. The long, hanging, sleeves are turned back to reveal the white lining. She also wears a pale green and white headdress with a white veil at the rear and a large white and green necklace. \n\nThe dress was designed in 1933 for the actress Dame Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies (1891-1992) to wear in Act I, Scene II of the play Richard of Bordeaux in which she played Anne of Bohemia. The sketch is signed Motley, which was the working name of a trio of stage designers Elizabeth Montgomery, Sophia Harris, and Margaret Harris.\n\nRichard of Bordeaux written by Gordon Daviot (pseudonym for Elizabeth Macintosh) depicts a romanticised version of the story of Richard II of England, emphasizing the relationship between Richard and his queen Anne of Bohemia. It was first staged in 1932 when it was given two performances at the New Theatre, then was revived at the same theatre in the following year, where it ran for 463 performances. John Gielgud starred as Richard.",
