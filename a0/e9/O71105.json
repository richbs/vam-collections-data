At that time experts thought that they had been made in England in about 1780-1800. This was because their design matched English metalwork of that period.  However, experts also thought that some of the decoration was out of character, which suggested that the candelabra had a non-European origin.  The idea that the candelabra were made in India was only accepted after 1964. At this time V&A curators learned of a piece in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This piece was similar in style to the candelabra and curators knew that it had been made in British India in about 1780-1800.",
