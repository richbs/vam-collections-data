They were mainly worn by urban women, rather than tribal people.  They were originally always worn in pairs, one on each wrist, and in some places were regarded as the mark of a married woman.  They were worn by Christian and Jewish women, as well as Muslims.\n\nThe earliest had solid metal clasps, but filigree clasps, either applied to sheet metal, like this, or of open filigree, became immensely popular with tourists in the 19th century, and are still being made in the region today.",
