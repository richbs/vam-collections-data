These statuettes were identified by Margaret Whinney as those formerly in the Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth, Grove End Road, London.\nOn acquisition this statuette and its companion figure were thought to be by Rysbrack. They are now to be known as cast after a model by Rysbrack of about 1743. This present piece is cast by L. Genneau in ca. 1850.\nIn the late 1740s Rysbrack produced models of some earlier Flemish artists, including the  the present Rubens, Van Dyck, and Duquesnoy. These seem to have been reproduced in plaster and lead during Rysbrack's lifetime. This bronze version however almost certainly dates from the 19th century.\n\nRysbrack (1694-1770) was born in Antwerp, and trained in the Netherlands, but spent his working life in Britain. He was one of the most important sculptors active in this country in the first half of the 18th century, and specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments. Although he never visited Italy, many of his works are clearly indebted to classical archetypes. His terracotta models are particularly fine, and are often virtually finished pieces in their own right.",

These statuettes were identified by Margaret Whinney as those formerly in the Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth, Grove End Road, London. The pair of bronzes were included in Christie, London, 24 November 1955, lot 15.\n\nHistorical significance: On acquisition this statuette and its companion figure were thought to be by Rysbrack. They are now to be known as cast after a model by Rysbrack. This present piece is definitely cast by L. Genneau, while the other is possibly cast by the latter.\nThe Rubens - the present piece - is the more highly finished of the two figures. The Van Dyck lacks inscription and signature, the eye pupils are left blank, and the coverlet is plain and not embroidered.",
