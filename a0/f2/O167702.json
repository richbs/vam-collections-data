She encloses sketches and dimensions and enquires as to their value with an eye to selling them to the Museum.\n\n28 November 1933 Minute of Ralph Edwards\nreports on his inspection of the carvings.  He dates them from the middle of the 16th century.  Though the carving is crude, he finds the animal decoration and the painting \"of considerable interest\" and \"unlike anything in our collections\".  He imagines they formed part of an exterior scheme of wall decoration.\n\n2 December 1933 H C Smith Minute \ndescribes the 4 panels as from the period of Henry VIII.  Though somewhat crude in execution \"they have a strangely marked character which gives them a certain air of distinction\".  The Royal arms of Henry VIII  and the private \"coat\" (as yet unidentified) add to their interest.\n\n5\tDecember 1933 Brackett Minute\nReports on the observations of Professor Tristram's assistant who said \"that the painting is undoubtedly original and, although extremely dirty, would come out quite bright when cleaned\".\n\nAs Miss Legge is in very reduced circumstances it is proposed that the Musem offer her more than the \u00a35 she is willing to sell them for.  (In the end they are bought for \u00a37.)\n\n26 February 1934 V & A research (CM query - does this relate to W.30 or another, W.29, 31 or 32??)\nshows that according to Papworth the impaled coat on the carvings should be described as:\nArms of Kiffen (including the lion rampant counterchanged of Einion Efell, Lord of Cynllaeth, lving 118(?) - 91, son of Madoc, last Prince of Powys Fadoc).\n\n27 January 1934 letter Maclagan (Christchurch, Oxford) to Clifford Smith\nlists several possibilities for the indentity of the Kyffin family bearing the coat-of-arms on the panel.  One possibility is Sir David Kyffin (Canon of St. Asapl's in 1537) a noted pluralist.  He had a son Maurice who built Maenam Hall apparently noted for \"quaint heraldic carvings\".  Maclagan speculates that perhaps \"Sir David, the Canon, was the owner of the two pieces of wood in question, and that he commemorated the marriage of his ancestor in 1230 by impaling the two coats instead quartering them as he himself did\u2026\"  He further speculates that \"perhaps the two pieces of painted wood were abandoned by the Kyffins on moving into Maenam Hall when it was built\".",
