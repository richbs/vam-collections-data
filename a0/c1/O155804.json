            "physical_description": "Cover of plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in chain, straight and running stitches, padded and quilted, backed with roller printed plain weave cotton, with an added silk fringe.\nA wide border surrounds all 4 sides of the central area.  The latter being patterned with a large lobed octagonal medallion outlined in green with white [faded from pink] 'beads' except one one lobe which has red 'beads'.  Four lobes terminate in green and red 'spears', with the other 4 are surmounted by a red bird edged in green.  This frames a star formation of 4 oval blossoms alternating with 4 5-petalled bud forms, again in red with green leaves and stems.  The latter join to form an 8-pointed star in green which in turn frames a red rosette with 8 green radiating bars.\nThe rest of the central space, save the 4 corner units, is decorated with scattered repeats of a simple flowering plant with curving stem, all pointing to the lateral axis.\nThe 4 corner units are contained in a trilobed frame in green with white or red 'beads' surmounted by a green and red spear flanked either side by a bud [red and green with occasional pink details].  Within this frame is a 5-petalled bud and two and a half oval blossoms in the same colouring.\nThe wide border is edged either side with a narrow band of small continuous arches in green chain stitch each containing a small 5-petalled flower head in red pointing outwards; the outline band is in grey chain stitch.  Between these 2 bands is a meander stem in green and yellow bearing larger and small red leaf forms.\nAll except where mentioned is worked in straight stitches.  The background is quilted with small irregular lozenge forms in white silk done after the rest of the embroidery.\nSome underdrawing is visible.\nThreads: 2S silk: white faded from pink, grey, green; red [unplied Z twist]\nBacking: light-weight cotton, pieced; light green ground with a diagonal brown stem meander holding pink and white roses and buds with dark green leaves - resist white for rose heads and buds; probably European.\n\nThere is an added fringe of green silk.",
