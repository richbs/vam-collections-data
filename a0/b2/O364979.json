The foreground is shown as a richly furnished interior with an elaborately swagged curtain above, but the scene opens out behind the figures to the open air, where in the distant landscape, a party is sledging on the frozen river.

An elegant lady warms herself by a roaring fire, surrounded with objects showing her wealth and good taste, while her servant brings her cakes; outside skaters and sledgers cross a frozen river. Flemish tapestries like this, with figurative subjects making no allusion to political, historical or religious themes but chosen simply for their highly decorative qualities, were very popular in the later 17th century.",
