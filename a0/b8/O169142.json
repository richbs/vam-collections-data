Using concrete poetry as a kind of springboard Houedard developed a way of making more purely abstract or pictorial images with the typewriter keys.\n\nJiriki and Tariki are Japanese words expressing aspects of  Buddhist faith:  Jiriki means 'self-power' and Tariki means 'other power'. While Jiriki is the finite power of man, Tariki is the infinite power of the Buddha.  Houedard pictures a mix of self belief and religious faith by inter-weaving the letters of the words themselves.\n\nThis is one of a number of so called typestracts by Houedard in the museum\u2019s collection. Some contain a legible arrangement of words, others are abstract, often resembling the drawings of the Russian Constructivists.",
