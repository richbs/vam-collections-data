Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Sloan, Washington D.C., 6 February 1977, lot 1340.\n\nHistorical significance: These panels are attributed to Cesare Aguatti by comparison with his documented mosaics in the entrance hall known as the Hall of Emperors of the Villa Borghese commissioned by Prince Marcantonio Borghese. \nCesare Aguatti was active in Rome during the last half of the 18th century. At the Vatican Mosaic Workshop he worked under Giovanni Angelo Braschi, Pius VI (r.1775-9). One of the earliest mosaicists to work in miniature, he was among the first to use tiny spun smalti. \n\nHe also worked on the restoration of the floors of the Baths of Otricoli in the Rotunda of the Pio-Clementine Museum. Mantelpieces by him survive in the Louvre, Paris and at Penrice Castle, Glamorgan, Wales.",
