            "public_access_description": "The mask is carved from a single piece of Japanese cypress (hinoki) with details painted over gesso (J. gofun). The yellow-brown colour and the anguished features of the mask are executed in the style of older masks but the features of this particular mask vary quite considerably from traditional conventions for this character. Yorimasa had entered the priesthood and was of advanced age when he died, this mask appears to be of a younger character. The mask traditionally has white eyebrows with details in fine black ink (J. sumi) which are drawn from the centre of the eyes out and downwards past the eye and onto the upper cheekbones. This mask has distinctly dark eyebrows which are drawn upwards and out. The mouth is turned slightly downwards as opposed to back and up, although the teeth (painted gold and highlighted in black) which are visible through the deep red drawn back lips are correct. There are too few lines of anguish carved onto the face - traditionally there would be more lines around the mouth, cheeks and eyes. The nose is rather full and the eyes are wide and staring rather than displaying the narrowed pained expression one would expect for this character. The eyes are painted red with details in sumi with a gilded metal disk inserted in the centre of the eyeball. The hair stubble has been rather hastily applied in sumi to the chin and temples. \n\nThe interior of the mask has been stained a warm reddish brown colour with the chisel marks remaining, but sanded down. Viewed from the inside, the mask gives the appearance of having been carved off-centre - the chin (from the inside) appears to slant to the left. There is some evidence of wear to the cord-holes which indicates that the mask has most likely been used.",
