The many techniques deployed included underglaze painting, coloured glazes and lustre, which was revived after 1650.\n\nSafavid potters created brilliantly coloured ceramics. The effect was often achieved with glazes of a single colour. Many of these wares have moulded or carved decoration, such as the decoration incised into the body of this bowl.",

It is usually decorated with incised or pierced patterns in the white body, occasionally with carving through a pale celadon wash, and very rarely with underglaze painting.  Gombroon is the European name for Bandar-e Abbas, the main trading port on the Persian Gulf.\n\n'The refinement of the ware sets it apart from all others of the Safavid period, and prompts the idea that it is probably of later date - perhaps reflecting the same tendencies as the fragile 'eggshell' porcelain of the  .....new porcelain factories of Europe... These delicate white wares form the only Persian class we know that would have been likely to appeal to sophisticated European taste about the middle of the 18th century' (quote from Arthur Lane: Later Islamic Pottery, pp. 110).",
