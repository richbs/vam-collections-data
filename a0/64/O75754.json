Kennedy to the Director: 'We are frequently asked for specimens of good incised lettering in stone, and are generally able to meet the request by recourse to casts and photographs. The lettering such as that on the tomb of Henry VII affords an admirable model but it would be useful I think to have a few specimens of good modern lettering as well.'",
