It shows a romantic image of a woman cutting flowers, surrounded by foliage. Toussaint was primarily a painter, but when he created this image he achieved instant recognition in the field of poster design. The colours are soft and glowing, and the lines have the flowing quality typical of Art Nouveau imagery. Le Sillon is French for furrow, and the image symbolises the aims and expression of a young artist making his mark.",
