            "public_access_description": "The goldsmith Hafez Muhammad Multani made this throne for Maharaja Ranjit Singh, probably in 1820-1830. It shows clearly the splendour of Ranjit Singh's court. In Europe, royal furniture is usually simply gilded, which creates the effect of gold without incurring the cost. However, in India the reverse is true, and thrones are decorated with richly worked sheets of gold. \nThe distinctive cusped base of this throne is composed of two tiers of lotus petals. The lotus is a symbol of purity and creation and has traditionally been used as a seat or throne for Hindu gods. However, the octagonal (eight-sided) shape of the throne is based on courtly furniture of the Mughals. Their many-sided furniture provided models for thrones, footstools and tables throughout northern India.",

The throne is traditionally associated with Lahore, where it was found in 1849 after the British annexed the Punjab and took over the royal treasury. TheGovernor-General, Lord Dalhousie, was not sure if the throne would be wanted in Britain, writing to London 'It is set apart as an object which the court [of the East India Company] would probably desire to preserve, but as it is bulky, I shall not forward it until I receive orders to do so'. The Company did wish to preserve it, and in 1853 the throne travelled to Calcutta (where Dalhousie had a wooden replica made) before it was shipped to the Indian Museum in London. In 1879, Ranjit Singh's Golden Throne moved to the South Kensington Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum., where it has remained ever since.\n\nJackson, Anna and Jaffer, Amin (eds), with Deepika Ahlawat.
