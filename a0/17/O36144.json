The whole is cast in two halves down the length and held\ntogether by tongue and slot joints. It is lithographed tinplate showing a pale bluish and white mule with yellow; dark blue; red and white trim and a clown in red; yellow; blue and white. The whole is designed to be comic. The clockwork mechanism is housed inside the body and covered with a metal plate cut out to allow the front legs to move. The back legs are a separate cast pinned to the plate by tongue and slot joints. The integral key protrudes from the body at the left flank and when wound; only the front legs move causing the whole to hop along. This is a development from the earlier versions when both sets of legs moved. *This model is probably earlier than B122 and B123 -1994 as the style of trademark and the overall visual effect looks older.",
