In the early 1960s the Austrians, Suzanne Wenger and Ulli Beier, wishing both to learn and teach, set up workshops in Oshogbo, in the predominantly Yoruba region of Nigeria.

The artwork was created by linocut printed onto soft handmade paper producing a highly textured surface.\n\nOdunlade emerged as one of the leading figures in the resurgence of traditional African art that came out of Oshogbo, Nigeria, in the late 1960s. As a visual artist he works across different media, including in paint, print, batik and fibre work. Odunlade is also an accomplished musician on the flute, Agidigbo (Mbira) and Congas. He manages his own music and dance troupe and has several record albums to his name.",
