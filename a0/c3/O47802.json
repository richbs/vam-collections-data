Though it is not clear to researchers yet, the artist has drawn on either Burmese legends or the Jataka stories, which chronicle the Buddha\u2019s former lives, for his subject. The appliqu\u00e9 design is worked in shaped coloured and silver-gilt textiles, sequins, with wool and silver-gilt thread stitch work on a black velvet ground.  \n\nThe costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay Court of about 1880. Kalagas, which could be used as decorative wall hangings, room partitions, or hung outside the house on festive occasions,  grew in popularity from the mid 19th century in Burma--particularly after 1885, when the kingdom came under British rule. This kalaga was collected by the donor's husband while he served as a medical officer in Burma with the British army in the early 20th century.",
