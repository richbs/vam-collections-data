There are seams down each side of the garment, with side-splits at the bottom. \n\nThe body of the smock is made of six panels: two for the back, two for the front and one for each sleeve. Side and back-seams are simply over stitched selvedges; the sleeve seams are double-felled with underarm gussets of loosely woven green fabric. The hems of the sleeves are finished with a line of cream-pulled work linen. \n\nThe jacket is embroidered with stylised flowers and trees in the style of Balkan peasant embroiderers. The embroidery runs down both fronts of the smock, across the shoulders and around the sleeve hems. The front edge of the garment is blanket stitched in yellow silk with pulled work in cream linen. The embroidery stitches are in long, short and feather stitch.",
