Materials such as serpentine marble and coconut shell were enhanced with silver or silver-gilt mounts for display. Objects within the 'cabinet of curiosities' were primarily objects of delight rather than of use, although they were often made in functional forms. By 1600, every prince aspired to such a collection. This concentration of wealth and artistry was intended to express the ancient lineage, power and connoisseurship of the patron's family.\n\nLittle is known about the production and marketing of mounted vessels made from exotic natural materials, although it can be assumed that certain goldsmiths specialised in the field. Serpentine marble was mined in Northern Germany, so it is possible that this tankard was mounted there. Serpentine was believed to have miraculous powers to protect against poison.",

The widespread passion for collecting and mounting marvels of nature and craftsmanship would have provided goldsmiths with a steady source of patronage from the 15th century onwards. \n\nSerpentine marble was mined in Northern Germany, so it is possible that this tankard was mounted there. Serpentine was believed to have miraculous powers to protect against poison.",

By 1600, every prince aspired to such a collection. This concentration of wealth and artistry was intended to express the ancient lineage, power and connoisseurship of the patron's family. Objects within the 'cabinet of curiosities' were primarily objects of delight rather than of use, although they were often made in functional forms.",
