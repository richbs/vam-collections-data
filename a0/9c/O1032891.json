Instead of pursuing portraiture, he turned his camera on British pastoral life in the 1850s.\n\nAlthough he shared Turner's affinity for rustic subject matter, Sherlock chose to depict the people who lived and worked in the countryside, while Turner kept his rural landscapes largely devoid of humans. Like his reputation, many of Sherlock's prints have faded over the years, probably because he did not rinse them thoroughly enough.
