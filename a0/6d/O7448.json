[Letter to J. D. Johnston, June 25, 1924 (Royal Photographic Society, Bath)] But what did he see in it? Was it the wit of the relation between the light of the sun and man's feeble imitation of it, by gaslight? Was it the great arrowhead of light formed by two planes plunging in reverse perspective down right? Did Stieglitz note the significance of the two steps rising to a door in relation to the barred window?

It is constructed on the telephoto principle with a variable focal length of from 8 to 45 inches. Of course it is not a rapid lens when the bellows is extended about a yard but it is much more rapid than the needle hole and you can see your image. the quality is all that could be desired, and i got a thing of the Tower Bridge from the middle of London Bridge, a distance of nearly half a mile.\nNaef, Weston. <font -u>The Collection of Alfred Stieglitz</font>, Metropolitan Museum of Art / The Viking Press, New York, 1978, No. 124",
