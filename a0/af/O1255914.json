He became manager of the Lyceum Theatre in 1878 and continued to run the theatre until his death in 1905. In 1895 he became the first actor to be knighted for services to the theatre. \n\nIrving staged a production of The Dead Heart by Watts Phillips at the Lyceum Theatre in 1889 in which he played the role of Robert Landry. This drawing was probably made as an illustration for one of the contemporary periodicals as there are details of the print size on the reverse.\n\n\n\n\n",
