Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this example. \nIn 1543 the Portuguese arrived in Japan. They were followed by the Spanish, Dutch and English. The Japanese became fascinated by Europeans. Their physical appearance, their clothes, their customs, the things they used and the way they lived all appealed to the Japanese people. \nIn the 18th century, Japanese craftsmen made netsuke in the form of standing European figures. Many of them were shown holding an animal, like this Dutchman with a dog. The Dutchman's eyes and nose are exaggerated. These netsuke were made at a time when Japan was virtually closed to Europeans. The netsuke carvers seem to have based their European faces on a type of doll known as Saga ningyo (Saga doll). The other source was prints and paintings of foreigners produced in Nagasaki.",
