The outer silk has a green ground with a pattern in gold and silver thread and coloured silks with two large vases, an archway, a bird, a fountain in a park and a small building in red and yellow silks. A vase in one repeat is brocaded in red and yellow silk. Bizarre garden grounded green, and orphrey pale blue.\n\nThe silk forming the orphrey has a sky blue ground brocaded in silver gilt thread with a more abstract and, possibly earlier, Bizarre silk design. The most obvious features are three superimposed square panels with 'trees' growing from them and some bulbous and geometric shapes linked by a floral stem.\n\nRepeat: Green ground silk: height 34.375 inches and width 9.5 inches visible. This silk is at least 19 inches wide.\n\nRepeat: Blue ground silk: height 28.75 inches and width only 6.375 inches visible.\n\nThere is a silver braid round the chasuble and a different one used to edge the orphrey and delineate the 'hood'.\n\nBoth silks have a complex structure using very high quality gold and silver thread.\n\nThe green silk: Tissue (lampas), damask ground brocaded in silver and silver-gilt thread (file and frise) and coloured silks. The pattern is bound in 3/1 twill with a binding warp taken from the ground warp. The metal threads are used in paired shoots.\n\nThe blue silk: Tissue (lampas), damask ground brocaded in silver-gilt thread used in paired shoots, file and frise. Only a very small amount of pink silk is used for a few details. The pattern is bound in 3/1 twill with one of two binding warps. A pink separate binding warp used for the silk details and a pale blue one taken from the ground warp to bind the metal threads.\n\nThe chasuble has retained its original glazed linen lining and buckram interlining.",

The comparable designs from 1707 are VS. 5, 13 (both 'flowered satins'), 35 ('drawn from one of Mr Baudewine's') and 40 (with the name 'M. Baudewine'), 41 an 'orrace tissue' and 29 ca. 1707. In 1708 the most comparable designed are 38 an 'orrace tissue', 45, 54, 19 (all 'orrace tissues' with 'gold and silk brocade' or 'flush and brocade' - or stuck down and difficult to read) and 77, a damask with 'flush and brocade'. There are thus eleven designs similar both in style and in their technique.",
