It comprises two pieces, one cover for the chair back, wings and arms, and one cover for the cushion.\n[Chair cover] Cover for the chair back, wings and arms. The inside back, inside and outside of sides and wings, and the front edge are of unlined linen embroidered in silk. The cover also has an outside-back panel and wing panels of glazed watered yellow worsted. It fastens with hooks and eyes down the centre back, and has eyelet holes down the inside edges of the embroidered back and wings. The eyelet holes have remains of linen tape. There is also a short linen tape attaching a ring on both outer sides, at the bottom edge towards the front.\n\nThe embroidered decoration is worked with yellow, red and a little blue, russet and cream silk in back, padded buttonhole, chain, satin, stem and overcast stitches. There is an all-over pattern of open medallions formed of interlaced strapwork lines with solid leaf decoration. In the centres and in the outer spaces are sprigs of carnations, roses, daisies and other flowers. Round the edge is a scalloped border containing stylized sprigs of flowers in red. Underdrawing is visible in some places which were left unembroidered.\n\nIn the centre of the inside back, there is a coat of arms, and a crest above with a beast's head.\n[Cushion cover] Shaped cushion cover of embroidered linen at the top and sides. It has a glazed watered yellow worsted on the underside, and a fastening with linen ties at the back.  The edges of the cover are bound with yellow silk and worsted braid in a diaper pattern.",
