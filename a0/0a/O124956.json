Followed his father's career 1833-36, when he first exhibited at the SBA and became a professional artist. It seems he failed to enter the RA Schools, but took lessons in colouring from George Lance; otherwise he was self-taught. Exhibited 55 works at the RA between 1838 and 1897, 40 at the BI 1837-67, and 23 (including three watercolours) at the SBA. Most were historical or literary subjects. Elected ARA 1872, RA 1876. He was more active as a watercolourist, exhibiting 260 works at the OWS, elected Associate 1852, Member 1854, and President 1871. He was knighted in 1872. In 1884 he refused to sell any more work, and in 1893 gave pictures to the municipal galleries of London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester, for which gift he became the first artist to receive the Freedom of the City of London. He was equally well-known as an illustrator and was extremely prolific; it is estimated he illustrated 150 books (most notably the Howard Staunton edition of Shakespeare (1860) for which he designed 829 illustrations) and magazines, particularly the <i>Illustrated London News</i> for which he is supposed to have produced 30,000 plates. He died at Blackheath 5 October 1897. \n\n\tLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 9 October 1897, pp494-5 (obit); R Davies 'Sir John Gilbert', <i>OWS X</i> (1933) pp 20-43 \n\n<b>Don Quixote Disputing with the Priest and the Barber</b> \n1856-1900 Neg V1935 \nCanvas, 71 x 90.8 cm (28 x 35\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'J Gilbert 1844' bl \nH S Ashbee Bequest 1900 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1844, it was hung in a room with drawings and miniatures, and the <i>Art Union</i> commented that 'It is too bad to see here a work that would do honour to many an artist who \"sits in judgement\". Mr Gilbert has produced pictures that would put to shame half the contents of the Exhibition, if so placed as to be appreciated'.\n \nThe full title given in the catalogue was 'Don Quixote disputing with the priest and the barber the merits of the great knights errant of antiquity. <i>Don Quixote</i>, book 1, chap. 1'. The relevant episode is in the first part of Cervantes's novel: \n\nHe had frequent disputes with the priest of his village (who was a learned person and had taken his degrees in Siguenza), which of the two was the better knight, Palmerin of England, or Amadis of Gaul. But master Nicholas, barber-surgeon of the same town, affirmed, that none ever came up to the knight of the sun; and that if anyone could be compared to him, it was Don Galaor, brother of Amadis de Gaul'. \n\nGilbert frequently returned to Cervantes's novel for inspiration, exhibiting six other Don Quixote subjects at the RA, and six at the BI; see also 'Don Quixote and Sancho Panza' (1825-1900, above). Three watercolours of Don Quixote subjects are also in the V&A collections. He designed illustrations for an edition of jarvis's translation of <i>Don Quixote</i> first published in 1856. \n\nEXH: RA 1844 (948) \n\nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1844, p161\"",
