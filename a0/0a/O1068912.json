Payne and the Rev. Ernest A. Payne, D.D. \n\n<i>Note:</i> This sand-picture is based either on the oil-painting of the subject by West, now in the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut, or on the engraving of it by William Sharp, published in 1788.  Wm. Burrough Hill's collection of sand-pictures by Zobel contained one of this subject (no.2 in his Inventory of a collection of Sand Pictures by Zobel, <i>A Lost Art</i>, Southampton 1913). \nOn the back of the millboard of P.7-1953 another sand-picture is laid in: it represents a farm-cart with three horses and figures, of the Morland type.  The main forms of the composition are in low relief (apparently built up with sand), and outlined in monochrome: the sky is sketchily painted in oil.\"",
