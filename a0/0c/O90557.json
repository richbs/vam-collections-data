Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy yet bulky enough to do the job. They were made in a variety of forms, this one being an example of the manju type, named after a kind of rounded, sweet dumpling filled with bean paste that it loosely resembles in shape. The compact forms of manju netsuke made them ideal for wearing next to the body. They were either solid or consisted of two pieces, generally in the form of hollowed-out halves, as in this example, which is in the form of a Japanese football that separates into two. The suspension cords passed through a hole drilled in the middle of the back and were then attached to a ring on the inside of the upper half. \n\nThis netsuke is decorated with guri lacquer. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua, which grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material. The craft of lacquering is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. Guri (bent ring) lacquer involves superimposing many layers of different-coloured lacquer in a particular order. The surface is then carved with characteristic curved and spiral patterns. The cuts are U-shaped or V- shaped in cross-section, showing off the sequence of coloured layers.",
