It is made of moulded porcelain and is decorated in a style known as Fahua or 'Cloisonn\u00e9-style decoration'. The design was outlined using thick slip and once dry the slip lines were then filled in with enamels using a palette consisting of dark blue, turquoise, yellow and green. The slip lines contained the enamels within the outlined areas during firing and the fired enamels which became unctuous and shiny gave a jewel like appearance to the decoration. The enamels were applied directly to what is known as the biscuit or unfired ceramic body. This technique was first seen on northern tiles in the 13th and 14th centuries and then on a variety of vessels and decorative ceramic wares made in Jingdezhen in the 15th and 16th centuries.",
