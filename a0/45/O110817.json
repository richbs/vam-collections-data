The mostly male audience sits on benches at two long wooden tables to the left and right of the stage.  In the foreground, right, there is the edge of an empty table.  The gas mantles are seen hanging down from the ceiling, top centre, above the scene.  The washes of colour are very pale and the area to the right of the small podium, at the back, appears unfinished.  The outline head of an audience member is not complete.",

Cruikshank worked in his father's studio and was a talented artist from an early age. He became a prolific artist of political cartoons after 1808 but despite his success in this field, from the 1820s onwards he became more involved in book illustration.  His best-known illustration was probably that for Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, first published in journal form in 1837. \n\nGeorge Cruikshank loved the theatre.  In the 1840s he was a member of Charles Dickens' amateur theatre company, and this delicately coloured pencil and wash drawing is a view of vocal enterntainment in a tavern, probably in about 1845.  From performances such as these in taverns, the idea of dedicated 'song and supper rooms' in taverns grew, and eventually the hugely successful 19th century music halls.",
