            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 221, 223, 224\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\u201cThis is a companion piece, in size and handling, to No. 375 [1249-1888] and Shirley (L. ed. S., p. 326) suggests that it may be a study for \u2018The Valley Farm\u2019.  This it seems not to be, unless Constable took hints from it in inventing the ramification for the added corwn of the tree in the right foreground of the exhibited picture.  It is, however, as has been pointed out by Mr. John R. Ovane, similar in all but some details of the lower branches to the tree in the left foreground of \u2018Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows\u2019.  Since the paintings was exhibited in 1831, and the paper on which No. 376 is drawn is watermarked 1833, this drawing was evidently copied from the exhibited oil or a sketch for it, probably for use in his lectures.  In the drawings a notice is nailed to the tree, of which the last word can be read as \u2018\u2026Law\u2019 [possibly \u2018Against the Law\u2019] and a mother and child are seated below it.  It is interesting to compare these features with Leslie\u2019s account of Constable\u2019s last lecture delivered at Hampstead on 25 July 1836 (L. ed. S., pp. 406 and 407): \u201cConstable then gave some practical rules for drawing from nature, and showed some beautiful studies of trees.  One, a tall and elegant ash, of which he said \u2018 many of my Hampstead friends my remember this <i>young lady</i> at the entrance to the village.  Her fate was distressing, for it is scarcely too much to say that she died of a broken heart.  I made this drawing when she was in full health and beauty; on passing some time afterwards, I saw, to my grief, that a wretched board had been nailed to her side, on which was written in large letters, \u201c<i>All vagrants and beggars will be dealt with according to the law</i>\u201d.  The tree seemed to have felt the disgrace, for even then some of the top branches had withered.  Two long spike nails had been driven far into her side.  In another year on half became paralysed, and not long after the other shared this same fate, and this beautiful creature was cut down to a stump, just high enough to hold the board\u2019\u201d.  No. 376 [1248-1888] clearly falls in with this train of ideas; but it does not exactly tally with Constable\u2019s description to his lecture audience, since it shows a tree after a board has been nailed on to it.  The general coincidence of particulars strongly suggests that it does not represent the tree of which he was speaking, and is therefore based on an ash at Hampstead.  Since No. 375 [1249-1888] is a companion piece to No. 376 [1248-1888], it may in that event also represent a Hampstead tree, but this does not necessarily follow.  In any even, No. 375 [1249-1888] must have been in existence in 1835 to have been used in the painting of \u2018The Valley Farm.\u2019\u201d\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
