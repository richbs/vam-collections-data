The following is the full text of the entry: MARATTA,CARLO (1625-1713) 740 The artist receiving the Order of Christ from Pope Clement XI or Cardinal Acciaioli. In the upper left corner a similar scene is roughly sketched in a small rectangle measuring 3 1/2 x 3 in. Inscribed on the mount in an 18th century hand 'Carlo Maratti' Black chalk 9 3/4 x 7 (248 x 177) Dyce 221 PROVENANCE J. Richardson, Jr (Lugt 2170); Sir J. Reynolds (Lugt 2364); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE Dyce Catalogue no. 221 (as 'anonymous ascribed to Maratti') A more evolved and detailed drawing of the same subject is in the Berlin-Dahlem Kupferstichkabinett and was shown there in the exhibition Romische Barockzeichnungen, 1969 (no. 131 in the Catalogue, and pI. 75). It is suggested in the catalogue that the kneeling man is Maratta, recognisable from a self portrait in the Diisseldorf Kunstmuseum: that the seated man is Pope Clement XI, recognisable from his dress and from the finials of his chair back which represent an Albani emblem: and that the female figure introducing the kneeling artist to his patron is Pictura, recognisable from the mask on the chain round her neck. The event celebrated, according to the Berlin catalogue, is Maratta receiving the Order of Christ from Cardinal Acciaioli, the Pope's representative, on the Capitol on 24 April 1704. The Pope himself did not attend the ceremony, but Maratta put him into the Berlin drawing doubtless to show that the Pope was the fount of an honour which Maratta valued highly. There is nothing in our drawing to show that the seated figure was a Pope: it might have been Cardinal Acciaioli: but there are several details to show that the drawing is a preliminary sketch for a picture of the same subject. The corner of the table visible on the left, with a bell on it: the position of the dais and the chair: the frontal pose of the seated figure and the profile view of the kneeling figure, with the female figure behind in a pose which clearly shows her to be introducing the kneeling man to his superior: these points of resemblance prove that the two drawings represent the same subject, ours being much the roughest and sketchiest, doubtless the first idea. The small preliminary sketch in the corner, showing the same scene again, is typical of Maratta's way of working out a composition.",
