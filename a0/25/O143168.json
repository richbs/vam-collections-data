She challenged the formality and complexity of the fashions of the time, and was critical of designers such as Christian Dior (1905-57). Pat Cunningham, editor of Vogue said, \u2018Femininity had gone too far \u2013 you needed stage-coach luggage to pack your frocks in and ladies\u2019 maids to fix the trimmings and petticoats. Chanel simplified clothes to meet modern needs.\u2019 \n\nThis practical, elegant suit is typical of the type of designs that propelled Chanel once again to the forefront of fashion.  The top is made of a comfortable wool jersey, and the jacket is loose fitting.\n\nThe suit was worn by the 1950s model Anne Gunning Parker (later Lady Nutting).",
