The body of the vessel is formed as a circular drum from two die stamped circular halves, joined by a folded over seam, internally.  Each side panel is embellished with three concentric mouldings.  The teapot is stabilised by a flat strip of silver, the edges slightly tapered, attached at an angle to the front.  The bottom edge of the handle stabilises the vessel at the rear.  The handle is of kingwood, square in cross section and curved to the same radius as the vessel.  It is attached to the body by a flat strip of silver at either end in the form of a T shaped section and secured by a pin.  The opposite end of the connecting strip is perpendicular to the curved wall.  The spout of the teapot is a tapered cylinder, attached to the front.\n[Lid for hot water jug (from a tea service)] The lid is a curved strip of silver which follows the radius of the body.  It is retained by an internal flange and an additional angled flange at the back which fits under the edge of the mouth of the body, so that the lid does not tilt forward as the vessel is poured.  The kingwood knop is an inverted triangle, attached to the lid by a pin through its centre and retained on the underside of the lid by a circular, threaded nut.",

An illustration of the service appeared in Design for Today (London, 1934). The following description is an extract from the commentary. \n\n\u2018We illustrate a tea set designed by H.G. Murphy\u2026which won the highest award at the Milan Exhibition of 1933. The design may at first sight seem deliberately eccentric, but its shape is in fact dictated by the method of machine manufacture. It cost \u00a320, which we understand is much less than a corresponding set manufactured by old methods would cost. The lids lift off completely thus dispensing with hinges which must be hand-made. The hand can be inserted for cleaning. The handles are in kingwood.\u2019",

The modern examples, with some exceptions, are of traditional form shorn of embellishement.  Here and there the designer has wavered, adding a little beading along the rim or a little engraving.\n\nWe illustrate a tea set designed by H.G. Murphy, of 58 Weymouth Street, which won the highest award at the Milan Exhibition of 1933.  The design may at first sight seem deliberately eccentric, but its shape is in fact dictated by the method of machine manufacture.  It cost \u00a320, which we understand is much less than a corresponding set manufactured by old methods would cost.  The lids lift off completely thus dispensing with hinges which must be hand-made.  The hand can be inserted for cleaning.  The handles are in kingwood.\n\nGoldsmiths' Company Exhibition RF.2004/844",
