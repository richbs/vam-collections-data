According to the account by Brother Leo, he was praying on Mount Verna during a forty day fast in preparation for Michaelmas when he had the vision. \n\nMedieval books had no contents page or index and so there was usually a hierarchy of initials marking important divisions in the text or music. The most important initials might be historiated with a figurative picture (istoire being the term for a story) or images of saints as seen here, while divisions of lesser importance had decorated initials.\n\nThe Master of the Budapest Antiphonary is named after a Franciscan manuscript in the National Library of Budapest (MS Clmae 462) which dates to around 1444-1450. This artist is sometimes confused with the Master of the Franciscan Breviary (named after MS 337 in Biblioteca Universitaria, Bologna), whose career and style overlap.",

Choirbooks in particular were produced in sets of many volumes (often more than 30). From the early 19th century onwards such choirbooks provided an easy source of images that connoisseurs eagerly sought to add to their collections of paintings. Manuscripts could be cut up to make them more marketable and pleasing to the collector. Single leaves survive, but also initials, as here, cut to shape.",
