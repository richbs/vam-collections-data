            "public_access_description": "Harry Clarke was one of the great masters of 20th-century stained glass. He trained in his father\u2019s studio and at the Metropolitan Art School in Dublin, which gave him an intimate understanding of the nature of glass. He soon learned to employ sophisticated techniques to create decorative effects. He toured Europe to study medieval glass, and was especially inspired by the 12th-century glass in the French cathedral of Chartres. Many of his windows, such as this one, are reminiscent of those at Chartres in the depth and richness of their colour schemes.\n\nClarke was especially skilful in exploiting the qualities of the new slab glass, which E.S. Prior had invented in 1889. The irregularities in the thickness of this coloured glass mimicked that used in medieval stained glass. Clarke enhanced the qualities of this richly coloured glass by acid-etching, the application of stains and fine delicate painting.\n\nHe created the design for the Apparition of the Sacred Heart in 1918. This was in preparation for a window for Phibsborough Church in Dublin, commissioned by the Arch-Confraternity of the Sacred Heart. The window was completed and installed in 1919. Subsequently, Clarke and his studio reused the original design to make other Sacred Heart windows.\n\nThe devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ dates back to medieval times, but it did not become a feast of the Catholic church until 1670. The spread of this devotional feast was largely due to the visions of St Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647\u201390), who communicated that Christ wanted to reveal his ardent love for mankind. He wished to manifest his heart with its abundance of love and mercy. Margaret Mary was canonised in 1920.",

This church was the home of the Arch-Confraternity of the Sacred Heart in Dublin. The design was approved in July 1918, a cartoon completed in November 1918 and the panel completed in August 1919.

            "historical_context_note": "The devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ is a devotion to Jesus himself and his love for humanity which is represented by his heart. \n\nThis devotion has a long history and is found as early as the 12th and 13th centuries, especially in the writings of St Anselm (d.1109) and St Bonaventure (1221-1274). The devotion was primarily a personal one and it wasn't until 1670 that the Church instituted a feast in its honour. \n\nNonetheless, it is largely due to the revelations made by Christ to St Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647-90) that the feast became a widespread devotion within the Church. St Margaret Mary communicated that Christ wanted to reveal through her his ardent love for mankind and his wish to manifest his heart with all of its abundance of love and mercy. \n\nSt Margaret Mary was canonized in 1920.\n\nSt. John Eudes (1601-1680) was the author of the liturgical worship of the Sacrd Hearts of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ. He was canonized in 1925.\n\n(March 1918) Clarke made a preparatory coloured design for a three-light window depicting the Sacred Heart, St Mary Magdalene and St John the Baptist  to be erected for the Vincentian Fathers in St Peter's Church at Phibsborough in Dublin. Little scenes in these side panels relate to the lives of St Margaret Mary and St John Eudes. In October he transferred the design to the cartoon stage and the window was completed by August 1919.",
