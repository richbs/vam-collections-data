It complements four other drawings showing the design process for a teapot in the same range (E.139-142-2005).\n\nDavid Queensberry and Martin Hunt are leading UK designers of ceramics and glass. In 2003 they were asked to create a new range for Portmeirion Potteries Ltd., creating simple designs for a company more often associated with very decorative wares. Queensberry Hunt is unusual in that the designers still use plaster models to realise the form of their ceramics, rather than relying on CAD modelling as most designers now do. They turn to computer drawings only when they have made an exact model. \n\nThe V&A's Department of Sculpture, Metalwork, Ceramics and Glass holds the resin-coated plaster design model, plaster production mould and finished pieces from the same 'Soho' range.",
