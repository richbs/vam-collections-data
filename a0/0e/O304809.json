The door cannot be opened when the roof is down - secure. The door, at mid-height has a latch which fixes the hasp. One would not have to stoop to get in.  When the lid is raised all the recesses for the window frames are open so the glass can be lifted out, or to save weight.  The chair is lined with plain natural-coloured moleskin-like fabric (fustion?). The seat is not upholstered or covered and can be adjusted to three different heights sliding in grooves cut in rails attached to the inside. There is a roughly-cut piece of carpeting, Brussels weave, fitted inside with an overall rococo revival pattern about 1830.\n[Carrying pole] Pine carrying pole, rounded at the ends but rectangular in section in the middle.  Pine, painted black, now worn.  There is a wooden triangle held on by 3 nails probably to stop the chair running forward on the poles.\n[Carrying pole] Pine carrying pole, rounded at the ends but rectangular in section in the middle.
