His lavish, painterly and  romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international  reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually  abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nMozart\u2019s opera Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) (1786)  was performed to celebrate the  twenty-first anniversary of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1955.  Messel designed the settings and costumes and critics praised his\nexuberant  pastiche of 18th-century art and design. 'The d\u00e9cor by Oliver Messel was in his richest and most inventive  vein, fully emphasising the unique blend of sharp satire and human understanding for the folly and  unhappiness of the characters which Mozart so perfectly caught in his music\u2019 (The Tatler, 22 June 1955).  \n\nAccording to the 'costume plot' for the production, Basilio, the music teacher, is \u2018a somewhat  prim and mincing figure\u2019.",

Oliver Messel designed the production for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, first performed at Glyndebourne on 8 June, 1955.  It was directed by Carl Ebert and featured Bruscantini as Figaro and  Elena Rizzieri as Susanna.  It was revived at Glyndebourne in 1956, 1958, 1962, 1963 and 1965. \n  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in  2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His Glyndebourne designs are regarded as some of his best work.",
