Human supporters on arms were popular in Germany, but did not become hereditary until about 1650. Individual family members could adopt different supporters for the family coat of arms. This makes it difficult to determine which member of the Virneburg family is represented here.\n\n\nThe arms are described as: \u2018Or, seven conjoined lozenges gules\u2019 (on a field of gold are displayed seven lozenges joined together, four in the top and three in the base).\n\nBecause of the shape of the panel, it is likely that it was placed in the upper small portions of a window. These are known as 'tracery lights'. There is another panel with these arms in the nearby church of Kapellen-Stolzenfel.",

Individual members of the family could adopt different supporters for the family coat of arms. This makes it difficult to determine precisely which member of the Virneburg family is represented here. \n\nThe arms are described as: Or, 7 conjoined lozenges gules (on a field of gold are displayed 7 lozenges joined together, four in the top and three in the base).\n\nBecause of the shape of the panel it is likely that it was place in the upper small portions of a window; these are known as 'tracery lights'. There is another panel with these arms in the nearby church of Kapellen-Stolzenfel",
