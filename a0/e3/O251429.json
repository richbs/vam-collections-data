Limerick, Ireland.  The specifications between the Earl of Limerick and William Watt, the maker, were drawn up by Godwin.  They were to be made in 'wainscot oak oiled with cushions & backs of fine horsehair covered with common tanned uncoloured leather with stamped pattern in gold' (RIBA MC GOE/1/7/4). All the chairs were sold at the Dromore auction in 1949.\n\nThe Department of Circulation acquired a set of one armchair and six chairs, originally designed for Dromore, from Mrs. R.C. Mackenzie in 1966. Originally only an armchair (Circ.719-1966) and two side chairs (Circ.720 & 721-1966) were given Museum numbers. On 16th February 1966 Hugh Wakefield, Keeper of the Department, explained to the Director that the proposal was to give four of the chairs 'C' numbers (C22567, C22568, C22569 & C22570) and keep them for exchange with other museums, or as gifts to other museums. Only one chair, C22568, was given to the Museum fur Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg (inv. no. 1967.62).  The three other chairs with C numbers were lent to Leighton House, London, in 1967, along with Circ.721-1966.  They were subsequently given extension numbers to Circ. 721-1966.",
