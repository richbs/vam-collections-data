To be seen on the hunting field was an essential attribute of social success. This waistcoat is from an important collection previously in Castle Howard, Yorkshire, that includes seven scarlet hunt coats and one blue hunt coat as well as waistcoats, breeches, stockings and boots. \n\nThere were many different hunt membership rules regulating the colour of the coat, collar and buttons. Many of the coats and waistcoats have hunt buttons engraved with foxes and initials to denote the various hunts the members belonged to, such as Holderness, Eton and Bedale. This waistcoat would have been worn underneath a field hunt coat.",
