GJ 1327 (reference no. 46054)In this photograph as in Ph 380-1947 (D.737) her two eldest daughters reaffirm their bond with each other and with their mother. Isabella Grace, in evening dress, her hair elaborately arranged, with her back to the camera perhaps in order to show the intricacies of her dress and hair to full advantage, stands at the French window to the terrace. Clementina, poised like a mirror before her sister, her expression perhaps reflecting that on Isabella Grace's face, incongruously wears a riding habit and appears dishevelled. Their rapport is visually strengthened by the lines of the window, which direct our eyes to their arms, gracefully linked.'",
