The bench was made and \ninstalled in 1994, and given a museum number: \nM.11-1995.  Paley first achieved prominence with an \nelaborate pair of steel and brass portal gates \nforged in 1974 for the Renwick Gallery in \nWashington DC.  His subsequent work has been \ndescribed as enlarged versions of the sculpted  \njewellery of his early career.  His work draws on \nmany traditions: Baroque, Art Nouveau, Modernism \nand even Space Age.  The bench is a lexicon of \nPaley's understanding of decorative, patinated \nironwork and the assymmetrical [sic] design is composed \nof a twisted, coiled hoop with secondary coiled \nelements incorporating decorative swagging.  \nExtending from the coil and  supporting the wood \nseating surface is a superstructure which includes \na coiled and punched structure with tapered \nelements that penetrates a banner-like form on the \nfar right.  The backrest for the bench is a bundle  \nof decorative forged elements.'",

            "history_note": "The sculptor Albert Paley was commissioned by the Victoria and Albert Museum to provide designs and then make a bench suitable for the new Ironwork Gallery in Room 114.  The bench was made and installed in 1994, and given a museum number: M.11-1995.  Paley first achieved prominence with an elaborate pair of steel and brass portal gates forged in 1974 for the Renwick Gallery in Washington DC.  His subsequent work has been described as enlarged versions of the sculpted  jewellery of his early career.  His work draws on many  traditions: Baroque, Art Nouveau, Modernism and even Space Age.  The bench is a lexicon of Paley's  understanding of decorative, patinated ironwork and the assymmetrical design is composed of a twisted, coiled hoop with secondary coiled elements incorporating decorative swagging.  Extending from the coil and  supporting the wood seating surface is a superstructure which includes a coiled and punched structure with tapered elements that penetrates a banner-like form on the far right.  The backrest for the bench is a bundle  of decorative forged elements.",
