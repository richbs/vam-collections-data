Articled to a legal attorney; taught himself painting. Exhibited seven works at the RA between 1836 and 1855, 28 at the BI 1828-63, and 194 at the SBA 1833-70 (elected Member 1842, and later Vice-President). Subjects principally landscapes, mainly river and lake scenes; his style was much influenced by J M W Turner. Travelled in Switzerland and Italy 1846, and Germany and Italy 1851. Published 'Windsor, With Its Surrounding Scenery' nd [1838-40], 'The English Lake District' (Manchester 1853), and 'The Lake Scenery of England' (1859). There are also several drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. Died 29 July 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 25 February 1871. \n\nLIT: MS <u>Picture Memoranda</u> 1840-1868 National Art Library collection, V&A; <u>Art Journal</u> 1856, pp205-8; 1870, p276 (obit); <u>Athenaeum</u> 13 August 1870, pp217-8 (obit); \n\n\n<b>Night Fete at Olevano</b>\n 1018-1886 Neg 57863 \nCanvas, 64.8 X 90.2 cm (25\u00bd X 35\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'JBPYNE 1854 No 357' br \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nThe number inscribed on the work refers to the artist's manuscript <u>Memoranda</u>, in which the subject is described as 'Olevano, Roman States: \nThe eve of a Festa with fire works etc.'.
