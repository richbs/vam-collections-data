He began painting landscapes in about 1843; his favourite locations were in Scotland, Ireland, Devon and Wales, although he also made a tour of Switzerland. Oakes began exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1848, and was represented there virtually every year until his death. He was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1876. \n\nOakes was influenced by the naturalistic style of the highly successful landscape painters B.W. Leader and Vicat Cole. His pursuit of naturalism in landscape is combined with an interest in effects of light, such as the subtle spring twilight here.\n\nOakes exhibited a work at the Royal Academy in 1879 with the title <u>Disturbed: early spring - twilight. 'In sober livery all things clad'</u> (no.378), which seems to be identical with this painting. It was mentioned in a review in the <u>Art Journal</u> as a landscape 'deserving of attention', and described as 'a study of twilight in the early spring'.",
