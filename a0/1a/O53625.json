            "public_access_description": "This is one of 35 marionettes from the Tiller-Clowes troupe, one of the last Victorian marionette troupes in England. Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is a pole balancer, or 'polander'. His existence in marionette troupes owes its origin to the fame of 'The Great Polander', a performer who had great success with his pole-balancing act at Sadler's Wells Theatre, in London, in the late 18th century. He is wearing his original costume, and is complicated to operate since his pole can be transferred to his hands and his feet.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, whose widow sold them to The Theatre Museum after his death in 1998.\n\nThis marionette was used as Carlos della Cucina di Cordoba, the Spanish Tranka!\nin the Variety performance preceding the production of <I>The Floating Beacon</I> at the Theatre Museum in April 2004.",

It is possible, however, to distinguish distinct types, and therefore groups, made by different makers, due to the type of carving.  The carver of this object has been distinguished as Maker D.",

In any case, this shows that pole balancing was a popular Circus and Variety act which was being represented by this marionette figure.",
