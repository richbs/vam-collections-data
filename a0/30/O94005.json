Busts of youthful-looking men  with plump cheeks and bulging eyes peer out in alternate directions from between them. The figures all have hair tied in top knots and are wearing<i> uttariysa</i> wound over the front of their upper bodies, with the ends of some draped over a shoulder. They rest one arm on a ledge while an unidentified  segmental object rests on their other side  On the right hand end there is a rectangular panel and the frieze has a plain fillet along the bottom and a convex moulding along the top decorated with a foliate motif.\n      There is a slot at either end along the top edge which runs from front to back. There are also traces of mortar on the back of the stone IM.861939 (the left hand part) has a V-shaped incision on the top edge and the other right hand part, IM.86A-1939, has a pair of parallel diagonal scratch marks. Additionally there is a back slot on the rear of the piece running down from the slot on the top edge.",
