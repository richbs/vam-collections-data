In medieval Spain, lustre potters worked for both Muslim and Christian patrons, and in the 14th century two production centres emerged in the south-east, at Islamic M\u00e1laga and Christian Manises (near Valencia). \n\nThe 'Gazelle vase' was found in the late 18th century at the Alhambra Palace in Granada, and by the mid 19th century it had become an icon of the rediscovery of Spain's Islamic past. The craze for historicist styles throughout Europe at this time propelled potters in Manises to revive the production of lustre ceramics for which their ancestors had been famous in the 14th and 15th centuries. \n\nThough the 'Gazelle vase' had been made in M\u00e1laga, not Manises, it also became the emblem of the revived lustre industry, and was incorporated into many factories' logos and advertising, even the coat of arms of Manises town council.",

Lustre is a decorative technique of overglaze painting with metallic oxides which was invented in Iraq in the 9th century, and used to decorate ceramics made throughout the Islamic Middle East. In medieval Spain, lustre potters worked for both Muslim and Christian patrons, and in the 14th century two production centres emerged in the south-east, at Islamic M\u00e1laga and Christian Manises (near Valencia). \n\nThe \u2018Gazelle vase\u2019 was found in the late 18th century at the Alhambra Palace in Granada, and by the mid 19th century it had become an icon of the rediscovery of Spain\u2019s Islamic past. The craze for historicist styles throughout Europe at this time prompted potters in Manises to revive the production of lustre ceramics for which their ancestors had been famous in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lustre production had continued on a small scale into the 18th century, and knowledge of this complex technique was passed down through generations of potters. Even today it is still practised according to traditional methods.\n\nThough the \u2018Gazelle vase\u2019 had been made in M\u00e1laga, not Manises, it also became the emblem of the revived lustre industry, and was incorporated into many factories\u2019 logos and advertising, even the coat of arms of Manises town council. The V&A acquired an important collection of lustre dishes made in the early days of the revived industry, but never a vase. This acquisition therefore fills a significant gap in our collection.\n\nMariam Rosser-Owen, 'Icon of an Islamic Past', short article among the pick of the V&A's new acquisitions, in the <i>V&A Magazine</i> issue 17, Autumn/Winter 2008, p. 76",
