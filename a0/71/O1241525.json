He came to Britain in 1845 from his native Novy Bor, in Northern Bohemia as an economic migrant. He became naturalised British in 1853 and married Sarah Holland three years later.\nThis small wine-goblet was donated by Mr Leslie Oppitz, a great-grandson of Paul and Sarah. It was part of a number of glasses kept in the family and said to be made by his great-grandfather. These were probably mostly used as examples for clients commissioning engraved glasses from Oppitz, but the monogram PSO on this goblet indicates that Paul Oppitz might have made this glass for himself and his wife Sarah.",
