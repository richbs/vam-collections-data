He first travelled to India in 1863 and photographed extensively there until 1869. Bourne wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes he photographed. \n\nHis first sight of the Taj Mahal was overwhelming. He wrote: \u2018The world knows not another building to be compared with the Taj. It rises in its queenly beauty on the banks of the Jumna, and the eye that has once gazed on its snowy whiteness and dazzling splendour can never forget it.\u2019 \n\nShah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in honour of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631 giving birth to her 14th child. Completed in 1643, the Taj is regarded as the greatest achievement of the Mughal architectural tradition because of its perfect synthesis of symmetry and simplicity of form. The building of the mausoleum alone was said to cost five million rupees. This huge sum did not include the cost of the white marble which was extracted from Makrana in Rajasthan.",

            "history_note": "This photograph was initially part of the photographic collection held in the National Art Library. The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised.\nThis window mount is similar to others in the collection. At one point it would also have had a label with red edging indicating the title of the photograph. There is evidence of this being torn off the mount. This type of label and mount suggests inclusion in an exhibition, possibly the Paris exhibition of 1867 or the subsequent South Kensington exhibition for which no catalogue has been found.\n\nHistorical significance: Samuel Bourne wrote an account of  his journey in India in the British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes of which he took photographs. His account of the Taj Mahal can be found in: \n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, 1 July 1863, Pg 269.",

            "production_note": "Although Bourne visited the Taj Mahal in 1863 he did not photograph on that first sighting. He would have photographed on a later visit.",
