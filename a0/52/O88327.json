            "public_access_description": "Jean Carri\u00e8s was a French sculptor and ceramicist and many of his works represent a unity of these two disciplines. He was particularly interested in form and this manifested itself in a preoccupation with human physiognomy and the limitless possibilities of facial expression. Amongst his most distinctive work is his exploration of the mask and many of his creations are grotesque and fantastical. Around 1889-92 he produced several self portraits in grey enamelled stoneware of which this is one.\n\nTraditionally regarded as a utilitarian ceramic body, Carri\u00e8s did much to elevate stoneware to a medium of truly artistic ambition.",
