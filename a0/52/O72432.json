These two pieces are soldered together, but the original on which this lamp is modelled probably had these parts pinned together. The backplate is pierced with triangular and circular holes in emulation of a rose window which is set above a row of twelve Moorish acrhes in the form of an arcade; there is a suspension ring at the top in the shape of a pierced trefoil. The eight lamps used during the Hanukkah festival project from the front of the lamp base, while the shammash (servitor lamp) is set sideways on to them, at the right of the base.\n19th century copy based on a 13th or 14th century southern French or Spanish original.",
