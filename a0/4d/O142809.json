His choice sometimes appeared shocking, as in his electric chair series or the car crashes, but his apparently deadpan treatment of them often implies a radical critique of social mores. Here, the bravery of the Civil Rights Activists of the early 1960s is immortalised through Warhol's simple re-iteration of some of the most harrowing press photographs of police 'intervention'.",
