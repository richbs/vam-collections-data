            "public_access_description": "This vase is an exceptionally ambitious creation. It depicts an episode in Roman history, traditionally said to have taken place in 750 BC. The Romans invited the neighbouring Sabine tribe to games in Rome, and then abducted the visiting women to take as their wives. \nIn 1781 Christoph Dihl (1752-1830), Antoine Gu\u00e9rhard (d.1793) and his wife Louise-Fran\u00e7oise-Madelaine Croiz\u00e9 (1751-1831) established a factory under the protection of the Duc d\u2019Angoul\u00eame (1775-1844). This Royal patronage allowed the factory to manufacture coloured and gilt porcelain which had been monopolised by S\u00e8vres since 1766. It operated first at Rue de Bondy, Paris moving in 1789 to rue du Temple. The factory enjoyed success and continued after the Revolution. The decorator of this vase Etienne-Charles Le Guay (b.1762) , worked for Sevres from1778-1785, 1808-1840 and for Dihl and Gu\u00e9rhard probably during both these periods.  The factory suffered financial difficulties in the early-19th century eventually leading to closure in 1828.",
