            "public_access_description": "The design of this curtain was first used for wallpaper and later adapted for wallpaper friezes and woven textiles. Voysey was under contract to Alexander Morton, the maker of this curtain, to produce a  number of designs per year. Morton's used Voysey's patterns for many different types of textiles including machine-woven and hand-knotted carpets, woven gauzes and various woven furnishings in wool, silk and cotton.\n\nOne of most internationally celebrated designers of his age, the architect C. F. A. Voysey (1857-1941) was also a prolific and versatile freelance decorative designer who sold variations of the same patterns to a number of  different manufacturers. His nursery-like patterns frequently depicted birds and animals.\n\nAlexander Morton's company was founded in 1867, based on the established muslin industry in Darvel in Scotland.  In 1881 he began producing woven textiles which he sold to retailers in Glasgow and London. Morton became one of the most innovative entrepreneurs of his day, using new designs in innovative techniques and colours.\n\nThis furnishing was sold through Liberty's shop in Regent Street. By the end of the 19th century the shop created what was described as 'a new English period' establishing a reputation as the main retailer of British Arts and Crafts goods.",
