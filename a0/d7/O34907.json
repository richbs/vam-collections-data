Herkomer, an artist and Society portrait painter, commissioned designs for the house in 1886 from the American architect, H.H. Richardson, in return for a portrait and building was completed by 1894. The house was demolished in 1939.\n\nHerkomer, whose family had been craftsmen in Southern Bavaria, Germany, designed the interiors and furnishings, many of which were made in the workshops he built in his garden. His father made the furniture and his uncle, a carver, created the carvings in the drawing room, working with two apprentices. The balustrade was placed above the ingle nook fireplace in this room, the decoration of which Herkomer described as adapted from the Gothic style.",
