There was an enormous variety of designs, reflecting the wide range of 19th-century taste.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe tilework of the Islamic world attracted considerable interest during the 19th century. Numerous tiles were acquired and sold on the European market. Various British manufacturers produced their own versions of the tiles. Both branches of the Minton firm, Minton's China Works and Minton, Hollins & Co., made tiles similar to this example, which is based directly on the design of tiles from Iznik in Turkey. Minton's versions were generally (and inaccurately) described as 'Persian' designs.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis tile was made in a very different way to that of the 16th-century Iznik tiles that inspired its design. It is an industrial rather than handmade product, made using powdered clay compressed under great pressure between metal dies. Perfectly square and flat tiles can reliably be produced in this way. The outline of the design has also been transfer-printed, although the decoration has subsequently been completed by hand.",
