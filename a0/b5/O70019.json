            "public_access_description": "This image of Billy Waters comes from a book called Costume of the Lower Orders by Thomas Busby, which was published in London in 1820. Busby claimed that he drew his portraits 'from nature'. They included a one-armed white fiddle-player and other beggars and street-sellers in the tradition of 'Cries of London'. These 'Cries' were originally the calls of street traders and hawkers selling their wares. They became a rich source of inspiration for British musicians and artists. The inclusion of real-life black personalities in books and prints reflects the historical presence of black people among the London poor in the early 19th century.\n\nThe compiler of this scrapbook also pasted into it a notice of Billy Waters's death from a contemporary newspaper: 'The eccentric Billy Waters, whose conspicuous character . . . gained him as much notoriety, bade adieu to this life yesterday morning, after being ten days in St Giles's workhouse, in a lingering condition. Poor Billy endeavoured up to the period of his illness to obtain for a wife and two children what he termed \"an honest living by the scraping of cat-gut\", by which he originally amassed a considerable portion of browns (half-pence) at the West end of the town, where his hat and feathers, with his peculiar antics, excited much mirth and attention . . . however, he died very poor, and was obliged, prior to his death, to part with his old friend, the fiddle, for a trifling sum at the pawnbrokers; and the wooden pin (leg) which had so often supported Billy, would have shared the same fate, but its extensive service had rendered it worthless though it had twice saved poor Billy from the penalties of the Tread Mill. He was formerly a sailor, and he received a trifling pension since he left the service. A short time prior to his death he was elected King of a party of Beggars in St Giles's, in consequence of his notoriety. He resided with his family in the house of Mrs Fitzgerald, Church Street, St Giles's. His remains were yesterday removed from the Workhouse, to the New Burial Ground, St Pancras, where he was interred. He was followed to the grave by his wife and children, with a few old friends - some professional ones. He was forty-five years of age.'",
