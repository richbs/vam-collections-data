Each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  \n\nIn the 1860s, Norwegian silversmiths working in the main towns started to make fashionable jewellery in traditional Norwegian styles, and this is one of those brooches.  It is shaped like a traditional boles\u00f8lje ring brooch, but the central tang is non-functional, and there is a modern brooch fitting on the back.  It was made by J\u00f8rgen Grinderud, the son of Tor Grinderud of Lunde in Telemark, who was one of the leaders of the new movement.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 16s.at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
