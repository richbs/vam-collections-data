Partly self-taught, he entered the studio of Auguste Couder (1789-1873) a former pupil of Jean-Baptiste Regnault (1754-1829) and Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825). Lafaye specialised in history paintings and interior scenes, and exhibited at the Salon from 1833 to 1847. He later became a restorer of stained glass windows.\n\nThis work is a fine example of Lafaye's history paintings, a category in which he specialised recording notable events of his time. The picture shows the visit of the Queen Victoria, prince Albert and their family to the Indian Pavilion at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Lafaye probably starts working on this composition while in London in the autumn 1851. Typical of his art is the fine chiaroscuro and diffuse light of this interior scene.",

He lived in Paris from the age of thirteen and became a pupil of Auguste Couder. He painted some battle scenes for Louis Philippe's Mus\u00e9e Historique at Versailles, but his most typical paintings are of interiors, characterized by the interplay of strong light and shade. He exhibited at the Salon from 1833, but lack of success in his later years led him to specialize in the painting and restoration of stained glass windows. \n\nLit. J.

Most of the figures, including those of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the children (left of centre), and of Lafaye's grand-daughter Yvonne (one of the donors of the picture) in the left foreground, were added in 1881. A note to this effect appears in the artist's diary under 12 August 1881: \n\"Termin\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le tableau commenc\u00e9 il y a au moins 30 ans repre\u00e9sentant l'int\u00e9rieur de l' exposition des Indes. Introduit la reine d' Angleterre \net des figures de toutes sortes, entre autres la petite Yvonne et sa m\u00e8re et des personnages du Mont [St Sulpice], etc.' \nThe Museum also has an almost full-size water-colour sketch (P. 56- 1968; 21 3/8 x 41 in., dated 1851-69), in which the pavilion is identical but the disposition of the figures - apparently added in 1869 - differs. There are pencil drawings of the individual commissioners in the Dept. of Prints & Drawings (E. 130/70-1968) and another version in oil in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts Decoratifs, Paris. \n\nCondition. Flaking surface laid down and canvas relined in 1966. \nProv. Direct descent in the artist's family; given to the Museum in 1966 by Dr Germaine Montreuil-Straus and Mademoiselle Yvonne Montreuil in memory of their grandfather, Prosper Lafaye. \nLit.

It shows Queen Victoria, Price Albert and three of their children in the Indian pavilion at the Great Exhibition of 1851. According to the painter's notes, he started the painting in 1851 while visiting London that year and added about 30 years later the members of the Royal family as well as few figures on each side and notably, the portrait of his granddaughter Yvonne (one of the donors) as a little girl in the foreground. \nPartly self-taught, Lafaye executed many interior scenes in a Romantic taste with powerful chiaroscuro. His painted oeuvre mostly witnessed the events of his time such as <i>Cholera in Paris</i> (1837- whereabouts unknown), <i> Louis-Philippe, the Queen, King Leopold I and the Queen of Belgium visiting the Crusades Room in July 1844</i> (1844 - Mus\u00e9e National des Ch\u00e2teaux de Versailles et de Trianon)  and <i>View of the Salon of the Princess of Orleans</i> (1842-Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris).    \nLafaye painted in the same year another version of the present painting as well as the <i>Room of the S\u00e8vres Manufacture at the Great Exhibition of 1851</i>, both in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris. Lafaye used to consciously prepare his compositions with the help of preliminary sketches and watercolours. The Museum owns almost full-size watercolour sketch of the present painting (see P. 56- 1968). Dated 1851-59, this study provides an interesting insight into the artist's working practice as he sometimes used to re-work his composition over the years.",

History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
