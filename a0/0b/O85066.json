            "bibliography": "Ashton, Geoffrey. <u>Catalogue of Paintings at the Theatre Museum, London.</u> ed. James Fowler, London : Victoria and Albert Museum, 1992. 224p. ill. ISBN 1851771026, no. 46, pp.68-69.\nThe following is the full text of the entry: \n\n'Margetson's picture depicts the second scene of the Prologue in Wills's adaptation of Goethe's <u>Faust</u> and shows the Witch's Kitchen with the monkeys skimming the witch's brew which Faust presently drinks to regain his youth. Irving's production of <u>Faust</u> opened at the Lyceum on 19 December 1885 but the scene of the Witch's Kitchen, with scenery painted by Hawes Craven, was not added until the 244th performance on 15 November 1886, by which time the play was one of Irving's greatest successes and it was played 792 times before its final performance in Bristol on 10 December 1902. The part of Faust was originally played by H. B. Conway but George Alexander took over the part on 9 January 1886 and played it for the rest of the run. \n\nThe souvenir booklet, written by Joseph Hatton for the Lyceum <u>Faust</u>, was revised following the introduction of the Witch's Kitchen scene and five pages of text added, illustrated with three drawings by Margetson. The major drawing, <u>Mephistopheles introducing Faust to the Witch's Kitchen</u>, agrees in almost every detail with [this painting]. The exceptions are the broom lower right which is in a different position, the sieve which is missing in the drawing, and the three owls sitting above the monkeys and one to the right of Faust which are all fairly prominent in the drawing. It is tempting to suggest that [this painting] is the original of the work reproduced in the souvenir booklet. However, the caption is quite specific that the original work was drawn  and not painted and the picture might easily be a refinement painted by the artist for Irving after the publication of the drawing. \n\nIrving's Mephistopheles costume is in the Museum of London (38. 19/1).'",
