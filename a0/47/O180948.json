The friezes represent the Ancient and Modern Drama. They were probably the first examples of the direct influence of the Parthenon marbles, which Flaxman had seen in 1807 when they were brought to England by Lord Elgin (and which are now in the British Museum). This one, along with that depicting Shakespeare (A.10-1968), illustrates 'Modern Drama' (as opposed to ancient drama). It shows Milton seated at the left with figures from his dramatic poem 'Comus'.\n\nJohn Flaxman (1755-1826) was an English sculptor, designer and teacher. He was the most famous English Neo-classical sculptor of the late 18th century and the early 19th. He focused on monumental sculpture and church monuments and portrait busts. A large collection of his plaster models is held in the Strang Print Room, University College, London. He also made outline illustrations of Homer, Aeschylus and Dante. Many of those in his sketchbooks (now in the V&amp;A) were drawn from the antique while he was in Italy. Furthermore he produced models for pottery and silver supplying the pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood among others. He thus can be considered as an important pioneer in the development of Industrial Design.",
