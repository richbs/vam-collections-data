At breakfast it could be half-filled with hot water and used for serving kidneys, bacon or poached eggs, kept warm in the strainer. In Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management of 1888, on the other hand, a diagram of a breakfast table describes two similar revolving covered dishes as holding muffins. At dinner the drainer section could be removed  to serve soup or retained to keep warm an entr\u00e9e such as hash.  Contemporary manufacturers' trade catalogues described similar items as 'breakfast or entr\u00e9e dishes' or 'soup tureens with revolving covers'.\n\nDesign & Designing \n\nThe revolving cover of this dish must have been a novelty when it was first developed. The design appears in the Elkington & Co. pattern books of the mid-1870s. Although these dishes could cost twice as much as an ordinary entr\u00e9e dish or soup tureen, consumers valued them for their versatility.\n\nProvenance \n\nThe value and status of silver has meant that ownership of silver tableware can be traced through the coats of arms and crests engraved on it. Throughout history people in Britain have valued silver and used it  as a reward or to mark significant personal events such as marriage. The inscription records that this dish was given by his staff to Captain Frank Johnson, Governor of HM Prison Pentonville, to mark his retirement. The cover is made of electroplated nickel silver, which  by the late 19th century had become a socially acceptable and cheaper alternative to silver and could be presented as a mark of respect in exactly the same way.",
