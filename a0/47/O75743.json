            "public_access_description": "On the breech of the cannon is a group representing a lion and winged dragon struggling; above the trunnions (which are now missing) is a figure of Mars in armour, seated amidst foliage. This cast is from the same design as a wax cannon on turned wood base (also in the Museum's collections, inv.no. A.79-1911) designed by Stevens for the son of his friend Alfred Pegler, but certain small differences between the plaster and the wax suggest the plaster was not in fact cast from the wax, or that the plaster version was possibly re-worked subsequently.\n\nA sculptor, designer and painter, Alfred Stevens (1817/18-1875) rejected contemporary distinctions between fine art and design. From 1850 to 1857 he was chief designer to Hoole &amp; Co., Sheffield, where he produced award-winning designs for metalwork, majolica, terracotta ornaments and chimney-pieces. Perhaps his two greatest works were the decorations for the dining-room at Dorchester House, London (about 1856), for which he made countless drawings inspired by the Italian High Renaissance style, in particular the work of Michelangelo and the monument to the Duke of Wellington for St Paul's Cathedral, London, which was completed after his death. The two allegorical groups from this monument made a lasting impact on the New Sculpture movement. \nThe influence of the Italian Renaissance is evident in much of Steven's work, and is perhaps best reflected in the Wellington monument.",
