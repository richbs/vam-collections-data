The end of the cross-staff, remarkably, rests on the helmet of a sleeping soldier. Christ steps from the tomb with his right foot, his torso represented frontally but his hips and legs viewed from the side, and turned to his left. His right foot rests on the shoulder of a soldier, wearing a basinet, a tippet of mail, a low-belted jupon and armour, who kneels asleep in the bottom right of the panel, facing right, resting his head on his arm. A battle-axe lies on a piece of raised ground behind him. A similar soldier is represented on the lower left of the panel, falling back onto a piece of ground and supporting himself with his right hand; he holds a battle-axe in his left hand and looks up at Christ in amazement. Two similar soldiers are represented behind the tomb, to right and left. The left-hand soldier is asleep, supporting his head on his right hand and holding in his left a lance which rests over the front edge of the tomb. On the right, the other soldier holds his halberd in both hands, looking up at Christ. A half-length figure of an angel, hands raised, is represented in the top left corner of the panel.\n\nThe top right corner of the panel is missing. Christ's right hand is damaged and his left hand and the top of the cross-staff of the Resurrection are missing. There is a diagonal break in the panel from Christ's right hand to his head and a chip in the lower left of the panel. No paint remains on the panel. The back of the panel is cut away at the bottom. There are four lead-plugged holes with latten wires attached.",
