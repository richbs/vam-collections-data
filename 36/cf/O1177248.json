After 1550, the Ottoman court began to use tankards made from luxury materials. Here grey-green jade has been inlaid with gold wire to form a design of floral sprays. The flowers are rubies and emeralds set in gold.\n\nLater the tankard was given a new handle and other mounts, all in gold and set with more gemstones. These mounts are in the Baroque style.",
