The two halves are partly joined by a narrow insertion of plaited bobbin lace with a simple zig-zag pattern. For the last approx 96 cm the two halves of the sheet are cut back and the space filled with an inserted band of linen and insertions of the same bobbin lace. The top edge of the sheet and the top 100 cm approx of each side are trimmed with a small, scalloped bobbin lace. The inserted panel in the centre is decorated with whitework embroidery, and the pattern of diamonds and triangles is worked mainly in satin stitch, but in the centre of each geometric motif are small cutwork squares with simple needle fillings. Rows of single, small cutwork squares decorate the lines separating the motifs and other outlines are defined by rows of tiny eyelet holes.\n\nAs well as the initials embroidered on the sheet, it has a series of pin holes that look like initials that had previously been worked on it, and subsequently unpicked.",

In 1638 the sheets which belonged to Anne, Viscountess Dorchester, were listed as fine holland, flaxen, middling, and 'olde thinne'.  \n\nThe fabric used for making into pillow cases and sheets was woven from flax or hemp. Flax made the best quality linen. Such linen, used for clothing as well as household goods, which was sometimes described as 'holland', or 'cambric', after the town of Cambrai, France, formed a significant export trade from the Netherlands, Flanders, and northern France. The majority of people would have had bed linen made from locally-grown, spun and bleached flax or hemp, however. Different parts of the plants produced fibres of differing quality, giving a range of sheeting from fine to very coarse and rough.\n\nMuch of this sheet may have been home made. The women of the household may have spun the linen thread and then sent it away for weaving. The woven linen was then cut, sewn and embroidered at home, where the bobbin lace could also have been made. The initials embroidered on it are those of the owners.",
