His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s designs for Helen!, an opera bouff\u00e9 first produced by Charles B. Cochran (1872-1951) at the Adelphi Theatre, London, on 30 January 1932, won the approval of theatre critics and secured Messel\u2019s place as Great Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer during the 1930s and beyond.  The costume and set designs show Messel borrowing freely from historical styles, especially Baroque and Rococo stage architecture.\n\nMessel designed an all white set for Helen\u2019s bedroom, an unusual colour scheme for a theatre set in the early 1930s.  The canopy and walls are enveloped in fabrics, inspired by Rococo decoration.   The swans either side of the bed refer to Helen\u2019s conception.  In classical mythology, Zeus, disguised as a swan, seduced Leda and Helen was born from an egg.",
