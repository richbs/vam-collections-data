Tooling marks remaining on the surface of the metal are evidence of the creative process. Forms resulting from the instinctive blows of the hammer are simple and honest. These specifically hand-wrought jewels reflect the natural qualities of the materials from which they are made. Even though these artists were inspired by ancient cultures, their jewels are thoroughly individual and modern in style. \n\nBreon O\u2019Casey has been successful as a painter, sculptor, etcher and printmaker. He became particularly interested in jewellery in 1960 after having seen some illustrations of jewellery by Alexander Calder. His Celtic background was a source of inspiration, as was the work of Barbara Hepworth, who taught him how to carve, and the sculptor Denis Mitchell. He was studio apprentice to both at the St. Ives School. \n\nThe simplicity of O\u2019Casey\u2019s necklace gives a primitive sense, yet the design feels modern. Breon O\u2019Casey was fascinated by ancient and ethnic cultures.",
