The stalls are run as follows: the Fruiterer and Greengrocer is Lady Verysoft, the Grocer is Mrs Plausible, the Pastrycook is Miss Wheedleton, the Toy Dealer is Baroness Goodchild, the Earthenware Dealer is the Duchess of Otherland, the Hosier and Glover is Viscountess Pumicestone, the Poulterer is Miss Silverstone, and the Florist is the Marchioness of Bailbury. Most of the cards relate to the goods found on these stalls. The players take the part of the various stall holders. The cards are dealt out to the players in turn, who have to follow the instructions of paying counters to the various stalls.",

Four cards wach lettered THE PLAYER TO RECEIVE ONE COUNTER FROM EACH PLAYER\n\nRULES  FOR THE FANCY BAZAAR OR ARISTOCRATIC TRADERS.  A COMIC GAME\nDIRECTIONS  FOR PLAYING\n\nThis amusing game can be played by eight persons, each taking a lady and stall; or four persons can play, each taking the charge of two stalls.\nHaving decided for what  purpose the bazaar is to be held, by choosing one of the four Bazaar Cards; namely `National Debt', `Acclimatisation Society', `School for Grown Children' or `Bridge from Dover to Calais', the other three cards are to be laid aside.  Distribute counters in the usual manner to each player (nornally 10 or 12).\nThe sheet or board is to be put in the centre of the table, the stall picture cards to be placed opposite to their corresponding pictures on the sheet.\nThe dealer must put one counter into each of the eight conpartments in the sheet, and two counters into the centre compartment.\nThe dealer after well shuffling the pack must deliver three cards to each player, with the printing downwards.\nThe player on the left hand of  the dealer may then turn up a card, and pay or receive, as directed; the other players proceed in like manner, paying or receiving until the Bazaar card is turned up, the fortunate player, of which may take all the counters on the board.  If the Bazaar card does not turn up in a deal, the counters remain for a fresh deal by the next player.\nThe named cards, VISCOUNTESS PUMICESTONE, MRS PLAUSIBLE, MISS WHEEDLETON, BARONESS GOODCHILD, DUCHESS OF OTHERLAND, MISS SILVERSTONE, MARCHIONESS OF BAILBURY and LADY VERYSOFT when turned up entitle the stall holder to take all the counters on her compartment on the board.\nWhen the trade cards Fruiterer, Grocer, Poulterer, Hosier, Earthenware Dealer, Pastrycook, Florist and Toy Dealer are played, the lady performing the trade turned up, must pay three counters to the centre compartment on the sheet or board.\nThe game may be varied by keeping in the pack two of the Bazaar cards, and making the game end the first that turns up.\nThe players will soon get familar with the names of the fair stall keepers, and the class of goods they have to sell.",
