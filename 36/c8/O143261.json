It was made for use by Coco Chanel in 1929. The selvage has the words \u2018Tricot Chanel\u2019 and its design registration number, 272020, stamped upon it.\n\nIn the early 1920s Chanel opened her own textile factory in Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine to cater for the demand for her signature silk-enriched wool and cotton jersey fabrics. This enabled her to control her own production and guarantee that Chanel fabrics were exclusive to her alone. Until around 1929, the factory was called 'Tricot Chanel'. After Chanel expanded into producing exclusive printed silks and other woven fabrics, the factory was renamed 'Tissus Chanel'. \n\nChanel used printed fabrics for coat linings worn with matching dresses, which became one of her design trademarks.This is a woven fabric stamped 'Tricot Chanel', so is probably one of Chanel's first fabric prints before the factory's official name change.",
