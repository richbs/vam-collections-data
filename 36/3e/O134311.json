Studied at Royal Dublin Society's Drawing School 1814-20, then worked in Dublin as portrait painter. Member of RHA 1826, resigned 1837, re-elected 1847. Moved to London, worked as Sir Thomas Lawrence's studio assistant, completing pictures after Lawrence's death 1830. Successful portrait practice with several distinguished sitters; the <u>Art Journal</u> listed him among six most eminent portraitists in 1843 (p570). Exhibited 72 works at the RA between 1830 and 1862, 28 at the BI 1832-63, one at the SBA 1851, and at the Royal Hibernian Academy. Travelled on Continent 1831-4, inspiring Italian subjects. Returned to Dublin 1847-52, then London to 1854, short visits to USA 1854 and 1855, Rome 1856-8, Leamington, Warwickshire, until 1862. Travelled to Belfast, Paris, Brussels and Rome, where he died September 1868. Buried alongside the poet John Keats. According to Strickland, Rothwell wrote he 'was given to the dream of a posthumous fame', but he had 'a high, an extravagant, opinion of his own powers as a painter'. \n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u> 1868, p245 (obit), 1872, p271; W G Strickland, <u>A Dictionary of Irish Artists II</u>, 1913, pp300-12 \n\n\n<b>The Little Roamer</b> \nFAI77 \nCanvas, 126.9 X 84.4 cm (50 X 33 \u00bcins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1843, with the unattributed quotation 'her path 'mid flowers' added in parentheses after the title. The <u>Art Union</u> critic described it as 'A child who has been gathering flowers, and is now resting against a bank. The assumed ease of her position has an appearance of awkwardness. The head is most forcibly painted, and the background is rich to a degree'.\n\nEXH: RA 1843 (257) \n\nLIT: <u>Art Union</u> 1843, p167 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
