The image was one of a number of geometric patterns that General Motors employees created as a diagnostic tool to check the quality of the computer's cathode ray tube (CRT) display. The patterns were automatically recorded on film by a CRT recorder, then printed.\n\nComputer graphics produced by General Motors staff were exhibited at Cybernetic Serendipity, an exhibition held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. This image and others are also included in the book published to accompany the exhibition (p.95) \n\nThe V&amp;A's copy of the photograph was donated by the Computer Arts Society, which organised a number of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
