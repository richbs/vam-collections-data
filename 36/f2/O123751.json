Several factories in Staffordshire specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This figurine was produced as a souvenir of John Liston (1776-1846). \n\nDespite a rather serious temperament, John Liston became one of the greatest comedians of all time, achieving his greatest successes in farce, particularly at the Haymarket Theatre after 1818 when he became the mainstay of their summer seasons.  He is seen here as the cockney pot boy Sam Swipes in Theodore Hook's play Exchange No Robbery which he first played at the Haymarket on 12th August 1820.  Liston was the first comic actor to command a salary greater than a tragedian, earning the vast salary of sixty to a hundred pounds a week in the 1830s with Madam Vestris's company at the Olympic Theatre.  He retired in 1837 after a stage career which lasted over thirty years.",
