The Spanish-born couturier, Cristobal Balenciaga (1895-1972) had set up in business there in 1937 in partnership with the hat designer Vladzio d'Attainville. At its height, the business had four dress-making, four tailoring and two millinery workshops. \n\nHats were made bespoke to complete couture clients' outfits. The etiquette of the period dictated that hats be worn on all formal occasions, even when going out for a meal in a restaurant or to a performance at the theatre. Elaborate hats such as this example would have been worn to cocktail parties or to dinner.\n\nGloria Guinness, to whom this hat belonged, commented: 'hats must be made on your head. A ready-made hat will not be you!  While I am sitting for a dress, I sit ten minutes longer, and Monsieur Balenciaga works on a hat.'",
