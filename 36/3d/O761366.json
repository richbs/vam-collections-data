James Hurdis, D.D. (1763-1801), Professor of Poetry in Oxford University (1793), and Rector of Bishopstone (1791). On his father's death, his mother married a doctor of Southampton , and went to live in France, where J.H.H. remained until he was apprenticed, probably at his own initative (for his people were in easy circumstances), to James Heath, the engraver. He lived at Ketches, Newick, near Lewes, and was a member of the Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Society, for whose publications he often made illustrations. Although always practising as an amateur, he worked industriously, sometimes in the style of George Cruikshank, whose friendship he made at an early stage in his career. He died at Southampton in 1857.\n\n[...]\n\nVillage Humstrums. Proof printed in 1926 from the plate in the possession of Mrs. Pearson.\n<i>Signed</i> J.H.
