In the centre of the back is a tiny circle of hollie point with a long narrow insertion leading down to the neck edge. The back is tightly gathered into the circle and has been ironed along the pleated lines and also across them to form two crescent-shaped outside pieces. The broad front pieces has a stamped design and is decorated with a rosette of bobbin lace which is pinned with an 18th-century pin to the left-hand side. With 18th-century fold marks.\n[Shirt] Shirt cut with a front opening and shoulder seams. The sleeves are gathered into the square armhole and there are square gussets under the arms. The shirt is decorated with a frill of bobbin lace round the neck but presumably was originally stamped with patterns to match those of the cap.",
