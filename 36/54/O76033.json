Like other designers of the time, he firmly believed that mass-produced furniture could be well designed and sold at affordable prices. His earliest furniture designs were notable for their new forms and for the exceptional use of new materials. Robin Day\u2019s modernist philosophy was shared by the British company Hille, with whom he has worked consistently since 1950. Day designed the Q Stak chair in 1953 as low-cost seating for use in caf\u00e9s, meeting rooms and places requiring inexpensive and strong stackable chairs. The Q Stak was extremely practical and enjoyed a long production life. It was produced in several versions so that it would appeal to as wide an audience as possible. One version was the non-stacking Q Rod with straight steel rod legs (see Museum no. Circ.239-1960).",
