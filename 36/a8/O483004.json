This type of wraparound skirt is more usually made from silk, which does pleat well, so it seems the traditional style held sway whatever the fabric.  The detail shows one set of six pleats, arranged in two groups facing the centre of the panel.  Each pleat is stitched vertically along its folded edge in the manner of a French seam.  All of them are held in place with a horizontal line of long, light blue stitches indicating the the skirt has never been worn.  There is no decoration here and the garment derives its beauty from the handle of the fabric and its rich indigo-blue colouring.  Historically, hemp was a major textile fibre cultivated and processed in China.  It was ousted by cotton as the main material for everyday wear but is occasionally used today.",
