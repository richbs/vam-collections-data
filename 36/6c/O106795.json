They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. This plaquette and inv.no. A.447-1910 were copied from a silvered copper inkwell here in the V&A. Their moulded edges suggest that they probably formed part of a casket or a similar inkwell.",
