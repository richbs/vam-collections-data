F.3086 The inscription is difficult to interpret. The drawing is obviously not by Leonardo follower Pietro Rizzo, or Giampietrino, to whom it is ascribed in the Ionides Catalogue. It is nearer to Sebastinao Ricci, though not by him. Andrews suggests that it may be by the same hand as a drawing in the National Gallery of Scotland ascribed by him to Lionello Spada (loc. Cit., fig. 780).",
