It has no means of fastening, and the bars on the back suggest that it was originally threaded on a band of material.  This would allow it to be worn as a bazuband, a three-part ornament worn mainly by men in Persia and northern India on the upper arm.  The bazuband was not usually worn in Anatolia.  The type of filigree is more suggestive of the Yemen than Anatolia, but the bazuband was not typically worn there either.",
