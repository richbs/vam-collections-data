Born in 1968, he trained at the Eindhoven Design Academy then graduated from London's Royal College of Art in 1994. \nWith his partner, glass artist Emma Woffenden, he began his career making glassware from recycled bottles (Transglass, 1997). He started designing eyewear and watches for Alexander McQueen in 1998 and the following year gained notice for his brutalist Rough-and-Ready furniture at Tate Modern.\n\nHis design aesthetic changed radically with his daughter's birth in 2000. In 2002, drawing inspiration from flowers and lace, he created the Garland light for Habitat and the delicate Blossom chandelier for Swarovski. The latter, a simple, asymmetric form, completely transformed a very traditional object type. In 2003, Boontje designed the V&amp;A Swarovski crystal Christmas tree in collaboration with Alexander McQueen.\n\nBoontje started teaching at the Royal College of Art in 2002, becoming Professor and Head of Design Products in 2009 after several years spent in France. His Studio has collaborated with many major international companies and his work, which continues to win awards, is represented in the collections of a number of public museums and galleries chiefly in Britain, Holland and the USA.",
