Fanny Cerrito gave this pink and white fan as a souvenir to Marie Taglioni when dancing the pas de quatre at Her Majesty's Theatre July 12th 1845.  Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, Lucile Grahn.\" \nOne of several fans in the Cyril Beaumont Collection owned by Marie Taglioni.  \nThe fan was probably part of the London Archives of the Dance, and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\nA collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and from Taglioni's niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi, after Taglioni's death.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: If this is indeed a gift to mark the performance of the Pas de Quatre, then it is an early surviving example of the 'first night gifts' tradition that still survives.",
