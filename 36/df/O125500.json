            "physical_description": "The chasuble is of Chinese white silk damask, sixteenth-seventeenth century, woven with a stylized lotus pattern. To this are applied embroidered motifs- stylized plants, fleurs-de-lys, and six-winged seraphs on wheels- of the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The orphreys show pairs of anonymous bearded saints, probably apostles, beneath triple architectural canopies. On the front orphrey there are three such pairs. On the back orphrey there are two pairs, and the Holy Trinity in the form of three enthroned figures wearing papal tiaras; in each of the two panels which have been added to form the arms of the cross-orphrey is an angel holding a heart pierced with many wounds.\n\nSilver-gilt thread and coloured silks in split stitch, couched work and raised work on linen. The use of silk instead of gold for the background is very unusual.\n\nFrom 'Opus Anglicanum:English Medieval Embroidery', The Victoria and Albert Museum, London:The Arts Council, 1963, p. 49.",
