It is a fragment of a larger hanging, which formerly hung in the choir of St Gereon's Church, Cologne, and may have been woven in that city. \n\nOther surviving fragments of the tapestry in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremburg, and the Musee des Tissus, Lyon, show a design of roundels containing griffins attacking bullocks. This was possibly based on an eighth century Byzantine silk found in a tomb in St Ursula's Church, Cologne.",
