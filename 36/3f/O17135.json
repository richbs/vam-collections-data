            "public_access_description": "This superbly executed bronze vase is the product of many traditions of Japanese art, not only of metalworking. The decorative inlay techniques derive from those employed by the makers of sword fittings, the naturalistic depiction of nature from the Shijo school of painting (which developed in the later 18th century) and the overall composition from the Rimpa school founded in the early 17th century. The skills required to decorate metal objects of this type became available as a result of the downfall of the ruling military government of Japan in 1868, and the eventual banning in 1876 of the wearing of swords in public. The traditional market for decorative metalwork on weapons and armour effectively disappeared and craftsmen had to quickly find new outlets for their talents.\n\nThe advent of the great world expositions in the 19th century (in which the Japanese government was actively involved) gave Japanese craftsmen an opportunity to excel in the production of sumptuous decorative objects, such as this vase. This particular example was bought directly from the Universal Exhibition at Amsterdam in 1883 from the Kiryu Kosho Kaisha (The First Japanese Manufacturing and Trading Company) which had been set up following Japan's great success at the 1873 Vienna World Exhibition in order to promote traditional Japanese craft industries. The vase was produced by the notable bronze-caster Suzuki Chokichi (1848-1919).",

ISBN 1851773088.\nAlthough acquisitions of Chinese material in the nineteenth century consisted predominantly of imperial objects from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, purchases of Japanese  material during the same period centred on contemporary manufactures, often from international exhibitions (cats. 10-11). This extraordinary vase displays the virtuoso craftsmanship that the Museum sought to represent in its collections at that time, and, indeed, it was purchased at the Universal Exhibition in Amsterdam in 1883, directly from the Kiritsu (Kiryu) Kosho Kaisha of Tokyo, a company set up to promote traditional Japanese craft industries.\nFollowing the downfall of the ruling military government of Japan in 1868, and the eventual banning in 1876 of the wearing of swords in public, the market for decorative metalwork on weapons and armour effectively disappeared. Consequently, craftsmen had to find new outlets for their talents. This superbly executed bronze vase, produced by the notable bronze-caster Suzuki Chokichi, is one such example. It combines the decorative inlay techniques derived from the manufacture of sword fittings, the naturalistic depiction of nature from the Shijo school of painting, and the overall composition of the Rimpa (Sotatsu-Korin) school.\n\n\nLit.
