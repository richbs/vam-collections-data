            "physical_description": "Of wood japanned black except where stated.  Supported on six legs all with casters surmounted by a band of brass beading; one at each end of the sofa at the back, of circular section and curving outwards from the seat rail.  Four at the front, all with pad feet.  The two outside legs at the front are cabriole with a flattened front side decorated with a gilt foliate motif above and below the knee which is decorated with a leaf shape with gilt serrated edges fitted with random mother of pearl inlay with white painted dotted decoration.  Above the knee the legs continue as arm supports.  The two outer front legs have a band of gilding all round their front edges; their backs are undecorated and angular.  The two inner front legs are similarly decorated, except that their knees are very flattened and they do not rise above the seat rail.  The front seat rails curve outwards between the four legs and each of these three curves is decorated with a central elongated spray of flowers painted naturalistically in colours, bordered on the lower curved edge with a band of gilding with foliate motifs.  The side chair rails curve round to the back legs and are decorated with a single central gilt band.  The back seat rail is straight except at its ends and undecorated.  The seat is heavily upholstered and covered with a modern purple damask with black edging.  The insides of the arms and arm suppports are decorated with gilt foliate scrollwork surround by a gilt band.  Their outsides are bordered by a band of gilding.  The arms have small upholstered pads and bend outwards at the juncture with the arm supports where they are decorated on top with a gilt leaf.  A similar gilt leaf decorates them before they bend inwards to meet the back.  The back is formed as three oval frames, the central one elongated horizontally and much larger the other two.  Each oval is supported on two scrolled supports rising from the back seat rail and decorated with gilt foliate ornament.  The two side ovals are decorated at the top with a wavy cresting veneered with plates of mother of pearl.  The oval frame itself is decorated with a band of random mother of pearl inlay with white paint dotted decoration enclosed by two gilt bands, one enclosing with an inner scalloped gilt band.  Inside the oval frame at the bottom are two scrolled X shaped supports at the top similarly decorated.  These hold an oval frame decorated with gilt bands enclosing a chain of circular inlaid pieces of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 connected by a broken gilt band, with fret-cut gilt foliate extensions at the top centre and sides.  Within this frame and connected to it by 'bridges' at the four main axes, decorated with gilt circles, is an oval plaque surrounded by a gilt band and filled with flowers painted naturalistically in colours.  The two outside oval sections of the back curve round to meet the arms.  They are connected to the straight centre oval by hour-glass shaped intermediate sections decorated at top and bottom with gilt folioate and scrolled motifs.  The central elongated oval is decorated identically to the side ovals except that the inner oval frame is held by three X shapes at the bottom and four scrolls (the two centre ones smaller) at the top.  Also it appears that its central painted plaque is of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.  The rear of the back is completely undecorated.",

It became popular in Britain during the eighteenth century when the term was first coined, probably by French immigrant craftsmen working in the trade. At first it was used in pulp form for architectural mouldings and frames. As technology progressed a technique of moulding laminated sheets of paper was developed. The durable waterproof nature of this material meant it could be used for anything from trays, boxes and screens to chairs, pianos and even carriages.\n\nUnlike wood, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was not prone to warping which could cause large areas of painted decoration to crack, or inlay to lift. It was therefore ideally suited to the decorative techniques of japanning, gilding and pearl inlay found on this sofa.  The durability of some forms of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 meant that it could be cut, joined and inlaid like wood, but furniture was usually made up of a combination of wood and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 components.  Here the frame of the sofa is constructed in wood while the three medallions set into the seat back are made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.",
