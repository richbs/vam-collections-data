This was collected by Herbert Ingleby, of Valentines,  Ilford, London,  who in 1891 sold to the museum part of his  collection of Norwegian objects.  A curator noted on file: 'I went to  Valentines at Mr Inglesby's invitation, on Saturday last &amp; saw the  remainder of his collection of Norwegian objects, which he has  gathered together during his travels in Norway.  On the whole,  the specimens which he has left at the Museum appear to me to  be a very fair selection from his collection, most of the forms being  represented as well as the designs.' \n\nRichard Adamson, curator, wrote on 6th October 1891: 'This is a  very interesting collection of Norwegian examples of wood carving  and would be of use for circulation to schools.  The price asked is  very reasonable. I recommend the purchase of the selection  made. The total is \u00a366.0.0.' The objects selected are museum  numbers 569 to 602-1891. Six further objects were sent to the  Museum of Science and Art at Edinburgh, and five to Dublin  Museum. Registered File: Ingleby, Herbert.\n\nCollections of Norwegian folk art were  formed both in Norway  and elsewhere in Europe  and America  from the 1880s onwards.   In Norway folk arts were seen as symbolic of  Norwegian   nationalism, since Norway was still under Swedish  rule until it  gained independence in  1905.  In Norway there was  increased  interest in traditional culture. Collecting and   displaying peasant  folk art in national museums, particularly the  Norsk Folkemuseum  near  Oslo, founded in 1894, and the  development of 'Husflid '  (literally \u2018House Industry\u2019) was  seen as  a way of promoting Norway's  economic development.  In other  parts of Europe,  designers looked to  Norwegian peasant crafts  as a relatively untouched folk tradition.   Wooden  artifacts were  admired for the visual impact of their bold and simple designs",
