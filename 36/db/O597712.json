Dorothy George, <u>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum IX</u>, London, 1949\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n'Cruikshank states that he engraved this after seeing the gibbet at the Old Bailey when women had been hanged for passing forged \u00a31 notes, that its publication stopped the issue of \u00a31 notes by the Bank of England, that hanging for forgery ceased, and the resumption of cash payments followed. Actually, Romilly raised the matter on 25 Feb. 1818, alluding to the execution of two women (18 Feb.); it was taken up by Macintosh who associated the forgeries with Bank Restriction, see No. 13197. A Royal Commission was agreed to on 13 May 1818, to examine methods of preventing forgery by the better printing of notes. Many notes were (optimistically) submitted to them as forgery-proof, and a preliminary report was made on 22 Jan. 1819. 'Parl. Deb.' xxxvii. 612 f.; xxxviii. 272 ff., 432-5, 555 f., 671 ff.; xxxix. 73-8. 'Examiner', 1818, pp. 92, 190, 267, 621, 802, &c. Executions for forgery continued: the death penalty was abolished by a series of acts from 1830 to 1837. The agitation relating to forged notes continued throughout 1818 and in 1819. This plate was advertised in 'The Times' as published 26 Jan.; a description of the note in the 'Examiner' of 24 Jan. (p. 58) suggests a slightly earlier issue. The relatives of Hone claim that he designed the plate, and in 1878 a dispute arose between him and the Cruikshank family: Cruikshank considered it the 'great event of his artistic life'. A rough sketch, supposed to show Hone's pencillings, and dated 12 January 1819, is reproduced, Hackwood, 'William Hone', 1912, p. 203. See Idem, pp. 191, 198-205; Jerrold, 'George Cruikshank', 1882, i. 90-4. The note was sold with No. 13199. Owing to the great demand a second plate was engraved, impressions from both are in the Print Room. See Nos. 13198 A, 13200, 13407. For other imitation notes cf. Nos. 10123, &c., 11780.\nReid, No. 965. Reissued, Hone's 'Facetiae', 1827.
