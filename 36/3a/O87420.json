Originally the lotus flowers, attached to bamboo sticks, would probably have been pushed through the holes in the larger textile pieces. These fragments were recovered from the site of Miran on the eastern verge of the Taklamakan desert. At this site material was discovered at a Buddhist shrine abandoned in the 4rd or 5th century AD.    \n\nThe site is part of an area of Central Asia we now call  the Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia, from China to Europe.  The most notable item traded was silk.  Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed the goods from oasis to oasis.  The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas. The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas \u2013 while silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in this way.\n\nThese textile fragments were brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862\u20131943). The Victoria and Albert Museum has around 700 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein  at the beginning of the twentieth century. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals.",

Stein excavated an ancient fort and remains of a Buddhist sanctuary there in 1907 and uncovered spectacular Buddhist murals in its temples and stupas. These depicted winged figures with garlands; imagery which he identified with the mythology and style of Persia and Greece. The appearance of the signature \"Tita\" led Stein to conclude that the paintings were the work of an artist from the eastern Mediterranean. Temple sculpture, including a colossal Buddha head, was rendered in the opulent Gandharan style of northwest India. Stein called this fusion of regional styles Graeco-Buddhist and determined that the site had flourished in the first centuries of the millennium, when trade along the southern Silk Road had thrived. The V&A holds, on loan, from Miran, silk and wool fragments, and a group of lotus flowers made of cotton and silk and fragments of a painted cotton temple hanging.",
