Previous attempts by designers to introduce the use of prefabricated rooms, or parts of rooms, had failed in the 1930s and 1950s. This 'new bathroom program', however, was advertised as a convenient way to easily create the bathroom you want through the arrangement of different ready-made units. The attractive yellow and orange of these units was a bright and fun 'pop' addition to the mid-1970s, and the use of moulded plastic in the shape of a fruit segment for the vanity drawers brought a humorous though practical element as it was lightweight and easy to clean. The efficient use of space for storing all the gadgets and products that people were being encouraged to buy was an important issue by the 1970s.\n   Beginning in the early 1920s, Poggenpohl was one of the first companies to produce standardised kitchen and bathroom units in series in Europe. During the 1960s they introduced modern strip handles and covered their cupboards in brightly coloured, gloss-laminate finishes.\"",
