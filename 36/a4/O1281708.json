The original book was designed by the Russian artist and designer Alexander Rodchenko. A few years after publication, during Stalin's purges, several of the party officials whose portraits appeared in the volume fell out of favour and were removed from office. Rodchenko defaced his own copy of the book, obliterating the portraits with thick black Indian ink. Ken Campbell has said how he found this 'an absolutely terrifying image; not a comment on the Soviet system, more a comment on the nature of censorship and self-censorship'. In this artist's book, enlarged photographic reproductions of the defaced portraits are printed opposite brief political biographies of the individuals, including their fates (where known). The portraits are printed in a frame, reminiscent of an icon. Some of the frames show where Campbell has fired staple guns into the zinc printing plates, so that the printing technique itself reflects the violence of the subject matter.",
