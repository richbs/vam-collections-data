He discovered his talent for  woodcutting and engraving when introduced to it by the artists James Pryde and William Nicholson. He produced his first wood engraving in 1893, and by 1899 he had engraved nearly 200 blocks, specialising in the new technique of 'white line' wood engravings in which the lines are un-inked and the image emerges from the surrounding ink. \n\nThis is one of several engravings Craig made in preparation for his 1912 production of Hamlet at the Moscow Art Theatre. It was used in the 1928 German arts press edition of Hamlet, printed by Count Harry Kessler's Cranach Press in Weimar. With typefont designed by Edward Johnston, the book consisted of Gerhart Hauptman's translation of the second quarto of Shakespeare's play. An English version was printed in 1930. Craig worked on the illustrations for over a period of 17 years, developing his designs from his 1912 production.\n\nCraig continued wood engraving but after 1900 developed a career as a stage designer and director with revolutionary ideas of staging and lighting. He broke with accepted traditions of stage realism and moved towards minimalist staging with innovative lighting, although many of his projects were abandoned due to his inability to compromise.",
