It is an exact copy of a shield by the celebrated French metalworker, Antoine Vechte. The original is also in the Museum's collection and was bought from from Le Page Moutier of Paris at the Great Exhibition in 1851.\n\nAs an electrotype this shield is an example of a 19th-century design model. Electrotype copies were used as design aids for students in the government schools of design under the aegis of the Department of Science and Art. \n\nElectrotypes play a key role in helping us to understand the V&A in its earliest days. The Museum bought electrotypes as part of a growing collection of reproductions. This collection enabled students to look closely at objects that were otherwise inaccessible. Electrotypes provided the same function as the Museum\u2019s collection of plaster casts.",

            "history_note": "This shield was bought by the Museum in 1854 from Elkington and Co. of New Hall Street, Birmingham for \u00a34.15s. It is an exact copy of an embossed and chased shield by Antoine Vechte which the Museum bought from Le Page Moutier of Paris at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Its decoration incorporates portraits of poets and scenes from their works: Ariosto (1474-1533), Ruggiero rescues Angelica (Orlando Furioso, X, 92-115); Tasso (1544-95), Carlo and Ubaldo in search of Rinaldo (Gerusalemme Liberata, XV, 55-66); Dante (1265-1321), the centaur Cacus attacked by snakes (Inferno, XXV, 16-24); Petrarch (1304-74), the poet laments the captive state of Italy (Rime CXXVIII, and letters to Emperor Charles IV). \n\nDuring the nineteenth century the art of fine metal chasing was extolled as true to Renaissance craftsmanship. Antoine Vechte was its master. Lauded as the new Cellini, his vases, candelabra and shields were highlights of the metals manufacturers' stands at international exhibitions. Vechte established his reputation in Paris, but worked in London from about 1849 to 1862.\n\nElectrotype copies were used as design aids for students in the government schools of design under the aegis of the Department of Science and Art. This one is described in the Museum's 19th-century registers of electrotypes as:\n\n\"'54.-44. VECHTE. - SHIELD, repouss\u00e9 or beaten work, with allegorical subjects from the Italian poets. French, modern. The original, in iron, by A. Vechte, is in the South Kensington Museum No. 1485-'52. Diam. 2ft. 3in. <i>Messrs Elkington and Co.</i>\"\n\nHistorical significance: As an electrotype this shield is an example of a 19th-century design model. Electrotypes play a key role in helping us to understand the V&A in its earliest days.\n\nThe V&A grew largely out of the Great Exhibition in 1851 and, under the guidance of Henry Cole, sought to arrest the perceived decline in British design. The Museum aimed, initially, to collect \u2018modern manufactures\u2019 for the education of manufacturers, designers and the public. Cole was also in charge of the Government Schools of Design, which he set about reforming. Cole passionately believed in the potential of both museums and the schools of design, to raise standards of taste.\n\nThe appointment of John Charles Robinson as curator of the Museum  in 1853 heralded a change in focus. Robinson persuaded Cole that historic works of art were as instructive as contemporary work. For Cole and Robinson, if historic works of art could not be acquired, copies were the next best option.\n\nThe Museum bought electrotypes as part of its growing collection of reproductions. This collection enabled students to look closely at both modern and historic objects that were otherwise inaccessible. Electrotypes provided the same function as the Museum\u2019s collection of plaster casts.\n\nElectrotypes are also relics of 19th-century industrialisation and mass production. The process of electroplating and electrotyping  favoured companies that could afford large factories and expensive technology. The power of the machinery and new technology now at the disposal of the silver industry allowed modern mass production to develop. Electroplaters could create thousands of identical objects using a fraction of the amount of silver to create \u201ca degree of mechanical finish it would be difficult to surpass\u201d (<i>Art Union</i>, 1846). The focus of silver and silver product manufacture moved from London to the new factories of Birmingham and Sheffield.\n\nSome smaller companies trying to keep pace with industrial change suffered. The large vats of potassium cyanide required spacious, well-ventilated factories. A report at the Great Exhibition claimed workers in smaller companies suffered blistered skin, headaches temporary blindness and nausea.",

            "historical_context_note": "This shield is an electrotype, an exact copy in metal of another object. Electrotypes were a by-product of the invention of electroplating (silver plating by electrolysis).\n\nELECTROPLATING: Electricity revolutionised the trade of coating base metal objects with silver. Patented by Elkington and Company on 25th March 1840, this technique was the fulfilment of a century of research into the effects of electricity on metals. A negatively charged silver bar, suspended in a vat of potassium cyanide, deposited a coating of silver on a positively charged base metal (mostly copper, later nickel-silver) object immersed with it. Electroplated objects were fully formed in base metal before plating. \n\nELECTROGILDING exploited the same technique but used gold bars instead of silver. It was safer than traditional mercury gilding. \n\nELECTROFORMING transferred the metal deposits directly into the moulds in the plating vats. When enough metal had been deposited to create a self-supporting object the mould was removed. Developed by Alexander Parkes, electroforms so accurately mirrored the moulds in which they were created that multiple copies could be created (ELECTROTYPES).\n\nDuring the electrotyping process a mould was taken of the original object. In this mould a copper type pattern was electroformed. From this type pattern subsequent moulds were created in which electrotypes were formed. This dish was therefore electroformed in copper from moulds made from a type pattern which itself was electroformed in a mould of the original. The copper electrotype was then electrogilded.\n\nEarly experiments in electroplating, often by amateur scientists using Elkington's home electroplating kits, involved coating fruit, flowers and animals in silver or gold \"with the most perfect accuracy\". They \"retained all the characteristics of the specimens before their immersion\" (<i>Penny Magazine</i>, 1844). The <i>Art Journal</i> enthused in same year, \"The electrotypes are perfect; the finest lines, the most minute dots are as faithfully copied as the boldest objections\" \n\nHenry Cole, the first director of the South Kensington Museum (V&A), quickly grasped the educational potential of this new technique. He employed Elkington's and Franchi & Son of Clerkenwell to take moulds of historic and modern objects in the Museum (at their own risk), create copies in a base metal and then electroplate them. These could be sold freely as reproductions, with a gold, silver or bronze finish, provided they bore the South Kensington Museum's official stamp. To avoid breaking English hallmarking laws, all marks were to be deleted from copies of silver objects. Copies were made of successful modern objects as well as historic works of art\n\nElkington's display of electrotypes at the 1867 Paris Exhibition proved extremely popular and prompted Cole to organise a convention at which 14 European countries agreed to exchange works of art. Representatives of Elkington's and the V&A sent staff to Germany, Sweden, France, Denmark and Hungary. The most ambitious trip, to Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1880, secured copies of over 200 items from the Kremlin and the Hermitage, including the celebrated Jerningham Wine Cooler and much Elizabethan and Stuart silver sent as ambassadorial gifts to the Tsars. By 1920 the V&A held over 2000 electrotypes. Copies toured the country as part of the museum's educational programmes and were sold to the public and to museums and art schools.\n\nElkingtons were a commercial giant selling electrotypes for profit as well as instruction. A variety of finishes met a range of tastes and budgets. This electrotype of the Italian Poets Shield was reproduced to look as close to the original as possible. Its copper body was electroplated in silver and then oxidised to resemble the chased steel of Vechte's creation. Elkingtons offered the electrotypes in a range of finishes to cater for varying tastes: copper bronzed for \u00a33.15s, silvered and oxidised for \u00a34.15s, parcel-gilt (ie partly gilded) for \u00a36.15s and gilt for \u00a37.7s.",
