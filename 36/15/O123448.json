            "public_access_description": "This scene is reported to have been partly taken from the Mall as it stood in 1812 and partly composed. The area that was called the Kensingtom Gravel Pits is now known as Notting Hill Gate. In the nineteenth century the area was considered to have fresh, unpolluted air and ragarded as a resort for health and holidays. William Mulready lived and worked in this area from around 1811. It was also a neighbourhood that was popular with other artists such as A.W. Callcott, John Linnell, William Collins and David Wilkie, all of whose work is represented in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nThis painting, dated to 1811/12 preceded a later work of 1812/13 entitled  Near the Mall, Kensington Gravel Pits, number FA.135 in the V&A.",

Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \n\nThe Mall, Kensington Gravel Pits\nFA136 Neg 69197 \nCanvas, 35.3 \u00d7 48.5 cm (14 \u00d7 19 \u00bc ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nHeleniak (78) dates the work to 1811/12. Originally commissioned by A W Callott on behalf of Mr W Horsley but rejected because of its excessive detail. Stephens claims that the painting went to Mr Thomas Welch before entering the Sheepshanks collection, but Mulready's account book and the Cole manuscript indicate that it went to Mr Welbank. It was originally rejected by the RA and not exhibited there until 1844. \nThe Examiner, 1844, p309, wrote: \n'Mulready has two small landscape subjects painted many years back, for which we would gladly give the two finest Ostades we ever saw (if they happened to be ours to give) ...' Twenty years later in 1864 when again exhibited at the Royal Academy (34), it was described as being 'repaired under Mr Mulready's sanction, but again cracking'. \n\nEXH: \tRA 1844 (330, 'Painted in 1811); Society of Arts 1848 (XXV, 'Painted in 1812'); William Mulready South Kensington Museum 1864 (34); RA 1951-2 (228); 1964 (6); Philadelphia Museum of Art 1968 (147); John Linnell and his Circle, Colnaghi 1973 (122); Tate Gallery, Landscape in Britain, 1973 (240); William Mulready V&A 1986 (22) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
