The central carved shield above the proscenium arch bears the intertwined carved letters RC for the name Richard Codman. The photograph was taken some time between 1936 and 1951 by the puppeteer, author and leading figure in the revival of British puppetry in the mid 20th century, Waldo S. Lanchester (1897-1978).  \n\nThe Codman family was a veritable Punch dynasty. The Liverpool booth was established by Richard Codman l in 1868. His son Richard ll took over the pitch in 1888, succeeding in turn to his son Richard lll, while other Codmans worked in Llanduddno and Colwyn Bay. For the Codman family Punch and Judy was their life., despite its hardships. As Jack Codman once said: 'The Codmans never retire from the show. They transfer from one box to another.'",

They moved to Stratford Upon Avon in 1951. Since this photograph is stamped verso 'Photograph by Waldo S. Lanchester, The Marionette Theatre, Malvern, Worcs.' it dates it to between 1936 and 1951, so this photograph dates from between",
