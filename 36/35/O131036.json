Coloured paper and different colours of ink and typeface, such as are used here, made the posters more eye-catching.\n\nOrf\u00e9e aux Enfers, or Orpheus in the Underworld, opened on 30 April 1877 and ran for four months at the Alhambra, Leicester Square. Orf\u00e9e aux Enfers is often described as the first full-length operetta, and influenced the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. First performed in Paris in 1858, it updates the myth of Orpheus\u2019 attempted rescue of Eurydice and included topical allusions and jokes.  It also introduced the famous dance, the cancan, when the gods of Olympus, bored with goodness, descend to Hell. The Alhambra\u2019s production, with its vast procession scene of 300 extras, was important for its inclusion of choreography by Henri Justamant (1815-1890) whose career focused on creating dances for f\u00e9eries in France, Berlin and London but who also worked at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Brussels (1861-1864) and at the Paris Opera (1869-70). Orf\u00e9e aux Enfers marked Justamant\u2019s return to the Alhambra having mounted his most famous production, Voyage dans la Lune, at the theatre two years earlier.",
