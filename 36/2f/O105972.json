One critic declared that Plunkett, born in Belgium, and Elssler were 'the most authentic Andalusians' - a comment that was received with incredulity by native Spanish dancers. \nIn the 19th century ballet, a 'national' costume was an adaptation of a typical ballet dress (low neck, pointed fitted bodice and bell-shaped, knee-length skirt), and add one or two features characteristic of the relevant country.  So Spanish = small bolero, hair pulled back into a comb, flounces on the skirt and castanets; Indian = short-sleeved top, fitted to under the bust, long earrings and multicoloured gem necklaces and belts.",

La Manola in the ballet La Favourite was her most famous dance.  \nThe print is No. 12 in the series, Les Danseuses de l'Opera, published ca. 1860.  There were 14 in total, all the work of Alophe.\nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

            "historical_context_note": "By 1860, photography had become a viable commercial medium, and several of the prints in the series Les Danseuses de l'Opera seem to be copies of photographs.  Maybe this was because most photographs were quite small and, of course, sepia toned; translated into lithographs, they could be larger and then hand coloured, making them more suitable for display.",
