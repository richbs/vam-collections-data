The stoneware body of this piece has been glazed in a modified version of the sancai  three-colour scheme of the Tang dynasty, known as Song sancai.",

The decoration is incised and painted on white slip beneath green, yellow and transparent lead glazes. \nNote: Liao Dynasty potters continued a style of colour known to collectors as sancai. This pillow was decorated in this 'song sancai' style. The sides have a characteristic bamboo-leaf and flower-bud pattern. Its main elements are delineated by lines carved through slip and glaze - a way of trying to control the spread of different colours during firing.\nChapter 5: Northern 'Popular' Wares - Cizhou\n'Cizhou' covers a wide variety of wares manufactured in many different kilns in many northern provinces. Made during Liao Dynasty to late Qing Dynasty. Range of body types, glazes and decorative techniques. Were domestic wares and not made for export.\n\nMargaret Medley:\nTz'u-chou wares - white slip covers greyish or buff stoneware. The carving is done with a fine blade held at a slight angle and the incising is done with a fine point.\nCizhou: buff or grey-firing clay is typical of northern coal fields. The slip is made from secondary (i.e. sedimentary) kaolins.",
