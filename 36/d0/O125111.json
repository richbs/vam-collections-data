            "public_access_description": "This drawing is possibly a preparatory drawing for a lost painting commissioned to Federico Barocci in 1556 in Urbino, Italy, his native city. It shows the Martyrdom of St Margaret of Antioch, characterised by the dragon represented beside her. St Margaret of Antioch was martyred in the 4th century A.D.  The drawing shows the stylistic influence of such mannerist painter as Federico Zuccaro with whom Barocci worked in Rome. The drawing is generally dated from his early career.",

Forlani-Tempesta, 1996).\nThe drawing shows in fact St Margaret whose traditional attribute is a dragon. Her story is related in the <i>Golden Legend</i> by Jacobus of Voragine: the dragon usually depicted beside her represents an allegory of the devil and her fight against it. She was martyred under Diocletian's reign in the 4th century A.D. \nThis drawing is possibly a preparatory drawing, i. e. <i>modello</i>, for a painting now lost that Barocci executed for the confraternity of the Corpus Domini in Urbino in 1556. The description of this painting by Bellori corresponds to the compositional arrangement of the drawing. It is however impossible to prove that this drawing was executed in preparation for this commission. Stylistically the present drawing shows features that belong to Barocci early career, related to the work in Casino of Pius IV and to the drawing <i>The virgin and Child enthroned under a canopy, with ST Roch and St Sebastian</i> in Chatsworth. This drawing can therefore be dated c. 1556.",
