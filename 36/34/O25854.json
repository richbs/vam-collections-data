Harry Rogers and Charles Henry Bennett entwined.\n\nProof of border for the book illustration E.1024-1998 for opposite 'The Farewell' for the 1861 edition of 'Quarles' Emblems'.  W. Harry Rogers drew on wood for this engraving to be made by a wood-engraver.\n\nThere is a frame consisting of sharp horizontal and vertical creases enclosing the border and visible on both the front and back.  This framework of creases may have been used to line up the border with the book illustration which it is intended to frame.\n\n\n\n\"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.' - REV.
