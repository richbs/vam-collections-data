The embroidery is placed as a band along both sides of the shoulder, both sides of the arm holes, all along the hem [A], a triangular medallion form [B] on the upper back, in the upper corners of the two front panels [C] and a larger motif at the hem of both front corners [D].\n[A] a continuous band 13 cm deep of long narrow botehs with red stems, one predominantly white with purple and light blue facing left, and the other facing right, predominantly red and green either side of a small cypress tree motif in light blue and red, surmounted by two inward curving fronds alternating predominantly in red and green. The rest of the ground is totally covered in small embroidered details of leaves, fan shaped blossoms and stems.  The band terminates with a row of spikey plant forms pointing into the central black field.\nThe hem and shoulder edges are finished with a narrow 1.5 cm embroidered band with a black meander carrying red, green or light blue blossoms with white details.\n[B] an inverted lobed triangle on the upper central back densely packed with multi-coloured central 112 blue petalled rosette form which emanates thick curving stems in blue and red holding multi-coloured blossoms, botehs and leaves.  The lobed outline supports a series of pendants on curving brackets, terminating in a narrow isolated inverted cypress tree framed by U-shaped brackets.\n[C] a diagonal downward-pointing composite boteh, 20 cm long, containing 2 elongated boteh shapes and floral elements partially framed by two long, slender curving leaves.\n[D] a diagonal upward-pointing, 57 cm long, composite boteh containing 4 botehs, multi-coloured blossoms, leaves, stems and cypress trees partially framed by a meandering line of thick stems, blossoms and botehs.\nThe shoulder seam, armhole, hem and front panel edges are finished with tri-coloured silks forming a narrow chevron stripe [made by using two needles???].  In places this  is replaced by red silk also in chevron pattern.\nColours: Z2S wool: white, deep yellow, purple, 2 shades of red, green, light blue, pink, orange [faded], turquoise.\nVery high quality work.",
