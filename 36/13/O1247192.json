Mrs Stratton whose London premises were located at 104, Piccadilly, was commissioned to make the Princess's bridal dress and several other garments for her trousseau. This was a very prestigious commission which confirmed her position as one of London's leading court dressmakers.\n\nPrincess Beatrice (1857-1944) was Queen Victoria's youngest daughter. She married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896)  on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, in the Isle of Wight.",

The cuttings were preserved, and presumably taken, by Mrs Caroline Augusta Gammack (1852-1916) who worked as a stock keeper for Mrs Stratton. \n\nThese fabrics were used to make an evening dress. <i>The Graphic</i>, 'The Princess Beatrice's Trousseau', 27 July 1885, included this description. 'Very stylish was a costume of the hunting Stuart plaid velvet, made up with Chartreuse-coloured satin, and trimmed with a silk fringe in which the colours of the tartan were tastefully blended. The same mixtures were repeated in long beaded drops with small gold balls; the effect was very novel.'",
