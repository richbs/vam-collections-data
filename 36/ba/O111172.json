The sophisticated lustre technique had been transmitted to Italy from Spain, where it had been brought by Muslim craftsmen from the Middle East. A continuing link with the Middle East is shown by the subject matter of the decoration. The turbaned man portrayed here has been identified as the Ottoman sultan Mehmet II (1451-1481). Italians and other Europeans took a practical interest in their powerful Ottoman neighbours, and many portraits of the sultans appeared in prints, oil paintings, and other media.",
