The largest model had busts of old men for the handles (as here), in the middle-sized versions these handles were replaced with young women, and the smallest size had busts of little children.  This example is of true S\u00e8vres porcelain of about 1780, however it is thought that the decoration, although very fine, is not contemporary with its date of manufacture.  It may have been added at the same time the replacement cover was made for it, probably in the 1840s-60s period.",
