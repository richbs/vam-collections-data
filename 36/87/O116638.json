The necklace consists of 17 openwork plaques of various designs arranged symmetrically with an additional matching triangular plaque at each end with a bar across its outer edge for attaching to a ribbon.  A toggle bar has been added to one terminal plaque.  Each of the plaques is made from plain wire loops and scrolls decorated on the front with appliqu\u00e9s stamped from thin sheet gold in the shape of flowers and leaves, and set with mother-of-pearl shapes \u2013 stars, bows, discs, lozenges - in pronged mounts.  There are hinge fittings, possibly for a missing brooch pin, on the backs of the two outermost plaques, just before the triangular terminals.  The pendant hangs from the central plaque.  It is girandole in shape, with a central plaque hanging from a smaller arc, with three flat mother-of-pearl drops hanging from its lower edge.",
