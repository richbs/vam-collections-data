The design is in a neo-classical style and was made by an anonymous designer working in Paris in about 1760-1780.  There are two other impressions made from the same plate (E.897:7-1988 and E.897:290-1988).\n\nEngravings of this kind were used by goldsmiths both to show to clients, and to guide the actual production of jewellery or metalwork. The design could be modified in pencil or ink and used as a base to try out enamel or gold colours.\n\nThis print is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and include snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  The binding is red morocco and the boards are stamped in gilt with the arms, now partly erased, of a member of the Bourbon family, probably Louis-Henri, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1692-1740).",
