In 1808 they sent a strong frigate squadron commanded by Jacques Hamelin to augment the forces available on the island bases of \u00cele Bonaparte and \u00cele de France and attack British shipping in the region. In 1810, British forces including volunteers from the native forces of the three Indian Presidencies took part, successfully removed the French threat by invading and capturing the \u00cele de France.\nThis medal was issued to the native troops who took part in this campaign.",
