Professionally-made books used decorative initials, such as the initial Q on this fragment, to signal the major divisions of a text. There was usually a hierarchy of initials within any book to designate sections, chapters, paragraphs and other breaks. The initials were added either by the scribe or, increasingly in the later Middle Ages, by a specialist, in spaces left blank by the scribe. The important initials might be historiated (ie embellished with a figurative picture, 'istoire' being the term for story) or decorated, while the lesser initials were made of coloured letters on coloured or gold grounds, often with flourishing in ink of a contrasting colour.",
