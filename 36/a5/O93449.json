His right  hand would probably originally have been raised in blessing, while in his left he is likely to have held the banner of the Resurrection. Below on his right side the Virgin Mary and a group of six Apostles kneel, their hands in prayer, while on his left side are St Mary Magdalene and the other six Apostles.\n\nThe relief is carved in five main sections of wood with some smaller pieces added; it has been reinforced by several horizontal and vertical wood batons which are screwed into the flat back.",

His right hand would originally have been raised in blessing, while in his left he is likely to have held the banner of the Resurrection. Below on his right side the Virgin Mary and a group of six Apostles kneel, their hands in prayer, while on his left side are St. Mary Magdalende and the other six apostles.",

The type of woods points to an origin in the Alps, and the style of the figures is comparable with works by Master Narciso da Bolzena of Bozen (active about 1472-1517). In particular with the altarpiece from Fiera di Primiero (now in the Museo Provinciale d'Arte in Trento and another in Voels am Schlern, which is signed and dated 1488. The distinctive facial features and the similar drapery suggest the present work was made in Master Narciso's workshop.",
