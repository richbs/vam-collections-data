But they were followed by a period of increasing prosperity, as the unification of much of Asia under Mongol rule caused a boom in international trade. One result of this was an increase in the influence of Chinese art on the art of Iran. This included the use of Chinese-inspired imperial symbols like the dragon and phoenix.\n\nFor a time after the Mongol conquest, secular imagery developed for palace walls was sometimes used on tiles destined for religious buildings - a striking departure from the usual avoidance of figural imagery in religious contexts. In this example, the Mongol imperial symbol of a phoenix in flight is framed by a quotation from the Qur'an.",
