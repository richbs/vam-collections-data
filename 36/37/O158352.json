In March 1763 the management of Covent Garden theatre announced on the playbills that only full price tickets would be available. The response was an organised riot which destroyed the interior of the theatre and forced the reinstitution of the half price concession.\n\nThe opera  being performed on this night was Artaxerxes,  an English opera composed by Thomas Arne with a libretto adapted from the Italian poet Metastasio\u2019s Artaserse. This is the only known attempt to adapt one of Metasatio\u2019s opera seria into the English language. The singers in the print are dressed in conventional opera costume of the period, with the men wearing generically 'Eastern' rather than historically correct costume, while the female singer wears a version of fashionable 18th century dress.\n\nArne was more successful writing light opera, and his most famous and enduring work was setting the poem of Rule Britannia! to his music.",
