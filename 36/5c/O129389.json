The custom largely died out after the First World War but from time to time some theatres revived the idea, in London particularly the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum.\n\nThis silk playbill was printed in London for a Gala performance at the London Coliseum to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of The English National Opera, on Thursday 28th May 1981 in the presence of the Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth II. The entertainment consisted of a medley of short excerpts of opera, and included two items by Benjamin Britten, one of England's foremost 20th century composers.  Unlike traditional silk playbills, this was printed in colour and included a fringe, multi-coloured to match the colours of the printing ink.",
