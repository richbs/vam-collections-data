            "public_access_description": "Tea urns were used to provide hot water when tea was drunk after dinner. The oil lamp beneath the main body of the urn kept the water hot. The handles for the urn are concealed as part of the decorative frieze, and  are hinged behind the classical masks. This gilt tea urn is exceptionally grand and  would have been made for a very wealthy and fashion-conscious client.\n\nThe urn was made by Digby Scott (born about 1763, died 1816) and Benjamin Smith II (1764-1823), who managed a workshop for the Royal Goldsmiths Rundell, Bridge & Rundell. They used a design by the French designer Jean-Jacques Boileau (active in England 1787-1851).  The  identification of the designer is based upon drawings thought to be  by Boileau  in the Print Room of the V&A, which use similar ornament.\n\nThis tea urn exemplifies fashionable design of the period. The Egyptian style of the tea urn was adopted for several items in the  Grand Service that belonged to the Prince Regent  (1762-1830).  Rundells' ability to market costly and sophisticated silver in numerous styles was unmatched by any of their competitors. They could afford to maintain a large design studio. They employed the most prestigious and accomplished designers, such as the artist and sculptor John Flaxman (1755-1826). Their lead in the reintroduction and reinterpretation of historic style was often decisive.",
