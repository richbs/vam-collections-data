At the top of the hill is the Greenwich Observatory with a line of bushes and trees on the horizon. Groups of men and women are dancing on the slopes, and one man and woman have fallen at the foot of a tree. Some of the men wear baggy trousers. One of them is performing scarf dance with a woman to the music of a pipe and drum. Other men and women are sitting on the grass or strolling. Two wardens, one with a badge of the City of London on his sleeve, are discussing either the dancing or the activities of a salesman with a basket. In the foreground, children are playing, the gentry are exchanging polite greetings, and a gipsy is offering a miniature garden for sale, another is telling fortunes while gipsy children pick the pockets of her victim.\n\nThe scene is framed above by draped curtains with a fringe and tassels supported by two cherubs. Cupid, with four arrows in his bow, flies between the curtains. The whole is framed by two decorative borders, and a scroll with an inscription is superimposed on them below the scene.",
