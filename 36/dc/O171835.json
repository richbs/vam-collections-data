It comes with a blazer, skirt and hat all with airline logo details. It is a manufactured object and comes complete in its own box shaped like a suitcase.  \n\nFancy dress outfits have been popular for adults and children for over 200 years but were particularly popular from about the 1850s. In the 1960s being an air hostess would have been an exciting job and many girls would have probably enjoyed wearing such an outfit and imagining themselves jetting off to foreign lands.",
