He is skilled at using low-tech, often found, materials. This poster was made by taking the existing poster portraits of two different politicians (made for their respective election campaigns), cutting them into strips and weaving them to make a new composite image. The original posters which Lopes used were designed for display in public places. \n\nBrazil is culturally diverse but has profound social and economic disparities. Voting is mandatory and those who are not registered voters are denied \"privileges\" such as passports and driver's licences. In his re-worked posters the artist suggests the futility of voting, given that the citizens do not have equal access to education, housing or employment. Lopes deliberately cuts out or obscures any text references to the statesmen's individual identities and himself loses track of who's who. The point is not who they are or what they stand for, so much as their symbolic position as institutionalised, undifferentiated talking heads, with policies which are more of less interchangeable.",

His childhood was difficult and he grew up in poverty with little formal education. Da Silva's long political history began in the 1960s when he first became active with Brazilian labour unions after serously injuring his hand while working in a factory. By the late '70s he was a prominent spokesman during a series of strikes (1978-81) and a co-founder of the PT. In 1986 he was elected to the house of representatives and in 1989-1990 he made his first of three unsuccessful runs at the presidency. He won Brazil's 2002 Presidential election, leading a coalition of parties behind the Partidos Trabalhadores (PT, the Labor Party).",
