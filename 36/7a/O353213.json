Very fine, buff, silk (?) warp with wefts of green, yellow, pink and white. The fabric has stripes across it which include brown leather strips, 2mm wide.  The linen lining is undyed; plain weave; approx 32x32 tpc. There appears to be a middle lining made of loosely, plain woven linen. It is undyed; z-spun; approx. 12 x 12 tpc ; approx. 0.5 -1.0 mm dia. There are holes and staining across the remaining fabric.\n\nThe construction would have been much like 1099-1900 and 1100-1900. Some of the rim remains, made of dark brown, linen, plain woven, approx. 5mm wide on the outer side and 7mm on the inner.  Next to it are two lines of running stitch, using black/blue linen thread, s-spun. A central join (black/blue, poorly dyed, linen thread; whip stitch) across the crown remains. On either side of the join are two rows of running stitch in the same thread.  The row continues from one side to the other with the same threads. The rows do not meet the edge of the cap. A small portion of what would have been a linen tie remains on one side. It is poorly dyed in blue and sewn to the cap with the blue/black, linen thread.",

            "public_access_description": "Fragment of a child's skull cap in silk and linen.  Egyptian,  ca. AD 1000-1400. From a tomb.The cover fabric is pattern woven in silk and thin strips of leather possible once gilded. Very fine, buff, silk (?) warp with wefts of green, yellow, pink and white. The fabric has stripes across it which include brown leather strips, 2mm wide.  The linen lining is undyed; plain weave; approx 32x32 tpc. There appears to be a middle lining made of loosely, plain woven linen. It is undyed; z-spun; approx. 12 x 12 tpc ; approx. 0.5 -1.0 mm dia. There are holes and staining across the remaining fabric.\n\nThe construction would have been much like 1099-1900 and 1100-1900. Some of the rim remains, made of dark brown, linen, plain woven, approx. 5mm wide on the outer side and 7mm on the inner.  Next to it are two lines of running stitch, using black/blue linen thread, s-spun. A central join (black/blue, poorly dyed, linen thread; whip stitch) across the crown remains. On either side of the join are two rows of running stitch in the same thread.  The row continues from one side to the other with the same threads. The rows do not meet the edge of the cap. A small portion of what would have been a linen tie remains on one side. It is poorly dyed in blue and sewn to the cap with the blue/black, linen thread.",
