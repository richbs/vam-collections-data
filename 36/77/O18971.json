In 1861 he worked in Gustave Courbet\u2019s studio for several months as a pupil. After a period of portraiture, Fantin-Latour concentrated on flowers paintings and still-lifes for which he is now best known. His flower pieces were especially popular with British collectors, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy in London from 1862 onwards, especially thanks to the patronage of James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Fantin-Latour\u2019s paintings of flower, a category in which he progressively specialised executing up to 500 floral compositions. This painting shows double nasturtiums whose bright orange and green contrast against the plain grey background. This effect of light and colour are characteristic of the new naturalism developed in French art in the second half of the 19th century, which anticipate the Impressionists\u2019 new experimentations.",

The artist has chosen not to show the container the plants are growing in, and the plain background makes the picture appear shallow in depth. The nasturtiums fill almost the entire length and breadth of the canvas.\n \nFantin-Latour is perhaps best known for his flower paintings but few resemble this one. Many of them show a vase of assorted cut flowers set on a table, alongside other objects such as fruit or tableware. These paintings of flowers found a ready market in England and examples of these more conventional bouquets are also in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n \nFantin-Latour lived in Paris but was able to sell most of his flower paintings in England through an English couple, Mr and Mrs Edwards, whom he had met in 1861. What began as a friendship later became primarily a business arrangement. Edwin Edwards would travel to Paris in the autumn and purchase, from the artist's studio, works he thought he could resell in Britain. After Edwards' death in 1879 his widow assumed the role of Fantin-Latour's agent and propagandist in Britain, and kept his work in the public eye by ensuring the inclusion of his paintings in exhibitions all over the country. The museum purchased <i>Nasturtiums</i> in 1882, two years after it had been painted. It was acquired as a 'schools example' to be sent round art schools in Britain for art students to study and perhaps copy. A substantial part of Fantin-Latour's own training had consisted of copying, mainly figure paintings, in the Louvre in Paris. \n\nAlthough a contemporary and associate of the leading Impressionist painters Renoir and Monet, he did not share with them their enthusiasm for the innovation of painting in the open air. In all probability Fantin-Latour painted <i>Nasturtiums</i> in his studio in Paris or at his cottage in Normandy, where he and his wife spent their summer. \n\nElizabeth Clunas\"\n<u>Henri Fantin-Latour (1836-1904)</u> Lisbon: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Calouste Gulbenkian, 2009, cat. 67, p. 179.\nExhibition catalogue\nWillsdon, Clare A.

One of Fantin's rare flower pieces featuring a single flower silhouetted against a plain background, this work was acquired as an 'example' of still-life painting, to be circulated to schools for use in art classes.\n\nPurchased, 1884\n\nHistorical significance: This painting was probably painted in Paris or in Bur\u00e9 (Normandy) where Fantin-Latour spent the summer in 1880. It shows double nasturtiums, a plant that according C.A.P Willsdon, was often used as a subject for training flower painters because of its complex structure. It is one of the three paintings the South Kensington School of Design, now Victoria and Albert Museum, acquired as a model for its students (see also S.Ex.4-1889 and S.Ex.61-1882). They all share the characteristic of presenting a single plant rather than a bouquet, depicted without a vase or table, on a plain background. \n\nThe Barbizon School and the Impressionists engendered a new interest for naturalism and the objective rendering of light and colours. However,  Fantin-Latour did not share their enthusiasm for open air painting and most of his compositions were executed in his studio.\n\nThis painting was purchased from Mrs Elizabeth Ruth Edwards, who was acquainted with Fantin-Latour as she and her husband hosted the artist for a few months in their house at Sunbury-on-Thames in 1861. On this occasion, Fantin-Latour executed her portrait, now in the Mus\u00e9e du Petit-Palais, Paris. Mr and Mrs Edwards became his dealers in England and their friendship with the painter is witnessed by his portrait of them dated 1875, now in the Tate Gallery, London (F.738).",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light.
