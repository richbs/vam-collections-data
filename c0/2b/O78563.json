The whole surface is painted black.\n\nStyle\nThe style of this object combines naturalism, in the carefully worked leaves and petals, and neo-Gothic elements, evident in the stylised foliage on the base. The latter is inspired by 13th-century ironwork, such as the grille around the tomb of Queen Eleanor of Castille in Westminster Abbey (1294). In the mid-19th century wrought iron was made fashionable by designers and architects, notably A.W.N. Pugin (1812-1852). From the 1860s it was displaced by cheaper, industrially produced cast iron.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis ornament was made for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. The Great Exhibition was the biggest and most ambitious exhibition of its kind, intended to raise the profile of British design and manufacturing, improve popular taste and encourage good international relations through commerce. Whilst many exhibits were made by well-known firms and designers, individual craftsmen and skilled amateurs also showed their work. Frederick Crook, a caterer and manufacturer of cooking equipment, was awarded a bronze medal for this piece.",
