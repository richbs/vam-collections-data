There are a number of detours en route to the end, including stays at hostels, or avoiding hills. There are no pieces included, but it could be played with any kind of counters and dice. It may well have been part of a set of different board games, and was donated to the museum with a another board, Flying Round the British Empire (B.86-2011). It was manufactured by Glevum Games, the trade name of Roberts Brothers. They were the inventors of Pilla Dex, a successful Victorian parlour game played by Princess Alexandra in the early 1900s and licenced by the Parker Bros in America, but the Glevum Games name had slipped into obscurity by the 1950s.",
