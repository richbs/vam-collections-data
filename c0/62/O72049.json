He began printmaking relatively late, in 1930, but  craftsmen who helped him described the studio atmosphere around Mir\u00f3 as one of 'continuous exhilaration and youthful enthusiasm'. This accompanied the childlike, 'primitive' style of work like Les Forestiers. The printers Crommelynck and Dutrou were among the most gifted in Paris, and their assistance enabled Mir\u00f3 to achieve the freshness of colour and texture seen here. Mir\u00f3 also learned from the English printmaker S. W. Hayter, whose Atelier 17 in Paris, set up in 1927 but relocated for a while to New York (1945-1950), was the ideal location for artists interested in experimenting with printmaking, especially in intaglio methods such as engraving and aquatint.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Joan Mir\u00f3 (1893-1983)</i> \n\n<i>Les Forestiers</i>, 1958 \n\nJoan Mir\u00f3, one of the most prominent members of the Surrealist movement, is best known as a painter.  He was also a great ceramicist and a prolific printmaker, although he did not make his first lithograph until 1930 and his first etching until some two years later.  <i>Les Forestiers</i> is one of three prints with the same title but printed in different inks.  The images are very close to each other but there are small changes, which appear to take advantage of the 'chance happenings and even mistakes' that occurred during the printmaking process.  This was something that Mir\u00f3 found particularly interesting. \nMir\u00f3 was a tremendously enthusiastic printmaker and it is worth quoting Roland Penrose on the subject.  He recalled that \n<i>The team of craftsmen who had helped in the printing of these graphics have told me of the excitement they felt in working with Mir\u00f3.  After long periods of contemplation he would plunge into new experiments, inventing unheard-of techniques with complete and unhesitating conviction...The atmosphere was one of continuous exhilaration and youthful enthusiasm</i>. \nIn the light of this commentary, it is worth noting that Mir\u00f3 was well into his sixties when working on Les Forestiers, and such 'youthful enthusiasm' often accompanied delightfully child-like imagery.  Children's and so-called primitive art was admired by a number of the most significant artists on the twentieth century, including Klee and Dubuffet, as well as Mir\u00f3 himself. \nCrommelynck and Dutrou, who printed this series, formed one of the most notable twentieth-century printing studios in Paris.  They worked with some of the finest artists of the period.  Collaborating with such experienced printers, Mir\u00f3 was able to carry out his artistic projects with the help of a team of highly skilled craftsmen.  He found the co-operative aspect of printmaking immensely rewarding. \nThe freshness of colour and texture and the freedom of line so characteristic of Mir\u00f3's printmaking in general may have owed a great deal to what he learned with the English printmaker, Stanley William Hayter.  Hayter had originally set up his atelier in Paris in the 1920s, and in 1947 (some years before making <i>Les Forestiers</i>) Mir\u00f3 had been invited to work in his studio when it was temporarily evacuated to New York.  Hayter was an important influence on the development of colour intaglio printing and 'experiments in gestural mark making', something to which Mir\u00f3 was already temperamentally inclined.  <i>Les Forestiers</i> appears spontaneous and simple in design, but this has only been achieved through Mir\u00f3's remarkable grasp of the inherent possibilities of the medium.\"",
