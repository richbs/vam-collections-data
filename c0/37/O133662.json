His second Christian name is wrongly given as John in DNB. Apprenticed for two years with James Baker Pyne in Bristol; a Member of the Bristol Sketching Club. Exhibited 17 works at the RA between 1833 and 1845, 14 at the BI 1840-45, and ten at the SBA 1836-40. Travelled extensively, making drawings which he used later for finished and exhibited paintings: seven months in Germany, Switzerland and Italy with the watercolourist George Fripp 1834-5, Greece, Egypt, Malta and Naples 1838-9, and Turkey 1843-5. Suffering from a heart condition, he died young in Bristol 8 September 1845. His studio sale was at Christie's 1-3 April 1846, and his work achieved high prices for some years after. A sketchbook and several watercolours are also in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1845, p318 (obit); Art Journal 1864, pp293-5; N Solly Life of William James M\u00fcller 1875; C Bunt The Life and Work of William James M\u00fcller Leigh-on-sea 1948; William James M\u00fcller Bristol City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1962; there was an exhibition of M\u00fcller's work at the Tate Gallery 1985, but no catalogue seems to have been published. \n\nGirl with a Lamb, near Schaffhausen \n1531-1869 Neg GX3997 \nCopper, 24.8 \u00d7 31.7cm (9 \u00be \u00d7 12 \u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'in Schaffhausen/W J M\u00fcller/1835' on conduit centre\nTownshend Bequest 1869 \nSolly describes how M\u00fcller visited Schaffhausen on his way to Italy in August 1834: 'From Strasburg they proceeded to Freyburg, and thence to Schaffhausen, situated about three miles above the great falls of the Rhine. The beauty of this spot had been made familiar by Turner's pencil to M\u00fcller, and he had determined to spend a week there' (p37). There is a pencil drawing by M\u00fcller of the town of Schaffhausen also dated 1834 and in the V&A collections (EI795-1926). \nEXH: William James M\u00fcller Bristol City Art Gallery 1962 (3) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nWaagen, <u>Galleries and Cabinets of Art in Great Britain: Being an account of more than forty collections of Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Mss, etc</u>, London, 1857, p.176.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n'Muller.- A little girl, with a sick lamb, is seated by a well; two goats reposing by her.
