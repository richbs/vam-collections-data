The design is not signed or dated but was probably created by Comelli in circa 1912. It shows a full length image of a woman dressed in an ankle length, narrow white dress with a pale blue, opened fronted, over skirt finishing just below the knee. Over this she wears a closely fitting, white, elbow length tunic with gold braid frogging at the centre front and gold braid trim on the sleeves. She wears a pale blue band around her hair and a pale blue bow on her right shoulder. The overtunic is gathered into a wide band of the same pale blue, this sits just under her bust and is trimmed with a gold tasselled edge. In her left hand she carries the handle of a violin, in her right she carries a violin bow.",
