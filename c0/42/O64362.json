He  twists his body round to his right and holds onto the drapery encircling the woman's hips with his left hand  and cups his other hand round the large bun at the back of her head.  She, in turn, reaches up to him with her arms round his shoulders.  The aedicule has a pair of rounded tapering pillars with annular decoration set on rectangular plinths. The pedestal comprises three tiers of cushion mouldings separated by cavetto mouldings with a central projection.\n\n\nA pair of embracing celestial lovers, (mithunas)  from a door jamb of the Surya Temple, Konarak., Orissa.   They reflect the importance of concepts of pairs embodied in Brahmanical liturgy and have also been described more specifically as \nsymbolizing the union of purusha (essence) and prakriti (substance).",
