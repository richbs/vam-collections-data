In 1856 the Government had announced that a competition was to be held for the monument. Stevens's competition model is also held in the Museum's collections (inv. no. 44-1878). Although Stevens came equal fifth in the competition, the winner being the Scottish sculptor William Calder Marshall, Stevens was eventually given the commission, as his design was felt to be more in keeping with the interior of St Paul's. The main part of the monument was completed after Stevens's death by his pupil Hugh Stannus.",
