It was produced as part of the NSCAD (Novia Scotia College of Art and Design) wallpaper series, for which a number of artists (former instructors and alumni of the college) were invited to contribute designs in 1999.\n\nKelly Mark's design references the idea of the domestic interior as a prison  - it has a pattern made up of endless rows of 'five-bar gates', the hand-written marks used for counting. Screen-printed from hand-drawn original marks, they are uneven and variable as if made with different implements. They suggest the marking of time by someone confined or housebound, if not actually imprisoned. The paper carries overtones of claustrophobia, and offers a witty take on the monotony of repetition, a defining feature of much domestic routine. It also makes play with the idea of wallpaper as a pattern of repeated marks.",
