He moved to Munich in 1843 where he shared a house with Franz Steigerwald, the retailer of this goblet which was purchased by the Museum following its display in the International Exhibition, Paris, 1855. Franz Steigerwald sold glass made by his brother Wilhelm through his glass shops in Munich and other cities. Wilhelm owned two other glassworks, one at Theresienthal (founded 1834, sold 1861) and the other, the Regenh\u00fctte, also at Zwiesel (founded 1844-45).",
