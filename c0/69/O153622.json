The evening dress is made of powder blue satin, it has a broad sash with a pansy design. The dress depicted on its left is made of mauve taffeta with insertions of ivory lace. The dress on the right is made of georgette with insertions of very fine lace.\n\nThese designs demonstrate the increasing trend for women to abandon the restrictive corset. During the early years of the 1910s, designers started to promote the use of lighter and softer fabrics in order to make their creations increasingly free flowing. This new approach focussed on fluidity provided a contrast with the stiff and S-Bend silhouettes of the previous decades.",
