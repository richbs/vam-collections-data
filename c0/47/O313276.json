The present example is not identical with the Oppenheim version and is unquestionably Northern, probably Netherlandish.\nSatyrs are the spirits living in woods and hills and are bestial in their behaviour and desires. They have features of animals, either of the horse or the goat. Satyrs are usually young and have Pan's goat details (in contrast to the rather old Sileni with horse ears). They were the attendants of Bacchus. They were lazy and lecherous and spent their time drinking and chasing nymphs. In medieval and Renaissance allegory they represent the evil or rather 'Lust' and may be labelled 'Luxuria' or 'Libido'.",
