Half had been transferred to different departments and half remained at Bethnal Green. In 2000 departments at the V&A were offered suitable items. Another quarter of the original collection was transferred, the remainder was offered to the Archive of Art and Design, at Blythe House, along with the original registers.  BGMC kept a small selection of other items for display in conjunction with the History of the Museum information panel.\n\nThe original Collection of Animal Products register (copy on transfer file 2000/932) indicates that it was made by Girandon & R\u00e9al, 48, rue Moli\u00e8re, Paris. It was bought by the museum at the London shop Howell & James, Regent Street, for five pounds ten shillings.  It was part of the collection of fish skins.",
