            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 179, 184, 185\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"Page from a sketch-book. \n\nThe leaf comes from the sketch-book used in Suffolk in October 1827. Lt.-Col. C. A. Brooks has noted that the barrier in the foreground is that seen in the barge-building yard represented in No. 137 [FA37]. Flatford Mill is on the left, and Flatford Lock in the centre, while Dedham Church has been inserted in a fictional position in the right-hand distance. The drawing may therefore be a study for a composition, rather than a sketch from nature. \n\nNote on Nos. 290-300 [834-1888, 624-1888, 802-1888, 269-1888, 837-1888, 838-1888, 241-1888, 313-1888, 244-1888, 274-1888, 242-1888]\n\nNos. 290-300 [see above] are all on leaves from the same sketch-book, measuring about 224x331 mm. (81x13 ins.) used in 1827. Nos. 290, 291, 292, 294 and 295 [834-1888, 624-1888, 802-1888, 837-1888, 838-1888] are inscribed for places in the neighbourhood of Flatford.  Nos. 297 and 298 [313-1888, 244-1888] are independently identifiable as scenes in that locality. The drawings were made on a visit of Constable's to Flatford Mill, which lasted nearly a fortnight; he took his two eldest children, John and Maria, and arrived probably on 2 October (<u>Beckett</u>, II, p. 439). \n\nTwo sheets from the same sketch-book are in the British Museum: \nL.B. 8. The Cottage in the Lane. 221 x 321 mm. (acquired in 1887). \nL.B. 15. Lock on the Stour, with Dedham Church in the distance. 222 x 327 mm. \nOn paper watermarked: J WHATMAN TURKEY MILLS 1824. (Gift of \nMiss Isabel Constable) \nThe National Gallery of Ireland has a sheet from the sketch-book:- \n2057. Flatford Lock, with Flatford Old Bridge and Bridge Cottage. Pencil. \n221 x 329 mm.  Inscribed by the artist<i>Flatford Octr. 5 1827.</i> \nAnother washed pencil drawing on a leaf from the sketch-book of 1827 is in the possession of Mrs. E. O. Beazley. It represents a large timbered house with a tiled roof, and on the left a haystack with haymaking in progress. It is inscribed by the artist<i> Flatford 13 Oct 1827</i> The sight measurement is 221 X 326mm. (about 8 \u00be x 12 7/8 ins.). At the back is the inscription <i>This sketch was presented to the late James Beazley by the widow or relative of Constable the artist, out of gratitude for a slight service rendered to her by him. J. H. Beazley.</i> (Since Mrs. Constable predeceased her husband the gift must have been made by another member of the artist's family.)\u201d",
