In the portfolio from which this image comes he has written:\n\n  \"Although the uprights and lintels obviously served as windows and doors one senses a greatness coming through yet another door. A greatness which perseveres in another dimension and causes chronological time to melt away. We may never know for certain why ancient man assembled these stones. But man's humanity can sense the nobility and feel the aspirations that materialized into a great internal idea. Sentinel like, the stones stand as if encompassing all inner and outer boundaries.\"",
