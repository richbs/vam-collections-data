ISBN 1851773088.\nA number of the large individual collections bequeathed to the Museum- notably those assembled by John Jones and George Salting- contained many related objects that were already understood as series through which it was possible to trace the development of  a particular type of artifact or style. Although the seemingly comprehensive nature of such collections was of course illusory, the Museum's holdings of vast numbers of like materials nonetheless made it possible to display row after row of similar objects, thus representing visual typologies. These typological displays, which were much indebted to anthropological models of the era, are exemplified by this series of brass candlesticks. Such massed groups of objects that, taken individually, have never been regarded as \"\"masterpieces,\"\" form an important facet of the Museum's collections and are still a significant part of its displays (fig.79).\nThese candlesticks represent but a small fraction of what is one of the most comprehensive collections in existence. They range in style from plain medieval forms found in excavations to finely engraved Venetian candlesticks of the sixteenth century, and present a history of the domestic candlestick from the twelfth to the nineteenth century.\nMuch of the interest in ordinary domestic brass and copper wares was stimulated by the English Arts and Crafts movement around 1900, and the emergence of candlesticks as a category of collector's item, with a growing literature, is really a twentieth century phenomenon, developing after the candlestick was no longer an essential domestic object. The Museum, however, had already begun collecting in this field as early as 1855.\n\nANTHONY R.E. NORTH",
