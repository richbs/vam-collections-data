Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898) made numerous sketches of classical and Italian Renaissance sculpture in this sketchbook.  Five sketches depict sculptures in the British Museum and four have been identified as showing objects from the South Kensington Museum.\n\nPlaces\nBurne-Jones moved near this Museum at the end of 1864.  He moved first to 41 Kensington Square and three years later to The Grange, North End Lane, Fulham where he lived until his death in 1898.  The South Kensington Museum, where many sketches were made, is mentioned several times in the 'Memorials of Burne-Jones' (1904).  He wrote about liking this Museum more than the British Museum and wrote about this Museum's tapestries and cast courts.  Such references suggest that he was familiar with several aspects of the collections.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSome of the sketches are in softer pencil than the last drawings in this sketchbook, drawn in hard pencil,.  The sketch book is made of paper with unvaried thickness, known as wove paper, which has a roughly textured surface on which soft pencil works particularly well.",

(1833-1898)</b>\n\nSketch-book containing studies of works of art including a bronze and part of a frieze and a metope in the British Museum, two sculptures by Pierino da Vinci in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and part of a fresco by Andrea Mantegna. 46 pages of white wove Whatman paper together with several unused sheets at the back, quarter bound in green leather, gold tooled, with canvas boards. After 1862.\n\nPencil and red chalk. Size of volume 18.4 x 26 cm\nGiven by Dr W.L. Hildburgh, F.S.A. \nE.2-1955\n\n[...]\n\nThe group was acquired in Florence in 1863. Burne-Jones's sketch-book is open at a study of it. He had little formal art training but he valued drawing from life and from sculpture highly. One of his students at the Great Ormond Street Working Men's College, where he taught from January 1859 to March 1861, recalled 'he left with his pupils a feeling that he was their fellow-worker as well as their master ... He encouraged them to draw sculptures in the British Museum'.<sup>10</sup> Whereas his wife reminisced 'Sometimes, after a day in the studio, he would go for a change to the South Kensington Museum in the evening, either to draw or to look at books in the Reference Library'.<sup>11</sup>\n\nOther sketch-books by Burne-Jones in the Museum include studies of the following sculptures from the Museum's collection: Donatello's 'The Lamentation over the dead Christ' (no.8442-1863), the twelve roundels 'The Labours of the Months' by Luca della Robbia (Nos. 7632-7643--1861), the bust of Giovanni Chellini by Antonio Rossellino (No.7671-1861), the plaque 'The Assumption of the Virgin' by Andrea della Robbia (No.6741-1860) and the northern German limewood reliefs of St Matthew and St Luke from a set of the Evangelists (Nos.4841-4844--1858). There are also studies of two 15th century South German tapestries entitled 'In Search after Trew' and 'The Buzzard' (Nos.4025-1856, 4509-1858).\n\nSL\n\n<sup>10 G.
