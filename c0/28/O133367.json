Her papers have been described as \u2018wall-art\u2019 and she incorporates a work-in-progress element to her papers, often adding instructions such as \u2018Cut out this\u2019, \u2018Fill in\u2019, or \u2018Peel away here\u2019, so that the customer can continue to modify the paper once they have taken it home. She values the idea that people can add their own pieces to her papers, such as photographs, to build up a narrative of their own lives. Pierce describes her work as \u2018individual handmade pieces\u2019 situated between craft and technology, art and design.\n\nThese two lengths (see also E.34-2007) could be hung separately but the design continues across both sheets (each of which is different) demonstrating clearly the way in which Pierce\u2019s designs are organic and develop from one sheet to the next.",
