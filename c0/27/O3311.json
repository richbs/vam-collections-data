            "public_access_description": "This glass beaker is known as the \u2018Luck of Edenhall\u2019. It was made in Egypt or Syria in the middle of the 14th century, and is elegantly decorated with blue, green, red and white enamel colours and with gilding. But its name reflects its later history, when magical powers were attributed to it.\n\nBy the 15th century, the beaker had reached England, where it was evidently considered an item of great value, as it was provided with a finely decorated leather case. This bears the IHS symbol on the cover; this is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase Iesus Hominum Salvator, meaning, \u2018Jesus, Saviour of Mankind\u2019. It has been suggested that this Christian religious symbol was placed there as a charm, to protect the beaker from damage. \n\nThe beaker had already acquired its nickname, the Luck of Edenhall, by the 1670s. In 1677 it was recorded in the will of Sir Philip Musgrave, the owner of a house called Edenhall in Cumbria, in the north of England. But it may date from much earlier. \n\nIn northern England, the term 'luck' was sometimes given to fine vessels that were thought to have a talismanic role: as luxury objects, they were owned by people blessed by wealth, and good fortune, and if they were broken, this good fortune would be lost. The Luck of Edenhall was thought to play this role for the Musgrave family of Edenhall. The need for the IHS charm on the cover was therefore all the greater.\n\nIn the 18th century local antiquarians took an interest in the Luck of Edenhall, and they recorded (or invented) a legend that explained the presence of this exotic and beautiful object at Edenhall. According to this legend, \u2018a party of Fairies were drinking and making merry round a well near the Hall, called St Cuthbert\u2019s well; but being interrupted by the intrusion of some curious people, they were frightened, and made a hasty retreat, and left the cup in question: one of the last screaming out,\n\nIf this cup should break or fall\nFarewell the Luck of Edenhall.\u2019\n\nThe Rev. William Mounsey of Bottesford, author of this passage in the Gentleman\u2019s Magazine of August 1791 speculates that \u2018ancient superstition may have contributed not a little to its preservation\u2019.\n\nThis superstition, fortunately, continued to exert its influence. The American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, in his mid 19th-century translation of Johan Ludwig Uhland\u2019s ballad about the \u2018Luck\u2019, envisages the terrible consequences of its careless destruction during a banquet at Edenhall:\n\nAs the goblet ringing flies apart\nSuddenly cracks the vaulted hall;\nAnd through the rift the wild flames start;\nThe guests in dust are scattered all,\nWith the breaking Luck of Edenhall!\n\nIn storms the foe with fore and sword; \nHe in the night had scaled the wall, \nSlain by the sword lies the youthful Lord, \nBut holds in his hand the crystal tall, \nThe shattered luck of Edenhall.\n\nFortunately the \u2018Luck\u2019 remains intact, though Edenhall itself was demolished shortly after the glass was placed on loan at the V&A in 1926.",

The first securely dated reference was made by Sir Philip Musgrave in his will of 1677, where he called it \"the Glass called the Luck of Edenhall\" (p.6). Davies redates the leather case to the 15th century on the basis of the 'ribbon letter' script employed for the IHS inscriptions (pp.5-6). In addition, Davies points out that the Luck was not necessarily brought to Europe immediately after it was made (p.4); he discounts the story that it was used as a chalice in the Mass (p.5); he suggests that the IHS motif on the case may have been a charm designed to protect the Luck from harm (p.5); and he places the Luck in a tradition of magical cups current in northern England as early as the 12th century (p.6).\n<i>Saved! 100 years of the National Art Collections Fund</i>, exhibition catalogue by Richard Verdi, London: Hayward Gallery and the National Art Collections Fund in association with Scala Publishers, 2003, p.166, cat.no.96.\nHall, S.C.
