He faces forward, with his eyes looking slightly to his right, his mouth slightly open. He wears a habit unbuttoned at the lower chest to reveal a pendant cross. It is a fine example of French portraiture in ivory, although its author is unknown. Theuerkauff suggested that the bust might be by Simon Jaillot. or his younger brother, or perhaps by another sculptor in their circle. The fine quality of carving and naturalsitic quality suggest indeed that this piece could be by a sculptor of the calibre of Simon Jaillot.",
