ISBN: 13:978 1 85514 398 2.\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 66, 67\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"The original canvas, which is somewhat irregularly cut, has been relined at an unknown date.  The measurements refer to the pigmented surface.\n\nBeckett, I, p. 7, identifies this as a portrait of Mary Constable, the artist's younger sister, who is portrayed on the right of the double portrait of his sisters in the collection of Lt.-Col. J.H. Constable (L. ed. M., Pl. II).  The identification is plausible and is supported by the two pencil sketches which were made by Constable of his sister Mary in April 1812, one of which is in the Witt Collection, Cortauld Institute, London.  The latter drawing is reproduced from the collection of the late Mr. R. B. Beckett in the <i>Art Quarterly</i>, Detroit, Vol. XVII, 1954, p. 383, fig. 10.\nThe style of the coiffure in No. 97 would be consistent with a date of <i>c.</i>1806 onwards.  Constable was making his copies of the portraits by Reynolds and Hoppner of the Dysart family in 1807 (L. ed. S., pp. 28 and lxxvi, lxxix) and the effect of this practice on his technique is perhaps to be seen in this portrait.\nHolmes, p. 242, dates <i>c.</i>1810.  The <i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>, followed by other authorities, dates No. 97 <i>c</i>1830, but this is ruled out as being too late on the grounds of costume alone.\"",
