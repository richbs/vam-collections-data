Mr. Edwards\u2026was breakfasting with Lord Spencer, then First Lord of the Admiralty, when this was mentioned.  Mr Edwards was personally acquainted with this family, and told Lord Spencer that he could learn anything from them that he was desirous to know.  Shortly after, Lord Spencer asked Mr Edwards to go over to Paris (promising him a safe conduct) to ascertain the particulars that the Government required.  Having satisfactorily performed the business, he returned, and thought no more of it till six weeks after, he received a letter enclosing a draft from the Treasury for \u00a3500.  Not understanding why this was presented to him, he took it to Lord Spencer, who said it was the usual payment for such a mission.  Mr Edwards, not having anything to do with diplomacy, declined accepting it, having undertaken the negotiation as an act of private friendship to Lord Spencer.  <i>\n \n</i>Shortly after, Lord Spencer told Mr Edwards that he had something to offer him which he could not withstand thought he refused the money, for he had heard from the agents of the French Government that some of the neglected treasures of the Jewel-Office in Paris were to be sent to this country.  So little was known of their value that these Stuart miniatures lay disregarded among the old chains and ornaments of this collection, which was accompanied with a written document, stating that James II had brought them over from England, and had deposited them with Louis XIV when he went to St. Germains, intending to reclaim them on his return.

Nos. 10 [Dyce 88] and 11 [P.2-1917].  Like the latter, this miniature has presumably lost an original presentation case, but the superlative condition suggest that neither it nor its companions were lying about without a protective frame for years in the 'French Jewel-Office'. \n \nThe miniatures of the original 'Stuart' group were: \n1 Nicholas Hilliard, <i>Elizabeth I</i>  (now P23-1975) \n2 Nicholas Hilliard, <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i> (P24-1975) \n3 Nicholas Hilliard, <i>Charles I as Duke of York</i> (now P10-1947) \n4 Nicholas Hilliard, <i>Henry, Prince of Wales</i> (now Royal Collection) \n5 Peter Oliver, <i>Lady Arabella Stuart</i> (now Stockholm) \n6 Peter Oliver, <i>Henry, Prince of Wales</i> (now Stockholm)  \n7 Peter Oliver, <i>Elizabeth of Bohemia</i> (the present miniature) \n8 Peter Oliver, <i>Ludwig Philipp, Duke of Simmern</i> (now Cat. No. 13) \n9 Nathaniel Thack, <i>Anne of Gonzaga</i> (now Cat. No. 43). \n \nGower's 1882 description of them reads: \n \nThis set of miniatures is mounted in small metal frames, on boards covered with white silk.  The portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary, the Duke of Simmern, the Queen of Bohemia, and Prince Henry are set in borders of parchment with gilt mounts and the names of the respective individuals inscribed in gilt letters.  The others are set on the silk boards in narrow bronze-gilt frames.  We imagine they were thus framed by Mr. Edwards but the parchment settings are probably of the time of James II. \n \nSubsequent writer have adopted Gower's dating of the vellum mounts, but in the light of the clean unbraded condition of the miniatures, it is difficult to believe that they were not protected by original cases or at least by being enclosed collectively in a frame like other royal assemblages, while in the 'French Jewel-Office'.  Possibly therefore they are 'antiquarian' settings designed for the miniatures by the original Mr Edwards (or even by Earl Beauchamp) early in the nineteenth century, for by 1827 the set was offered at Christie's 'in a frame with plate glass'. (2) The present frames on the Herschorn group are of a type which usually dates from later in the nineteenth century, so are probably from the period of ownership by the Revd. Edwards, rather than that of Mr James Edwards, as Gower surmised.  Williamson's testimony, (3) that the miniatures were 'mounted by Mr Edwards in small metal frames set on boards covered with white silk', is obviously just a repetition of Gower. \n \n1 Gower 1882, vol. II.  <i>Trentham Vicarage</i>. \n2 Information from Graham Reynolds, letter of 3 April 1989.  Dr Rowan Watson (personal communication, August 1993) confirms the view that the vellum mounts are not seventeenth-century: 'His version of italics letters was used for engraved inscriptions in the seventeenth century as well as for writing.  What is here hints of the facsimile, though individual letters are well shaped.  The rationale of italics is a forward swing for ascenders and a backward swing for descenders, and efforts were made to accommodate letters like \"h\" to this movement in seventeenth-century examples.  Here the \"h\" in \"Bohemia\" does not swing enough and refuses strangely to drop below the line; the \"ae\" ligature looks odd (though I have not traced an \"ae\" in seventeenth-century versions of this script).  So I incline to a post-seventeenth-century date.' \n3 Williamson 1904, vol. I, p.32.\"",
