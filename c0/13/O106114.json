However, from 1883 he started to design ceramics and from then on he increasingly designed for the crafts. \n\nHe was a master of the Art Nouveau style and here you can see its influence in the organic shape of the decoration. Bindesb\u00f8ll became known both locally and internationally as one of its most brilliant practitioners. His silverware received international acclaim at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900, which was a showcase for the Art Nouveau style.\n\nThe firm of A. Michelsen, who made the beaker, was founded in Copenhagen in 1841 and continues to this day. It contributed significantly to the major international exhibitions in the period 1850-1900.",
