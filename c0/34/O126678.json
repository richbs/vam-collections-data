Istria was a province of the Venetian Empire, relatively close at hand and a prolific source of excellent carvable stone. Conventionally, a torus moulding does not belong to a  capital, but is properly the uppermost part of of the apophyga  of the shaft.\nThis solecism is quite frequently to be found in later Antiquity and then, as in the Renaissance, can be explained in the greater stregnth of a salient edge carried out in stone rather than brick or tile. Bramante, as late as the very end of the Quattrocento, either lazily permitted the continuance of a Lombard workshop tradition or ignorantly misconstruing a later Antiquity, suffered torus based capitals to be set upon stone columns, where forty years earlier laurana  - the earliest and most meticulous Antique reviver of Antique nicety - would not.\nThe vase depicted on the longer of the two carved sides is distinctly lombardic in style, recalling Bramante's  S.Maria Presso S. satiro, ca.1482. The volutes would appear to descend from the arch of Titus in the Roman forum (throughout the Renaissance a gate to the Savelli fortress and clearly well known in itself.; but the fame of its much imitated composite order, doubtless was considerably supplemented by the circulation of architect's drawing books.Throughout the Quattrocento there was however endless experiment with capitular design in all the larger Italian cities, perhaps resulting in yet greater vagary than in the febrile Roman Baroque. Accidental similarity to Antique models should be allowed for rather than assuming conscious Neo Classicism.",
