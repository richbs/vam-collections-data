She had become dissatisfied with documentary, finding it misleading. Mahr began a new photographic career, making tableaux based on  the lives  of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Lili Brik. Another series was set in ancient China. This one is based on a visit to Geneva to see friends. Mahr took photographs from the cathedral tower and later acquired sheet-music of a melody which kept coming into her mind during the visit - Chopin\u2019s La Grande Polonaise Brillante. With these ingredient and her characteristically light touch, Mahr transformed a few objects in a corner of her studio into a few days elsewhere.",
