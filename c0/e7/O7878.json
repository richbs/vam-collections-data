This collection included a stool with shaped inlaid legs and fragments of a leather seat, XVIII Dynasty (reference: EA 2472) which apparently inspired various 19th century designs. One of the earliest was a chair, with a seat and legs similar to that on the British Museum stool, designed by William Holman Hunt and made in 1856 by J.G. Crace (Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery). Other versions include Ford Madox Brown's simplified chair, with ladder back and cane seat, c. 1860, stocked by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.\n\nLiberty registered their own design, No.16673, in 1884, which had a slatted wooden top and square section legs joined by vertical, diagonal and horizontal rails.Various examples seem to have been produced, including the version in the Museum and a stool with three splayed legs.It was advertised as being available in walnut, mahogany or oak, but examples exist in various woods, including beech. An example of the stool in the Nordenfjeldske Kunstindustrimuseum, Trondheim, Norway, was apparently acquired from Samuel Bing's Salon de l'Art Nouveau, Paris, in 1896.",

The stool was originally sometimes sold with a matching cushion.\nReason For Production: Retail",
