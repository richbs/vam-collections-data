It refers satirically to significant events of the year, depicting them as pas de deux, solos, pas de trois and a corp de ballet, the names of the dances based on real dances performed by the company.  The artist Bernard Partridge was a staff member of Punch from February 1891 for over fifty years, but had also been a professional actor on the London stage from 1887, working under the stage name Bernard Gould.\n\nEvents referred to in the cartoon are Lloyd George's introduction of Health Insurance with a compulsory contribution stamp; plans for the annexing Libya by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy; Winston Churchill's provision of troops to France to help repel the Kaiser's invading forces; the part played by President William Howard Taft in the opening of the Panama Canal; the advances made into the origins of life by the British psychologist Sir Edward Schafer who was knighted in 1913; the parts played by the Irish Parliamentary Party leader John Redmond and Sir Edward Carson of the Irish Unionist Party in the amendment of 8 July 1913 in the exclusion of Northern Ireland from the Home Rule Bill, and Herbert Henry Asquith's opposition to the Suffragette movement demonstrated in his speech of 13 May 1913.",

However, it may have been Howard Taft who gave the greatest personal impetus to the canal over the longest period. Taft visited Panama five times as Roosevelt's Secretary of War, and twice as President. He also hired John Stevens, and later recommended Goethals as his replacement. Taft became president in 1909, when canal construction was only at the halfway mark, and remained in office for most of the remainder of the work. However, Goethals later wrote 'The real builder of the Panama Canal was Theodore Roosevelt'.",
