In the foreground stand a man and woman, back to back with the woman in front facing the viewer.  His head is turned in profile to his left and his left shoulder and bent arm are visible; he wears a white shirt and sleeveless red waistcoat with blue trims on the seams and has a small moustache and goatee beard.  On his feet he wears blue, buttoned fitted boots.  The woman stands on point on her left foot, her right foot visible behind the left knee.  Her hands are on her hips and her head is turned to her right.  Her hair is pulled back into a coiled plait from which flutter blue and red ribbons.  Her very low cut blue bodice continues into narrow straps on the upper arms and fastens down the front with tiny buttons; the bodice sides are black with a red stripe dividing it from the blue front.  Over the blue bell-shaped, knee-length skirt, is a red overskirt, bunched up over the hips and held at the sides by blue tapes.",
