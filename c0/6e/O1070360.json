(2) This version seems to be heavily overpainted.  \n2  Formerly in the collection of Lord Cobham. (3) \n\nDespite its minute size and the consequent difficulty of distinguishing the hand, the miniature was confidently attributed to Hoskins on grounds of style before its connection with the Windsor and (especially) the signed Cobham versions was recognised by Graham Reynolds in 1950.(4) Both of these are much finer than this miniature which should probably be regarded as part of the Hoskins workshop production of the mid-1630s.  \n \nThe dukedom of Richmond is complicated at this date, and references to it often are confused. Briefly, James Stuart was himself created Duke of Richmond on 8 August 1641; this creation in effect revived the dukedom in the family after its extinction on the death of James Stuart's uncle, Ludovic Stuart (created Duke of Richmond 17 May 1623). Ludovic Stuart and his younger brother Esm\u00e9 (the latter was James Stuart's father) were, respectively, the 2nd and 3rd Dukes of Lennox, being sons of Esm\u00e9 Stuart, 6th Seigneur d' Aubigny, who was created Duke of Lennox, 5 August 1581. \n\n1 Cust 1910, p.18, no.129. \n2 MS note on photograph in NPG. \n3 Signed; sold Sotheby's 19 October 1950, lot 28. 4 MS note in department file.\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1942</u>, London: HMSO, 1955.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n<b>\nHOSKINS, John (d.1665), Attributed to</b>\n\nMiniature portrait of a man wearing the Garter Ribbon.\n<i>On parchment on card.
