Like Modernism itself, Post-modernism rejects existing or established ideas and boundaries, but additionally has a tendency toward parody, pastiche and irony. Baselitz rebelled against the dominance of abstract art during the 1960s, but at the same time he was concerned to shift the focus of attention in an image away from the subject-matter. For this reason he began turning his images upside down. The eagle was one of his favourite motifs. In Germany its special significance was of historic imperial power as well as being the symbol of the modern Federal republic. By turning it on its head, as it were, Baselitz seems to be making a direct comment on German art and history.",
