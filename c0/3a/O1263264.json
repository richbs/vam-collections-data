It was used by the Royal Princesses Elisabeth and Margaret, which helped with its popularity.  It is often gifted to a child as a christening present.  \n\nThe Bunnykins range was introduced in 1934, the characters were created by Sister Mary Barbara (born Barbara Vernon Bailey), a young nun who taught English at a convent school.  Barbara\u2019s father worked at Doulton and was instrumental in the development of this series; he appears as a character in some of the scenes.  \n\nThe scenes are of Mr and Mrs Bunnykins and other rabbits dressed as little people, set in rural England, each scene shows everyday events, such as having breakfast, getting married, taking picnics.  \n\nBarbara worked with Royal Doulton up until Word War II producing sixty-six scenes.  When production restarted after the war, Walter Hayward took over the artwork, he adapted some of Barbara\u2019s earlier work and went on to create his own scenes.  Babrara\u2019s name appears on the table ware till the mid 1950s.  \n\nBunnykins is still produced today and the earlier pieces are now highly collectable.",
