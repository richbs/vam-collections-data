She is looking down on St. Mary Magdalene, veiled, seated at the foot of the Cross and embracing it. On the left of the Virgin and set behind her, one of the other Maries, haloed and veiled, looks up at the scourge symbolically displayed against the background. The third Holy Woman, also Mary, stands behind St. Mary Magdalene and the Cross, with her back to the Cross but turning her head, haloed and veiled towards the Virgin. Under the left arm of the Cross stands St. John the Evangelist, haloed, long-haired, beardless, his right hand on his breast, his left hand holding a book. Abover him, slightly to his right are symbolically displayed the three nails and a hammer. The scene is set on a narrow ledge.\n\nIvory has at some time broken into two sections. The break follows the left side of the Cross and Mary Magdalene. The top of the panel is rounded off at the corners and the right hand corner has broken away; the break cuts through the handle of the hammer and passes behind the halo of St John the Evangelist. Two small incisions towards the bottom of the panel on both sides are presumably for fixing. A narrow rectangular cavity with a less depp section in the centre has been cut at the foot of the panel. A large part of the lower edge of this cavity has broken away. The ivory appears to be stained with patches of dark pigmentation.",

It was probably originally part of either a small altar or frame.\nAlthough formerly thought to be Spanish, the relief is almost identical with one in the collection of Jo\u00e3o Teixera in Lisbon, exhibited in Brussels in 1991 and there catalogued as Sino-Portuguese (Macau or Canton). Another relief, which was clearly from the same group was thought to be from Sri Lanka. It is difficult to attribute ivories from this group more accurately, although those mentioned here must surely come from the same workwhop. The composition is thought to depend from an engraving after the Antwerp painter Marten de Vos (1532-1603), but no specific source is known.",
