He suffered more than the usual reversals of public favour but came to be recognised as one of the few artists of the late twentieth century to preserve the true traditions of the Music Hall. He was also acknowledged as an accomplished actor.  Professor Wallofski was Wall's most famous character, a lanky, long-haired professor of music whose grotesque movements owed much to Wall's training and early career as a dancer.  The costume, with its seedy coat and tights and ill-fitting boots, was devised to accent character and movement. The Theatre Museum purchased this and other stage costumes from Max Wall's daughter. Associated production: Wearer, actor and performer: Max Wall. Character: Professor Wallofski. Costumes devised and worn by Max Wall: S.919:1 to S.934-1997.",
