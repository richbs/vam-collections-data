However, the addition of the bird with open wings, is in keeping with the more sculptural silhouettes of 1930s headwear. This hat is a much lighter interpretation of the fashion for hats featuring birds and wings, popular in the period 1905-1915. \n\nThe hat was designed by the millinery house of Caroline Reboux. From the 1870s until the 1930s the label of  Caroline Reboux (1837-1927) dominated Parisian millinery fashions. Caroline Reboux began her career as a penniless but talented young milliner. Her work was discovered and promoted by the fashionable Princess Pauline de Metternich and in turn attracted the custom of the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. In later years the House of Reboux was run by the milliner Lucienne Rabat\u00e9.\n\n Reboux was known for her clean, simple style using fabrics such as satin, velvet and felt which were draped or cut with a minimum of added or fussy details. Feathers were a favourite embellishment. In the 1920s Reboux was highly regarded for her cloche-style hats, which were often cut and formed on the client's head.",
