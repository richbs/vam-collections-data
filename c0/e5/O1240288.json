Two angels resting on clouds are represented either side of them, clasping hands in a gesture of adoration.\nThe surface of the relief shows a fine network of concentric circles radiating from the infant's groin area through to the edge. These lines might possibly have been left from a reducing machine: where these should have been erased once the casting was complete, Dropsy may have considered these added to the formal qualities of the object.",

Henri Dropsy (1885-1969) was one of the most influential French medallists of the first half of the twentieth century. He trained a generation of French medallists, directing the medal-engraving studio at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1930 until his retirement in 1955. \nDesigned in 1931, at the height of Dropsy's creativity, this uniface medal was edited in bronze and ceramic (Monnaie de Paris, 1964, no. 109 p. 58). Dropsy's sources of inspiration were varied and eclectic. The format of this medal of religious subject evokes Renaissance relief sculpture, while stylistically it shows Italo-Byzantine, Romanesque and Gothic elements.",
