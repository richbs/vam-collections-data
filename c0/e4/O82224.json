Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>92 John Somers</b>\n(d.1680/81) \n<b>c.1666-70</b> \nEvans 41 \n\n<b>Oval 73 x 60 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in firm hatches of brown and sanguine with some grey shadow and white heightening, thickly blended over a pale carnation ground; hair in brown washes, hatched in darker colour and heightened with gouache; robe in opaque blue, hatched with dark grey and the lights in white; white collar; on a dark gummy brown background; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some flaking. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Falsely signed: <i>SC 1666</i> in yellow paint. \n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century oval gold locket with plain convex back, the sides channelled and rising to the bezel, which holds the bevelled convex glass; hanger of D-section with a central channel on the outside, bifurcating into tight turns and continuing in tapering flat-section spirals of four turns. Later engraved across the back: \n<i>By S. Cooper./ 1666.</i> \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> According to a note by Long in the Wallop Loan Book, the miniature had been in the collection of 'the late Stracey Clitheroe of Boston House, near Brentford': acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop in 1922 and lent to the V&A, 1927-49; given in 1933 to Alan Evans, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at theV&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Grosvenor Place 1932. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nLong apparently accepted this as by Cooper; Reynolds was the first, in 1949, to state his dissent: 'I think the signature is bogus, & that the miniature is by D M.' (1) Since the miniatures in the Evans Collections were largely unknown before 1927 and have remained out of sight since 1949, no other scholar has recorded an opinion. \n\nReynolds was certainly right to point out that the signature was false, but his suggestion of D M as the artist emerges more favourably from a comparison of black and-white photographs than from direct confrontation of the miniature with signed works. D M's variable manner and uneven quality, the relative uncertainty of his structural sense and apparent hesitancy of brushwork seem to preclude him as the author of the miniature. Both compositionally and in the accuracy of the basic draughtsmanship, this miniature is impressive. On this level its relation to Cooper's authentic miniatures of the late 1660s is profound, especially to those apparently left unfinished by him at his death and 'finished' by other hands. It thus lacks the tonal subtleties and rich blending of the surface which Cooper would have added in the final stages of the sittings, and the 'finishing' by another hand, Signalled by the obviously false monogram and date, is of relatively poor quality. Although the initial impression is thus unpromising for late Cooper, closer study tends to confirm that the miniature is very largely the master's work. \n\nAccording to Cokayne 1887, John Somers was an attorney at Clifton-on-Severn in Worcestershire. His wife was Catherine, daughter of John Severne of Powyck in the same county. His son John, born in March 1650/51, was a lawyer whose career prospered greatly after the abdication of Iames II; he achieved the office of Lord Chancellor (1697-1700) and a barony in December 1697. The identification is apparently traditional but of uncertain antiquity and not supported by any evidence. \n\nLong doubted it, and made a note that, when he had seen the miniature at Grosvenor Place, the pose of the head had reminded him of Lely's <i>Lord Clifford</i>.(2) He cannot have intended this as a suggestion of the sitter's identity. \n\n1 MS note in Wallop Loan Book. \n2 Repro.
