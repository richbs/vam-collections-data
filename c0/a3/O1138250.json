The original building was destroyed by fire in 1869 and rebuilt the same year but it closed after suffering war damage in 1941.\n\nThe poster's style is typical for its era, printed in two colours and advertising the acts in the order they appeared on the stage. Jack Hylton's Band is 'top of the bill' in red lettering, with Eddie Gray (1898-1969) in blue, the comedian whose fake French accent led to his soubriquet 'Monsewer' Eddie Gray. The poster came to the museum as part of a collection of memorabilia and costumes belonging to Bay Harrington (ne\u00e9 Florence Charlotte) Harrington (1891-1983). Bay Harrington was originally a singer who made her career in pantomime and variety, appearing in several double acts including one with Evelyn Kirkby. Kirkby & Harrington appear on this poster with their act Practice Makes Perfect.",
