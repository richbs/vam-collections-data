This type of lock is a rim lock, with its mechanism entirely enclosed in a case to be mounted on a door.\n\nThis lock has four bolts to control security levels. The machanism of an identical lock in the Peter Phillips Collection was described by its owner as follows: \"The master of the house could select, by turning the small knob at the top of the lock, the number of bolts (1 to 4) that he wished to put into operation. When set at number 4, which is maximum for locking the top 4 bolts are locked out by just turn of the key, but 4 turns of the key are required to withdraw these, ie. one at a time! There is however literally a \"sting in the tail\" of the top bolt, the one last withdrawn, for it triggers off the twin anti-burglar bottom bolts, and these can only be unlocked by a reverse action of the correct key.\"\n\nThe Museum bought this lock for \u00a36 in 1859.",

The bold proportions and twirling ornament are unmistakeably Baroque and would complement contemporary decoration in the house without necessarily matching exactly. On this example, even the inner workings are finely decorated.\n\nEnglish locksmiths were based mainly in London and the Midlands and were renowned for their ingenuity. Wolverhampton produced, according to one writer in 1686, locks 'curiously polisht and the keys so finely wrought, that \u2018tis reasonable to think they were never exceeded'. \n\nThe complicated mechanisms of locks made rooms secure while their intricate patterns in steel and brass turned their locks into works of art.
