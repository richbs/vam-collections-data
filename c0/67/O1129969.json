Slide rules were first developed in the 1600s, based on new discoveries about logarithms, and remained in use until the 1970s, when they were generally replaced by electronic calculators.\n\nUntil this point, slide rules were a common sight in offices and schools, and decorative and specialist models were available. This particular example was produced for use by schoolchildren, and is suitably robust and simple to use.\n\nIt was made by British Thornton, a company established in the nineteenth century, but best known after the Second World War for their well-crafted slide rules, each one taking over a year to complete. In the 1960s, the company experimented with new materials and produced slide rules like this one in plastic.",
