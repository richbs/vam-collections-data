Originally worked in pinks, reds and greens on a blue ground part of this ground has now faded showing dye differences. The central disperses outwards with a row of carnation heads and rose branches finishing in four corner ogee devices of tulip plants with two ragged leaf tulip heads on each side of the cloth.\n\nThere is an outer border of shaded green to cream onto which are placed nine roundels to each side. These show alternate circular shaded blue to cream circles with ones depicting a stylised flower form.\n\nThe cover is completely surface embroidered mostly with darning and stem stitching (each central motif has a stem stitched outline). Some satin stitch has been sued in the floral roundels of the outer border. The colouring, which has now faded slightly, is of reds, pinks, browns, greens, creams, black and blues on a blue/cream. The blue showing strongly in the outer cartouche, the cream in the centre and the borders.\n\nThe lining is anchored to the surface with four symmetrically placed circles of running stitches which show on the back as they are in pink silk.",
