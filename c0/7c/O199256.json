Founded in 1913 by Roger Fry, Omega Workshops was a group of artists (including Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant) who designed furniture, pottery, carpets, textiles, stained glass and whole schemes of interior decoration.  The Omega textile designs were ahead of their time and set a fashion for abstract and geometric patterns. This example 'Mechtilde', is likely to have been designed by the artist Frederick Etchells, a member of the group. This simple design was also used for a carpet woven by The Wilton Royal Carpet Factory, near Salisbury, in about 1915.",

I should like, therefore, to recommend that the gift be very gratefully accepted. The pieces are small and can be accommodated in the  portfolio. The duplicate pieces will be very useful, if required, for Circulation purposes.' Letter of acceptance dated 15/03/1930 and signed by Eric Maclagan. (30/2364)",
