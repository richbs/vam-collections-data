            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 48-51.\nThe following is the text of a note on the entry:\n\nConstable describes his trip in April from London to Deal in the East Indiaman <i>Coutts</i> in his letter of 23 May 1803 to Dunthorne (L. ed. S., pp 23-25). He left the ship at Gravesend to walk to Rochester and Chatham; from Chatham he hired a boat to see the men-of-war in the Medway and sketch H. M. S <i>Victory</i> in three views. Then he rejoined the ship at Gravesend. She lay under the North Foreland three days because the weather was stormy and, in the confusion of leaving the ship when Deal was finally reached, he left his drawings behind. As he had been nearly a month on board and had been \"much employed in making drawings of ships in all situations\" this was a serious loss to him. However, Leslie records that he recovered his sketches, which were about 130 in number. Subsequently he made use of some of the sketches for the drawing 'His Majesty's Ship <i>Victory</i>, Capt. H. Harvey, in the memorable Battle of Trafalgar, between two French ships of the line'. The ten drawings Nos. 41, 42 recto and 43-50 are all assigned to this voyage down the Thames and the Medway. No. 41 was certainly made then, since it is dated 24 April 1803, and the others are clearly homogeneous in style and subject matter. A drawing from the same series in the collection of Lady Harrington shows the East Indiaman <i>Coutts</i> and another named ship, the <i>Woodford</i>. It is on a sheet of paper measuring 7 5/8 x 12 7/8 ins, and watermarked: T WICKWAR 1801. A drawing of the same series was No. 49 in an exhibition at Colchester in 1950 of drawings from Lt.-Col. J. H. Constable's collection; it measured 8 x 10 inches, and was reproduced in the catalogue of that exhibition. Other drawings of the series were in the collections of the late Sir Bruce Ingram and the late Mr. A. P. Oppe. Four others were sold as Lots 1-4 at Messrs. Christie's, 26 July 1957; Lot 3 showed Tilbury Fort and Gravesend Church and Lot 4, of Chalk Church near Gravesend, was dated on the back 18 April 1803. The influence of Van de Velde has been seen in these drawings (Key, p. 22) and it is interesting to note that in an unpublished entry of Farington's <i>Diary</i> (21 May 1803) Constable is recorded as saying that he did not think Turner's pictures were \"true to nature and a fine selection like the works of Vandevelde, Backhuysen etc...\"",
