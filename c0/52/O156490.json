            "public_access_description": "The scene painted on the top of this box took place on July 13, 1740 in the royal forest of Compi\u00e8gne. During a court hunt involving Louis XV, a stag was pursued onto the roof of a thatched cottage and remained at bay until the master of the hunt cut the roof from underneath him. The box is reputed to have belonged to Louis XV and to have been subsequently presented to Andr\u00e9 Hu\u00eb in 1824 by Louis XVIII. The Hu\u00eb family had a long tradition of royal service, principally as greffiers de chasse, record-keepers of the royal hunt at Fontainebleau. \n\nThe miniatures are by a member of the van Blarenberghe family of painters. The van Blarenberghe family originated in Leyden but moved to Paris in 1751. At least five members of the family were painters of miniatures but as they rarely signed either their first name or initials, their work is difficult to attribute. The hunting scenes shown here are typical of their output.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
