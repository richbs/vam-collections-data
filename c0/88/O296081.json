            "public_access_description": "Although traditional jewellery was worn throughout Sweden, and has a distinct Swedish character, there are marked differences between the different provinces.   Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nBodice fasteners originated in the Middle Ages, as a way of fastening the front opening of the bodice.  Women made holes on either side of the bodice, and then laced them together with a cord running through the holes, in the same way that people still lace their shoes.  Because of their prominent position on the front of the costume, the holes were often decorated with embroidery, or replaced with silver eyelets or bodice fasteners, like these.   \n\nThese bodice fasteners are typical of those made in southeast Sk\u00e5ne.  The rosette of stamped sheet silver in the centre deliberately lacks one petal, to leave room for the chain which links them together, but by the 19th century they were purely decorative, not functional.  These fasteners are marked with the maker's mark of Jonas Aspelin the youngest, who came from a family of silversmiths who specialised in traditional jewellery.   He worked in Ystad from 1830 to 1842.",
