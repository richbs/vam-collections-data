The comparison would support the redating of this piece to the period: about 1720-1740. (cc 11/4/1988)\nConservation (8/5/1984-5/10/1984): Breakages to openwork back and sides caused by a child climbing on the object in Room 44. Three pieces broken off the back section. The first step section of the top back rail broken off in two pieces on the right hand side. One piece missing from the carved area just below the right hand corner top rail, c.21 cms in from right hand side. This replaced with softwood fixed with animal adhesive scotch glue, and toned to match existing surface with button polish mixed with burnt sienna, slate umber and ivory black.\nThe damage also resulted in a section of openwork carving below the stepped top rail coming loose, an area of approx. 22 * 11 cms. This too refixed using scotch glue.\nAt some time in the past, a composition of whiting and glue has been used to fill gaps caused by shrinkage. Wax also used. This wax has in areas covered the decoration, and this was removed by scalpel.",
