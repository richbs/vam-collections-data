Players compete against each other in the categories Olympic Golds, First Medal, Height, Hall of Fame, and Number of Games. The pack includes one 'Golden Card', with a code to win prizes including a 'rowing experience with Steve Redgrave'.\n\nAs one of the official licence holders, Winning Moves created a range of Top Trumps products as merchandise for the 2012 Olympic Games in London.\n\nThe game:\nTop Trumps is a competitive card game which first became a craze in school playgrounds in the mid 1970s. The game developed from \u2018quartets\u2019, which had a similar objective: to beat your opponents and win all the 40 or so cards. \n\nSold for pocket money prices, in the early days Top Trumps was marketed mainly to boys, and the military-focused subjects included cars, planes and trucks. In 1982, Waddingtons took over the brand and determined to broaden the game\u2019s appeal, introducing decks featuring cats and dogs as well as horror characters, football teams and prehistoric monsters.\n\nIn 1999 Winning Moves relaunched the brand, producing smaller decks of only 30 cards and tying the games in to popular culture. They now produce packs for every major event, TV series and film release.\n\nRules of the game: \nAt the start of the game, all the cards are dealt out equally between players. Each card contains statistics such as speed, weight, length etc. The starting player calls out the category that he/she feels will \u2018trump\u2019 the other players, and then lays the card face up. The remaining players show their cards and the one with the highest score wins, and takes all the cards. The player that holds all of the cards is the winner.",
