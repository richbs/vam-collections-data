Their fascination with tea pots was satirised in particular. George du Maurier drew a number of cartoons satirising the Aesthetic Movement for 'Punch' magazine, including a cartoon entitled 'The Six-Mark Teapot'. In it, the 'Aesthetic Bridegroom' and his 'Intense Bride' are looking at a teapot. He declares 'It is quite consummate, is it not?' and she replies 'It is, indeed! Oh, Algernon, let us live up to it!'. Similarly in the contemporary play by F.C. Burnand, 'The Colonel', the leading character says, 'There is so much to be learned from a teapot'.\n\nPeople\nThis is from a set of prize-winning designs by Albert Ludovici II  (1852-1932). A number of printers awarded annual prizes for novel greeting card designs in order to acquire new designs for their next season's collection.",
