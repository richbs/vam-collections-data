Simpson\nDeveloped in the late eighteenth century to act as supports for the carving knife and fork and prevent grease spoiling the table cloth, the knife rest was sold in pairs or in cased boxes of four by the end of the nineteenth century. The design of a single bar supported on  x -shaped ends could be ornamented with the use of additional decorative materials such as pearl and ivory or figurative supports in the shape of sphinx or dogs. James Dixon and Sons sold pairs of  plain plated knife rests for 5/6d. Levesley Brothers manufactured in Sheffield but had a retail outlet in London. The firm went bankrupt in 1929.",
