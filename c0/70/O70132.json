With knots.\n\nThe sampler is divided into sixteen bands varying in depth from 0.875 inch (2 cms) to 2.5 inches (6.5 cms). The linear designs are all based on Italian zigzag and angular 'coiling' stem patterns. The last and most ornate band of bunches of grapes depending from leafy stems is unfinished. Several of the embroidered lines separating the different patterns have come unworked, leaving only the needle holes.",
