Professor Charles Rhyne has pointed out, however, that the words <i>Epsom book 1806</i> occur on the back of a drawing (59.55.263) in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, and that the doubtful word here should also read as <i>book</i>.  See also <i>John Constable Drawings & Sketches</i>, the catalogue by R. R. Wark of an exhibition at the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, 1961, No. 10.  Constable is known to have visited Epsom, where his aunt Mrs. Gubbins lived, this year; a water-colour drawing by him of Epsom Common dated 4 August 1806 is in an extra-illustrated volume of Leslie's <i>Life of Constable</i> which at one time belonged to Lord Lee of Fareham, and a view of Epsom dated 6 August 1806 was formerly in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler.  The building represented in No. 95 is presumably the old church at Epsom which was rebuilt, except for the tower, in 1824.\"",
