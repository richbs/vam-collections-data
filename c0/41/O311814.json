Wyon.\nThe International Exhibition of 1962 was held in a building larger than the Crystal Palace on a site in the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society in Kensington. The building was designed by Captain Francis Fowke of the Royal Engineers (1823-1865), to whom this medal was awarded.\n\nThe original owner of these medals, Captain Fowke of the Royal Engineers, became a distinguished official architect in the middle of the Victorian era, and published a number of related papers. In 1857 he became an inspector in the Science and Art Department in London; in 1860 was added the office of architect and engineer; while in 1862 he was appointed Superintendent of the construction of the South Kensington (now Victoria and Albert) Museum. He designed the new Museum of Science and Art (now the Royal Scottish Museum) Edinburgh, as well as extensions at the National Gallery, Dublin. He planned the buildings for the International Exhibition of 1862. Shortly before his death he designed the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nLeonard Charles Wyon (1826-1891) was the eldest son of William Wyon (1795-1851). Educated in art by his father, he became a skilled engraver. When 16 he already had made several medals, and when 24 he succeeded his father with the title of Modeller and Engraver (1851). He made a great contribution to coinage, which he was particularly trained for by his father.",
