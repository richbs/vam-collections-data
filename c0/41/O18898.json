            "public_access_description": "The name Ninsei, along with Raku, is synonymous with the rise of Kyoto as a major centre for the production of ceramics. According to the T\u014dk\u014d Hitsuy\u014d, written by Ninsei\u2019s student and successor Ogata Kenzan (1663-1743), Ninsei\u2019s proper name was Nonomura Seiemon, his art name being a combination of \u2018sei\u2019, the first character of his given name, and \u2018nin\u2019, the first character of Ninnaji, the temple in the northwest part of Kyoto in whose grounds he established the Omuro kiln in 1647.\n\nWhile there is documentary evidence to suggest that Ninsei died in 1694, his date of birth is unknown. A record in the Ninnaji temple referring to a \u2018Tamba-yaki Seiemon\u2019 (Tamba pottery Seiemon) corresponds with the fact that Nonomura was a village in the province of Tamba, situated to the west of Kyoto. If Ninsei was born and trained as a potter in Tamba, we know from the T\u014dk\u014d Hitsuy\u014d that he also worked in Seto, a large ceramic-producing centre in modern Aichi Prefecture renowned among 17th century aficionados of chanoyu (the tea ceremony) for the high quality of its brown, iron-glazed tea caddies.\n\nBy the time Ninsei came to set up the Omuro kiln he was a highly seasoned potter who was able to take full advantage of the market for high quality ceramics that Kyoto represented. His early success in this was helped by the patronage he received from the influential tea master Kanamori S\u014dwa (1584-1658). The ceramics known to have been made for S\u014dwa are relatively restrained, but during the 1660s and 1670s Ninsei went on to develop the highly colourful and painterly style of overglaze-decorated stoneware for which he is renowned.\n\nThis incense burner is an interesting fusion of restraint and exuberance: restraint in terms of it being painted in plain tones of underglaze iron-brown, and exuberance in terms of its shape, which imitates the conch-shells famously carried by Japanese mountain ascetics (yamabushi). With regard to the latter, there is a passage in the diary left by Morita Ky\u016bemon, a potter from the province of Tosa who visited Kyoto in 1678, which mentions how the Omuro kiln was famous for its incense burners modelled after pheasants, mandarin ducks, prawns and other natural forms. The V&A\u2019s incense burner has a sibling in the form of a slightly larger and more colourful, overglaze-decorated example in the collection of the Seikad\u014d Bunko in Tokyo.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nNonomura Ninsei was a prominent figure in Kyoto's rise as a major ceramic-producing centre during the seventeenth century. He is renowned for his use of overglaze enamels in the production of elegantly decorated stonewares. This trompe l'oeil work in the form of a seashell, with its underglaze iron oxide painting, is subdued and naturalistic. Adoption of an underwater mollusk as a container to burn incense associates it with the use of conch shells by both the military and itinerant priests in Japan. This piece, too, was among the Japanese ceramics proudly presented by the South Kensington Museum as its property at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 (see cat. 114).\n\nANNA JACKSON/RUPERT FAULKNER",
