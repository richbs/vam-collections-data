From the 1430s, Nishapur benefited from the diaspora of potters released from their enslavement in Samarqand. Along with faithful imitations of Chinese porcelain, a distinctive house style developed out of a traditional Islamic palette of black and turquoise and slip-carved technique introduced in the late 12th century. Dishes were painted in layers of black slip and incised with Chinese scroll-work designs possibly inspired by wares from Cizhou kilns in Northern China, but also found on underglaze painted wares from the 14th century, these designs were covered with a clear turquoise-tinted glaze. The designs were generally geometric, possibly inspired by embroidered textiles. Four dishes in this Timurid style are dated between 1468 and 1495, bowls and mugs also survive. The style was copied at Mashhad and also found on contemporary wares excavated from Istanbul, the so-called \u201cMiletus\u201d wares.",
