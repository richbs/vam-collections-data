            "bibliography": "In a letter of July 1, 1811 to his friend John Morrit, Sir Walter Scott wrote that he had 'bought a small farm value about \u00a3150 yearly with the intention of \"bigging myself a bower\" after my own fashion'. This farm was Cartley (nicknamed 'Clarty') Hole Farm, situated in the Borders between Kelso and Melrose, which Scott would rename Abbotsford. Abbotsford originally comprised 110 acres but grew exponentially as Scott bought up neighbouring property such as Abbotslee (1812) and Kaeside (1816) at inflated prices. By 1825, it was ten times its original size. The buildings too had been radically transformed. First, in 1812 Scott had built a 'cottage' for family residence. The first proper expansion (1816-18) saw the addition of a square western tower and the present dining room and parlour, turning Abbotsford into a rural villa. Soon, however, the house became too small for the ever-expanding land and for the accommodation of Scott's innumerable guests that included Maria Edgeworth, Joanna Baillie, J.M.W. Turner and Washington Irving. Upon accepting a baronetcy in 1818, Scott also felt that the house was no longer in keeping with his new dignity. In winter 1821 he began a second phase of building, demolishing the cottage and building a two-story manor house in its place. Beginning with Virginia Woolf, many commentators have seen Abbotsford as an echo of the blending of ancient and modern that Scott attempts in his written works. Externally, it resembles a Scottish fortified house of the sixteenth century, with turreted towers, high chimneys, and a castellated fringe. The interior is filled with relics of both national and family history: heraldic devices, suits of armour, old weaponry (including Rob Roy's long-barrelled gun, pouch and dirk), and paintings, collected or commissioned, of Scott's forebears. In other respects, though, Scott was remarkably forward-looking, installing a pneumatic bell system, water closets, and extensive gas lighting (on which some commentators have blamed his poor health). It proved immeasurably influential on nineteenth-century building styles, sparking the Victorian revival of Scots-Baronial architecture.",
