The slab has a simple bolection-moulded edge and is pierced in the centre with a circular hole, approximately 5 cm in diameter\n[Stand] Stand of tripod form, supported by three panther monopodia flanking a wrought-iron column, all supported on a triangular base with with concave sides. It is decorated with black paint and gilding. The stand is surmounted by a circular marble slab (:2) which supports a porcelain vase (:1).\n\nThe base is triangular, with concave sides, the top made of two boards with a tongue and groove joint.  The sides are gilded over black paint, the top painted black. The three monopodia stand on the points of the triangle, where the base is supported underneath on low blocks.  The monopodia curve back from the base in a double curve which brings the heads of the panthers level with the edge of the plinth. The paws and the sheath of acanthus above each paw are painted with matt black, with slight areas of gilding on the paws.  Above this the monopodia are gilt, except for a narrow fillet running up the back of each, scrolled at each end, which is black painted.\n\nAt the centre, between the monopodia, rises a black-painted (now rusted) wrought-iron column, which has been twisted from a bar originally approximately 3 cm square. The twists on this are very irregular. On the base, this has been seated in a quatrefoil mount composed of four petal-shaped castings of iron.  The inner edge of these, against the sides of the column, have been filled in with carved wood or composition, carved to follow the castings of the petals and, like them, painted black. The top of the column is seated within a circular iron washer which is screwed to and upper plinth.  This is also triangular and concave-sided, the concave sides each carved with a recess framed by narrow fillets, the recess set centrally with an elongated patera with raised centre. The edge fillet are painted black, the rest of the plinth gilded, over a black-painted ground.  This plinth supports a circular beechwood top, the edge painted white, the top unpainted.  The top is cut in the centre with a cross-shaped recess, which provides the housing for the iron rod on which the vase is assembled (:4) and screws holes for fixing are visible. The top is entirely covered with green cotton sateen, tacked to the underside of the top.  This was presumably slit to allow the rod to be attached and the top is now rent in several directions.",
