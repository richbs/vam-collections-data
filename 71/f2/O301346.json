The narrower blue stripe is in a plain weave; the broader stripe is made by weaving extra wefts of cotton gimp into the blue weave. This combination creates a rough and smooth textural effect.\n[Curtain] The selvedge of the fabric is left on the right hand side, while the left hand side of the curtain has been turned in. A small hem at the foot is evident, and in parts is coming apart; at the top there is deep cotton rufflette tape (7cm) which probably postdates the original making up of the curtains. It is stamped with the words 'RUFFLETTE BRAND'.\n[Curtain] The main differences between this curtain and its pair are the depth of the hem and the type of rufflette tape used at the top. This object apparently has its original rufflette, which is much narrower (at 2.5 cm) than the tape on the other curtain. It is made of cotton and is sewn in place about 4 cm from the top of the curtain; it still gathers the curtain into pleats. The hem is deeper and in better condition. There are worn patches in the middle. Faded in the centre (by the sun?).",
