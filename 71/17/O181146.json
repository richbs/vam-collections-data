            "public_access_description": "Omar Ramsden was a renowned English silver designer of the first half of the 20th century. The son of a silver and electroplate manufacturer, he was apprenticed to a company of silversmiths and attended evening classes at Sheffield School of Art. In 1897 he won a competition to design a mace for the city of Sheffield, which was made with the English silver designer Alwyn Carr (1872\u20131940). Both men went on to study at the Royal College of Art in London and in 1898 Ramsden and Carr set up in partnership in London to produce fine \u2018art\u2019 silver. They exploited the fashionable taste for handmade silver of the Arts and Crafts Movement and, with the help of skilled artisans, made articles adapted from Gothic and Renaissance designs. Wine coasters, bowls, ladles and sauceboats were ornamented with dog roses, oak leaves and briar twigs and applied with Celtic-style inscriptions, which became a trademark. They were patronized by Church bodies for their superbly wrought, large-scale ecclesiastical ornaments, such as monstrances and chalices. In 1905 the studio moved to larger premises in Fulham, London.\n\nRamsden, unlike Carr, rarely executed a piece himself, but the studio\u2019s success was due to his exacting direction and entrepreneurial flair. He revived the mazer from the Middle Ages: a fine-grained, turned-wood bowl with ornamented silver rim and base. Best known is his Kings\u2019 Mazer of 1937, which displays portrait heads of the three British monarchs who reigned in the previous year (London, Middle Temple). The partnership dissolved in 1919; Ramsden retained the studio, and by the 1930s, with 20 assistants in his employ, his reputation was at its peak. The grandest pieces were still handcrafted and are now in royal and other collections.",
