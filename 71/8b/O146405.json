They were fitted onto the lids of tombs and memorial slabs to commemorate the lives of the deceased. Colour could be added to monumental brasses, and this example has traces of wax inlay. Monumental brasses generally reflected the status and identity of the individual they commemorated, and were often accompanied by inscriptions to identify them, although this brass has unfortunately been separated from its inscription. Memorial brasses are important sources of information about clothing, armour, status and social aspirations, as they naturally reflected the status and identity of the individual they commemorated, and are frequently dated, an otherwise rare occurence in medieval art.",
