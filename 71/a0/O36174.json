The legs and rider are separately attached. It is white with black yellow and red. Its tail is unravelled black twine and the reins a red thread. The integral key protrudes from the right shoulder of the body which houses the clockwork mechanism. Around the middle of the body is a band of red  and black striped cloth which covers the open allowing the movement of the horse. When wound the horse's body opens and narrows at the middle forcing the legs to open and close and move the whole forward. The rider; representing a cowgirl; is coloured green; white; dark pink; black and tan. The head is of moulded vinyl with painted blue eyes and a white and pink mouth. The figure sits forward of the body join. \n*The mark is a K within a 5 petalled stylized flower. It is similar to that used by Yonezawa Toys of Tokyo.",
