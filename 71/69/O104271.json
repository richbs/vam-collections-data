The donor was usually a prominent member of the community, which in country parishes often meant the local landowner. But gifts came from other sources too. Many were given by women, showing their active involvement with the church. Churchwardens also took pride in commissioning new silver and often contributed to the cost. Occasionally, gifts like Lord Hertford\u2019s chalice and flagon were made to win support for a political cause. \n\nNot all of these gifts were new. Old-fashioned domestic plate, often richly decorated with secular ornament, was welcomed and used for the service of communion or the collection of alms.\n\nFrancis Tyssen, a Dutch merchant and elder of the Dutch Church in Austin Friars, London, became a British citizen in 1687 when he was granted armorial bearings which were engraved on the pair of silver flagons then in his ownership.  When this flagon (along with its pair) became the property of Thirkleby Church, North Riding, the cartouches engraved with the Tyssen arms were covered over with plain plates.  Though the arms were only granted to Francis Tyssen in 1687, he may have been using them for some time before.",
