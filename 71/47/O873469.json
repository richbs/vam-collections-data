London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Thomas BOWLES after I. DONAWELL Ironmongers Hall with a View of Fenchurch Street.\nLettered with the title in English and French and <i>I. Donawell delin/ T. Bowles Sculp./ Printed for Carington Bowles in St. Paul's Churchyard, John Bowles in Cornhil, and R. Sayer in Fleet Street</i>.  Inscribed top right <i>49</i>.\nEngraving and etching coloured by hand.\n26 X 41.5cm\nE.3054-1903\n\nLit. C. J. Kaldenbach in <i>Print Quarterly</i> Vol II No 2 June '85, pp.87-104\n\nThe Bowles family printselling business was founded by Thomas Bowles Senior in 1703.  It was bequeathed to his son Thomas Bowles Junior in 1721, who died in 1767.  The younger son Thomas Bowles may well be the engraver recorded in Le Blanc, Manuel de L'Amateur d'Estampes, Paris 1854-1889 as responsible for a number of topographical prints of London in the 1740s and 1750s.  If this is the case this must be a posthumous printing as on Thomas Bowles death did the business pass to Carington Bowles. \nThe size, format, and subject matter of this print all point to it being a 'perspective' print, intended to be viewed through a double convex lens which gives the illusion of depth.  'Perspective' views normally depict monuments, the architecture of famous cities, formal gardens or the interiors of buildings, drawn in such a way that the straight lines within the image converge to a vanishing point.  This sort of composition gives the greatest possible sense of depth when seen through a lens of the correct size.  The lens was sometimes mounted along with a mirror to allow the prints to be laid flat on the table rather than held in the hand.\n'Perspective' prints were available throughout the eighteenth century and early in the nineteenth centuries although the period of their greatest popularity was c.1740 to 1790.\nThe fashion for these prints was international, with publishing centres in France, Germany and Italy and prints being issued with bi-lingual and tri-lingual captions.  The provided pleasant hours of entertainment, fulfilling a dual purpose as souvenirs and as substitutes for travel for those who preferred sight-seeing from their own fireside.\nThe colouring, opaque in the sky and transparent over the buildings and figures, is similar to the colouring on the view of Chiswick House and Garden.  A copy of the image in the Museum of London testifies to the popularity of this class of print, which would have been the staple fare of printsellers.\"",
