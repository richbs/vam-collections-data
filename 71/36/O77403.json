One of the jurors commented that the plaques were possibly suitable for the adornment of a coffin but that 'they are very badly displayed at present. They would look much better if they were sunk in a piece of dark marble of small 'figure' and not too highly polished.'\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe subjects are the three figures from Greek mythology,  Perseus, Andromeda and Orion, after which three constellations are named.  Perseus is depicted with a sickle in one hand and the head of Medusa in the other, Andromeda stands chained with her hands before her and Orion holds a spear and has a sword hanging from his belt.\n\nPeople\nThese panels are the work of Margaret Jenkin who before her marriage, as Margaret Giles, was recognised as one of the most able students in the modelling class at the Royal College of Art.",
