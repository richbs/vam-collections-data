It was a distinctive garment since it was often quilted and decorated with silk cord or braid frogging. It  could be single- or double-breasted. Soft materials were used such as silk, velvet or wool in dark reds, greens, blues, brown or black.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis smoking jacket and matching trousers are made from black and green striped velveteen.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe popularity of the smoking suit shows how sartorial rules were relaxing in the late 19th century. The smoking jacket was often worn in place of the dinner jacket for an informal evening at home.  It was worn with day trousers, evening trousers and sometimes (as in this example) with matching easy-cut trousers.\n\nTime\nThe smoking jacket was still popular in the early 20th century. In 1956 the Austin Reed catalogue announced an updated version of the smoking jacket, named the television jacket.  This did not become a widespread fashion as by this date few men felt the need to wear a special garment for watching television or smoking.",
