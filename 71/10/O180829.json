            "public_access_description": "Tea-drinking, introduced into Britain in the late 17th century, became widespread during the 18th century.  Since tea caddies were placed on the table as tea was served, they were often highly decorative.  A great variety of wooden caddies were made between 1780 and 1810 as tea became cheaper and more widely used.  A. Hepplewhite & Co. published designs for both \u2018tea caddies\u2019 and \u2018tea chests\u2019, which were usually larger, in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer\u2019s Guide, 1788 (2nd edition 1789, 3rd Edition 1794). \n\nThis caddy is decorated with four minute wood carvings of landscapes and trophies behind glass. These carvings may have been imported from the Netherlands as they are probably by the Dutch craftsman Cornelius Bavelaar (1747-1830). He specialized in tiny dioramas very similar to these, usually mounted in glass-fronted wooden frames. His son, also Cornelis Bavelaar (1777-1831), worked in the same style.",

The word 'caddy' is thought to derive from the Malay word for a measure of weight (<i>kati</i>) equivalent to about half a kilogram.",
