The action of the rains had washed away the soft alluvial deposit, which apparently had once formed the bed of a lake, into innumerable pointed pillars, standing sometimes singly, sometimes in groups, some of them having large stones balanced on their narrow  points, looking as though they would topple over at any moment.\u2019",
