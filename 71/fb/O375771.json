Beham and signed with the monogram A.P. The case of square section with an attached Doric column on a plinth at each corner. The top of the case surrounded by a Doric frieze and entablature supported by the four columns. The intervening panels between the columns are engraved with the allegorical figures of Astrology, Geometry and Arithmetic. These representations are copied from woodcuts by Hans Sebald Beham. The panels between the plinths are engraved with various types of foliage enclosing roundels with profile Roman heads. The fourth side contains the clock face and has evidently been inserted later, presumably in 1620, the date engraved on it. Within the hour ring of the clock is an alarm indicator dial which revolves with the single hour hand. The alarm indicator hand is missing. On the front of the clock, above the cornice, is a revolving sphere, one half of which is gilt and one half blue. This revolves once in twenty-four hours.\nIn the centre of the top is the bell for the alarm and the striking mechanisms. The gilded exterior of the bell is etched with arabesques and it is suspended from a frame consisting of four legs surmounted by grotesque bearded heads and terminating in lions' paws. The meeting point of the legs forms a pedestal for a draped female figure whose attributes, if any, are now missing. At each corner of the top is a figure of a putto blowing a horn. The female figure's upper arms appear to be restored; one of the putto is ungilded and may be a replacement.",
