            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nMichael Good (born 1942) is an American jeweller of Belgian parentage, based in Rockport, Maine. The elegant and sinuous forms of his work are created by anticlastic raising, where the metal is shaped into two principal curves which bend in opposite directions. This demonstration sample, made while teaching at the Royal College of Art, illustrates the potential of this technique. Michael Good, through his making and teaching has been an influential champion of anticlastic raising.",
