            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nIn avant-garde jewellery, the necklace has experienced a complete makeover. Conventions have been broken and scale is no longer a constraint. Emphasis is given more to animation and the interaction with the body, but most of all to expressiveness.\n\nFor his neckpiece, Ted Noten chose a random selection of 'found objects', a process that is characteristic of his humour and sense of irony. His themes derive from personal experience and emotions, and critique of modern day life. The objects from everyday life which he combines with gold and silver, are given a new meaning. The interpretation is, however, left to the imagination of the viewer or wearer. He continues to break conventions and innovate jewellery.\n\nTed Noten studied at the Academy of Applied Arts , Maastricht and the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, Amsterdam. He is a designer of objects, interiors, photographer and video-artist.",
