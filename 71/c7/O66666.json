One of its characteristics was that it was made as one continuous piece, rather than parts that were subsequently joined, and together with the fineness of the particular thread used in its construction, this made it the softest and most delicate of all laces.  For this reason it was considered particularly suitable for use with lighter clothing in the summer months. Another characteristic of Mechelen lace was the use of a distinctive, shiny thread to outline its motifs. This gave a clarity that made it particularly suitable for pictorial designs,",
