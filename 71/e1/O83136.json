There are very few such jars which survive intact and this example is particularly noteworthy for its elaborate decoration and combined techniques of moulding, stamping and piercing. While the origin of such jars is not known, certain details such as the moon-shaped faces of the figures and their elaborate crowns and neckalces, as well as the rulership iconography exemplified by a cross-legged figure holding a beaker and the presence of lions point to Mesopotamia during the 11th-12th century, the Abbasid period.",

A Mesopotamian provenance has been suggested by early scholars such as Lane (1949), though a similar but less elaborate complete vessel in the Institute du Monde Arab has been attributed by Porter (1999) to Iraq and to the Jazira. This seems to be supported by the moon-shaped faces on the figures and the elaborate costume style. Unglazed vessels usually suggest a utilitarian use at a non-courtly level, however the extensive figural decoration and combination of piercing, stamping and moulding suggests ostentatious display of wealth on a utilitarian object.",
