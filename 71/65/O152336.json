Painted miniatures were common in England and royal personages sometimes gave them to favoured courtiers. The making of silver medallions such as these was a contemporary Dutch practice. \n\nPeople\nFrederick V (1596-1632), Elector Palatine of the Rhine, married Elizabeth (1596-1662), the eldest daughter of James I of England (ruled 1603-1625), in 1613. He was offered the Crown of Bohemia in 1618. This medal was probably made before 1617, when the couple's second son, Charles, was born.\n\nSimon de Passe (?1595-1647) was born in Cologne  and worked as an engraver in Utrecht in The Netherlands. He spent some time in Copenhagen working for Christian IV, King of Denmark-Norway  (ruled 1588-1648). In England he received orders from James I to produce a series of portrait medallions in silver, perhaps as gifts for courtiers. One at least is dated 1616 and the series was completed by 1619.\n\nDesign & Designing\nEngravers such as Simon de Passe would often copy or adapt the work of others as well as producing their own designs. For example, his medallion of Elizabeth I (ruled 1558-1603)  is copied from a painted miniature by Isaac Oliver (about 1558-1617).\n\nLearning to engrave on metal or plate was often seen as a way to train for other trades such as printing or book illustration. The English artist William Hogarth (1697-1764) began his career as a plate-engraver before moving on to painting.",
