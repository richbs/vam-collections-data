Most were made of leather, though softer materials were popular for informal wear.\n\nMaterials & Making\n\nBy the 1850s most boots were mass produced.  Some, however, were still partly made at home. Women often embroidered the uppers of boots and slippers for their families as well as for themselves.  Patterns for these were readily available, but the results were sometimes gaudy as some of the colours favoured for the embroidery were produced by bright chemical dyes.\n\nDesign & Designing\n\nThe elastic-sided boot was patented in 1837 by J. Sparkes Hall of 308 Regent Street, London, as a result of experiments made with India rubber cloth. The elasticated side gussets eliminated the need for laces and button fastenings. Instead, the boots could simply be pulled on with the help of the fabric loop positioned at the back of the ankle. \n\nBy 1850 techniques for making the elastic gussets had much improved, though the elastic tended to perish after a number of years.  It was not until the early 20th century that techniques for using elastic in clothing, underwear and footwear were perfected.",
