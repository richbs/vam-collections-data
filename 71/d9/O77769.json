Combs were often made of luxurious and eye-catching materials, in this case ivory decorated in gold lacquer with a pattern of maple leaves. This motif is found in the work of British architects and designers such as Edward W. Godwin (1833-1886).\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis type of comb was meant to be used as a decorative hair ornament rather than as something with which to actually comb the hair. Combs became popular with the emergence of elaborate hairdos during the 17th century. They complemented the elegant kimono of their wearers and were usually used in combination with ornate hairpins and bodkins.\n\nTime\nIn the mid-1850s Japan was opened up after more than two centuries of seclusion from the rest of the world. The passion for all things Japanese that this triggered in the West was termed 'Japonisme'. Japanese art objects were avidly bought by western collectors, artists and designers from specialist dealers or shops such as Liberty's. Kimono and dress accessories were regarded as the embodiment of Japanese femininity. Combs were pretty items that could be bought relatively cheaply.",
