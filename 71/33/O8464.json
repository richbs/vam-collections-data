It appears to be an early example of the new fashion in British chairs of the 1720s and 1730s for curving backs and cabriole legs. The chair is painted, or 'japanned' red in imitation of red Chinese lacquer and is evidently intended to be in the Chinese style. It may be that it illustrates the transition of design elements from Chinese chairs to British furniture. \n\nTime\nBritish chairs with curving back splats and cabriole legs, usually made of walnut, and with upholstered seats, are sometimes described as 'Queen Anne' chairs.  However, these chairs first came into fashion not during the reign of Queen Anne (1702-1714), but in the reign of George I (1714-1727). \n\nPeople\nThe construction and wood of the chair indicate that it was made in Britain, but its maker and history are not recorded. Giles Grendey (1693-1780) was the cabinet-maker most noted for the production of red japanned furniture later in the 18th century, but this piece does not resemble the chairs he produced.",
