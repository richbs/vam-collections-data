The elliptical blade is reminiscent of late 18th century servers, contradicted by the dynamism of the handle, shaped as the streamlined tail of a flying fish. The detail on the surface of this simple design brings it to life. Engraved scales and waves decorate the entire surface and dramatic piercing creates a fin effect. The sense of action is captured through the sweeping fin pattern on the blade, aligned with the tail of the handle. The aerodynamic form and bold decoration of this piece create an exciting feeling of suppressed energy.",
