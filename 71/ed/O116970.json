While the inscription on the lower right was once thought to read '1815', the last figure in the date is now illegible.",

Aschcroft.\nAlthough this is also a page from a sketch-book, in spite of the similar measurements it is doubtful whether it comes from the same sketch-book as Nos. 139 [308-1888], 141 [ 300-1888], and 144 [306-1888] of 1815.  The outer (right-hand) edge of the page in No. 142 measures 115 mm.; in the three cited the measurement is only 114 mm.  (The measurements given above are of the greater, left-hand, side.)  Possibly the year should have been read as 1817, one of the years in which Constable was using a sketch-book of 115 x 187 mm.  \n(See note on number 611-1888)",
