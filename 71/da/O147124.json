There is a long inverted conical opening at the front with reinforcement in the same patterned silk only at the back of the neck band.  It has a small cross-over flap but no fastenings.  The jacket is formed of one back panel seamed at the shoulders with many variously shaped inserts, back and front, forming a definite hipped outline.  The short sleeves are multi-pieced, set at right angles to the main panels, and seamed to form a tube through the underarm area is left open and partially faced to form three sides of a square.\nThere is evidence of padding and quilting along both hips.\nMain Silk: dark blue satin patterned with large composite, offset botehs facing left in one row, right in the next.  Each boteh is outlined by a red band filled with yellow and blue flowers framing a yellow flowering stem and on a dark blue ground. Small botehs are placed along the base line of each separate motif and a small boteh between each mid-way, while 2 flowering sprays emanate from the large boeteh's tip; their colouring echoes that of the main motif.\nWarp: dark blue silk, Z-twist\nWeft: brown silk, faded red silk, yellow silk which originally had silver strip open S-wound around it.\nFacing: bias-cut red woollen twill.\nLining: heavy dark blue [indigo] plain weave cotton\n829-1876 is made from a very similar woven silk fabric.",
