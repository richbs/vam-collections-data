The shapes of the seat and back were generated by a computerised 3D modelling programme and CNC (computer numerically controlled) cut from timber. They were made to test the ergonomic quality of the chair and its sculptural form.  The grey painted base bears no relation to the finished legs of the chair and was made only to support the back and seat at the correct height and attitude in relation to the floor.",
