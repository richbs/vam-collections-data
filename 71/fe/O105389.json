Its decoration follows the trend towards large-scale composition on ceramics made in Iznik, north-west Turkey, that began in the 1550s.\n\nThe Ottoman court renewed its patronage of Iznik ceramics during the construction of the S\u00fcleymaniye mosque in Istanbul in the period 1550 to 1557. Potters produced the first Iznik tiles and added a bright red to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, dishes, bottles and other vessels were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on white or coloured grounds. From the 1550s the motifs of small sprays of tulips and other recognisable flowers were replaced by compositions on a larger scale, as shown here.",
