Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nWhen Sweden became Protestant in 1527, Swedish women continued to wear crosses rich with symbolism and religious pendants like their medieval predecessors.  These round pendants were also called 'crosses', and had a strong religious character.  This one is stamped with the monogram IHS, the first letters of the name Jesus in Greek.  The Swedish word trillekors means a wheel-shaped cross.\n\nThis pendant is marked with the initials IAL, the mark of Jonas Aspelin the elder.  He was a member of a large family of silversmiths in Ystad who specialised in producing traditional silver.",
