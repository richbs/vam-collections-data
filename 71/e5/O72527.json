The Prince wears upper-body armour that survives in the Armouries of the Tower of London and the collar and enamelled George of the Order of the Garter. The miniature is notable for still being set in its original gold locket, which is enamelled with blue on the outside. It still has its front-fitting hinged lid. Two years before this miniature was painted, the Civil Wars had broken out in England. King Charles I was captured, tried and executed as a public enemy in 1649. By then, Prince Charles was in exile abroad. During the Civil Wars and following his father's execution, images such as this one proliferated among those loyal to the monarchy. The monarchy was restored in 1660, when Charles II returned from abroad and reclaimed his crown.",

Three miniatures signed with these initials have appeared so far: a portrait of Francis Hones (c.1604-162 2), third son of the 1st Earl of Clare, at Welbeck Abbey, (1) a portrait identified as of the Duke of Hamilton, said to be 'on card'; (2) and Cat. No. 175, which was previously unrecorded. Long (3) mentions that Gilbert Jackson (<i>fl.</i>1622-42) and George Jamesone (1587-1644) were both working at the date of the Welbeck miniature, which Goulding dated to just before Francis Holles's death; both may still have been working at the date of the miniature catalogued here, though neither is known to have practised limning, and certainly not at the level of technical competence evident here. \n\n1 Goulding 1914-15, p. 79, no. 45,pl.VII. \n2 South Kensington 1865, no. 330. \n3 Long 1929, p. 234. \n\n<b>174 </b><b>Charles II, as Prince of Wales </b>\n(b.1630 d. 1685)\n<b>1644-5</b>\nE442-1995\n\n<b>Oval 48 x36 mm (sight size)</b>\n\nFeatures hatched and stippled in brown, grey and some sanguine, with touches of white in the eyes and red in the lips, on a pale creamy carnation ground; hair in dark brown wash, lined in black and with highlights in grey gouache; collar in pale brown wash, heightened and modelled in white and pale grey; armour in grey and black washes, the lights in pale grey and white, and the gold-work in yellow ochre and brown; the George in brown, grey and white; background in a pale flat brown wash, shaded above the shoulders and in the margins with darker brown hatches; on vellum; the support not seen. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Perhaps slightly faded in the flesh; otherwise fine, and apparently undisturbed in its locket (see below). \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Upper right, with the brush point in black: <i>GI</i>. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century oval gold locket; the convex back with a raised and milled fillet around the edge, within which is a field of pale blue champlev\u00e9 enamel; the same blue enamel fills the sides of the locket, producing a full, rounded edge, terminating at the gold bezel which holds the flat glass by its bevelled edge; the locket is closed at the front by a convex lid, enamelled like the back, hinged at the top and closed at the bottom by a gold clip fitting tightly over a curved gold post soldered to the base; the hanger is a coarse replacement of an original of which only the curling tail, in gold enamelled champlev\u00e9 in a paler blue than the rest, remains. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Given in August 1994 by Miss Elizabeth J. George of Twyford, Berkshire, who had recently inherited it from her grandmother. \n\nThe miniature is a copy after the portrait of Prince Charles, at the age of fourteen, by William Dobson (Royal Collection); the Prince wears the upper-body part of an armour which survives in the Armouries of the Tower of London. The painting is 'believed to have been in the collection of William, 1st Earl of Craven (1606-97), and to have been given to him by Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, or bequeathed to him by Prince Rupert, who had inherited many of his mother's possessions'. (1) Like the painting, the miniature would presumably thus have formed part of the deliberate spread of images of the Prince of Wales in the 1640s, for use as tokens of gratitude and loyalty. Comparable objects were produced by Hoskins, Des Granges and Nathaniel Thach (see Cat. Nos 47, 50), and earlier, the group of images of Elizabeth of Bohemia by Peter Oliver (Cat. Nos 10, 11, 12). But although clearly taken from the Dobson, the likeness in the miniature has 'slipped' considerably. This may imply that there was an intermediate source for it, and that the miniature was not necessarily produced close to the original, at Oxford in 1644.\n \nThe miniature is a confident piece of work and is in a conventional professional technique for the 1640s, except for the use of dark grey in the drawing of the features, which had otherwise been superseded by the subtler and more corporeal brown and sanguine. Another minor anomaly is the absence of a painted gold margin to the vellum: here the miniature has been cut slightly small for the locket, and the appearance of a gold border in the lower right quadrant is in fact the inner surface of the gold back of the locket. \n\n1 Millar 1963, vol. I, p. 113, no. 204. I am grateful to Katie Coombs for showing me the initial fruits of her cataloguing of this miniature.\" ",
