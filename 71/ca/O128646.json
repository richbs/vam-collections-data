While the larger fairs were enlivened by anything from juggling and acrobatics to plays and puppet shows, smaller ones were far less spectacular. The attractions shown in Elwood's watercolour sketch are representative of  those found at the minor country fairs throughout Britain. The costumed mountebank appears to be performing a slight-of- hand trick and amusing the crowd by producing a snake from a box. His partner, wearing the traditional jester's cap with ass's ears, attracts less attention with simple comic contortions. They work on a trestle stage which would be easily dismantled for transportation. It is a scene that could belong to any period and only the dress of the audience places it in the 18th century.",
