Pan was a quid made of chopped areca nuts mixed with spices and wrapped in a leaf that was chewed after meals. In courtly settings, the offering of pan marked the end of a visit.\n\nPlaces\ns.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe box was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and bought by the Museum of Ornamental Art for \u00a331 as a 'modern' piece from Dholpur in Rajasthan.",
