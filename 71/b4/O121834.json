The officers represented were Major Robert Browne, kneeling, Captain Michael Head and Lieutenant the Hon Pierce Butler. They belonged to the12th Light Dragoons regiment and were at that time stationed in the Italian seaport town of Civita Vecchia following French military activity. News of the good conduct of the regiment reached Pope Pius VI who announced his intention of presenting, in Rome, a gold medal to each of the officers. The soldiers are show wearing the medals.\n\nThis painting, by the artist James Northcote (1746-1831), shows the moment when the Pope took Captain Brown's helmet in his hands and expressed the wish ' that Heaven would enable the cause of truth and religion to triumph over injustice and infidelity'. The painting includes another figure, dressed in civilian clothes, shown standing to the left of the Pope. This is possibly a Mr Jenkins, who was an English gentleman resident in Rome.",

He was self-taught before moving to London and studying at the Royal Academy Schools in 1771.  He was a pupil and resident assistant to Sir Joshua Reynolds, President of the Royal Academy, from 1771 to 1775. Northcote travelled to Italy in 1777. He remained in Italy until 1780 and was elected into Academies in Florence and Rome. On returning to London he worked predominantly as a portrait artist although he also produced history paintings. He was elected ARA in 1786 and RA in 1787. He exhibited over 200 works at the Royal Academy between 1773 and1828, and also exhibited at the British Institution and the Society of Artists.  He was principally a portrait painter, but also painted fancy pictures and historical subjects, including several for Boydell's famous Shakespeare Gallery. Many of his works were engraved.  He published the <u>Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds</u> in 1813 and <u>The Life of Titian</U> in1830.  There is a portrait drawing of him in the V&A (museum number 3007-1876).\n\nJames Northcote (1746-1831) was born in Plymouth, Devon.  He began teaching himself painting whilst he was still in Devon.In 1771 he moved to London to study at the Royal Academy Schools.

Northcote also contributed to the literature on art by writing biographies of artists. He published the <u>Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds</u> in 1813 and <u>The Life of Titian</U> in1830.  There is a portrait drawing of him in the V&A (museum number 3007-1876).\n\nThe painting commemorates the presentation of British Officers, from the 12th Light Dragoons, to Pope Pius VI (1717-1799) in the summer of 1794. The work is signed and dated 1800. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy four years later (number 156). The officers are shown in a group on the left of the painting. They have been identified as Major Robert Browne (kneeling), Captain Michael Head and Lieutenant the Hon. Pierre Butler. Behind the Pope is a figure in civilian clothes who has been identified as a Mr. Jenkins, an English Gentleman who was then residing in Rome. Behind the group is a banner with a cross on it, to the left of this in the distance is Castel Sant'Angelo. Originally built as a mausoleum for the Roman Emperor Hadrian (76-138 AD), Castel Sant'Angelo has had various functions throughout history. At the time of this painting it was being used as a prison at the time of this painting. Situated close to the Vatican, the inclusion of Castle Sant'Angelo sets a location for the event whilst also referring to the historic past of the city.\n\nAccording to the Historical Record of the 12th Lancers 1842, pp.18-19, Pope Pius VI had been struck by the conduct of the Regiment and announced his intention of presenting a gold medal to each of the officers (see note on object file). Some of the Officers went to Rome where they had the honour of meeting the pope. According to a note on the museum file, the Pope received these officers in a gracious manner, and taking a helmet in his hand, wished \"that Heaven would enable the cause of truth and religion to triumph over injustice and infidelity\". Having uttered these words, he then placed it on Captain Browne's head. Although the Pope stated that the medals could not be provided before the regiment departed from Civita Vecchia, Northcote depicts these figures wearing them. The Officers were also presented with three melodies, the Sicilian Vespers, an evening hymn which later became known as the Spanish Chant, and a theme that later became known as the Russian National Anthem.",
