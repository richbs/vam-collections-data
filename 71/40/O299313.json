This table was made as part of a set with a cabinet that is also in the V&amp;A (W.8-1965). Occasionally, mirrors and pairs of candlestands were also supplied. The most luxurious pieces were made to order for rich clients, both aristocrats and well-to-do merchants. The exuberant decoration of this table, and its matching cabinet, was known as laque incrust\u00e9 (inlaid lacquer). It was a technique for which Antwerp makers were famous, an attempt to imitate Asian lacquer, reflecting the fact that Antwerp had close links with both Japan and China from the very beginning of the 16th century. The Portuguese, who had been the first to develop trade with East Asia, gave Antwerp a monopoly for the storage of spices and other goods brought from Asia.",

            "history_note": "Probably bought by William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608-1697), who left England after the execution of Charles I in 1649 to join the court of Elizabeth of Bohemia (1596-1662), sister of Charles II and widow of Frederick V, Elector Palatine and King of Bohemia (1596-1632). He returned to Britain after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and planned to build a large palace at Hamstead Marshall, Berkshire, for Queen Elizabeth. After she died in 1662 he continued to build the house as a memorial to her.  This table and its matching cabinet (W.8-1965) may well have been intended for that house, which was designed by the Dutch-born architect Sir Balthasar Gerbier (1592-1663) as a miniature version of her old home at Heidelburg Castle in Germany and took thirty years to construct.  The house was burnt to the ground in 1718.  The cabinet and table would have been highly fashionable objects at the time that plans for Hamstead Marshall were laid. \n\nThe pieces were later at Coombe Abbey, Warwickshire, which the family owned until 1923 but it is not clear when they were moved there. \n\nPurchased by the Museum from Sotheby's, New Bond Street, London, 20 November 1964, lot 147, for \u00a3400. (Registered File 64/3176).  \n\nThe table required considerable conservation after its acqusition by the Museum.",
