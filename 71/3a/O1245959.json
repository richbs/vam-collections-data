Cowper had heard the story from a friend, Lady Austen.\nHe was said to be a wealthy draper from Cheapside in London, who owned land at Olney in Buckinghamshire, near where Cowper lived. It is likely that he was actually a Mr Beyer, a linen draper of the Cheapside corner of Paternoster Row.\nThe poem tells how Gilpin and his wife and children became separated during a journey to the Bell Inn, Edmonton, after Gilpin loses control of his horse, and is carried ten miles further to the town of Ware.\nThere are a number of sites commemorating the exploits of John Gilpin, most notably 'Gilpin's Gallop', a street in the village of Stanstead St Margarets said to be on the original route taken by the horse's unfortunate pilot.",
