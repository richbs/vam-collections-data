The printer is shown in medieval costume, rather than contemporary clothes, but the process of block printing is accurately represented. The wood block, with the pattern cut into its surface so as to leave the raised areas for printing, has been inked, and registered with the previous impression. It is then impressed firmly and evenly onto the paper, using additional pressure via a foot-operated lever. One hundred years ago, woodblock-printed wallpapers were considerably more expensive than machine-printed papers because the process was more labour intensive and took much longer to complete.",
