The character Plough Monday appears in the first scene along with the Twenty-Ninth of February ('Her first appearance these four years'), and Twelfth Night. The playbill credits: 'The Masks, Allegorical Devices and Designs by DYK-WYN-KYN the Celebrated Artist in Pantomime Physiognomy'. In an article of 1867 the playwright T.W. Robertson described him as 'the presiding genius of all theatrical Christmas revels.'\n\nFor his pantomime work Keene used the name Dykwynkyn which he characteristically signed on an artist's palette on the ground. He was also responsible for designs for a number of other lavish productions of the day, and for these he was billed as Mr. R.W. Keene.",
