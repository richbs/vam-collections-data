Pupil of John Crome 1811-14, exhibited at the Norwich Society of Artists from 1811 and elected Member 1812. Entered RA Schools 1815. Exhibited 65 works at the RA between 1811 and 1859, 136 at the BI 1814-59, 53 (including seven watercolours) at the SBA, and also at the watercolour societies. Subjects all landscapes, often with figures and animals. Published 'The Scenery of the Rivers of Norfolk' (1827-34). Died Hampstead, London, 24 March 1859; his son Arthur James Stark was also an artist. An exhibition of his works was held in Norwich in 1887; several drawings and watercolours are also in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: <u>Art Journal </u>1850, p182, 1859, p135 (obit); H Day <u>East Anglian Painters</u> 11, 1968, pp56-77 \n\n\n<b>Lloyd's Pulpit, Festiniog, North Wales </b>\nFA192 \nPanel, 27.3 X 33 cm (l0\u00beX 13 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nPresumably the painting with this title exhibited at the SBA in 1837.

It rests upon a broad base, rising from the bed of the river, detached from those rocks which form its wood-fringed sides. The Hugh Lloyd from whom it takes its name was a reputed sorcerer in the time of James I, and is said to have delivered his incantations from the summit of this isolated rocky pillar, for which dark purpose its situation in a deep umbrageous glen was well calculated.",
