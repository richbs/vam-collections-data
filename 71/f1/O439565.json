            "public_access_description": "Noh is the classical theatre of Japan which was codified in the 14th century by the father and son actors Kan'ami and Zeami under the patronage of the Shogun (supreme military leader) Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. Under Yoshimitsu the Zen principles of restraint, understatement, economy of movement and frugality of expression became incorporated into the performance. By the early seventeenth century Noh had become an even more austere and formalised drama reserved almost exclusively for the military elite.\n\nThe Noh mask of O-Doji (lit. \u2018large\u2019 Doji) represents a young boy with the ethereal quality of eternal youth. The narrow, smooth, oval face contributes to the overall impression of a gentle and good-natured character; the arched eyebrows help convey a general expression of innocence coupled with amazement or surprise. The mask is traditionally used by all Noh schools except the Kanze in plays such as Makura Jido (Pillow Boy) and Kiku Jido (Chrysanthemum Boy) where the main character celebrates an auspicious imperial reign by presenting water from the Fountain of Youth to the emperor's messenger. It is also used in other plays where the innocent features conceal a benign supernatural being.",

From his studio in Kobe, Suzuki continued a tradition which stretches back over some 600 years creating Noh masks both for performance and exhibition. Suzuki has donated a number of masks since 1987 thereby enhancing the V&A\u2019s collections of masks which began in 1876 when we acquired 12 masks from Samuel Bing. \n\nDuring February and March 2002 in the Toshiba Gallery at the V&A, as part of the Japan 2001 Festiva, Suzuki displayed 12 masks in the exhibition \u2018The Spirit of Transformation: the Noh masks of Suzuki Nohjin\u2019 and subsequently donated six masks (FE.127 to 132-2002). \n\nIt was typical of Suzuki\u2019s friendship with the V&A that even on his death-bed that among his last thoughts he instructed a bequest of No masks \u2013 including a mask of Okina, a type that I had mentioned to Suzuki many years ago that we would dearly love to have in our collection.",
