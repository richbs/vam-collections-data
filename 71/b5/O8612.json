At the French Revolution, which began in 1789, this church was closed down and its stained-glass windows were dispersed. Some ended up in another church and others in museum collections. \n\nScenes from the lives of the saints were popular subjects for stained-glass windows in the Middle Ages. The cult of St John the Baptist was especially prominent in Europe after about 1450 and remained strong into the 1500s. The subject matter for scenes of his life was taken from the Gospels, apocryphal texts and the ever-popular Golden Legend, a compilation of saints\u2019 lives written about 1260.\n\nSt John was related to Jesus Christ. His mother, Elizabeth, was the Virgin Mary\u2019s cousin. In this panel we see John as a young man leaving his aged parents, Zacharias and Elizabeth. He is about to begin his stay in the wilderness. Through prayer and fasting his spirit was strengthened in preparation for his coming ministry.",
