The object has been adapted in the following manner:\n(1) The opening for the neck is now covered by a composite disc of brass; the middle section is decorated with a 19th-design that incorporates Rococo C-scrolls. \n(2) Where the junction between the body and the base should be, the metal has been folded back to form a blunt edge. \n(3) There are spaces on the upper side of the body for the spout and handle to be soldered on; these have an inverted tear-drop shape, with a small, vesica-shaped boss at the top. The space for the spout once had a hole in it, off-centre. This has been filled with a plug of brass sheet of a different colour. \nAs a result of these changes, the object was mistaken for the head of a standard when acquired in 1897.",
