            "public_access_description": "This cup and cover with removable spice-box bears the arms of both King James I and the Prince of Wales, the future Charles I. A number of similar cups are known to exist; this cup is one of four in the collection of the V&A. Most are made from turned pearwood, incised with heraldic animals, and date from the early 17th century. The closeness in design of the majority of these cups, and of their date of production, may suggest that they came from a single workshop, or were the work of a single craftsperson.\n\nIt is not certain exactly what this type of cup would have been used for. The most regular interpretation is that they were communion cups used by private chapels, or by chapels that could not afford silver. However, the use of wood as a material for holding the host had been forbidden by the Canons of Winchester since around 1071, as its porous nature would cause the wine to be absorbed.\n\nOther theories concerning their use range from the humdrum (being prototypes for silver communion cups) to the glamorous (the insignia of an exclusive society). The latter notion holds some weight, it has been suggested that the armorials are the crests of founding members of such a society.",

Pinto relates that they could have been the cups of Royal Cupbearers, and though some of the crests relate to holders of this office, most had held it before the reign of James I. The likelihood of their having been prototypes for silverware is thrown into doubt by the lack of any known replicas made in silver.\n\nPinto proposed that they may have been 'part of the insignia of some exclusive 17th century society', similar to, or perhaps an ancestor to, the Honorable Order of Little Bedlam, a social club founded by the 5th Earl of Exeter in 1684.",
