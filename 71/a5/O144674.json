Holman Hunt was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of artists. He is now best remembered for his allegorical painting of Jesus 'The Light of the World'.\n\nThe jeweller Carlo Giuliano (1831-95) was originally associated with the Roman firm of Castellani. He was born in Naples but spent most of his working life in London, where he initially supplied work to other jewellers. In 1874 he opened his own shop on Piccadilly. There he sold pieces in the archaeological style and also items inspired by Tudor and Renaissance jewels.  He was succeeded by his sons, Carlo Joseph and Arthur Alphonse Giuliano, in 1895, who continued the business until 1914.  From 1912-14 their shop was at 48, Knightsbridge, London, the address which is printed on the silk of the case.\n\nThe marks on the jewels show that the brooch was made by Carlo Giuliano before 1895, and that the hair ornaments were made by his sons Carlo and Arthur Giuliano between 1895 and 1914.  The three jewels are in a case made in 1912-14.  It seems likely that the hair ornaments were made in 1912-14 to match the brooch and that a new case was made for all three items at the same time.  \n\nCoral was popular in jewellery of the 19th century. Most coral in Europe came from the sea around Naples and nearby Torre del Greco. In the 19th century it became a fashionable souvenir. This was partly because people could travel more once the Napoleonic wars had ended in 1815, but also due to the growing popularity of naturalistic jewellery in the 1850s.",
