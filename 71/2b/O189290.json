Age of Chance. Des: The Designers Republic: Ian Anderson (b.1961) and Nick Phillips (b.1962). Pencil, ball-point pen, felt marker and wash. 1987. 41.7 x 59.1. E.843-1990 and E.841, 844, 845-1990. Felt marker, tracing sheet, acetate and PMT (photomechanical transfer). 50.6 x 75.0. E.855-1990. The images in this design strive to present 'the world' of the Age of Chance picked-out of The Designers Republic studio file on the group. This 'world' was one of loudness and a confused mix of slogans and images. Just as the imagery of the Age of Chance singles should hold the viewer's interest for three to four minutes, so this LP record sleeve design should sustain itself for 20 or more minutes. \n\n<b>PLATE 3.32.a : 12-inch LP record sleeve.</b> <i>One Thousand Years of Trouble</i>. Age of Chance. De: The Designers Republic. Offset lithography. Virgin Records Ltd. 1987. E.789-1990. \nThe finished sleeve constructed from the elements seen in plate 3.31 and constitutes a sort of \u2018passport\u2019 to the world of the Age of Chance.'",
