Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a tiger on a bamboo stem.\n\nOne of the greatest appeals of netsuke lies in the enormous range of their subject matter. The main inspiration was undoubtedly the natural world, especially animals. Although the tiger is not native to Japan, it has been widely used as a motif in Japanese art because it is one of the 12 animals of the East Asian zodiac. The 12 animals, one for each year, were used in a fixed order that was repeated every 12 years. The rat, monkey and tiger were among the most popular of the zodiac animals. A tiger netsuke might be used over the new-year festivities for the year of the tiger, as well as at any time throughout that year. Since the bamboo was seen as an unbending plant of enormous strength, its use in combination with the tiger may also be interpreted as representing unyielding strength in the face of adversity.",
