One talon lacks the outer keratin sheath, and the tip of the exposed bone is damaged. The other sheath is intact and seems slightly polished (to be expected with handling).\n\nIt was found to most closely resemble the Northern Goshawk (Accipter gentilis), but due to the large number of raptors present across this region of Asia and the limited material of this archaeological bird specimen, the identification must remain tentative. From its the characteristics, the talon is clearly either the long back talon or innermost front talon, i.e. one of the two most powerful digits in the typical raptor's foot. The general dimensions of the damaged bone suggest that the artefact was originally a broadly matched pair of talons. The size of the surviving talon compares very closely to the adult female Northern Goshawk. (see Historical Context Note)\n\nNotes on the Northern Goshawk prepared by Joanne H. Cooper",

They were recovered from the site of Niya, which dates from the 2rd to the 3rd century AD. Niya was probably the capital city of the kingdom of Shanshan whose people were of Indian origin. The site of Niya is remarkable for the carved wooden capitals, beams and balustrades that show similarities to the western classical decoration that filtered through Iran and Northwest India.  \n\nThe site is in an area of Central Asia now referred to as the Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia, from China to Europe. The most notable item traded was silk. Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed their goods from oasis to oasis. The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas \u2013 while silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in this way.\n\nThis object was brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862\u20131943). The Victoria and Albert Museum has around 700 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein at the beginning of the twentieth century. The textiles range in date from the second century BC to the twelfth century AD. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals.",

            "historical_context_note": "Niya includes a group of towns in the southern region of the Taklamakan Desert, at the foot of the Kunlun mountains. Once a military post under the Kingdom of Khotan, Niya became an important oasis along the southern Silk Road. Stein excavated several groups of dwellings there and found hundreds of wedge-shaped wooden tablets, some laced together in pairs with string and affixed with clay seals. The appearance of Pallas Athena, Eros and other Greek deities on some seals showed the impact of western classical art on Khotan. The tablets were inscribed with Kharoshthi, an ancient script of northwest India. Stein identified some as Buddhist prayers and others as administrative documents and he dated them to the period of the Kushan empire, which thrived in the first three centuries AD. Among ruins of dwellings and orchards, Stein found numerous textile fragments, Roman coins, wooden furniture with elaborate carving, pottery, Chinese basketry and lacquer, and documents in Chinese script which he dated to the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). The V&A holds, on loan, a large number of textiles from Niya, including leather, wool yarn, appliqu\u00e9d and stitched wool felt, and braided animal hair.\n\nThe inclusion of two talons from the Northern Goshawk may reflect both a trade in captive hawks along the Silk Road and also cultural beliefs relating to the use of animal parts as amulets or ornaments. \n\nThe Northern Goshawk is a large hawk that strongly favors woodland habitants.
