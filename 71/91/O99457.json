            "public_access_description": "This pierced porcelain basket was made at the Chantilly factory, south of Paris, in about 1770.  The basket shape suggests it was intended for serving fruit as part of the dessert course.  The fruit could have been fresh, crystallised or preserved in some other way, perhaps with sweet glazes and sprinkled with icing sugar. In France porcelain baskets were first made by the Vincennes/S\u00e8vres factory in about 1753.  They were sometimes called 'marroni\u00e8res' in the factory records and as the name suggests, were for serving preserved chestnuts 'marrons glac\u00e9s'. \n\nThe Chantilly factory was created by the royal aristocrat, Louis-Henry, duc de Bourbon and prince de Cond\u00e9 (1692-1740) in 1730.  A great patron of the arts, the prince embellished his ch\u00e2teau and domaine with paintings, sculptures, tapestries and decorative arts of every kind.  He bought expensive imported porcelains from China and Japan in quantity and this enthusiasm for porcelain suggests that it is perhaps not surprising that he chose to establish his own porcelain factory in the town of Chantilly to imitate the expensive imported wares.  He employed Cicaire Cirou, an experienced potter who had worked at the St. Cloud porcelain on the production and decoration of earthenware (called fa\u00efence in French) and the creamy white soft-paste porcelain made there.  True porcelain, as made in the Far East and at Meissen in Germany, could not be made in France at this time as one essential ingredient, kaolin, had not been found there.  Instead, so called 'soft-paste' porcelain was made utilising other materials in place of kaolin, and while early French porcelain lacks the glassy hardness of true porcelain, it has a special charm of its own.\n\nProduction started at the new manufactory in 1731 and in 1735 they were granted a royal 'privil\u00e8ge' for a period of twenty years, giving them permission to make porcelain of all kinds in imitation of Japanese wares.  The early porcelains made at Chantilly resemble closely Japanese 'kakiemon' wares and were no doubt made copying original items in the collection of the prince de Cond\u00e9.  By the 1750s the porcelain body had improved and a wider range of decoration is found, imitating the products of the royal porcelain factory of Vincennes, in fact there were a number of potters recorded at Chantilly who came from Vincennes or vice versa. \n\nWhile Chantilly service plates can be found in many collections, larger service items, 'pi\u00e8ces de forme', like this basket are not commonly found today.  One rare surviving service which, although divided between many different collections, still has many of its shapes, is the Anemone Service made between 1755-60 for use at the court of the Duke and Duchess of Parma.  (Madame Infante, eldest daughter of Louis XV became Duchess of Parma in 1748.)  A wide range of service items are known inspired by those in use at S\u00e8vres, including baskets, chestnut baskets, wine bottle coolers, juice cups, cheese dishes, bowls and plates.  \n\nInformation taken from Genevi\u00e8ve Le Duc, Porcelaine tendre de Chantilly, \u00c9ditions Hazan, Paris, 1996.",

They produced more than 80 between 1726-1746.  The most famous early French porcelain service was the <i>blue c\u00e9leste</i> one made at Vincennes 1753-55 for Louis XV.  At Chantilly, the Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 family had, since the early years of the 18th century been dining off Chinese export services 'porcelaines des Indes', and also possessed Meissen service items according to their inventories.  Le Duc speculates that it was perhaps Louis-Henry de Bourbon that encouraged the Chantilly factory to move into the production of services.  Groups of plates with similar decoration are recorded in contemporary inventories but it is difficult to say if these were part of services as such.  Plates presented some difficulties in terms of production for many soft-paste factories, but Chantilly succeeded in making them as did Vincennes.  Le Duc concludes that Chantilly was probably making services prior to 1740.  However it was only during the period of Peyrard's directorship during the 1760s that services became a more important part of the factory's production.  However, the inventory of la duchesse Charlotte de Rohan-Soubise, princesse de Cond\u00e9 taken at her death in 1760 revealed that Peyrard had delivered porcelain to her to the value of 3516 <i>livres</i> in 1759, the large sum suggesting that a service or services were included.  \nLarger service items, '<i>pi\u00e8ces de forme</i>', as oppose to plates, are not commonly found today.  The most significant group with polychrome floral decocration are perhaps those in the Anemone Service made between 1755-60 for use at the court of the Duke and Duchess of Parma.  (p. 250) Madame Infante, eldest daughter of Louis XV became Duchess of Parma in 1748.  Her premier ministre in Parma was Guillaume Dutillot who paid for French items through the offices of the Parisian banker Claude Bonnet.  In April 1760 Bonnet wrote to Dutillot: '<i>Je vous ai envoy\u00e9 Monsieur deux doubles services scavoir deux de Saxe de 21 courverts chacun et deux de Chantilly de 24 couverts chacun... Le service de Chantilly est pour les secondes tables, tout le monde trouve cette porcelaine plus agr\u00e9able que celle des Indes et chacun veut en avoir.  Cette manufature s'est relev\u00e9e, je ne scait trop si elle se pourra soutenir, pour faire mon service ils ont pris de nouveaux moules fait a limitation  du mod\u00e8le de S\u00e8ve qui leur ont beaucoup coutt\u00e9, et ce service double que jay pai\u00e9 3000 et quelque livres leur est revenu a eux plus de Dix milles par les pi\u00e8ces fendues (mises au rebut?) et par la construction de ces moules</i>'.  One of these services has survived scattered around the world in private and public collections.  \nIts shapes are all more or less inspired by Vincennes/S\u00e8vres, and include pierced baskets and chestnut baskets <i>marroni\u00e8res</i>.  The pattern of the piercing on this basket is very similar to the piercing on Vincennes cheese dishes (<i>fromagers</i>), see for example C.361-1909.",
