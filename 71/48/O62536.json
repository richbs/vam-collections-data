The designer George Walton (1867-1933) frequently used stencilled fabrics in his interiors. Because of their texture and subtle colouring, linens and hessians were popular furnishings for use in Arts and Crafts homes.  They were printed, painted, stencilled or embroidered but were also used in their natural form for curtaining and upholstery. Walton's wife, who donated this sample, described it as having been designed and executed by her husband so it may have been printed in his own workshops.\n\nThis pattern was used by Walton for the stencilled decoration in the morning room of Elm Bank,  a house that Walton decorated for Sidney Leetham near Knaresmire in York.  This may be a sample removed when the house was converted to a flat some years later or possibly a trial sample prepared by Walton in advance. Nail holes suggest the panels were used although there is no evidence of uneven fading, a sign of long-term use.  The same pattern was exhibited at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1906.",
