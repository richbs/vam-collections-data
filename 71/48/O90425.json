Giambologna has focused on the treatment of the female figure, and presumably removed the arms to allow a more detailed working of the torso, the surface of which has probably been finished with a soft, damp rag. <i>Pisa</i> on the other hand has been worked very loosely, his features merely suggested by pinches of clay and with the surface finish remaining quite rough. The details of the final marble composition are, however, taking shape, both in the basic relationship of the figures and in the quickly incised marks on <i>Florence\u2019s</i> thigh to indicate the position of the drapery.",

            "public_access_description": "This model forms the second stage in the preparation of the design for Giambologna's colossal marble group. The marble is 2.6 metres high and is now in the Bargello museum in Florence. It represents the city of Florence, who is personified as a powerful but elegant female, triumphing over the crushed figure of the elderly male figure of Pisa. This nearby rival city was then under Florentine rule.\n\nThe sketch was modelled on a wooden board, the imprint of which is visible underneath. It is solid apart from the torso of Florence. The sculptor is focusing on the treatment of the female figure. He presumably removed the arms to allow more detailed working on the torso, the surface of which has probably been finished with a soft, damp rag. Pisa, on the other hand, is worked very loosely. His features are merely suggested by pinches of clay, and the surface finish remains quite rough. The details of the final composition are, however, taking shape. This is shown both by the basic relationship of the figures and the quickly incised marks on the thigh of Florence, which indicate the position of the drapery.",

            "history_note": "This object was once in the possession of the Rucellai family and housed in the prestigious Palazzo Rucellai in Florence. With a long standing history as a wealthy Tuscan mercantile family, the Rucellai had owned the Palazzo for over 500 years during which time they commissioned work from artists such as Alberti, Michelangelo and Botticelli\n\nBought by the National Art Collection Fund (N.A.C.F) and the Pilgrim Trust in 1979, this statuette was given to the V&A in memory of David, Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, Chairman of the N.A.C.F 1945-70 and Trustee of the Pilgrim Trust 1945-75.\n\nPrior to its donation, it had been on loan to the V&A from P.& D. Colnaghi & Co Ltd.for the period of one year for its display in the 1978 touring exhibition <font i>Giambologna 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici</i>.\n\nHistorical significance: This terracotta is one of a series of surviving models for Giambologna\u2019s colossal marble group of <i>Florence triumphant over Pisa</i>, now in the Bargello. Following on from the wax model (4118-1854), which is believed to be the first, this is the next stage in the evolution of the composition. It represents the city of Florence, personified as a powerful but elegant female, triumphing over the crushed figure of <i>Pisa</i>, the nearby rival city then under Florentine rule. \n\nThe terracotta <i>bozzetto</i> conforms closely to Sirigatti\u2019s description of clay modeling included in Borghini\u2019s <i>Il Riposo</i>, a dialogue set in the villa of the same name belonging to Giambologna\u2019s long-standing patron and collector of his models, Bernardo Vecchietti. It is largely due to the growing interest in the creative process that so many of his models have survived, as well as the few by Michelangelo which were not destroyed. The latter\u2019s clay <i>Hercules and Cacus</i> (Casa Buonarroti, Florence) for example, generated significant interest in the theme of two figures in conflict.\n\nThe extraordinary number of extant models and the lack of drawings by Giambologna indicate his preference for working out ideas in three dimensions. Moreover it is possible to track the evolution of this particular design from inception to completion because of the unprecedented survival of every apparent stage of the process as described by Vasari. These comprise the initial idea or <i>pensiero</i> in wax (Inv. No. 4118-1854), this <i>bozzetto</i>, and two terracotta heads in the Bargello, which are fragments from a larger-scale model that have been worked up in more detail. The composition was further developed in the full-sized clay model, from which Francavilla probably carved the marble \n\nWhile the daring undercutting separating the limbs gave greater movement and space to the marble version, the freshness of the modeling seen particularly in this terracotta was lost in the more detailed carving of the features and the polished surface of the finished work. The surprisingly languorous position of <i>Florence\u2019s</i> right leg, though less awkward than the terracotta version, produces a strained elegance. However, the overall feeling of power and monumentality of the victor has been increased by her more upright and defiant pose. The columnar support under <i>Pisa</i> becomes a fox in the finished marble, presumably representing the cunning of the Pisans.\n\n(For all the above see New Haven 2001 and Florence 2006).",

            "historical_context_note": "<i>Florence triumphant over Pisa</i> is one of a number of such two-figure victory groups produced around the mid-sixteenth century, including those by Pierino da Vinci, Vincenzo Danti and Ammanati. While all these were influenced by Michelangelo\u2019s works, Giambologna\u2019s version was specifically designed to be placed in direct comparison with the older master\u2019s marble. Despite his dependence on modeling, of which this is amongst the first, his working method varied considerably from that of Michelangelo, who made comparatively limited use of assistants. In contrast, Giambologna set up an extremely efficient workshop, concentrating his own efforts on invention, and ceding most of the time-consuming execution of the finished marbles and bronzes to others.\n\nThe marble group was commissioned in 1565 by Prince Francesco de\u2019 Medici as a pendant to Michelangelo\u2019s <i>Victory</i>, which had been presented to the Medici by Michelangelo\u2019s nephew and heir following the master\u2019s death the previous year. The two marbles were intended to be displayed together in the Salone del Cinquecento of the Palazzo Vecchio at the festivities of Francesco\u2019s marriage to Joanna of Austria in December that year. However, there was insufficient time even for the marble block to be chosen and transported from the quarry and instead the full-sized clay (gesso) model (currently in the Palzzo Vecchio, Florence) was substituted for the final work, which was not completed until 1570.",
