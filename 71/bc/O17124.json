Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a group of mushrooms. \n\nThe main inspiration for netsuke subjects was the natural world, most commonly animals, birds and plants. Although the netsuke appears simple it was, in fact, very demanding to carve. The skill lies in contrasting the smooth, curved upper surfaces with the intricate, textured gills on the underside of the mushrooms.",
