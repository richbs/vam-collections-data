They were usually shaped like the piece you see here. The bowl was oval, with curved loop end handles and a domed cover with a finial, sometimes in the form of a lifting ring. \n\nThis sauce tureen is made of Sheffield plate, a thin layer of silver fused to a copper core. Sheffield plate originated in 1742. A  Sheffield cutler, Thomas Boulsover (1704-88), discovered that unequal quantities of silver and copper could be fused by heating under pressure, rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The Sheffield plate industry flourished for approximately one hundred years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
