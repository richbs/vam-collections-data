On the reverse, bamboo.\nThe metal mount of the stopper has a serrated upper edge.\nThe bottle has a small oval base with curved indentation underneath and no foot.\nPine and bamboo are symbols of long life, and bottle gourds included longevity amongst their connotions since they were traditionally carried by old men on their backs (C.A.S. Williams, Outlines of Chinese symbolism and art motifs, (2nd ed., Shanghai, Kelly and Walsh, 1932), p.215), and by the Taoist immortals to carry magic elixirs (Cammann, 1982, p. 25).\n[Snuff bottle] The bottle is an elongated flattened flask form curving to a slightly narrower base, with rounded shoulders.

The habit of snuff-taking spread to China from the West during the 17th century and became established in the 18th century. People generally carried snuff in a small bottle. By the 20th century these bottles had become collectors' items, owing to the great variety of materials and decorative techniques used in their production.",
