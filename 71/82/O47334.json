It was presented to the clown, Charlie Keith (1835-1895), and probably represents Keith himself, showing his wig modelled in the traditional clown's 'three-bobble' coiffure.\n\nCharlie Keith was a Londoner who began his career as a tumbler at the Whitehall Music Hall and later at the Bower Saloon as a sprite.  In the 1850s Keith toured as an acrobat and by 1861 advertised himself as 'Charley Keith, the Favourite Clown, Tumbler, Chair and Original Performer'. In May 1868, he opened his own circus at Exeter, a portable wooden building which he called Grand Cirque Imperial, featuring his own troupe of riders, jugglers and gymnasts. In 1882 Keith submitted a patent for a travelling circus building, and during his lifetime he travelled the world as a circus proprietor and clown, erected as many as 65 circus buildings, and performed before royalty.  He died in Bury and was buried in Southport.",
