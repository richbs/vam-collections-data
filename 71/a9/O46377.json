Previews opened 7 Feb 1991 and between then and the final performance at the Lyttleton, 25 April 1991,  the company gave 38 performances. Directed by Annabel Arden with Simon McBurney; designed by Rae Smith; lighting by Luke Sapsed; music by Jeremy Arden.  The Company comprised Mick Barnfather, Lilo Baur, Jasper Britton, Celia Gore Booth, Richard Hope, Kathryn Hunter, Marcello Magni, Eric Mallett, Julianne Mason, Clive Mendus and Simon McBurney. From 20 May - 9 June 1991 the company took the production to Spoleto, USA, where they gave a further 19 performances. Poster designed by Michael Mayhew.\n\nHistorical significance: In The Visit, (Der Besuch der Alten Dame), Durrenmatt exploits the possibilities of the stage as an instrument, including the Surrealist juxtaposition of things in new, strange and striking combinations, the cliches of advertising, the tricks of burlesque and slapstick comedy.\n\nComplicite's production of The Visit was due to have celebrated Durrenmatt's 70th birthday and they hoped to have played it for him as a tribute, but he died on 14 December 1990.",
