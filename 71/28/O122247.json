In his left hand he holds a chalice, his right arm bent at the elbow holds the cloak to his side. The right hand is missing. The head and eyes cast down slightly to the left. The bare toes of both feet showing under the robe. The figure stands on a rough octagonal base. The terracotta is a pink colour. The figure is a 'squeeze' or cast in terracotta. A 'squeeze' is a type of cast usually made in stucco, or terracotta taken from another relief. The process was common in Italy during the 15th and early 16th centuries as it provided an economic means of manufacturing versions of popular compositions. These were also not unknown at the time in London and examples can be seen at Hampton Court and also the fragments from Suffolk Place, Southwark in the Museum (inv.nos. A.26 to 36-1928) which show both white and red terracotta. The Southwark fragments, of similar date (around 1518-22), were found during excavations on the site of Suffolk Place, the palace of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk (d. 1545), brother-in-law to Henry VIII (see Bilbey with Trusted, British Sculpture 1470 to 2000.

            "public_access_description": "This figure relates to the tomb of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York in the Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey, carried out by the Florentine sculptor, Pietro Torrigiano. It is a slightly reduced replica of one of the bronze figures on the grate around the tomb. The tomb comprises of gilt bronze effigies surrounded by a grille. Only six out of original thirty-two figures remain on the grate, and these six have been in place since the inventory of the early eighteenth century. The pendant figure to this statuette that of an Unidentified saint (inv.no. A.77-1949), was considered to be so closely related to the grate figures that it was thought to have been a cast taken from one of the missing statuettes. \n\nThe dating for this figure and its pendant is one that has aroused much debate since acquisition in 1949. The debate concerning the dating of these terracottas is noted in departmental records. The earlier date of around 1505 was suggested by the fact that the production of cast figures of saints, such as this and the pendant figure would have been unlikely after the Reformation. The figure is a 'squeeze' or cast in terracotta. A 'squeeze' is a type of cast usually made in stucco, or terracotta taken from another object. The process was common in Italy during the 15th and early 16th centuries as it provided an economic means of manufacturing versions of popular compositions. The taking of squeezes and casts in terracotta was known in London around the start of the sixteenth century. Thermo-luminescence testing (a scientific means of determining the age of a ceramic object by establishing when it was fired) carried out in 1987 suggested that the two statuettes were fired in the early to mid eighteenth century and therefore are not contemporary with the original bronze figures surrounding the tomb. However, despite this result, for religious and stylistic reasons and those outlined above, a date of around 1505, contemporary with the grate itself, has been given.",
