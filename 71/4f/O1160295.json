            "public_access_description": "Buddy \"L\" Toys were produced by the Moline Pressed Steel Co. in East Moline, Illinois The business was started by Fred Lundahl who was the founder of the Moline Pressed Steel co. The company originally made automobile fenders and other stamped auto body parts for the automobile industry. They primarily supplied parts for the McCormack-Deering line of farm implements and the International Harvester Company for its trucks. \n\nMr. Lundahl first designed toys for his son \"Buddy\" in 1921. He designed and produced an all-steel miniature truck, reportedly a model of an International Harvester truck made from 18 and 20 gauge steel which had been discarded to the company's scrap pile. The sheet metal used in the toys was the same as used in real vehicle production. Most toys were based on real production vehicles. The toys were advertised as \"Guaranteed Indestructible\" although production changed during the war years as metal was needed. Instead a line of wooden cars and trucks was produced. After the war, Buddy L continued to manufacture toys; however, it was never the same as before as toy manufacturers began making plastic toys. \n\nThe toy business prospered so much that by 1923, Moline Pressed Steel stopped fabricating full-size auto parts in favor of toys. By 1925 the toy line expanded to 20 items, including fire engines, moving vans, tanker trucks, lumber trucks, overhead cranes and sand loaders. In 1926, the fabulous \"Outdoor Railroad\" train appeared. It was soon followed by ice trucks, coal trucks, tug boats, airplanes and a bus. Highly detailed and functional construction toys were also introduced, including some of the most desirable Buddy L toys ever manufactured. In 1930 the name of the company was changed to Buddy \"L\" Manufacturing Company. The toys underwent some improvements to make them more realistic. The Junior line of trucks and toys were introduced.\n\nThis particular truck is very similar to the Buddy L Construction Company Orange Dump Truck. This was sold on its own or as part of a set of construction vehicles.",
