From 1898 Walton was designing showrooms for the Eastman Photographic Materials Company, soon to be renamed Kodak, in London, Brussels and elsewhere. He used this chair design so frequently that it became almost a trade mark of the showrooms. George Davison joined the Eastman Company in 1897 and prospered as Kodak profited from the growing popularity of amateur photography.  By 1908 Davison was able to commission George Walton to design him a house, the White House on the banks of the Thames at Shiplake, Oxfordshire, and the chair design re-appeared in the dining room. This is one of the chairs from that house.",
