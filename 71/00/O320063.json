The body is cut in three flared pieces, one back and two sides. The back has a small half-belt piped in red and fastened with a small smooth brass button.  The sides are split to above knee height for ease of movement. The front is single breasted and tabs fasten over small smooth brass buttons. The tabs are decorated with navy braid and 5 smaller brass buttons in a quarter rosette motif. The top is secured by 3 sturdy hooks and eyes. A cape collar with falling and pointed fronts is surmounted by a smaller collar, and the front edges and edges of the collars and cuffs are piped with red face cloth. The top collar and wide cuffs are decorated with an inlay of bold scrollwork in red secured by dark navy braid.\n\nThe lining is of weighted satin. It has perished to reveal a woven interlining of black and brown wool as well as tailor's canvas at the neck edge and along the centre fronts.\n\nThe cape collar was lined with weighted dark blue taffeta which has almost vanished. The garment is machine stitched with hand finishing. It has two side pockets.",
