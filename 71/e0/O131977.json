Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\nStudy of a Nude Female Sleeping \nDYCE.37 Neg L899 \nCanvas, 24.1 x 31.7 cm (9\u00bd x 12\u00bd ins) \nDyce Bequest 1869 \n\nFarr dates the work to about 1845-9, and mentions possible retouching on the hands and feet. The pose is faintly reminiscent of the antique Belvedere Cleopatra, while the swelling thigh may be compared with those of the odalisques of Ingres, such as that in the museum collection (CAI 57). \n\nEXH: <i>The Artist at Work</i> Hampstead Arts Centre 1966 (34) \n\nLIT: <i>Farr</i> no 217\"",
