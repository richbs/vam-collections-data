The earliest sockets were polygonal in cross-section; by the 15th century they were round. At first, two vertical apertures were cut into the socket to facilitate the extraction of the burnt-out stub. These gradually became smaller and by the 15th century they tended to be horizontally cut. \n\nThis example retains the base typical of the simple European pricket candlestick, where the shaft is supported on three legs. With the introduction of Near Eastern candlesticks into Venice via trade in the 14th century, high bell-shaped bases began to appear.",
