As she describes it: 'The pop singer Michael Jackson's trial has been the biggest showbiz trial since that of O.J. Simpson. After months of daily reports on the news and tedious court dramatisations, the trial ended dramatically last night with the jury exonerating Jackson of all charges. The cartoon was drawn in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and so includes that morning's front-page headlines.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
