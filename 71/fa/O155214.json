The borders are not quilted. Several layers of colour have been used in the cross-hatching of the white flower and the base of the red one.\nThere is a lobed medallion in the centre formed by an elaborate band with a red ground and pink, blue and light blue threads forming a pattern of diamonds. There is a pale rosette in the centre with a green stem forming an 8-pointed star with small pink and red pointed buds and 4 red and 4 blue flowers.  A pair of serrated leaves and a red trefoil flower emerge from the top of each flower.  At the top and bottom of the medallion there is a small tree and a pair of large birds - one looks away from the other. There are 6 small vases of flowers also from the edge of the medallion each with a pair of confronting birds. A quarter of the design is in each corner. The ground is quilted in a scale pattern. There is a large vase filled with lines of colour surrounded by small flowers in the middle of the upper and lower edges.  Two floral motifs are scattered on the ground, each facing the central horizontal axis - a blue pointed flower with a leafy stem curving over and to the left and a small daisy-like flower outlined in red.\nBacking: Pink ground with a half drop repeat of oval shaped boteh all bending to the left.  Many small green leaves at the base, pink and yellow and pink flowers, a large central white petalled flower with black veins, a purple flower to the right with smaller red and yellow flowers and a curving stem of red buds at the top.\nFringe: looped green silk from a woven heading.",
