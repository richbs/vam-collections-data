Sumpter cloths were used to cover bales of goods moved by packhorses, in the case of wealthy property owners between their houses. The cloths were often richly embroidered or made of tapestry, sometimes with their owner's arms. When not in use on journeys they could be hung as decorative wall hangings.\n\nPlace\nThis tapestry may have come from Drayton House in Northamptonshire. Drayton had a set listed in an inventory drawn up under Sir John Germaine (died 1718), described as 'four pieces of tapestry gold colour'd hangings with boys and flowers', in a drawing room. \n\nDesign & Designing\nThe border design here is a simplified version of a wider border with coats of arms on a set of tapestries made for Ralph Montagu, later Earl of Montagu, between 1673 and 1684. During that period Montagu owned the premises of the Mortlake workshop, where those tapestries are likely to have been made. The design for the border would have been kept in the workshop, available to be copied for this sumpter cloth.",
