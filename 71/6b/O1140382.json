It is intended as a companion to the far-famed 'Canterbury Pilgrimage,' and exhibits an equal if not greater variety of action and force of character; the activity of the minstrels who, with instruments of music, lead the procession, the beauty of the maidens who strew the way with flowers, the modest elegance of the happy pair, whose twelve months' abstinence from hard words or dark looks have won the rustic prize, and the air of gladness and joy which reigns over all, will, we have no doubt, make the engraving, which will shortly be published, a favourite with the public.'\n<u>THE ATHEN\u00c6UM. Journal of English and Foreign Literature, Science, and the Fine Arts</u>. London. 7 July 1832. no.245. p. 443.\nThe relevant text, as follows:  \n\n'<i>Procession of the Flitch of Bacon</i>. Painted by T. Stothard, R.A. Engraved by James Watt.\n\nWe think, for beauty, variety, and simplicity, this fine national picture is superior even to the 'Canterbury Pilgrimage,' of the same painter. We never before saw so much loveliness and modesty engaged in any procession either on foot or on horseback. It is related by Dr. Plot, in his History of Staffordshire, that Sir Philip de Somerville held sundry manors of the Earl of Lancaster, on condition that he should \"find, maintain and sustain one bacon flake in his hall at Winchenovra, ready to be given to every woman a year and a day after their marriage, who might be enabled to declare, upon oath, that during all that period, they had neither repented of their contract nor desired change of partners, nor had quarrelled with their husbands.\" Another authority adds, that, on the flitch of bacon being claimed and obtained, \"the happy pair were taken upon men's shoulders in a chair kept for that purpose, and carried round the side of the priory, from the church to the house, with drums, minstrels, and other music, the gammon of bacon being borne high above them.\" The painter has given form and character to this curious custom; with true poetic feeling he has dismissed all that is common or vulgar; the scene is laid in those times when simplicity of manners prevailed; and the youthful pair who claim the flitch are not only of beauty, but of rank. In front of the procession are four minstrels or musicians cheering the march with music from four different kinds of instruments: behind them rides the (?)hind who bears the flitch, three maidens - worthy of becoming brides - follow, scattering all kinds of flowers before the happy couple, who, in their turn, are accompanied or followed by a score or so of their companions and friends: some young, bashful, and beautiful; others well acquainted, if we may judge by their looks, with the world and its ways, but all distinguished by individuality of character, and by an easy and graceful carriage. Those who desire to see ladies lovely, modest, and unaffected, and gentlemen of natural good-breeding and true spirit, all engaged in an adventure of mingled joy and seriousness, will see them far better in Mr. Watt's engraving than in our description.'\n<u>THE ATHEN\u00c6UM. Journal of English and Foreign Literature, Science, and the Fine Arts</u>. London. 6 October 1832. no.258. p. 655.\nAn advert for prints of the final painting 'Procession of the Flitch of Bacon'.\nExcerpt of text as follows: \n\n\u2018In the course of the present year will be published, inscribed to Samuel Rogers, Esq. a highly-finished Line Print, engraved on copper, by JAMES WATT; from an Original Design by THOMAS STOTHARD, Esq.

The purpose of the Trials is to award a flitch of bacon to married couples, who can swear on oath that in 'twelvemonth and a day', they have 'not wisht themselves unmarried again'.\n\nIt is claimed that the Trials date back to 1104 and the Augustinian Priory of Little Dunmow, when Lord of the Manor Reginald Fitzwalter and his wife dressed as humble folk and begged the blessing of the Prior, a year and a day after their marriage. The Prior rewarded their devotion with a flitch of bacon. Fitzwalter revealed his identity and gave the Priory his on the condition that a Flitch be awarded to any couple who could claim a similar devotion. The Trials are referred to in Chaucer's 14th century 'Canterbury Tales', within 'The Wife of Bath's Tale' and are mentioned in William Langland's 1362 book 'The Vision of Piers Plowman'.\n\nThe contemporary form of the Trails is that of a court presided over by a Judge; Counsels representing the claimants and the donors of the Flitch of Bacon; a Jury of 6 maidens and 6 bachelors; a Clerk of the Court and an Usher. It is not a competition between the couples, but each couple's claim is strongly defended by the Counsel on behalf of the donors of the bacon. Following the Trials the 'Procession of the Flitch of Bacon' takes place. Successful couples are carried shoulder-high by bearers (humble folk) in the ancient Flitch Chair to the Market Place, where they take the oath (similar to pre-Reformation marriage vows) kneeling on pointed stones.",
