The canopy is surmounted by a pointed element resembling a temple spire. The lower right arm of the figure holds a flask; the lower left hand holds a curved object (possibly an elephant goad or fly whisk), whilst the upper arms are shown above the head holding two sides of an arch on top of which are two elephants with their trunks extended, touching the top of the figure's crown and with a three-part scroll decoration in the centre. The figure is wearing a decorative necklace or breast plate and appears to be wearing large earrings. The elephant wears a harness, collar and head cover and holds a small cylindrical object in his trunk. The elephant and the arch stand on a base which is slightly raised at both the front and back, forming one point at the front and two at the back.",
