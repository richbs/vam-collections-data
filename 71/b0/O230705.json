            "public_access_description": "This waistcoat was worn by John Montefiore (1820-1895) when he married Julia Norman on 28 January 1845. Cream or white silk waistcoats were popular for weddings at this time and many survive in museum collections. The small scale floral pattern of this waistcoat, woven here in silver thread, reflects bridal fashions of the period.  A hand-written paper label sewn into this waistcoat records the bridegroom's name, and the wedding date. John Montefiore was born in Barbados. He moved to England to look after the British business interests of his father, the merchant and plantation owner John Castello Montefiore.",
