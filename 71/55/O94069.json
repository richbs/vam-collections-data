The image's grainy quality is due to the image structure of the original printed advert that Prince photographed. The vibrant colours of the image, the artificiality of the colouration of the woman's skin emphasise the sense of the artificiality of the advertising image.  Prince has cropped out the by-line or brand names out of his photographs of adverts, drawing attention to the image that had caught his eye on the pages of magazines and billboards. As Prince has said of the appeal of this subject , \"I started to thinkof the camera as a pair of electronic scissors.  The public images I would take didn't really need anything done to them...the photograph that I presented had to resemble , as much as possible, the photograph that had initially attracted me...Advertising images are presumptious, as if they have their own ego.  They're alien-looking, and at the same time so familiar they seem to have the possibility of being believed.  They look like they have no history to them - like they showed up all at once.\"",
