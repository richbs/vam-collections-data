Made in eight triangular segments, and when open has a flat conical outline with a slight peak at the ferrule end. There are eight ribs, which like the stretchers, are probably made of steel. They are hinged in the middle so that they can be folded to reduce the parasol to one third in length. The top notch is concealed with a green silk washer with a pinked edge, and the top spring is covered with a ruched green casing. A series of stays with a loop, made from matching green silk ribbon, is attached inside.\n\nThe stick consists of three tapering silver rods, arranged telescopically, so that they will collapse inside one another when the parasol is folded. They expand into a rounded handle. The ferrule end is silver and there is a silk covered ring which slips over it to hold the parasol closed. The rib tips are covered with green silk. According to the instructions, it can also be used as a fan.\n[Instructions] The parasol's function is described in the Instructions written in ink on paper.\n[Parasol case] Cylindrical box of red morocco leather on card with a slip-on cover at each end which is faced with navy blue morocco.\n[Parasol case] Cylindrical box of red morocco leather on card with a slip-on cover at each end which is faced with navy blue morocco.\n[Parasol case] Cylindrical box of red morocco leather on card with a slip-on cover at each end which is faced with navy blue morocco.",

The slender silver handle is made in five sections, each slightly smaller in diameter so that they slide inside each other when the parasol is not in use.  Hallmarks and inscriptions on the handle indicate the partnership behind the parasol\u2019s manufacture.  The handle was made by the London goldsmith George Creak and the rest of the parasol by Thomas Weeks.  Weeks sold his finished products in a commercial establishment known as \u2018Weeks\u2019s Royal Mechanical Museum\u2019 on Tichborne Street.   This rather official title appears to be a purely commercial establishment; there is no evidence of royal patronage and items were for sale, rather than collection. George Creek (or possibly George Collins \u2013 their maker\u2019s marks are similar) made other telescoping items for Weeks\u2019s \u2018museum\u2019, including a telescoping toasting fork.",
