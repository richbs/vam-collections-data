On the right St. Susanna, dressed in purple and green, holds a palm leaf in her right hand and a golden hilted sword, point downwards, in her left. A golden crown lies on her left near the sword. On a green mound which can be seen between the two saints lies a fasces partly hidden behind St. Susanna. Between the heads of the saints can be seen the golden rays of the sun shining through brown clouds and sky. Below there is an inscription in dark brown on opaque white glass. Around the whole panel runs a border truncated at the four corners where each of the triangular spaces thus left is filled by one figure of the date 1668 in dark brown pigment on white glass. The flesh tints of brownish pink enamel are painted partly on the back of the glass. The panel is painted in stipple technique and is composed of thirty six rectangular panes, some of which have been repaired with leading.",
