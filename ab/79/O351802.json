There is a small house and a gallows.\nInner border: blue and red ribbon-like zigzag on yellow ground. \nMiddle border: blossoms on red ground.\nOuter border: S-motifs linked by yellow motif on blue ground.\nBand top and bottom: reciprocal ram's horns in blue, red and yellow.\nWarp: white wool; Z2S; 14 threads/inch, 56 threads/10 cms; slightly depressed.\nWeft: white wool; 2 between each row of knots; 9 sets/inch, 36 sets/10 cms.\nPile: wool, 10 colours: red, light red, blue, yellow, dark green, light green, purple, black, white, pale blue.\nKnot: symmetrical tied around two threads; 63/sq. inch, 908/sq. dm. This carpet feels as if it ought to have more knots sq/inch than T.272-1994, but it doesn't. It has less knots across the carpet but more down the length and consequently more shoots of weft-and it is the weft which gives it the firmer feel.\nSide finish: two cords overcast in alternating blocks of red and blue.\nEnd finish: both ends have 2\" (5 cms) of plain weave with a reciprocal design of triangles in blue and red. Plaited and knotted fringe at both ends.",
