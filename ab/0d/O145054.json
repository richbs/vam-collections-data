There have been four different theatres built, with the current building constructed in 1812. \n\nThe third Drury Lane theatre was destroyed by fire in 1809, after just 15 years of performances. To finance the building, shares were sold to the public with certificates naming them as proprietors, and entitling the holder to benefits. The benefits ranged from free admission to profits from shows. This certificate shows an architectural plan of the theatre, and is ascribed to to James Mitchell, Esq.\n\nAfter the financial disaster that was Drury Lane's previous incarnation, under manager Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the new theatre was designed and managed to be a profit-making enterprise. There were concerns that the theatre was failing to show legitimate drama, as one of the only theatres in London licensed to do so. The need for revenue, however, led to Drury Lane becoming synonymous with spectacle and more light-hearted drama on a large scale. It has since housed large musical productions.",
