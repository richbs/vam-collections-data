On the sound bow (beneath a double moulding) is overlapping, downward-facing acnanthus. The bell has an iron clapper, possibly original. A foundry mark appears just above the sound bow on the interior: The inscri[ton has been cut into the metal, a difficult feat in light of the high tin content, and it may therefore be of later date.",

The inscription confirms that this was a household bell used for summoning servants. Radiography of this object shows an impenetrable mass behind the coat of arms, possibly the presence of solder which would indicate that they were separately cast and applied. The bell was therefore not commissioned, but would have been a stock item with a blank shield ready to be personalized. The arms have not yet been identified.",
