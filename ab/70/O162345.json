Jacob's widow continued to run the pottery and when marks were introduced on Delft pottery around 1680, she started to use her late husband's initials.

The classical style of this is in contrast with the added borders painted in enamel colours, which betray an oriental influence.\nThe mark \"IW\" in monogram on the bottom, stands for Jacob Wemmersz Hoppesteyn, who became involved with the pottery \"Het Oude Moriaenshooft\" in 1659 and was its sole proprietor from 1664 until his dead in 1671. Jacob's widow continued to run the pottery and when marks were introduced on Delft pottery around 1680, she started to use her late husband's initials. Only when their son Rochus took over in 1686, he started to use his own mark \"R(I)HS\".  \n\nThe shape of the jar, which would originally have had a lid, is based on an Oriental type. Two pots, both marked \"IW\" and decorated in a very similar way, are kept in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam and the Mus\u00e9es de Cinquantenaire, Brussels. The pot in Brussels still has its original lid.",
