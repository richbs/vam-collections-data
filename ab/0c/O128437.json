The tower rises above its low surrounding buildings and banks on to the river Thames. The detail and monumentality of the building is further captured in the large size of this photographic 'contact print' made by placing a glass negative directly onto photographic paper. \n\n\n\nPlaces\n\nThis is Henry VII Chapel and the Clock Tower, housing Big Ben. The Clock Tower is one of the Palace of Westminster's two great towers, the other being the Victoria Tower. Construction of the Palace of Westminster, which includes the Houses of Parliament, began in 1835 and continued for thirty years. This photograph was taken shortly after the building was completed. \n\n\n\nDesign & Designing\n\nThe 19th-century Palace of Westminster was built in 'Perpendicular Gothic' style to harmonise with the 16th-century Henry VII Chapel. The Perpendicular Gothic style of architecture features many vertical lines. The grand scale of this photograph is appropriate to depict part of the building which houses the government. The small figure in the bowler hat emphasises the scale of the building.",
