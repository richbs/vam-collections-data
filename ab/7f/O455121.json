They appear to include a chakra and noose.  His trunk curls upwards, slightly to his left.  There is a tiny rat beneath his right foot and a cobra wrapped around his belly.  A smaller consort sits on his left knee.  A \"stalk\" behind him may have been topped by a rearing cobra.  The lower part of the base may be missing.  Dark copper colour.",
