The framed relief is listed in the inventory of the Medici Palace taken after the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in 1492, and is described in more detail when it was in the Salviati Palace in 1581.  The frame has been considered to be possibly the 16th-century frame that housed the marble at that time, but more recent examination suggests that it is a 19th-century product, possibly created from reused wood.  Further details on its history will shortly be made available here..",
