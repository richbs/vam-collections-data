The deep frieze has a shaped iron escutcheon in the centre and is decorated at each angle with applied split balusters. Below the base moulding is a carved and shaped edging resting on three turned baluster legs connected by two stretchers of similar turning. In the centre of the long stretcher there was originally a pivot supporting a second flap, which is missing.\n\nThere is a carved apron on its front and angled sides, and 4 turned sections of baluster which are cut back and applied to the corners of the compartment. The back is jointed into the full-height back uprights (square section where they sit inside the top compartment) using a single tall tenon, and is nailed to the bottom using three old nails. The back is formed from one plank with a semi-circular mortice on its underside for the (missing) gate leg. There is a similar hole in the middle of the back stretcher. The lid is formed from two planks (one six-sided) which are grained side-to-side, with a nailed moulding on the underside along the front and sides. It is held on two hand-made iron hinges (apparently replacements) on the inside of the lid and the exterior of the back. Two bottom boards (the back board possibly elm, the front board shaped) appear to be nailed up at the front and sides, with the joint concealed by a nailed moulding and carved apron pieces.",
