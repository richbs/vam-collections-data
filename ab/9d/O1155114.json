She stands in front of a view across the rooftops of the city.\n\nA note on the back of the painting (written by the artist) describes the images as \"E.T. on leads at Burleigh Mansions. She called it walking on the Ramparts\".\n\nThe image was drawn by the writer Marguerite Steen who befriended Ellen Terry late in her life, having spent three years at part of the acting company managed by Terry's brother, Fred. Steen took up writing, partly on Ellen's advice, and later wrote a biography of the Terry Family entitled 'A Pride of Terrys'.",
