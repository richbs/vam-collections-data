Gall\u00e9 is best known for his skill as a glass-maker but from 1889 he was also a successful furniture designer.  He founded the School of Nancy, a group of designers who produced most of the best Art Nouveau glass and furniture in France from the 1880s until Gall\u00e9\u2019s death in 1904.  The table\u2019s foliate marquetry, in the form of a rambling clematis, and foliate openwork carving is typical of the Art Nouveau style and is a good example of the links between Art Nouveau and Rococo.\n\nThe table was shown at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1900 and was one of five items of furniture by Gall\u00e9 that was acquired by George Donaldson directly from the Exhibition and presented to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  He also purchased and presented work by other European designers in the hope that British designers, craftsmen and manufacturers could have access to the very best examples of the 'New Art' furniture being produced in Europe.",
