Each player must be provided with a square piece of card, with the initial of their name, to mark his or her position on the route.\nRULE II.  Each player will place their mark on the Southampton Docks, No. 0.\nRULE III.  To commence the play, let one of the company spin the tee-to-tum, and  should be Spin No. 1,  he moves from Southampton Docks to the Isle of Wight, but on the other hand, should his number exceed that, he cannot move.  Now let the next player spin, and if it be No. 1, he arrives at the Isle of Wight.  It will be now necessary that in his next turn  he should spin two; that added to the one brings him to the Needles.  If he turn three the next time, he arrives at the Bay of Biscay, No. 6; but should he at any time spin either above or below the number required to gain the next place, he cannot move, as, in this game, he must get a sufficient number so as to visit each place on the route; as, i f he arrived at Fort William, by spinning one he immediately arrives at Calcutta, and wins the Game.\nNB.  Should the Game be found too long, it may be shortened by observing the following:  SUPPLEMENTARY RULE\nWhen a player spins, and the number is above that required to reach the next place on the route, he may remove to the next number, but if below, he must remain in his present position, as directed in Rule III.\n\nThe booklet then has numbered and titled text blocks describing each of the ports of call from Southampton Docks to Calcutta.  With each text is the direction for the next move., the number of the throw needed to gain the next destination.\n\nRules placement: booklet of 12 pages, Printed by Francis Passmore, Printer, 45 Borough Road, Southwark (London)",
