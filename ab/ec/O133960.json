Pupil of the portraitist in crayons and engraver John Raphael Smith 1802-6; entered RA Schools 1807. Exhibited 13 landscapes and topographical views at the RA between 1807 and 1828 and 11 at the BI 1808-24, but principally watercolours - 417 at the OWS 1808-49. Also worked for engravers of topographical books. Married the sister of his friend William Hilton RA. Lived many years in Lincoln, where the Usher Art Gallery has a fine collection of his work. Many watercolours and drawings also in the V&A collections. Died London 30 June 1849; his studio sale was at Christie's 22-28 May 1850. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1849</i>, p260 (obit); W Armstrong <i>Memoir of Peter De Wint</i> 1888; H De Wint A Short Memoir ... privately printed c1900, reprinted in <i>Smith</i>; H Smith <i>Peter De Wint</i> 1982 (and for fuller bibliography)\n\n<b>Greenwich Park</b> \nP57-1921 Neg 38437 \nMillboard, 42.9 x 57.6 cm (16 7/8 x 22 11/16 ins) \nBequeathed by Miss Harriet Helen Tatlock (the artist's granddaughter) 1921 \n\nThe view, from the hill down to Greenwich Hospital and across the Thames to St Paul's in the distance, is similar to that in De Wint's drawing engraved by W B Cooke for his 'Thames Scenery' (impr in the V&A collections E4113-1905, published 1 June 1822, and stated to be from a drawing in the posses ion of the Duke of Argyll). The trees in the foreground are differently composed. The artist exhibited a watercolour of Greenwich at the OWS in 1818 (349, titled 'Greenwich - (for Cooke's work of 'Thames Scenery')'; it was described by the critic of the <i>Examiner</i> (1818, p285): 'The most energetically touched and naturally greyish green trees have a sprightly effect given to them by the different coloured dresses of the ambulating company, and by the bright masses of light'. \n\nOn the reverse is a study of a brace of grouse. \n\nEXH: <i>The Artist at Work</i> Hampstead Arts Centre 1966 (37), where it is dated c1835 \n\nLIT: <i>Connoisseur</i> March 1928, repr facing p168\"",
