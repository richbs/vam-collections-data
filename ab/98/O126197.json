It bears traces of having been a sketch-book page, with the hinge marks on the left, and the width suggests that it came from the same book as No. 383 [314-1888], which was drawn on the same visit to Worcester. \n\nNote on Nos. 378-381, 383 and 384 [272-1888, 260-1888, 312-1888, 615-1888, 314-1888, 836-1888]\n\nNos. 380 [312-1888], 381 [615-1888] and 383 [314-1888] come from the same sketch-book of which the leaves measure 221 x 285 mm. (8 \u00be x 11 1/8 ins.), which was used by the artist on his summer visit to George Constable at Arundel concurrently with the intact sketch-book No. 382 [316-1888], and again when he went to Worcester to lecture in October. For the reasons given in the entries on those drawings, Nos. 378 [272-1888], 379 [260-1888] and 384 [836-1888] are probably from the same book. Holmes, p. 252, notes in the Sir J. C. Robinson sale of 21 April 1902 a drawing 'Landscape with Cottages' dated 15 July 1835 and measuring 8 \u00be x 11 ins. This was made during the visit to Arundel and may have been from the same sketch-book.\u201d",
