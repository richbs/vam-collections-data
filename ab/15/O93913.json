It was then catalogued incorrectly as a portrait of the Marachal de Saxe. The earlier history if unknown but the bust may be identical to one sold at Galerie Georges Petit, paris in 1886, Lot 41 in <u>Catalogue des Objects d'art....provenant du ch\u00e2teau historique de Langeais</u>. The ch\u00e2teau de Langeais had belonged to the ducs de Luynes from 1766. Abandoned at the Revolution it was bought in 1833 by a M. baron. After 1886 it was refurnished by its last owner M. Jacques Siegfried, who gave it in 1904 to the Institute de France. Therefore the 1886 sale must have been of the effects in the ch\u00e2teau during the ownership of M. Baron.",
