The vase from was coil-built in several stages with adjustments being made on a potters wheel. The snake was hand-modelled as a solid form using a full-scale drawing as a template. It was left to partially harden for two days. It was then cut into sections corresponding to the parts due to protrude from the body of the vase. These were temporarily applied to the surface of the vase so that their positions could be marked. After further drying, the inside of each section of the snake was scooped away to leave a wall thickness of approximately 3mm but slightly thicker at the ends, which would be luted to the surface of the vase. The tail, like the tongue, is solid. Its position was fixed once the vase had dried to a sufficient hardness for it to be laid on its side. Bisque firing was carried out at 800 degrees centigrade for ten hours. The surface of the vase was polished before and after bisque firing. Wax resist was applied so as to create the scales on the body of the snake. Potterycrafts White B/O Glaze (P2850 - as checked on Potterycrafts website on 20/12/2013; B/O = Brush On), an opaque tin glaze with a good spreading quality, was applied all over using a flat brush (hake). Where glaze had adhered to the wax resist on the snake, it was removed with cotton buds. Red pigment mixed with the Potterycrafts White B/O Glaze was applied to the tongue. For the eyes, black pigment was applied under a clear glaze. The artist's signature was painted on over the tin glaze in cobalt blue. Firing was carried out at 1200 degrees centigrade for 11 hours. A third firing at 700 degrees centigrade for 5.5 hours was carried out to fuse on the gold detailing applied to the eyes.  ",

            "public_access_description": "Keiko Masumoto was the Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s Ceramics Resident from April to September 2013. The V&A\u2019s Residency programme provides on site studios for creative practitioners, access to collections for research and, through working closely with the public, the opportunity to interpret the collections to multiple and diverse audiences. Masumoto also demonstrated her approach to ceramics at the International Ceramics Festival, Aberystwyth, on 29 and 30 June 2013. \n\nAfter completing her MA in the Ceramics Department of Kyoto City University of Arts in 2007, Masumoto  established herself as one of the most inventive and prolific makers of her generation. She  taught at the Fumonsha ceramic studio in Kyoto (2007-2010) and Kobe Design University (2012-2013), and was Artist in Residence at the University of Arts, Philadelphia (2010). Masumoto has been the recipient of numerous prizes including the Grand Prix at Tokyo Wonder Wall (2009). In 2011 she presented a much acclaimed solo show at the Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art forming part of their Touch and Sense series, an annual exhibition for blind and partially sighted people.\n\nMasumoto works at the interface between form and surface decoration, colliding vessel shapes with three-dimensional renderings of two-dimensional imagery. The results are both humorous and subversive in their questioning of the boundaries between the utilitarian and the decorative, and in the freshness of their challenge to conventional notions about the purpose and meaning of ceramics and other genres of craft.\n\nMasumoto commented on the International Ceramics Festival, Aberystwyth and on her residency at the V&amp;A as follows:\n\n\u2018'This is the first time for me to present my working techniques at an international festival of this kind. As well as presenting my own work, it will be great to see all of the other internationally renowned artists working there too. What\u2019s really special about this festival is that visitors get to see work by highly regarded ceramicists close up, pieces we would otherwise only see as photographs in print or on the internet.\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve attended ceramics festivals in Japan and have really enjoyed taking part in these. The International Ceramics Festival in Aberystwyth presents a range of cultures and traditions in ceramic practice that I expect will have many similarities to, yet many differences from, Japan\u2019s ceramics culture \u2013 and I am especially fascinated by cultural exchange\u2019. \n\nDuring my residency at the V&A, I am researching the exchange of ideas and influences in design and ceramic craft between East Asia and Europe. The V&A\u2019s collections are really interesting for my research as they include extensive holdings of ceramics from all over the world. This makes them absolutely perfect for my interest in trade and exchange, especially that which occurred during Japan\u2019s Meiji period (1868-1912), when Japan became an active player on the international scene after several centuries of relative isolation.\n\nThe Ceramics Residency Studio at the V&A is very special for me as it forms an integral part of the gallery that explores the materials and techniques used in the making of ceramics at different times in history and in different parts of the world. Visitors can see my making processes and techniques and can also visit me during Open Studios to see my work close up, ask questions, engage in discussion, and have hands on experience of ceramics at different stages in the making process. I am very enthusiastic about working with the public and am inspired by seeing people laughing and enjoying themselves as they work with clay. \n",
