Paxton, London, ca.1905.\n\nSir Henry Irving was one of the leading actors of the late 19th century. He became manager of the Lyceum Theatre in 1878 and continued to run the theatre until his death in 1905. In 1895 he became the first actor to be knighted for services to the theatre.\n\nThe quote from which the song takes it title, as Alfred, Lord Tennyson's (1809-1892) play Becket. The events of the play focus on the historical figure of Thomas Becket (1118-1170) during his time as Archbishop of Canterbury, which ended with his murder. The success of Irving's production of this play led him to keep it in his repertory of plays, and it was the last role he performed before his death. His last words on stage were those of the dying Becket, saying \"Into thy hands, O Lord, into thy hands\". Later that evening Irving collapsed and died in the entrance hall of the Midland Hotel in Bradford.\nit was the last role he performed before his death.",
