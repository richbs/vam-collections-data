Clara Webster was the white hope of British dance in the 1840s, the only English dancer who, it was felt, could become a rival to the great foreign ballerinas.  It was not to be.  In 1844, during a performance of The Revolt of the Harem, Clara's flimsy ballet skirts caught against one of the open gas jets that were used to light the stage in the days before electricity. She died three days later from her burns. Although there were ways of fireproofing fabrics, many dancers refused to use them as they stiffened the skirts and destroyed the ethereal illusion.",

Clara Webster was the white hope of British dance in the 1840s, the only English dancer who, it was felt, could become a rival to the great foreign ballerinas.  It was not to be.  In 1844, during a performance of The Revolt of the Harem, Clara\u2019s flimsy ballet skirts caught against one of the open gas jets that were used to light the stage in the days before electricity. She died three days later from her burns. \nThis print was issued as a memorial.",
