No.52 2.13 1) before its transfer to the V&A. There is a very similar brooch from the same cemetery in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\n\nHistorical significance: Although found in Oxfordshire, it is highly likely that this brooch was made in Kent, as are other brooches of this type. The materials used to make this brooch testify to the international trade during the Anglo-Saxons period: the garnets probably came from Sri Lanka, and scientific research on other similar brooches has shown that the white shell is from Mediterranean species.",
