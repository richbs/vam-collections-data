            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis type of helmet is known as a close helmet because it completely enclosed the head. It was the standard form of 16th-century helmet in use in the field.\n\nPlaces\nThis helmet was made in the armoury workshops at Greenwich, London, around 1540.  These workshops were first established by Henry VIII (ruled 1509-1547)  in 1515 and continued to operate until about 1644.  They were initially staffed by armourers from Germany and the Low Countries and soon developed their own style and characteristics.\n\nMaterials & Making\nA feature of Greenwich-made helmets is the elegant profile of the visor (the face defence at the front of the helmet), which resembles the prow of a ship.  In form this helmet resembles one on the armour of Galiot de Genouilhac dated 1527 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.  The high comb (the ridge at the top), however, is a feature usually dating from the 1540s.  Another Greenwich helmet of similar form and date is in Croydon church, London.  Unusually for a Greenwich helmet of the 1540s, the bevor is made in one piece.  The bevor protected the face and chin and was usually made in two pieces.  The appearance of the surface indicates that it was heavily corroded. The gorget plates that protected the neck at the bottom of the helmet are missing.  Extensive over-cleaning and surface grinding have completely removed all traces of the original decoration.\n\nMaker\nThis helmet was made when Erasmus Kyrkenar (first recorded 1517, died 1567) was Master of the Greenwich workshops, a time when some of the finest Greenwich armours were produced.  It formed part of the collection of arms and armour assembled by Major Victor Farquharson, a well-known collector of the 1920s.",
