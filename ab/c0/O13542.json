Worn with a petticoat and bedgown, a waistcoat formed part of the informal ensemble of women\u2019s dress. It could be worn under a gown to provide extra warmth. This waistcoat is made of silk quilted in a diaper pattern. Bright yellow was a popular colour for women\u2019s dress from the 1740s to the 1770s. Quilting was a common type of needlework in the 18th century, as it was both decorative and practical. It can also be seen on petticoats and gowns. This waistcoat has a matching pair of pockets.",
