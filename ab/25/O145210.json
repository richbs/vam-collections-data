            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nBy the 1980s avant-garde artist jewellers had increased the scale of jewellery and pushed wearability to the limit. The wearer became more conscious of the jewellery interacting with the body. From this evolved the theme of sensual jewellery, which flows and moves with the body. \n\nCarlier Makigawa (Australia, born 1952), by contrast, made jewellery that is animated by the wearer, with container-like pendants. In her neckpiece the pendant hangs over the stomach, which in oriental philosophies is the source of energy. \n\nTypical of her work are wire constructions, containers or cages. In the earlier phase these contained found objects, later to be replaced by individually crafted symbolic forms. The inside and outside, volume and void, or contrast between the man-made and nature are some of the dualities she wishes to explore in her jewellery.",
