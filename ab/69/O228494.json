            "public_access_description": "Taxile Doat (1851-1939) was born at Albi (Tarn) and trained at the \u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Limoges and at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts, Paris, under the sculptor Augustin-Alexandre Dumont. From 1877 until 1905 he worked at the S\u00e8vres Porcelain Factory. In about 1892 he also set up a kiln at his own home, and in 1898 a wood-burning kiln for his own use at the factory. He experimented with highly specialised decorating and high-temperature firing techniques, (called grand feu) in stoneware and porcelain, sometimes even combining the two and was able to sell these privately.  Doat was a master, but also unusual in that he published a number of treatises on the techniques of grand feu firing and on the development of the ceramic arts, especially in France.  His prolific writings attracted the attention of the American potters Adelaide and Samuel Robineau and in 1909 they invited him to St Louis, Missouri where he helped set up the University City Pottery. He stayed there until 1914, returning then to his home in S\u00e8vres (Hauts-de-Seine).  He worked in porcelain, privately, until the end of his life.\n\nGrand Feu ceramics, especially porcelain, were regarded as the most exclusive type of all and were certainly the most difficult and therefore the most expensive to produce. The use of classical motifs served to increase even further their appeal to the richest collectors. P\u00e2te sur p\u00e2te was developed at S\u00e8vres in the 1850s.  Literally 'paste on paste' , it is a time-consuming technique of building up an image by layering liquid porcelain and was used extensively on delicately coloured celadon glazed wares. Its use spread to other factories including Mintons in England in 1870.  Typically decorating in the p\u00e2te sur p\u00e2te technique, Doat was the acknowledged master.  But, he also specialised particularly in crystalline and drip glazes on stoneware and, in contrast to his classical style, he made vases and lidded jars boldly modelled as asymmetric and knobbly gourd shapes. He exhibited a number of paperweights of this type at the celebrated international exhibition held in Paris in 1900, including this design which shows an appealing combination of neo-classicism and art nouveau styling.",
