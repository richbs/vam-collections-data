            "public_access_description": "The spread of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain in the early 19th century created a new middle class with money to spend on decorating their homes. Fine porcelain figures from the Meissen factory in Germany were popular but expensive and potteries in Staffordshire quickly found a market for their cheaper earthenware figures. In a period when literacy levels were low and news hard to come by outside the main towns and cities, the figures became a form of visual literacy depicting key personalities of the day from politics, royalty, sport, literature and entertainment.\n\nThis Staffordshire figure group represents \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 and \u2018Eva\u2019, two characters from the anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin by the American author Harriet Beecher Stowe,  which was first published in serial form in 1851. The novel focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering African American slave. Eva is a white girl whom he rescues from drowning then is employed by her family at their plantation. \n\nUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was the best-selling book of the 19th century and has been credited as a driving force behind America\u2019s anti-slavery movement. However it also contributed to the negative stereotyping of black people, particularly in the character of Uncle Tom who passively accepts his fate.",
