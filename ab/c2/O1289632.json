While he was creating the production Massine was mentored by the ballet\u2019s designer Michel Larionov who was fascinated by Russian peasant traditions and folk-lore. The music was taken from Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov\u2019s opera Snegourochka (The Snow Maiden).  First performed at the London Coliseum 19 November 1918 when Leon Woizikowsky took the role of Bobyl.\n\nThe synopsis in the programme for the London Coliseum reads\n'The Midnight Sun belongs to Pagan, primitive Russia\nAt this time of year when in these Norther regions, the Sun rises soon after midnight, there are ceremonies and dances to hail the coming of Yarilo, the Sun-god of ancient times.\nThe whole village takes part in the ritual, which includes dances by buffoons, and by the \u2018Innocent\u2019 who assumes such prominence in Russian folk-lore.\nThe Midnight Sun is symbolised by a youth chosen from the village, who, at the end of the ritual, is lifted towards the dawn to propitiate the god and ensure the coming of the sun.'\n\nAllinson\u2019s drawing suggests the format an illustration for a booklet in Cyril Beaumont\u2019s series Impressions of the Russian Ballet but this was never produced.",
