Some examples used camels, monkeys or people as figures of fun, completely abandoning any relevance and entering the realms of novelty and sometimes of impracticability. This teapot borders on the whimsical and would certainly have provided a topic for conversation at teatime.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe complex shape added considerably to the difficulties of making and applying the pattern.  It was slip-cast in a convoluted mould but the material is earthenware (the cheapest to fire) and the decoration is transfer-printed.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis highly elaborate teapot shows an Indian scene, with an elephant, British and Indian people and hunting dogs.  Traditionally Chinese shapes and decoration were the most common for teawares, but here, in the Victorian days of Empire, India was favoured.",
