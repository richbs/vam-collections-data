Others, like this one, came in two parts which could slot together or come apart to be packed for travelling.\n\nOwnership & Use\nWigs were an essential part of a man's wardrobe for most of the 18th century.   A wealthy man might own five or six wigs in different styles, which could be restyled and set by the wigmaker or barber. The majority of men had their head shaved under the wig.\n\nTime\nAt the time this stand was made, the fashion for wigs was starting to decline.  Young men were beginning to 'wear their own hair'.  However, for older men and those in conservative occupations, such as lawyers, doctors and clergymen, wigs continued to be worn into the 19th century.",
