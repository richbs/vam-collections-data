Four smaller squares are arranged at roughly equal intervals on the cloth, two at the top and two at the bottom, on either side of a flowering tree which grows from a diamond-shaped compartment containing a windmill or stylised flowerhead. In the spaces between these designs are further motifs, human and animal, e.g., woman churning butter, a baby in a swinging cot, people riding camels and elephants, various quadruped, peacocks, etc. Around the edge of the cloth is a series of borders, embroidered and appliqu\u00e9, the longest and most conspicuous being of dark blue cotton with a repeating pattern of large stylised rosettes, each with a mirror inset in the centre. The cloth is edged with a series of coloured binding strips, and backed with coarse white and unbleached cotton.\n\nThe colours used in the embroidery and appliqu\u00e9 are: two reds, two blues, green, yellow orange and ecru or biscuit. The predominant colours are scarlet and indigo on a cream ground. The main embroidery stitches used are: interlaced stitch, double chain stitch, button-hole stitch, and outline stitch.",
