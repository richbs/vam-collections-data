The Foundling Hospital was established in London by Thomas Coram in 1739 to provide refuge for abandoned children. The subject matter is appropriate-depicting an allegorical figure of Charity carrying a child. Rysbrack was one of a number of artists with close connections with the charity and was elected a Governor and Guardian of the hospital in 1745.\n\nThe Foundling Hospital still exists and was renamed the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children in 1954.\n\nRysbrack (1694-1770) was born in Antwerp, and trained in the Netherlands, but spent his working life in Britain. He was one of the most important sculptors active in this country in the first half of the 18th century, and specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments. Although he never visited Italy, many of his works are clearly indebted to classical archetypes. His terracotta models are particularly fine, and are often virtually finished pieces in their own right.",
