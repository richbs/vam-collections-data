            "physical_description": "<b>W.25B/1-1954 (stool)</b> \n\nThe frame is made of walnut.  All four rails are tenonned into the legs and built up with ears consisting of blocks and shaped facings.  The original blocks were carved in with the facings (?they are all original?).  Triangular corner blocks, themselves with the corner cut out to accommodate the inside corner of each leg, re-enforce the frame.  These corner blocks seem to be made of walnut and are nailed on (?are they original or later?).  The rebates for the seat were cut out from the rails with a plane before the rails were joined to the legs; the rebate at the top of the legs is chiselled out.  \n\nA veneer in burr walnut is applied to the sides of the rails with a convex veneer on top.  Cut-out fretwork is applied over the veneer, including beadings at the top and bottom.  \n\nCramp marks are evident on the inside of all four rails \u2013 these most likely originate from securing the veneer and/or fretwork.  Unexplained nail holes are visible on the underside of the rails.  Plane marks are evident on the top face of the rails where the rebates are formed.  A 'II' is chiselled onto the frame of the stool using a short blunt chisel (the chisel used is different to that used to make the same numbering on the underside of the frames of the drop-in seat but is the same as the one used to apply 'I' to W.25A/1-1954).\n\n<b>W.25B/2-1954 (drop-in seat)</b> \n\n<b>Frame</b> \n[For the comments below, the front rail is taken to be beneath the shepherdess\u2019 skirt!]\n\nThe rails are oak.  The side rails are tenoned to the front and back rails. On the front ends of the right and middle strips of webbing rusty nail holes are visible, denoting where it was previously fixed (when the seat was \u2018re-done\u2019 the original webbing was kept and re-used).  The front end of the left strip of webbing has surplus material turned over (why is this different to the other two?).\nOn the face of it this oak frame looks like a replacement, which might account for the refixing of the webbing and base cloth. However, it is oxidized on the underside, where it has been exposed, and not where it is in contact with the main frame of the stool, so certainly has some age.\n\nThe embroidery canvas at the back and left rails is sewn onto another canvas lining tacked onto the underside of the frame quite near the outside edge.  The embroidery canvas at the other two rails (front and right) is glued to a cotton tape that has also been tacked to the underside of the rails slightly further in.\n\nThe front rail is marked with II, struck with a chisel near the right of the rail on the back face.\n\n<b>Foundation</b> \nPlain weave, probably linen, webbing with three thin white stripes (perhaps more complex?).  Three strips of webbing run from front to back and are interwoven with two strips that run from side to side.\n\nThe base cloth is either made of linen or hemp and is a 2/1 broken twill construction.\n\n<b>Covering fabric</b> \nComprise cross-stitch ground and flowers.  The figure is in tent stitch, some of which appears finer than others.",
