Amongst the textiles listed in the inventory taken on Henry VIII's death in 1547 were 15 dozen  'handkerchers garnished with golde and siluer and gold [sic] of all sortes'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe embroidery on the handkerchief is worked in double running stitch. This is a double-sided stitch, creating identical patterns on the front and back of the ground fabric. For this reason it was considered suitable for clothing and accessories that might be seen from both sides, like collars and cuffs that were turned back, or handkerchiefs. The metal lace and tassels add to the showy effect of the embroidery. Their weight would have made the handkerchief drape gracefully.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe decoration of this handkerchief was chosen to complement the imported Italian silks with small repeating motifs that were used for both men's and women's dress. The freedom an embroiderer has to introduce variety among motifs has been suppressed in this case in favour of perfect regularity, as if the design were created on the loom.",
