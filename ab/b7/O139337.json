It has short sleeves formed of gathered chiffon and raised wire ruches of the trimming. Bows are applied to the centre front and back and a waistband of ground material conceals the slightly pointed lower bodice border. It has a made bow at the centre back.\n\nIt is boned, lined with matching silk, and has laces at the centre back to fasten. The upper part of the bodice hooks across to conceal the fastening.\n[Skirt] The skirt of matching moir\u00e9 silk is fitted to the hips in front and the double inverted pleats at the centre back flow into the slight train. A design of linked and applied bows heads a graduated, flaring frill which turns from the centre front at hip level to the sides of the train. The skirt splits in the centre front to reveal a triangular panel of white satin.\n\nIt fastens at the centre back with hooks, eyes and patent dress fasteners. It is lined with matching yellow silk with a pinked, scalloped frill to face the train border. There are white silk ribbons to adjust the train's fullness and two tape loops at the waist for hanging. It has a parchment label with a number stitched inside the centre back waist.",
