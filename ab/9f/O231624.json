Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis drawing in ink is for an advertisement for a car instruction book. The illustration shows a car instruction book held in a left hand in the centre of the composition. Depth is created through hatched lines in black against white and lines being scraped into the black ink to reveal the white of the board underneath. There is a feeling of movement in the pages being turned by the thumb of the hand. The curving form of the pages in the top right corner contrasts with two straight lines that project from the pages to the bottom left corner, simulating the headlights of a car.",
