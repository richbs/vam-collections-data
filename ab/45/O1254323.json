            "public_access_description": "James Duffield Harding (1797-1863) was one of the most popular and influential drawing masters of the 19th century. John Ruskin admired his work, describing him as 'after Turner, unquestionably the greatest master of foliage in Europe'.  Harding published a number of drawing manuals, including the Lithographic Drawing Book (1832), Elementary Art, or the Use of the Lead Pencil (1834) and Principles and Practice of Art (1845). Some of the drawings pasted into this album appear to relate to his best-known work, Lessons on Trees (1852). \n\nHarding's manuals are invaluable sources of information about mid-19th century amateur art practice. He probably assembled this album of 51 drawings and watercolours as a teaching aid for his students. As such it gives a fascinating insight into his practice, showing how he used drawings in the context of one-to-one tuition.",
