            "public_access_description": "Wilfrid R. Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland Advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis illustration in pen, ink and wash shows a car in front of a plane at an airport. The style of the figures suggests that this drawing is from the late 1940s. In the bottom right corner are placed pieces of luggage waiting to be loaded on to the plane. This suggests that the plane is for passengers. In the late 1940s passenger flights were developing as a mode of transport. Such planes would have been seen as having connotations with technology and speed as well as the luxury of flight that only a few people could still afford.",
