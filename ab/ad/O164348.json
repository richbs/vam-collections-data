In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England.  He also traveled widely making photographs on the continent. Jones work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.",
