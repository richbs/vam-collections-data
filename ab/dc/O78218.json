This drawing has a clear outline, which suggests that it was made when the creative thinking was over and the design was ready to be shown to the client. However, it is not  as finished as some of Rysbrack's other designs for monuments.  For example, he does not attempt to imitate marble in the thin, even layer of watercolour (known as wash) over the triangular section behind the figures. \n\nPeople\nThomas Foley was a Member of Parliament for Stafford for 18 years until he was raised to the peerage in 1712.  He was one of 12 Tory peers created at this date.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis design is not the same as the monument, itself, which is in St Michael's Church, Great Witley, Worcestershire.  In the actual monument, the figures of the mother and child are on the same level as the reclining Lord Foley. The central, standing figure in the top row of the design is replaced by an urn.  The engraver and diarist  George Vertue (1684-1756) praised  Rysbrack's monuments (and in doing so mentioned the one to Lord Foley), stating that they were  'standing Monuments to his Fame'.",
