            "physical_description": "The black cat is made from shaped blocks of wood, 3/8in thick (1cm), nailed and rivetted together.  The body is in two parts, separated at the head end by the neck and at the tail end by the tail.  The legs are on the outside of the body parts and at the front, the legs, body parts and neck are rivetted as one while at the back, the legs body parts and tail are rivetted together as one.  Small blocks are nailed to each foot and these swivel.  The head is a shaped panel mounted on a post and ball at the back which fit into a curved cut out at the top of the neck.  The ball is held in place by two metal hoops and a pin each side; this allows movement of the head.  The face is painted with a large cream nose, red mouth and nostrils, cream whiskers and red and cream inner ears.  The eyes are semi-circular additions painted turquoise blue with cream and black; there is a cream ring painted round each.  They may be of wood, however, they appear to be of wood pulp composition.\n\nThe book which accompanied this toy is a 32 page soft cover book illustrating a number of stories in cartoon style with the text in French.  It was copyrighted in 1931.  The cat figure is not a true likeness of the cartoon character but was bought in Paris to compliment the book.",
