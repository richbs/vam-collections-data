The armchair back is an open framework with an upcurving cresting rail, and with three vertical spindles between two lower horizontal rails (the upper of which is also upcurving); the seat is of canework within a wooden frame.  The legs are splayed for stability, with single stretchers at the front and back and paired stretchers at the sides.  A screw-eye has been inserted into the true left front leg just below the arm, possibly so that the child could be tied into the chair (there is no indication of any fastening otherwise).  The foot rest consists of three rails between two more substantial bars, and has been permanently fixed into the legs, although there appears to have been the option of two positions for it, the other holes being plugged.",
