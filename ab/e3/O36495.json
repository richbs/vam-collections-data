            "physical_description": "The typewriter is made of mild pressed steel with the underside black. The flat base is printd in red and black on yellow to show 4 lines of red dots on each side of the centre (a total of 40) indicating the keys of a typewriter with each bearing a letter, number or function mark. At the back of the base is the carriage and paper patten with rubber rollers, guide bar and a turning knob in red at each end. The width is marked out from 0 to 70 with grid lines in gold paint. Along the bottom edge are `teeth' so the whole will move along one stop at a time. Attached to the centre of the base and protruding upwards is the typing mechanism. It consists of a block with two levers; the one in the front taps the letters and the one to the right side is the space bar. On the top is a disc, now very badly scarred, which had the letters and numbers marked around its edge. In the centre of the disc are the remains of its name possibly maker's name and copyright etc. The disc is moved by hand to show each letter or number in an arrow indicator at the very top edge. Under\nthe disc is a wheel with each of the letters and markings on it; this turns via a series of cogs to bring the letter or marking required into the correct position for printing it on the paper. As the front lever is pressed down to print it also moves the carriage along one space. \n\n*The toy still works well but the disc has been badly scarred and is now unreadable.",
