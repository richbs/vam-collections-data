During the 1970s and 80s Furlong developed a new concept in sculpture which used sound as its principal material. In 1973 he established Audio Arts, an organisation through which he recorded, edited and published artists' conversations, and produced sound works. The inscriptions on this drawing suggest snatches of overheard conversations.",
