A complex etiquette surrounded the taking of snuff, which was a preparation of tobacco for inhaling through the nostrils.\n\nThe lid and base of this snuff box is made from tortoiseshell inlaid with tiny gold pins, a technique called 'piqu\u00e9 point'. The red tone of the inlay on this box has been achieved by mixing the gold with copper. The piqu\u00e9 point forms a trellis and fish scale pattern and is arranged around scrolls made up from thin strips of inlaid gold ('piqu\u00e9 pos\u00e9'). At the front, a thumb-piece has been added to protect the lid against excess wear. Several other boxes of identical shape and similar ornament are known to have been made in Italy.",
