She then learnt how to cut patterns in order to produce her own clothes. She based the shape of the clothes on the textile print:\n\n'So my first ever collection was born. It mainly featured the Knitted Circle print. I had designed in a circle, now I cut in circles and at last the creative circle was complete. I made swirling, dramatic shapes with no concessions to the saleable, the acceptable or the ordinary. The true Rhodes style came into being.'\n\nThe Art of Zandra Rhodes, 1984.",
