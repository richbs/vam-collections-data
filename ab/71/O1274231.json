Harry Tate (1872-1940), born Ronald McDonald Hutchison, assumed his stage name from the company Henry Tate &amp; Sons, Sugar Refiners, for whom he worked before becoming a professional performer. He first appeared under it at the Oxford Music-Hall on 13 April 1895 when his early act consisted of sketches in which he mimicked music-hall stars of the day, using clip-on paper costumes to allow as many as forty-two changes in one act. He went on to develop various sketches based on middle-class leisure pursuits such as fishing, golfing and gardening which he performed with a small company.",
