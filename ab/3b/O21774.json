Around 1150, a new technique for decorating this celadon-glazed pottery was developed. Koryo Potters set coloured materials into the clay surface before the wares were glazed. After firing, the pattern inlaid in this way remained clearly visible beneath the transparent glaze. \n\nThe potter who made this bottle has combined inlay in white and black to give a pattern of small figures standing amongst vines and bunches of grapes. Decorating a vessel in this way could be difficult as the potter had to ensure that the inlay materials contracted at the same rate as the body of the vessel when the piece was fired. If the different materials shrunk at different rates, the inlay might crack or fall out.",
