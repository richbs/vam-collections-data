In 1547 he made a two-year study journey to Venice and Rome, from which he brought back numerous drawings and works of art. From the end of the 1550s Deschler lived in Vienna, where he was court sculptor  for Maximilian. \nDeschler had an enormous output of medal art: 115 pieces are ascribed to him, and also several stone models.\n\nThe depicted Neud\u00f6rfer was a famous and influential calligrapher in Nuremberg. In 1519 he issued a sample book for writing, which was the first of its kind north of the Alps. With that he established the fundamentals for the German 'Frakturschrift', which remained the predominant printwriting up to the 19th century.\nHe also collaborated with Albrecht D\u00fcrer and was highly respected with his contemporaries.",
