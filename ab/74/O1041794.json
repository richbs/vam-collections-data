The cart is being loaded, and the labourers are watched by an onlooker.\nThe measurements agree with those of Nos. 225 [839-1888] and 237 [792-1888], and the use of pencil and water-colour accords with that in Nos. 236 [797-1888] and 237 [792-1888].  In addition the drawing is mounted on a small sheet of old paper in the same fashion as Nos. 225 [839-1888], 236 [797-1888], 237 [792-1888], 244 [840-1888] and 245 [793-1888].  This sheet may therefore be dated c. 1821.  Holmes, p. 240, dates No. 243 [798-1888] c. 1806.\n\nNote on Nos. 225, 236, 237, 243, 244 and 245 [839-1888, 797-1888, 792-1888, 798-1888, 840-1888, 793-1888]\n\nNos. 225, 237, 243, 244 and 245 [see above] all appear to come from the same sketch-book, with leaves measuring about 84 x 113 mm., which, as the date on No. 225 [839-1888] shows, was used in 1821.  For the reasons given in the note on that drawing No. 236 [797-1888] may be on a trimmed leaf from the same book.  The mounting to which reference is made was probably done before the drawings entered the Museum, and may be duet to the artist of his family.",
