            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "The following is the full text of Nancy Pressly's catalogue entry on this drawing in <i>The Fuseli Circle in Rome</i>, no.88, pp.87-88: \u2018Despite the annotation on the verso on this sheet identifying the subject as Apollo endeavouring the raise the walls of Troy, the drawing most likely depicts Orpheus singing to the ancient Greeks. Orpheus was renowned for the beauty and magical power of his singing. He was also associated with teaching the arts of agriculture and husbandry; hence the farming implements in the foreground. The nude or simply attired figures in a rustic setting are intended to suggest a primitive stage of society. This is one of several drawings by Jefferys depicting a figure singing or speaking before an assembled crowd that look back to Mortimer\u2019s <i>Homer Repeating his Verses to the Greeks</i>. It is the most successful and poetic of this group and is one of Jefferys\u2019s most accomplished works. The features and expressions of the gracefully posed figures are generally stereotyped, which is a characteristic of Jefferys\u2019s art, although, as we shall see, his particular repertoire of facial types and gestures varies at different points of his career. The face of the bearded man in the foreground closely resembles that of St. Peter in Raphael\u2019s cartoon of <i>The Miraculous Draught of the Fishes</i>, while the female figures at the right find their counterparts in another Raphael cartoon, <i>The Healing of the Lame Man</i> (Victoria and Albert Museum). Raphael\u2019s six cartoons, which Jefferys presumably saw before he left England and could also have known through engravings, underlie many of his early Roman compositions. The Orpheus drawing and a replica of it, which is among the six large studies by Jefferys at the Royal Academy, display the rather unusual technique he devised to repeat his large works. Both are made up of several pieces of tracing paper which were pasted down and joined on a heavier sheet and then varnished over. These sheets were probably traced from preliminary studies like the pen and gray ink drawing for the right half of the composition in the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery or a full-scale study like the following work. The method allowed Jefferys to make corrections to his unusually large compositions, although the patched character of the sheet gives it an unfinished look.\u2019",
