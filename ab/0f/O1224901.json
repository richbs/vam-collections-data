There are 135 sterling silver strikes, each numbered and ribboned, 500 brass strikes and 1,000 base metal strikes. This medal is one of the latter. \nOn the obverse is Shakespeare, with an image of the new theatre to be built. Planning permission for 'The Theatre, Shoreditch' was granted in 2010 and the opening date of the building is scheduled for 2013. \nOn the reverse, Queen Elizabeth I is seen in profile, holding an image of The Theatre in her hand instead of the orb. This theatre, where the first perfomance of Romeo and Juliet took place, was dismantled in 1598 and moved to the London borough of Southwark, where it was known as the Globe Theatre.",
