The carving is all vigorous, rather than refined. The crudely finished back bears a paper label with the pen inscription 'William Godsalve' in an early 20th(?) century hand.\n\nConstruction\nThe front frame appears to consist of a mitred outer bolection moulding (back edge) with pierced carving, joined to a mitred top edge moulding of rolling leaf, fruit, maize and pomegranate(?). Pine backframe (10mm deep), the long sides lapped over the shorter top and bottom pieces, and nailed in place. It appears that this backframe was added to reinforce the front frame. (It is not clear how this would have been done, possibly by dismantling the front frame, and nailing the bolection moulding to the backframe, then concealing the fixings under the top edge.)",
