The first prints he designed were of actors for John Bell's edition of Shakespeare (1775-6), and soon he was offered consistent employment by the publisher Carington Bowles.He knew the theatrical world well, as he had a successful parallel career as an actor and singer and appeared at the Haymarket, Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells.",
