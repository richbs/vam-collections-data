Came to London 1820, worked as a miniature painter, and entered RA Schools 1823. Exhibited 122 works at the RA between 1826 and 1881, 25 at the BI 1828-45, and 34 at the SBA 1826-38. Painted portraits, views of church interiors in England and Italy, and large historical canvases (his 'Lady lane Grey', exhibited RA 1829, was nearly 14 feet square). Elected ARA 1835, RA 1840. Visited Italy 1841-2. Professor of Painting at the RA 1854-63, and Librarian 1864-81; also Art Examiner to Science and Art Department at South Kensington. He was the first Jew to be elected RA, and his career marks the beginning of the emergence of Jewish artists from the strictly enforced prohibitions against the practice of painting. Died London, unmarried, 11 June 1881. His studio sales were at Christie's 29-30 July and 2 August 1881. \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 18 June 1881, p821 (obit); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 25 June 1881, p621 (obit with engr portrait); <i>Art Journal</i> 1881, p223 (obit); ed A Brodie <i>The Reminiscences of Solomon Alex. Hart, RA</i> 1882; G Pycroft <i>Art in Devonshire</i>... 1883, pp55-8 \n\n<b>The Scala Santa at the Benedictine Monastery of Subiaco, Near Rome</b> \n61-1905 Neg GF705 \nCanvas, 90.8 x 62.1 cm (35\u00be x 24\u00bd ins) \nBequeathed by Mr L Van Oven 1905 \n\nProbably the painting exhibited at the RA in 1845 with the title 'A Portion of the Interior of the Church of San Benedetto, Subiaco, where St Benedict founded the order which bears his name'. The <i>Athenaeum</i> critic thought it had 'all the picturesque grace of the south, but hardly the true southern warmth of colouring'. \n\nThe monastery was founded by St Benedict in about 529; the present church is 14th century, and on two storeys, the lower in the form of an extensive stairway with several landings, decorated with wall frescoes. \n\nHart was in Italy 1841-2, sketching architecture and scenery; two watercolours in the studio sale (lots 130 and 131) depicted the monastery and were dated 22 and 27 April 1842 respectively. \n\nPROV: Presumably the artist's studio sale, Christie's 30 July 1881 (209, as 'A Staircase, with priests and other figures at prayer. Exhibited at the Royal Academy'), bought Permain \u00a37 \n\nEXH: ?RA 1845 (197)\"",
