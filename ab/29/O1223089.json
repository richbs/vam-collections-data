It was drawn by the artist Alick P.F. Ritchie (1868-1938) and was created for reproduction in a newspaper/magazine, possibly the Penny Illustrated Paper. This paper, priced 1d per issue, was published on a weekly basis between 12 October 1861 - 28 December 1907.  \n\nHerbert Campbell is most famous for the 22 years he spent starring in the annual Drury Lane pantomime, where, from 1889, he built up an extremely successful stage partnership with the renowned pantomime Dame, Dan Leno (1860-1904). Campbell also had a successful solo career in the music halls with an act founded upon his comic songs and exaggerated 'cockney' humour. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
