Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nOne of the most typical techniques in the south of Italy and Sicily was the use of mixed colours of gold.  The goldsmiths usually used red sheet gold with yellow gold filigree.  This technique was used for pendants and necklaces, as well as earrings, and is still in use today.  The chain in the centre of this earring, made from flat shapes of red gold, is typical of southern Italian earrings.\n\nThis earring was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
