He started a craze for knitted jumpers by wearing a Fair Isle sweater to play golf at St Andrews in Scotland.\n  \nThis sweater is hand-knitted in stocking stitch with fine two-ply wool.  The garment is knitted in the round, without seams, up to the armholes and the arms are grafted on.\n\nThe grey ground is decorated with a Fair Isle pattern in blue, yellow, red, green, brown and black. However, in traditional knitting of this kind, the knitters use no more than two colours in one row. They use a plain stitch for the ground and a purl stitch for the coloured wools. This gives the overall striped effect to the ribbing that is typical of Shetland and Fair Isle knitting.",
