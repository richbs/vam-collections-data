            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 209\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"MULREADY, William, RA (1786-1863) \n\nBorn Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, 1 April (not 30 as is sometimes recorded) 1786, son of a leather breeches maker and amateur draughtsman. Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \nThe Rattle \nFA156 Neg FH2054 \nStudy, panel 10.4  \u00d7 9.8 cm (4 ? \u00d7 3 ? ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nHeleniak (36, reproduced pl 172) dates this sketch to 1807. It is a study for the larger picture of the same title painted the following year, now in the Tate Gallery. A pencil study is in the V&A (6022). She also noted two oil studies now lost, also probably for the painting (her catalogue 27, 28). \n\nIt seems to be the first genre painting by the artist, perhaps inspired by the success of David Wilkie in this 17th-century Dutch style with 'The Village Politicians' in 1806 and 'The Blind Fiddler' in 1807. \n\nEXH: \tSociety of Arts 1848 (LXIII, 'Painted in 1807'); William Mulready South Kensington Museum, 1864 (114); William Mulready V&A 1986 (101) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
