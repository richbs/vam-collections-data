            "public_access_description": "This poster was issued by the Alliance of Free Democrats in the Summer of 1990 during the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism. The highly stylized image is a direct illustration of the text. The rallying slogan \u2018Clean past \u2013clean future\u2019 is repeated to form a road through the landscape and a virtual road above.  The slogan refers of the opposition activity of the Free Democrats prior to the period of democratic transition in Hungary.  The fact that the party had represented democratic ideals during the hard times of communist oppression is offered as proof of its credibility.   \n\nGy\u00f6rgy Kara designed the Free Democrats party logo consisting of three soaring birds in the national colours, seen here in the sky. He is also the designer of the poster. Kara, joined later by his colleague P\u00e9ter Nagy, created a well functioning and clearly identifiable system of printed materials for the party. They had to consider the poor financial environment and improvisations were often unavoidable.  The design was therefore kept extremely simple. \n\nAt the bottom we can see another logo \u2019de\u2019 standing for \u2019demokratikus ellenz\u00e9k\u2019 (democratic opposition). The particle \u2019de\u2019 also has its own meaning that can be roughly translated as \u2019yes, indeed\u2019, \u2019for all that,\u2019 \u2019you bet\u2019.",
