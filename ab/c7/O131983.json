He later studied in Paris (1830) and in Munich (1834), the most vibrant artistic centre in Germany. After travelling in Italy and Egypt, he settled in Rome where he specialised in landscape painting.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Frey's output. He particularly favoured anecdotic genre scenes set in the Roman countryside where he made frequent excursions. The composition is enlivened by the presence of Italian women, wearing traditional colourful dresses, and the bright sunlight of a summer day.  This painting was probably executed in Frey's studio after sketches made in plein-air and costume studies. This work is a good example of the na\u00efve imagery combining landscape and genre scenes that developed during the 19th century in Germanic Europe.",

Koch (1768-1839) and J.C. Reinhart (1761-1847) who took over the tradition of classical Italianate landscapes in the manner of Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain and Gaspard Dughet. \nThe present painting is therefore typical of the following generation of painters who included in their work neo-classical elements combined with a waned Romantic spirit, particularly visible in the taste for distant views. \nIt is possible that the present painting shows the Lake of Nemi, which Frey painted several times from different angles. There is a similar composition dated 1854 exhibited in the  Kunsthalle, Hamburg, in 1969 and another exhibited in Maltzahn Gallery, London, in 1974. \nThe Kunstmuseum in Basle has a collection of his paintings.",
