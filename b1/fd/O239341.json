Hector was the best warrior on the Trojan side, he knew that he was fated to die in the war, but as heir and eldest son of Priam, he was duty bound to defend Troy and he fought bravely against the Greeks in the Trojan War. He was eventually killed by Achilles who tied the warrior's body to a chariot and dragged the body around Troy before the eyes of the Trojans. Hector's funeral marks the conclusion of Homer's Iliad, as well as the beginning of the end for the Trojans. \n\nThis rare dish is amongst the earliest pieces of English tin-glazed pottery or delftware. It shows the strong influence of Chinese porcelain on the border decoration, while the central part recalls both Dutch and Italian maiolica.",
