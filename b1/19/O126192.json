Novr. 28. 1823.\n\n*Corrected in pen from <i>it</i>.\n**Corrected in pencil from <i>has</i>.\n\nConstable took this drawing as the basis of the large oil painting he exhibited at the Royal Academy (No. 9) in 1836, under the title \u2018Cenotaph to the memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds, erected in the grounds of Coleorton Hall, Leicestershire, by the late Sir George Beaumont, Bart.\u2019.  The verses by Wordsworth written for the monument are quoted in the Royal Academy catalogue, following the text transcribed above from the reverse of the drawing with only minor variations.  Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 342) gives a different text, with two more lines.\nThe exhibited oil painting is now in the National Gallery, No. 1272.  Full notes and references are given by Davies, pp. 27, 28.  Briefly, the first stone of the memorial to Reynolds, erected by Sir George Beaumont in the grounds of Coleorton, was laid on 30 October 1812.  The lines by Wordsworth were composed in November 1811 and first published in 1815.  Constable refers to the memorial in his letter of 2 November 1823 to Fisher \u201cIn the dark recesses of those gardens, and at the end of one of the walks, I saw an urn--&bust of Sir Joshua Reynolds--& under it some beautifull verses, by Wordsworth\u201d (Beckett, VI, p. 143).  Davies, p. 28, suggested that No. 259 may have been drawn in London, but Constable wrote to his wife on 26 November postponing his departure from Coleorton until Friday 28 November, the day this drawing was made.\nFor another instance of Sir George Beaumont\u2019s fondness for erecting altars in his grounds (a predilection mentioned by Allan Cunningham in his <i>Lives of the most eminent British Painters</i>, Bohn\u2019s edition, 1879, Vol. III, p. 9) see No. 260.  Other inscriptions for the grounds of Coleorton are printed in Wordsworth\u2019s <i>Collected Poems</i>.",
