            "physical_description": "The album page, painted in opaque watercolour on paper, shows a man with a grey beard seated crossed-legged on a carpet with a bolster behind him on grass with a row of flowering plants along the lower edge. A golden balustrade runs behind him with a row of flowers peeping above against a green background which rises to a  notional band of  blue sky which darkens towards the top edge with a wavy band of clouds.\n\nThe man is shown in profile facing left, his right arm raised from the elbow holding a red flower between  his forefinger and thumb. His other hand is held loosely in his lap. He is wearing an off-white turban decorated with fine banding in gold of a geometrical pattern set off with  a gold-set green gem and pendant pearl placed in the centre at the front -  the only piece of jewellery he is wearing.  He is dressed in a green <i>jama</i> edged in pale orange  along the margins of his sleeves, neckline and hem, with matching orange lappets under his right arm. He is wearing a narrow <i>patka</i> in gold with crimson floral scroll ornamentation tied at his waist.  He sits on a rhombus-shaped buff-coloured  floor cloth, decorated with roundels inset with quatrefoils and a running scrolled border shown in dotted lines. There is a small golden spittoon with a broad splayed rim positioned near the left hand edge of the front edge of the cloth. This cloth is shown laid upon a rectangular carpet which takes up the whole of the width of the painting and has a pink ground with an overall design of interlocking scrolling stems with three shades of pink rose-like flowers.  The carpet has a dark green border with golden scrolling interspersed with orange four-petalled blooms. The bolster behind is shown as a golden oval. The material cover is  decorated with a half-drop design of deep pink pom-pom blooms and tied at each side with a pair of golden tassels with pink tips.\n\nThe grass below is textured with fine horizontal  brush strokes in a slightly darker colour and the row of four clumps of flowering plants all have different flowers in pink, white tipped with pink, orange and yellow with orange frilled outlines, respectively as seen from the left\n\nThe painting is framed in a  narrow border of pinkish buff-coloured strips of applied paper ornamented in gold with a floral, foliated scroll outlined in gold with white and black outlines.  The outer blue outline  has been painted over the edges of the floral decorations of the main outer border, which clearly indicates that the main border was painted prior to the assembly and creation of the inner border of the album page.  The outer border has an ivory-coloured  ground and is ornamented with alternate red poppies and pink lilies outlined and detailed in gold.  The margins of the page have strips of  blue paper with a white inner outline applied to them and an additional  green piece of paper on the inner edge acting as a gutter for the album's binding.",
