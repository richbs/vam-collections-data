Many traditional costumes must have included ribbons like these, but they very rarely survive.  It is easy to forget that ribbons were as valuable as the silver hair pins for their original owners.  This headdress of lace and velvet cost \u00a31 12s when it was bought in 1867, while the hairpins were only 18 shillings each.  \n\nHair pins were the sign of a respectable married woman in Italy.  They were first worn at the wedding, and after that on feast days and special occasions.  Only the unmarried and prostitutes wore their hair loose.  \n\nThe whole set comes from the Romagna.  It was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
