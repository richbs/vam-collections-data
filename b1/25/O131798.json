Studied art with the landscape painter John Vincent Barber in Birmingham, and settled in London 1828. Exhibited 139 works at the RA between 1828 and 1870, 80 at the BI 1828-55, and 46 at the SBA 1829-38. Early landscapes were principally in Wales, Yorkshire and Cornwall, then Ireland (after a visit in 1837), and coastal scenes after 1848. An early member of the Etching Club, many of his works were engraved. Commissioned 1851 to paint an extensive series of views in north Wales. Elected ARA 1842, RA 1851. Admired particularly in the later 1840s and 1850s for his truth to nature and the charm of his compositions; later works were criticised for being too dark and brown in tone. Occasionally worked in collaboration with other artists such as Richard Ansdell and W P Frith. Died Bayswater, London, 28 December 1869; his studio sale was at Christie's 6-7 May 1870. The <i>Illustrated London News</i> obituarist wrote that his life and work were 'comparatively monotonous and devoid of incident'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp141-4, 1870, p53 (obit); <i>The Graphic</i> 8 January 1870, pp121-2 (obit with engr portrait); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 8 January 1870, p53 (obit with engr portrait); C Collins Baker 'Thomas Creswick RA and Mid-Victorian Landscape Painters' <i>Art Journal</i> 1908, pp104-7 \n\n<b>A Summer's Afternoon</b> \nFA62 \nCanvas, 101.6 x 127 cm (40 x 50 ins) \nSigned and dated 'THO CRESWICK 1844' \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1844, and acquired by John Sheepshanks before 1850. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> critic was 'glad to observe that Mr Creswick is returning to colour in his foliage; and it is to be hoped he will resume the winning freshness of tint which characterised his productions a few years ago'. The <i>Athenaeum</i> was more enthusiastic: 'The painter has been called our English Hobbema, and in right of his \"Summer's Afternoon\" (486) he well deserves the name ... It struck us, however, that this picture which, though of a chaste richness, is rather low in tone, suffers more than the generality of landscapes from its compeers'. In 1908, Collins Baker thought 'this striking example travelled for its inspiration back to the solemn tone and almost the classic sentiment of Wilson or Paul Sandby'; the clothes of the foreground figure and the arched bridge in the middle distance are also reminiscent of Richard Wilson. \n\nLike the 'Scene on the Tummel' (see FA61, p52), also exhibited in 1844, Creswick is painting a favourite theme, but in this case perhaps a generalised rather than an actual location. \n\nA smaller replica, said to have been painted in about 1869, was recorded in a London private collection in 1924. \n\nEXH: RA 1844 (486) \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 25 May 1844, p482; <i>Art Union</i> 1844, p161; <i>Collins Baker</i>, pl06\"",
