On the base is an eight-character mark in two vertical lines: \n\nXuantong gengxu year, made for the Hall of Appropriate Spring.\n\nYichun Tang (Hall of Appropriate Spring) was the studio name of Liu Shiheng (1875-1937), alias Juqing, native of Guichi, Anhui.  An unofficial history describes him as an ardent collector of antiques.  His most famous acquisitions were two pipa (a musical string instrument similar to a guitar) called the Great and Small Hulei (literally 'sudden thunder'), reputedly dating to the time of the Tang Emperor Wenzong (828-840).  To commemorate that congratulatory event he gave himself one more studio name: Shuang Hulei Ge (Chamber with the two Sudden Thunders), bringing his studio names to a total of 23.\n\nLiu himself had not held important posts in government.  The family fortune was made by his father Liu Ruifen (1827-1892) who was assistant to Li Hongzhang (1823-1901), one of the most influential ministers of the 19th century.  Liu Shiheng's financial position was apparently not affected by the political turmoil during the last few years of the Qing empire, for he had placed two orders for porcelain - one in 1909 and one in 1910.  Thus objects with the Yichun Tang mark have either the cyclical year jiyou or gengxu written on them.  Based on published material all Yichun Tang pieces are blue and white wares.  A dish and a bowl, both made in 1910 and both painted with three dragon roundels, make very interesting comparison because whilst the decoration and the mark on the bowl are slightly blurred, the dish is fired to a sharp blue and the painting is crisp.  This shows that pieces from the same order, thus presumably from the same firing, are not necessarily of uniform quality.\n\nQing dynasty, Xuantong period, 1910",
