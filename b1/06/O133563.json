Like his elder brother Stephen Kemble, Charles Kemble conducted his stage career in the shadow of his acclaimed brother John Philip Kemble, and his legendary sister Sarah Siddons. He made his debut at Drury Lane Theatre in 1794 as Malcolm to John Philip Kemble's Macbeth, but he was better suited to lighter roles than to tragic, and made his name with parts including Orlando, Young Absolute, Charles Surface, Benedick and Orlando. He married the actress Theresa De Camp in 1806 and managed Covent Garden Theatre between 1822 and 1832, during the difficult period when many performers were defecting to Drury Lane. His daughter Fanny Kemble's appearance with him in 1829 as Juliet was such a hit however, that he kept the theatre temporarily solvent.  With Fanny too he made lucrative North American acting tours from September 1832 until January 1834..\n\nCharles Kemble was appointed Examiner of Plays in 1836, a post he held until his death in November 1854.",
