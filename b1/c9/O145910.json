Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nManuel Vilhena studied at Sir John Cass School of Art, London (1988-9); Fachhochschule in Cologne (1991), and the Royal College of Art, London (1993-8). \n\nHe reverses the use of thread in his necklace. With its vibrant orange colour, rather than being secondary it becomes the main feature. The design appears complex, yet the idea is simple and makes for a visually effective piece of jewellery. \n\nVilhena likes to use any materials that he happens to come across and transform them into objects to be worn. At the same time these are works of art in their own right. In his work Vilhena often poses the question:  is it art or jewellery?",
