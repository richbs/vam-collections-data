This house also claims associations with The Tailor of Gloucester, 1902 &amp; 1903, for some interior compositions composed here and alongside Esthwaite Water for the backdrops for The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher, 1906. Potter would test out unpublished stories on her cousin's children during her stays to see their reactions.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
