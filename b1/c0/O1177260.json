            "public_access_description": "David Essex is a stage and film actor and has had a extensive number of UK hit singles, including two number ones. His career began in in 1971 when he garnered praise for his lead role in Godspell on the West End stage. His 19 Top 40 singles run began in 1973 with Rock On which sold over a million records internationally. Essex's British tours incited hysteria amongst his female audiences and he was a teen idol for more than a decade. His stage career continues to this day and he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1999.\n\nWith t-shirts becoming a staple fashion item for youth and rock 'n' rollers in the 1960s, promotional t-shirts and sweat shirts printed to advertise products also became common place. This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into the creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts/ sweat shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.",
