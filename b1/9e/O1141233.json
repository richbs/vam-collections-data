Short-lived and financially disastrous, the Apple boutique was envisioned as \"a beautiful place where you could buy beautiful things\". It opened 5 December 1967 at 94 Baker Street in London, and became an instant tourist attraction due to its outrageous design, including a huge psychedelic three-storey mural. The boutique and its stock were designed by The Fool, a Dutch design collective who created exuberantly dramatic garments that were widely illustrated in the contemporary media.\n\nThe clothes were extravagant and theatrical, using expensive custom-designed textiles such as those used in this dress. One design, of yellow stars against a blue ground, was widely used in The Fool's psychedelic murals and posters. The garments were almost all one-offs, with this dress being individually decorated with appliqu\u00e9d felt flowers and beading in addition to its unique mixture of textile patterns and prints.",
