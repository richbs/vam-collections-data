In this case Palmer has stood further back from the building, viewing it across a lane. This picture shows a particularly vigorous handling of gouache. \n \nPalmer\u2019s detailed studies of farm buildings at this time suggest that he might already have been thinking of  developing more agriculturally based scenes of rural life. A few years later, in  the early 1830s, he was to use such  themes for his most ambitious and  successful paintings, notably <i>The Shearers</i> (cat. 88) and <i>The Sleeping Shepherd</i> (cat. 89). Both these works are set at the entrances to barns.\n \nThe <i>Cart Shed</i>, like <i>Ivy Cottage</i> (cat. 43 recto), came from the collection of John Linnell. It is presumably one of the studies from nature that he made for Linnell at this time. This might explain why the design is, like that of <i>Ivy Cottage</i>, slightly more conventional than in the case of cats 40 and 41.'\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1937</u>, London: Board of Education, 1938.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'PALMER, Samuel (1805-1881).</B>\n\nLandscape with  barn, Shoreham, Kent. <I>On back</i> An ink sketch of a turreted castle.\n<i>Signed</i> Saml.
