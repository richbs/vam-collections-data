            "historical_context_note": "Original collection design brief:\nChlo\u00e9 Spring Summer 2005: \"The relaxed elegance of a self assured woman\"\n\nDresses and skirts fall away from the body and are held in check with tone on tone banding at the hem. Details from the 18th century are used on romantic, full silhouettes. In contrast to the volume of skirts and dresses, pants are narrow and tapered. Jackets are structured and clean or slightly oversized and masculine. They have a nonchalant look and are designed to fall off the shoulder.\n\nFabrics for this collection are light and fluid, including light silks and satins, cotton voiles, washed taffeta, cotton poplin and cotton silk ottoman. Added to these are traditional men's suiting and stripy seersuckers, raw silk, and light wool.\n\nDresses with sequins, lam\u00e9, diamante straps, pleating and metallic and wet look bugle beading, and \"badla\" embroidery with flat, metallic yarns woven in and out of tulle. Colors comprise a range of neutrals, whites, and nude mixed with black and contrasted with olive, blues and greens.\n\nChlo\u00e9's seasonal shoe is high, strappy and black in satin and snakeskin. Bags for day are large and made of washed leather closed with a padlock.",
