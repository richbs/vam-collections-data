London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Charles GINNER (1878-1952)\nCornwall\nSigned Charles Ginner\nWoodcut coloured by hand.\n18.8 X 13.8cm\nE.2667-1929\n\nCharles Ginner was chiefly a painter in oils and watercolours and his woodcuts, a significant number of which are hand-coloured, are not well-known.  This woodcut is the only print by Ginner at present in the V&amp;A's collection.  It belongs to that class of hand-coloured print in which the artist who made the print also coloured it.  The hand-colouring of prints has often been carried out by painters taking up printmaking rather than specialist printmakers.  For some of the artists experimenting in this field, such as Degas, printmaking was essentially a private process.  This print has obvious similarities with watercolours by Ginner, for example <i>Through a Cornish Window </i>(see P.8-1928), both in terms of the colours employed and the way that the painted areas are bounded by dark lines, printed in the woodcut, drawn in ink in the watercolour.\"",
