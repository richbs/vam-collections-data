He was a versatile and influential Baroque artist employed by the rulers of the southern Netherlands as their ambassador and became painter to the courts of Europe.

Instead, Rubens depicts the Child crowning the Saint with laurel to symbolize her purity and victory over the forces of evil. The three saints surrounding the enthroned Madonna were all martyred, tortured and killed for refusing to renounce their faith. Apollonia on the left holds the pincers used to pull her teeth while Margaret holds the leash of the dragon that swallowed her. Catherine kneels, contemplating the palm branch, the emblem of martyrs, while above her a cherub clutches the lightning bolts that destroyed the spiked wheels used to torture her.",

From 1600-08 he lived in Italy, entering the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, on whose behalf he visited Spain in 1603. He returned to Antwerp in 1608 and was appointed painter to the Brussels Court of the Archduke Albert in the following year. He was commissioned by Marie de M\u00e9dicis to execute a series of paintings for the Luxembourg and accordingly visited Paris in 1622 and 1625. His activities as a diplomat took him to Spain in 1628 and to London in 1629-30, when he was knighted by Charles I. Having returned to Antwerp in 1630, he carried out the paintings for the ceiling of the Whitehall Banqueting House in the succeeding year.

He later settled in London, and became a member of the stock exchange.  His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.\n\nHistorical significance: Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and diplomat. He was a versatile and influential Baroque artist employed by the rulers of the southern Netherlands as their ambassador and became painter to the courts of Europe. Rubens blended features of the Italian High Renaissance, with which he became acquainted during an extended visit to Italy, with northern realism and a love of landscape. He had a deep knowledge and understanding of Classical art and literature and successfully translated these into vivid images of flesh and blood. He returned to Antwerp from Italy in 1608 to good work prospects on the eve of the Twelve-year Truce with Spain (1609\u201321) and under the stimulating government of Archdukes Albert and Isabella. 524-1870 appears to be an 18th century reduced copy with slight alterations of an altarpiece painted by Rubens for the Church of the Augustinians in Mechelen (Malines), modern Belgium, in 1631 now in the Toledo Museum of Art (oil on canvas, 266 x 214 cm, inv. 1950.272). There is an engraving after the original by P. de Jode.

Netherlandish artists' new interest in naturalism transformed distant history into contemporary scenes of everyday life, situating classical and biblical scenes in Dutch settings with figures in contemporary costume and sometimes even including historicised portraits.",
