In grand houses, busts were often displayed in private libraries.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Augustus, Duke of Cumberland (1721-1745), was the second son of George II and younger brother to Frederick, Prince of Wales. At the time that this bust was made he was widely celebrated for having crushed the Jacobite uprising at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. In May 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), he had led the Allied forces (British, Dutch and Austrians) in an attempt to relieve Tournai (now in Belgium) from a French siege; it failed at the desperate battle of Fontenoy, five miles from Tournai. Coincidentally, Joseph Willems, Chelsea's principal modeller was working in Tournai at that date. The Duke's secretary, Sir Everard Fawkener, was one of the backers of the Chelsea porcelain factory.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Chelsea factory may have adapted the portrait from a cast lead bust by John Cheere, or from a commercially available plaster adaptation of Cheere's portrait.",
