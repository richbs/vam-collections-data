Black ground with an overall pattern of rows of large botehs all facing left with a outline of a floral border. Each boteh contains a pink and yellow flowering stem on a white ground. At the base of each boteh is a pink and white stem bearing a carnation fan in pink and green, all curving to the right. The ground between the botehs is packed with small floral motifs. The colours are sombre with some slight variations in effect. Along the top and bottom is a composite band formed by very narrow black, white, red and yellow bands on either side of a wider band of white on which is a small repeating pattern of three green leaves and a pink and green flower head. Along the lower edge is 1 cm without weft followed by a narrow band of undecorated light green weft. There is a narrow border down both sides - it has a white ground with a variety of flower heads each separated by a narrow bar, all in green, pink and yellow. Selvedge: 4 cotton cords. Warp: black silk, Z-twist. Weft: light green, white, deep yellow, pink, dark green, probably all Z-twist. The loom piece probably the correct length to be made into a garment.",
