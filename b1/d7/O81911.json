'Regal' was first created as a watercolour over an etched background. This was then scanned and printed digitally.  From this image photographic separations were made and then printed using both lithographic and screenprinting processes:  the background has been overprinted with a phosphorescent ink, which glows in the dark, using the screenprinting process; the 'watercolour' parts of the image are lithographic. This print was published by Counter Editions in 2000 in a portfolio of 14 works by contemporary artists.\n\nOfili is celebrated for invoking stereotypes of black people and culture, while simultaneously creating images which are  respectful, affectionate and sometimes deeply moving. This image was conceived as a companion piece to an earlier but similar female image 'Celestial' made in 1998.",
