Since clocks were so highly valued, they were often lavishly decorated. This one combines an unglazed white porcelain known as 'biscuit' with gilt bronze, elegant marquetry and a painted scene. \n\nPeople \nThe clock was made by the firm of Benjamin Vulliamy, clockmaker to George III. The King was passionately interested in clocks and there is one by Vulliamy, dated 1786 and very similar to this, at  Windsor Castle. The London firm of Thomas Brownley, who made the case, specialised in this work. The pedestal was probably painted by Thomas Bromley, a decorative painter. The biscuit figures are based on models that are likely to have been made by John Deare (1759-1798). He was a sculptor from Liverpool and the youngest Royal Academy gold medallist of his day. From 1785 until his death, Deare enjoyed a very successful career in Rome. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe figures looking at the clock are Venus and Cupid. On the pedestal is the Greek god Apollo, surrounded by the signs of the Zodiac. This scene derives from an engraved gemstone illustrated in Bernard de Montfaucon's Antiquity Explained, published in London between 1721 and 1722.",

The clocks and barometers sold by the firm of Vulliamy, with their classical sculptural  figures, competed in a luxury market in which French products led the field. The design of this stand, and that of the matching barometer nearby, reflect a move towards simplicity that marked Neo-classical design from the late 1780s onwards.",
