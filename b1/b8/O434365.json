Shyamal Dutta Roy lives and works in Calcutta. \n\nIn his work, Dutta Roy often focuses on the melancholy of urban Calcutta, its poorest residents, the broken walls, crumbling plaster, cobweb-filled rooms and empty houses.\nIn this watercolour, we see a woman, half-length, feeding a swarm of pigeons from her out-stretched hand. The woman has her eyes shut, wears a colourful sari and has several bangles on her armwrists. Beyond more birds circle in the air. A screen of large buildings blocks the view.",
