But it must have been favourably received, because he submitted designs for a competition to create windows for the House of Lords. These designs were for a large window depicting eight Norman kings. In 1844  they were exhibited at the Bazaar, St James\u2019s Street, London.\n\nThis window was formerly located in a house in Niton in the Isle of Wight.\n\nGwilt was one of several stained-glass artists in the first half of the 1800s who experimented with the use of coloured glass in their compositions, in a return to earlier traditions. In this window Gwilt combines coloured and stained glass in a setting of clear quarries (diamond-shaped panes as used in lattice windows). Heraldry had been a popular addition to windows since the Middle Ages. Here we see arms representing the patron saints of Scotland and Ireland, Andrew and Patrick. St George represents England.",
