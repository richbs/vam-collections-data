            "public_access_description": "Life-like figures of birds were a speciality of the Meissen porcelain factory in Saxony.  In 1731 the sculptor Johann Joachim K\u00e4ndler was employed to make models of real animals and birds in the menagerie of the Saxon King, Augustus the Strong, to decorate his pleasure palace, the Japanische Palais (Japanese Palace) in Dresden.  The extraordinary large models K\u00e4ndler and his assistant Kirchner created were the precursors of many smaller animal and bird sculptures modelled a few years later.  A wide range of naturalistically modelled birds are known, including doves, magpies, wagtails, kingfishers, bitterns, sparrow hawks, jays and many more.\n\nK\u00e4ndler's work records for 1733 and 1734 mention models of green woodpeckers.  This woodpecker appears to be the 1734 model which was slightly smaller and had the addition of insects and fruits, or as here, fungi on the tree-stump support.  Very small porcelain models (mostly under 10cm high) were intended as table decorations at court and are listed in the inventories of the court pantry (Hof-Conditorei). Life-size models such as this woodpecker were another category of courtly production, intended as room decorations which could be grouped on furniture or placed on brackets to create the delightful illusion of a real aviary in a royal residence or pleasure palace.",

The present models are of the 1734 type with a beetle, caterpillar and fruit added to the bases.'  (The two birds' measurements are given as 27.5cm.)\n'An example of the plainer and slightly larger 1733 model, bearing a Japanese Palace inventory number, was sold at Sotheby's London, 2nd June 2005, lot 28, where the note comments on the differences between the original figures ordered for the Japanese Palace and slightly smaller examples of the present type.'",

Monumental sculpture was also more or less abandoned in favour of smaller models that functioned as table decoration or interior decoration for courtiers and kings.  Meissen porcelain was still a royal prerogative and ministerial perk: it was a luxury item that was bestowed, not sold, except by the clever <i>marchands-merciers</i> in Paris or the manufactory itself....The larger birds and songbirds in the Baillie Collection belong to another category of courtly production.  Much closer in style and conception to the earlier Japanese Palace models, they were similarly imagined as natural specimens for room decoration or a perpetual aviary in a noble residence or royal pleasure palace....In the 1753 inventory of the Conditorei (pantry) of King Augustus III's porcelain-loving Prime Minister Br\u00fchl, 301 animals were listed by type in a chapter titled 'An unterschiedenen Thieren' (of different animals.) Yet 45 dogs and 22 cats warranted their own chapters, 'An Hunden' and 'An Katzen' and the hunting groups were likewise clustered under 'An Jagd-St\u00fccken' (of hunting pieces).  There were also 146 birds listed together according to type under the chapter 'An Feder Viehe' (of feathered wildlife.)...\nThe life-size models of birds in the Baillie Collection are types that have been particularly popular with American collectors yet the history of this production remains obscure.  Many are re-workings of the Japanese Palace models and King Augustus III himself gave permission for the manufacture and sale of these later editions.  Over fifty birds were inventoried in 1768 in the so-called Porcellain-Cabinet' in the Taschenberg Palace in Dresden, indicating the production was a local and royal taste.  There might have been more in Dresden had Frederick the Great not absconded with 230 birds in 1746 following his occupation of Meissen.  His booty included 92 parrots in three different sizes that might have been destined for France.  And surely he found the <i>Schneeball-vases</i> appealing because they too incorporated songbirds into their viburnum clusters. Clemens August, Prince Bishop of Cologne, had 91 birds in his<i> Indianisches Haus</i> before the sale of his possessions at auction in 1764.  How he came to own this impressive aviary, which included a pair of exotic doves as in the Baillie Collection, is unknown.'...",
