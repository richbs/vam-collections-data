In 1756 it was transferred to S\u00e8vres, the other side of Paris, and shortly after was bought by Louis XV. The support and protection of the king and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, enabled it to secure the best artists, sculptors, designers and chemists. S\u00e8vres porcelain soon became the most sought after in Europe.\nThe royal manufactory at S\u00e8vres specialised in luxury porcelains, many of which were destined for the French court. Each year it displayed its newest models in the king's apartments at Versailles. The factory was very responsive to changes in fashion and introduced many innovations in design and decoration. Its products were admired throughout Europe and its style was widely imitated. \nThe discovery of the clay, kaolin, in France in 1768 enabled the French porcelain factories to produce hard-paste porcelain, closer in its material properties to that made in Germany, Austria and China. Hard-paste porcelain was less expensive to produce and prompted the development of a new range of enamel colours and gilding techniques. Gilding had previously been applied to soft-paste porcelain in the form of layers of crushed gold leaf, which were painted on before firing. The new methods involved a much more economical, chemically 'precipated' gold powder. It could be applied in much thinner layers and was more durable.",
