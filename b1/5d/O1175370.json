His major achievement was the revival of all but four of Shakespeare's plays, taking as his source the original published texts, rather than the adapted versions which had subsequently come into use.  Phelps was a major influence on the next generation of British actors, especially Henry Irving (1838-1905) who was inspired to become an actor after seeing him perform.",
