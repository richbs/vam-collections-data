This poster is possibly a working proof with hand-coloured areas, perhaps used to guide the printers. Rosen had a studio partnership with another German poster artist, Lucian Bernhard, and this poster was produced in their studio. \n\nThis striking image is typical of Rosen's style, which employed bold lines to convey the message. In this poster, two men face away from each other, with a burning city landscape behind them. One man is wearing a suit and the other what appears to be manual labourer's clothes. It is likely that the theme is class division and the lack of social change: the words So wird's nie besser translate as 'this way it won't get better'.",
