The whole is lithographed to represent a cream and brown circus performing type decorated with grey; red and yellow. The back legs and tail support the horse and the mechanism is housed in the body. The front legs are separately attached and move when the whole is wound up. The key bar protrudes from the left body. When wound; the horse vibrates slightly and moves in a circle. There is a\nweight attached to the mechanism which controls the movement and it can be seen at the base of the body. \n*It is marked MADE IN ENGLAND and is thought to be an English copy of the German version (B150-1994). It is probably a pre-1940 example but may have been made up to 1950.",
