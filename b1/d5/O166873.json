In this instance, the maker has use a variation of applique known as  'broderie perse', whereby individual printed motifs, such as flowers or birds, are cut from fashionable chintzes and then stitched onto a larger piece of plain fabric.  The technique of broderie perse became particularly fashionable in middle class homes between 1775 and 1840. Women were keen to produce finely worked items that signalled their aspirations towards gentility, while also declaring their access to the latest printed cottons. Broderie perse displayed both to best effect. \n\nMany of the textiles seen here were printed in the first decades of the nineteenth century, at a time when the British cotton industry was rapidly expanding. The market was flooded with a new range of printed cottons for clothing and furnishings, which could also be used for the creation of light, bright coverings for the bedroom.   Many broderie perse coverlets of the period drew on printed fabrics produced in northern textile towns such as Manchester and Preston. The glazed cottons used here are reminiscent of (but not the same as) the Bannister Hall examples of T.382-1960.",

            "historical_context_note": "From the late eighteenth century the British cotton industry developed into one of the most successful in the world. Woven silks had been the dominant fabric used for quilts and coverlets in the eighteenth century. They retained their appeal with the aristocracy, but by the early years of the nineteenth century printed cottons became the preferred choice of furnishing for fashionable middle-class homes. It was important to use up-to-date patterns, and because they were expensive to buy, they had to be used to best advantage. Consequently Broderie Perse became a popular technique, as it showed the most fashionable details exactly as they had been printed.",
