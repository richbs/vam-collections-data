It reflects and Arts and Crafts influence as well as a concernfor integrating the interior elements in a rational form. Unlike Mackintosh's contemporary linearity, there are almost no curves in the forms of Wright's clipped boxy style. Greatly influenced by Japanese architecture and interior planning, by the early 1900s Wright's dining rooms had lost their walls and had become dining areas incorporated into larger open-plan living spaces. The chairs, with their tall slat backs arranged around the table form an enclosure in themselvesand the dining table becomes a room within a room.\n\nMarion Mahoney was one of Wright's principal drawing assistants between 1895 and 1909. This drawing shows her neat rendering style, clearly delineating natural decorative forms with architectonic elements, and includes Wright's distinctive stained glass panels with their arrow-shaft pattern.",
