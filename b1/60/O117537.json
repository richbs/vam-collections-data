It is based on a print published by Hodgson in 1826 which shows Liston as nine of his best-known characters.  Pottery figures of seven of the characters are known to exist.\n\nDespite a rather serious temperament, Liston achieved his greatest successes in farce, and particularly as Paul Pry, a role in which he was often depicted in paintings, drawings and figuines. Liston was the first comic actor to command a salary greater than a tragedian, earning the vast salary of sixty to a hundred pounds a week with Madam Vestris's company at the Olympic Theatre.  He retired in 1837 after a career of over thirty years.",
