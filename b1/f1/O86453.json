Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nRoss Parker was a lyricist and composer who wrote the songs I Shall Be Waiting (1939) and My Heart and Your Heart (1950). He wrote material for Jack Hylton's 1957 summer shows for television Summer's Here and was probably the musical director for the pantomime Cinderella which was also produced by Jack Hylton and opened at the Oxford New Theatre on 26 December 1950.",
