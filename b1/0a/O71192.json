As Monghyr was on the route between Calcutta and Delhi, local craftsmen found a ready market in the Europeans who stopped at the town for rest and refreshment. Some of them left detailed accounts of their purchases. This piece would have sat on a desk and would have been used for holding a pocket watch, pen, paper and inkwell.",

Monghyr was well-known during the British period for the manufacture of bric-a-brac to suit the European life-style. Fanny Parks noted in her journal for 29 November 1836: 'Arrived at Monghyr: the place looks very well from the river with its old Fort. On anchoring we were assailed by a number of people, all anxious to sell their goods - chairs, work-tables, boxes. . .' (Parks [1850] vol.II, p.69.)",
