Frank Brangwyn (1867-1956) provided a bridge between the simple elegance of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the more dynamic character of Art Nouveau. He became one of the most prominent of the British designers associated with Bing\u2019s Paris gallery, the forum of Art Nouveau. Bing held exhibitions at the Grafton Galleries in 1897 and 1899. On both occasions he used posters designed by Brangwyn.",
