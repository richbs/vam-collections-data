During this period, extravagant displays of lace were increasingly worn as a mark of wealth and status. The showiest effects were achieved with lace  at the throat and wrist, setting off the face and hands, but a fashionable man might even have matching lace borders trimming his boot hose, or stockings.\n\nMaterials & Making\nEnglish travellers often  purchased their lace abroad and brought it home. Lace for cravats was available either by length or by the piece, made to shape.  It was usually made up by a milliner. Sometimes, at a later stage, it was adapted into a newly fashionable style.\n\nTrading\nIn an attempt to protect the English lace industry, a royal proclamation was issued in 1662 forbidding the importation or selling of foreign lace. The royal family was exempt from this prohibition. It also seems to have been ignored by members of the court and other fashionable people, since  Venetian needle lace  continued to be freely sold and worn in London.",
