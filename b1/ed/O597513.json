These prints come from a set published in 1722 by Pieter van der Aa as illustrations to the <u>Thesaurus anituitatum et historiarum Italiae</u> by Johan Georg Graevius.\n\nHistorical significance: This print is one of a set of 103 published by Pieter van der Aa (1659-1733)  in 1722 after plates from Carlevarijs' volume <u> Le fabriche e vedute di Venezia disegnate poste in prospettiva et intagliate da Luca Carlevaris</u>. Published in 1703, this book consists of 104 views of Venice designed and engraved by Luca Carlevarijs. This was the first published volume of printed views of Venice. It was highly influential with many later view painters, including Canaletto, borrowing composition ideas from it for their own paintings. The work's influence can also be seen in the number of prints made after it following its publication at the beginning of the century. Van der Aa produced this set of prints in his native Leiden as illustrations to the <u>Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae</u>, written by the German classical scholar Johan Georg Graevius (1632-1703). Finished by Pieter Burmann  the Elder (1704-1725) and published after the death of Graevius, the <u>Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae</u> is one of the author's most important works.\n\nThis view looks across the canal to the campo and church of Santa Giustina, situated in the northern <i>quartiere</i> or area of Castello. Two bridges on either side of the composition frame the church whilst directing our eyes towards the structure. An Augustinian church, Santa Giustinia was founded in the seventh century. The Soranzo family commissioned Baldassare Longhena to rebuild the fa\u00e7ade in an ornamental gothic style. It is this fa\u00e7ade, completed between 1636 and 1640, which Carlevarijs presents here. On the right of the campo is the Palazzo Gardenigo. A gondola passes by the church in the foreground of the composition. The north of the Campo S. Giustina is at the crossing of two major waterways in Venice, the Rio. S. Giustina, which links the northern lagoon with the Bacino di San Marco; and the rio del Fontego, which links the Arsenale with the Grand Canal.",
