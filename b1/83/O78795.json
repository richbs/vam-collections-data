The embroidery of the early 17th century has given way to the lavish use of ribbons in the 1660s and 1670s.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe ribbons have been arranged and attached in deep loops and bows covering the gauntlet of the glove.  A wide ribbon of white silk, silver-gilt and silver has a gauze weave creating an open effect.  At the selvedges (the edges of the weave, which were finished in such a manner as to prevent fraying) silk threads create a picot edge (an edge formed of small loops of twisted threads). The narrow ribbons are of ivory and salmon-pink silk with silver strips.  Here, the selvedges have been cut to create a decorative frayed edge.\n\nTrading\nRibbon was originally woven on a narrow hand-loom, but  only one piece could be made at a time. New technology in the 17th century allowed one worker to operate up to 24 looms at once.  The increased availability of ribbons influenced fashion, particularly men's wear. Breeches, doublets (close-fitting body garments) and gloves were liberally festooned with great bunches of decorative ribbons.\n\nDisapproval\nMoralists condemned the extravagant use of ribbons in dress, especially by men. In 1661 the diarist John Evelyn commented on one young 'fashion victim' as having 'as much Ribbon on him as would have plundered six shops, and set up Twenty Country Pedlars; all his body was dres't like a May-pole'.",
