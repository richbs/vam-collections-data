Bamboo clothing is made from the finest branches of the tree, worn in summer next to the skin to keep the light cotton shirt of inner jacket from irritation the skin when moist from perspiration.Made like a large jacket with a centre front opening, it was constructed from tiny pieces of hollow bamboo sewn together in a diagonal pattern. The effect of this open-work construction was like that of a moderne string vest: it trapped the air, kept the wearer cool and dry in the hot weather and protected the outer clothing.",
