The King\u2019s Colour, carried by Lieutenant Matthew Latham, was attacked by several French hussars, one of whom seized the flag-staff, and aiming a stroke at Latham's head severed one side of his face and nose. He still struggled with the dragoon, and exclaimed, \u201cI will surrender it only with my life.\u201d A second sabre strike severed his left arm and hand in which he held the staff. Latham seized the staff with his right hand, threw away his sword, and continued to struggle with his opponents, being trampled and speared by the Polish lancers. His last effort was to tear the flag from the staff and thrust it partly into the breast of his jacket. \n\nThe press of his attackers impeded their efforts to kill him, and they were driven off by the 7th Fusiliers, and the 48th Regiment, who came up to support the Buffs. The colour was found under Latham who was left on the field, presumed dead. The flag was forwarded to the Buffs, with a statement of the manner of its recovery. Latham, however, although desperately wounded, was not dead. He had crawled on his remaining hand and knees towards the river of Albuera, and was found by some orderlies attempting to slake his thirst in the stream. His wounds were dressed, the stump of his arm amputated, and he ultimately recovered.\n\nThis is a copy of the 100 guinea gold medal struck for him and paid for by the officers of the Buffs.",
