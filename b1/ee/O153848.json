Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nThere is an added blue-black border and a separate small section added on the upper right.\nThe main field is a U-shaped cover in scarlet red wool forming [a] regular joined stepped cross-shapes because of [b] inset octagonal star motifs in dark blue edged with a narrow white border.\n[a] on the red ground a small blue rosette with white embroidered silk stems forming a large quatrefoil motif terminating in a serrated blue leaf  form with a brown centre at each of the four tips OR in every second row, an alternating internal lozenge composition marked with smaller blue leaf fans with brown bases held by white silk embroidered stems framing a small blue central rosette.\n[b] on a dark blue ground, a white silk embroidered circle with a small light or dark blue and brown leaf form in each of the eight star points framing a central and four smaller rosettes, all in red, with small green leaves.  However, in 3rd and 4th rows down from the top on the right - a different internal compositions in two and a partial blue star, of two overlaid quatrefoil embroidered shapes, all 8 points of which terminate in a light or dark blue/brown leaf, and enclosing the four small red rosettes, along side the central red rosette.  This oddity suggests that the octagonal star shapes were embroidered prior to insertion. The complete U-shaped piece is bordered with a narrow blue-black felted border with two rows of white/black silk cord, Z plied with some light grey replacement band.\nThe separate section has a scarlet red ground.  It is folded to form a long, narrow triangle decorated with a single line of isolated botehs facing left, formed of a single flowering stem with very small light and dark blue, and occasional purple rosettes and black leaves, all held by white silk embroidered stems and tendrils.  Other details in light green and pale blue silk thread, S-plied.\nA 2 cm wide light brown cotton tape has been sewn onto the long edge of this separate section; brass hooks have been sewn onto it.\nAlso along the width of the U-shape a white cotton folded cotton band has been attached to support two long strips for hanging for display purposes.\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk: white, yellow, light blue [faded], black, orange\nInset wool:  red, dark blue/black, light blue, dark green, brown, yellow, white.",
