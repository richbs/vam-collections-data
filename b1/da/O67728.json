The concept of a vessel specifically for serving sauce came from the French Court, along with the fashion for sauces. The first sauce boats were double lipped with spouts at opposite ends, but the type with a spout at one end and a handle at the other became more common after 1730.\n\nPeople\nAlthough there is no identification of the maker on this sauce boat, it is illustrated in the pattern book published in 1825 by Samuel Roberts and George Cadman, where it is described as 'fluted antique'. Illustrated alongside is a similar \u00be-pint sauce boat in silver by William Sampel with London hallmarks for 1763-1764.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSamuel Roberts the Younger (1763-1848) was among the first manufacturers to apply silver wire to the edges of Sheffield plated articles, and he became very proficient at it. In 1824 he took out a patent which incorporated several improvements to his existing technique. Silver wire was soldered to the edge of the article so that the wire slightly overlapped; the protruding edge was then filed back so that it met with the main edge of the article itself. The two edges were then carefully burnished (polished) until the seam apparently disappeared. Roberts's objective, as stated in his patent specification, was to disguise the laminate so that he could imitate sterling silver wares, with the hope that 'it would be impossible, even for an expert, to discriminate between silver and plated articles when they were placed side by side'.",
