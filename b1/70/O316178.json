The padded quilting is worked over rolls of cotton wool which are drawn-cut or laid in loops to fit the pattern. The over-all effect is of a design built up from a series of short and sharply defined raised lines. The design consists of a large central panel surrounded by a border filled with upright flowers and plants, and each stands within a triangular frame formed by an angular scrollwork of stems decorated with tendrils and fruits. Both border and central panel are edged by two sets of parallel lines containing an open chain motif, and with a rosette at each corner.\n\nThe central panel is divided into three main areas: A broad strip across the bottom divided into three panels with the central one containing an exotic animal, the left panel with a hunter and centaur-like creature, and the right panel with a man and animal; The main area is taken up by an arcade of three rounded arches, each topped with a tall cone, two of them are surmounted by rosettes and the central one by a round medallion bearing a portrait head of a figure, and the central arch of the arcade contain a full length figure playing a bass viol, and two smaller arches with animals surmounted by birds with out-stretched wings; The top portion contain hunters and animals, and in the two top corners are eagles with wings out-stretched, and all the interspaces are filled with branching stems without leaves or flowers.",
