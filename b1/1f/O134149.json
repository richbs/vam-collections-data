Between 1843 and 1848 he sojourned in Rome where he befriended the Swiss artist L. Berthoud (1822-1892). He went to Lausanne prior settling definitively in Freibourg in 1862, where he taught at the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Michel. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Bonnet's town views he produced while staying in Rome between 1843 and 1848. It shows the Pantheon in Rome, seen from the right hand-side and a market scene in the foreground with small figures clustered around shops. The interest in everyday life activities and the broad sketchy technique enlivened by a warm earthen palette is typical of the Realist movement that emerged in France in the 1840s.",

He mainly produced landscapes, views of lakes and mountains. This work depicts the Pantheon in Rome, seen from the right hand side. In the foreground is a market scene with small figures clustered around shops. \nThis painting is part of a group recording the monuments of Rome, which Bonnet executed during his 5-year stay in the city between 1843 and 1848. Typical of Bonnet's manner is the broad and sketchy brushwork in a warm earthen palette. This technique is characteristic of the Realist movement emerged in the 1840s in France. \nThe town view or 'veduta' goes back to a long tradition particularly popular in Venice during the era of the Grand Tour of Europe, stimulated by the need of recording topographical settings. This painting was probably executed directly after the motif, which provides the picture with great dynamism. \nComparable works include <i>The Portico of Octavia</i>, Sotheby's paris, 25 Jun 2003, lot 85 and <i>Sunny Courtyard of an Italian Palazzo</i>, Dobiaschofsky Auktionen AG, Berne, 8 May 2010, lot 3229.",

This genre painting became particularly popular in Venice during the era of the Grand Tour of Europe, stimulated by the need of recording topographical settings. Painters who produced 'vedute' were known as 'vedutisti' and benefited from the technical support of the 'camera obscura', a box  with a small hole used as an optical device to improve the representation of the natural world, especially the perspective. Many of the vedutisti also produced 'capricci' i.e. compositions that combine imaginary and realistic architectural features in a picturesque setting. The genre declined during the early part of the next century and was gradually transformed by the Romanticism into a vehicle for emotional responses to the visible world. The 'veduta' was however eventually supplanted by the invention of photography in the 19th century.",
