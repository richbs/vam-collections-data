ISBN 1851773088.\nExtravagant in scale and luxurious in material, this remarkable tray uses the natural shape of the tortoiseshell to represent Mount Fuji rising to a peak. The elaborate decoration in gold lacquer and ivory that covers the inside of the shell depicts a scene of a bridge, pavilions, and figures below Mount Fuji, taken from the Tales of Ise in classical Japanese literature. Shown at the London international exhibition of 1872, this exotic tray is an impressive example of the lacquerwork that was being produced for the Western market. Although using traditional lacquer techniques, such works were often in a flamboyant style that reflected high Victorian, rather than Japanese, taste. A manifestation of this was the application of lacquer to a base material other than wood, such as tortoiseshell, which was predominantly manufactured at Nagasaki around the 1870s.\n\tThe tray was lent to the 1872 exhibition not by the manufacturer but by Sir Rutherford Alcock, who had been appointed British Minister to Japan in 1859. His many purchases in Japan had formed the nucleus of the Japanese section of the 1862 exhibition, which was the first large-scale display of Japanese arts and crafts in the West and played a vital role in bringing such works to a British audience. The 1872 exhibition was altogether a more modest affair, with only a handful of Japanese exhibits.\n\nLit. Faulkner and Jackson, 1995\n\nJULIA HUTT",
