The cockspur used for firing the piece is still attached. The centre has a shield enclosed in a green band, with manganese lines. From the shield radiate long double manganese strokes alternating with single lines springing from dotted circles, also in manganese. Large numbers of similar fragments have been found at Paterna, including others with the cockspur still attached, clearly wasters. The 'arms', though reminiscent of the pallets of Aragon, are purely decorative. Similar pieces are illustrated by Gonzalez Marti (1944, figs.198 and 200),  Ainaud (1952, fig.36) and Amigues and Mesquida (1985, pl.7 , no.39); and cf. Pascual and Marti, 1986, figs.91-2. Of considerable interest is the fact that this fragment and 92, found near Paterna, perhaps on the site of the Testar, entered the collections in 1904, three years before the 'discovery' of Paterna. The donor, Jose Ros, was the founder of the pottery La Ceramo (see p.296), where wares of Paterna types were made until very recently.",
