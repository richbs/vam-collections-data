At this time, blue and white porcelain still represented a substantial part of the export ware to Europe, and mass-produced tableware and household objects were shipped in bulk by state and private companies.\n\nThis tureen was part of a dinner service made for the European market; the shape imitates a western model, while the decoration was supposed to be a traditional Chinese design. In fact, the river landscape depicted on the cover is a stylised and much adapted version of a traditional landscape theme, a subject that was re-invented and integrated into the repertoire of western chinoiserie and often imitated again on Chinese porcelain made for export. The design was perceived by European clients as purely 'oriental' and 'exotic', although it was very distant from the domestic taste in China.",
