Lord Rochford's father had come from Holland to England with William III at the time of the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688, and was raised by King William to the English peerage in 1695. Lord Rochford's family arms are displayed on the shield in the pediment above the door. He may have commissioned this doorway to mark his succession to the earldom in 1710 (on his brother's death), or perhaps around 1715 when he was also renovating his country house, St Osyth Priory, Essex.\n\nThe doorway was re-painted soon after it came to the Museum in 1935, and this is probably the paint scheme that remains in place.",

A typed note on Stuart and Turner headed paper, enclosed with a letter from Turner dated 23 September 1935, gives further information:\n<u> CARVED CREST IN CARTOUCHE OVER DOORWARY. c. 1730</u> \n\"Crest: Out of a coronet composed of fleur-de-lys and strawberry leaves or, two single attire of a stag gules. Above the cartouche is shown an Earl's coronet. This is the crest and Coronet of the family of Nassau, Earls of Rochford, and the title being now extinct [<i>sic</i>]. Frederick, third Earl of Rochford, succeeded his brother William Henry, second Earl of Rochford 27 July 1710; he came to England the same year, where he resided for most part [<i>sic</i>] of the time until his death at his house in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, 14 June 1738 in his fifity-sixth year and was buried at Easton, Suffolk. He married Bessy, daughter of Richard Savage, Earl Rivers, by whom he left two sons. he was succeeded by his eldest son William Henry. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Earl of Rochford in 1830.\" \nIn Clifford Smith's original minute of 24 September 1735 he adds:\n\"I told him [Turner] that if accepted we would probably paint the doorway again. With this he quite agreed. The carved detail on it is very fine. The fanlight obviously dates from the latter part of the 18th: century.\"\n(Nominal File MA/1/T1501: Turner, Cecil F.)\n\nNotes from R.P. 35/4807\n\n24/9/35 Minute Sheet, H Clifford Smith\nreports on the offer of a pine doorway, c.1730, from Mr Turner (President of BADA and an architect who had studied at the Museum).
