            "public_access_description": "Julia Margaret Cameron's career as a photographer began in 1863 when her daughter gave her a camera. Cameron began photographing everyone in sight. Because of the newness of photography as a practice, she was free to make her own rules and not be bound to convention. The kinds of images being made at the time did not interest Cameron. She was interested in capturing another kind of photographic truth. Not one dependent on accuracy of sharp detail, but one that depicted the emotional state of her sitter.\n\nCameron liked the soft focus portraits and the streak marks on her negatives, choosing to work with these irregularities, making them part of her pictures.  Although at the time Cameron was seen as an unconventional and experimental photographer, her images have a solid place in the history of photography.\n\nMost of Cameron's photographs are portraits. She used members of her family as sitters and made photographs than concentrated on their faces. She was interested in conveying their natural beauty, often asking female sitters to let down their hair so as to show them in a way that they were not accustomed to presenting themselves. In addition to making stunning and evocative portraits both of male and female subjects, Cameron also staged tableaux and posed her sitters in situations that simulated allegorical paintings.\n\nSir John Herschel was a major astronomer who also found time to contribute pioneering improvements to the medium of photography (including the word 'photography'). He was a lifelong friend of Mrs Cameron. Her biographer, Helmut Gernsheim, has written that Herschel's was 'probably the most striking face she ever had before her lens, displaying the majesty and energy of genius, softened by age'. Before Cameron left England for Ceylon in 1875, she entrusted her negatives to the Autotype Company, who supplied and sold carbon prints of her images: these pigment prints are flat - if permanent - in tone.",
