            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nChristening robes tend to survive for sentimental reasons and are still handed down the family.  They were usually made of fine white cotton or linen and were often decorated with whitework embroidery.  Some, like this one, were overlaid with fine lace.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe birth of an infant was a very private event but its christening in church marked its first public appearance and was an occasion to be celebrated. From an early date the church decreed that a child should be baptised in a white garment to signify innocence and purity.  By the beginning of the 19th century this was a long, white or cream robe.  Often the one dress was used for all the children in the family. This christening robe was made specifically for Lieutenant Colonel H.P.L. Cart de Lafontaine for his christening in 1884.  There is, however, evidence that it was reused at a later date.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe shape of christening robes hardly changed from the beginning of the century to the 1890s.  They still resembled fashionable women's dresses of the early 1800s with their low neckline, short sleeves and skirts made of delicate materials. The baby always wore a close-fitting white cap to complement the dress.  It might also be carried in a christening cape, mantle or shawl to help keep it warm.\n\nHistorical Associations\nRoyal christenings were very elaborate affairs.  The Illustrated London News of 5 December 1874 describes the christening of a grandson of Queen Victoria:\n\n'The infant having been placed in the arms of the Queen and the Archbishop calling upon the sponsors to name the child, the Queen answered \"Alfred Alexander William Ernest Albert \" and his Grace baptised the child in those names.  The infant was attired in a mantle, gown and cap of Honiton lace - being the same dress in which all the Queen's children and those of the Prince and Princess of Wales were christened.'",
