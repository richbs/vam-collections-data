Born in Germany, his work in that decade was about form and material. Strongly influenced by the simplicity of Japanese design, particularly in ceramics, which influenced the design of this cup and its related pieces for the Breakfast Set for Babylon Design. Torsten wanted to retain the pared-down shape whilst keeping it practical, so that it could be held comfortably whilst containing hot liquid. His design for a double-walled cup and made in porcelain resolved this challenge with beauty and elegance.",
