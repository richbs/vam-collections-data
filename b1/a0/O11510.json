The decoration of rich red glaze with minimal foliate motifs suggesting Celtic or Japanese ancestry,  and in a restrained  'art' style, was chosen to appeal to the widest possible, yet fashion-conscious market. Moorcroft's ceramics were sold through the London company Liberty & Co., which was a byword for artistically conscious design. Flamminian Ware was introduced in 1905 and was made in blue, green and this rich red. While Liberty's were responsible for the choice of several Moorcroft pattern names, Flamminian was William Moorcroft's own choice.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Moorcroft (1872-1945)  trained at the Burslem School of Art and won a scholarship to the National Art Training School at South Kensington.  As a student he studied ancient and modern pottery and porcelain at the British and South Kensington Museums.  He joined James MacIntyre & Co. as a designer in 1897.  This gave him his first experience of raised slip decoration,a technique that became a lifelong speciality.  He opened his own pottery at  Cobridge in 1913.  Many of Moorcroft's designs became synonymous with Liberty & Co., and the close connection with Liberty's stood him in good stead commercially throughout his career. After his death, his son Walter took over the family business, continuing many of William's designs.",
