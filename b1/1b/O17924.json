They depict a durbar (public reception) at the Murshidabad court, and various Hindu and Muslim festivals and religious scenes. A Murshidabad artist copied it, probably from an original oil painting by George Farington. He had worked in Murshidabad from May 1785 until his death there in 1788. Farington's original is lost.  Bakr Id, which is depicted here, is a Muslim feast of sacrifice. Muslims celebrate it on the tenth day of the Zilhijj (April / May) in commemoration of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son Ishmael. At the moment of sacrifice, however, God substituted a ram for the youth.",

A less spacious version of this scene is in the India Office Library (M. Archer, [1979] pl.79). Mani Begum was a dancing-girl at Delhi who went to Murshidabad and became the wife of Nawab Mir Ja'far. She was for a short time appointed by Warren Hastings to be guardian of Mubarak ud-daula, before being pensioned off by the British. Her mosque was built in 1767.",
