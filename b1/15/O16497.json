But Fanny was pregnant, and by the time they reached Florence it was clear they would have to remain there for some time.  Although the birth was difficult, a son survived; Fanny however died of a fever at the end of 1866.  Hunt returned to London the following September, having designed his wife's tomb and painted the view of the Ponte Vecchio in the city where the couple had spent such a happy if brief time.  The bridge has a special significance in European literature, as it was where the great Dante had first seen his beloved Beatrice; she too died within a year, and it may be the reason for Hunt painting this uncharacteristic work.  It certainly has a deeply melancholic mood. Hunt must have also remembered Elizabeth Siddal, who died after a short marriage to Rossetti; having the first name of Dante, Rossetti compared himself to the Italian poet and saw Lizzie as his Beatrice, painting her several times in that role.\nCurrently in gilt fame.",

After they disbanded in the 1850s Hunt was the only member to continue to pursue the concept of 'truth to nature' that had been the central aim of the brotherhood. At the end of 1865 Hunt married Fanny Waugh, and they embarked on a tour. They went first to Egypt, but Fanny was already pregnant and by the time they reached Florence, Italy, on their return home it was clear that they would have to remain there for some time. Although the birth was a difficult one, a son survived. Fanny, however, died of fever at the end of 1866. Hunt returned to London the following September, having designed his wife's tomb and painted this view of the Ponte Vecchio, Florence - the city in which the couple had spent such a happy, if brief, time.",
