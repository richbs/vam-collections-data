After working with modulated line, in a series of drypoints, he went on to make a series of lithographs  with very precise rectangular structures. These were  followed by a series of wood- and lino- cuts in some of which he plays with curvilinear patterns, in others he uses very precise, straight-line geometric patterns. It was the latter which took precedence in his work and  by the late 1940s he had abandoned curvilinear form in his drawing, although in some images he was still using the grain of wood or impression of cork or linoleum to create an organic textural ground.  His geometric images of the 1940s characteristically  trick the eye into ambiguous readings of perspective.",
