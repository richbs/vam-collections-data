The tunic is cut straight across the front; over the shoulders, forming sloping sides to the neck, are appliqu\u00e9d broad round-ended 'straps'. From under the curved lower front edge emerges a band cut into lappets, under which is fixed the kilt, formed of individual graduated strips.  Beneath the kilt is an asymmetrically cut skirt, edged with heavy white twisted cotton fringe. Fixed across the neck at centre front is winged cherub head of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9. On either shoulder and over the top sleeve is a paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask of an upper face and hair; the top side of the elbow length bell sleeve is pleated into the lower edge of the mask, leaving the outer arm bare.  The costume is appliqu\u00e9d with narrow strips and studs of lightly padded white leather, simulating an embossed design.  All edges of the tunic and kilt are bordered with narrow strips of white leather.  On the chest are motifs and foliated arabesques.  At the waist is a stylised flower and, continuing around the back, simulated strappings with curlicue ends below which are outlines simulating overlapping scales.  The simulated strappings at shoulder and waist have a central row of small studs.  \n\nThe 'scales', with occasional central studs, are repeated on the kilt strips.  The skirt has a border of outline ovals with small ovals at the centre, between lines of white leather.  The tunic is padded and lined with white cotton and fastens on an extension down the back with hooks, bars and eyes.  On the left front shoulder and right back shoulder are heavy bar fastenings.  The lining is marked with make-up.\n[Theatre costume] Large semi-circle of off-white heavy duty flannel with a fringe of heavy white twisted cotton.  The fabric is arranged to fit around the left arm and fall in elegant folds as a cloak.  On the left shoulder is a stylised ram's head of gilded and antiqued rubber composition.  The cloak has heavy hooks to fit onto  bars on the tunic",

The designer was Oliver Messel and he stunned audiences with his daring use of white - often considered a 'forbidden' colour on stage because it can flare under stage lights and wash out the performer's face.  Messel got round the problem in this costume by using strong textures and shades of off white.  \n\nThe plot centred on the abduction of Helen by Paris and the subsequent siege of Troy by her husband, Meneleus.  The costume would appear to be that worn in the original production by Bruce Carfax as Paris in the final scene outside the walls of Troy, when he is rescued from Menelaus by Venus.  Fancy dress balls were quite common in the 1920s and 1930s, and Messel may have worn it on such an occasion - certainly a photograph exists of him wearing the costume, or another made to the same design.  It was later worn by actor and director Peter Glenville to Lady Jersey's ball at Osterley House in 1939, the last of the great fashionable costume balls before World War II.",
