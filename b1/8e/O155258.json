There is a border along the bottom: green ground with pink flower pointing to the lower right and a chevron stem with 3 mauve flowers pointing to the upper right.  There is a narrow border from the top edge of this border going part way up both sides: small hexagon, dark green on the inner half and mauve and pink on the other half.  Does this represent a bowl with fruit?\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark green ground with white flower with coloured centre pointing either straight down or to the right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] dark green ground with angled stem and downward pointing triangular flower with pink petals outlined with blue and dark green and edged with a row of yellow outlined flowers alternating with a blue-outlined yellow vase pointing to the right with a pair of pink leaves at the base and a mass of small flowerheads.\n[b] dark green ground with 3 blocks: one has dark blue-edged irises pointing to the lower right; one has a group of 3 small pointed mauve and blue flowers; one has a round rose with yellow and light blue centre.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; dark green, green, white, red, orange, pink, yellow, light blue and mauve.",
