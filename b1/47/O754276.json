After his retirement he drew a small portrait of himself virtually every day, not so much as an exercise in recording his appearance, but as a method of self-analysis. He also made small informal drawings of his son, his friends and acquaintances. These were not made for display but to be kept in albums where they formed a kind of visual memoir.  \n\nThe subject of this drawing is the poet and scholar Francesco Algarotti, Count Algarotti in the Prussian nobility (1712-64). As a young man he was considered to be extremely charming and good-looking. His first visit to England was made in 1736, at the age of 24, the date of this little portrait by Richardson. He also captured Algarotti's features in another drawing of the same date, also in the V&amp;A (E.538-1929).",
