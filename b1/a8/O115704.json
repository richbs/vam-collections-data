In Greek mythology, Medusa was a monstruous figure, whose hair was formed of snakes and whose glance would kill the onlooker. According to legend, coral was formed from the blood of the severed head of Medusa, explaining perhaps the choice of this motif. \n\nCoral is formed by the skeletons of marine creatures. It has been used in jewellery since antiquity. It was believed to protect the wearer against the evil eye and was often worn by small children or made into rosaries. \n\nMost coral in Europe came from the sea around Naples and nearby Torre del Greco. In the 19th century it became a fashionable souvenir. This was partly because people could travel more once the Napoleonic wars had ended in 1815, but also due to the growing popularity of naturalistic jewellery in the 1850s.",
