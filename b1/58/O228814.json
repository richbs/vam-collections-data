            "physical_description": "Description: plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in  straight and split stitches and couched metal thread; evidence of a cotton backing, faced with plain weave cotton, padded and quilted.\nThe lower part has been cut, the main border and the inner border removed and the outer border re-joined. Two red flowers from the missing main border have been used to form a patch half way down the left hand side of the main panel. The outer border contains a thin meandering stem with pointed red or blue flowers. There is a square section in each corner containing a star of 2 red and 2 blue flowers.  The main border, now only on 3 sides, contains pairs of red or blue pointed flowers with sprays of green leaves. There is a square section in the 2 upper corners and these contain a roundel in  white with metal thread centre and green leaves with red details. The main border along the  top has pairs of blue and whit leaves. There is a large roundel in the centre in white with a green cross and metal thread centre. Four blue leaves enclose it and there is a smaller green roundel with a white cross to either side. The inner border is a repetition of the outer one.  There is a crude patch down the right hand side. The ground of the prayer mat is white. A narrow blue line forms a lobed niche in the main panel. In the spandrels there is an X-shaped arrangement of floral stems with a variety of blossoms.  The ground within the niche has been quilted in parts with a scallop-pattern. There are 2 floral stems along the bottom bending to the left. Between these are 3 small, fat white cypress trees. The embroidery has worn from the middle one. Above this row are 2 straight floral stems followed by 3 more bending ones, but the design has been disrupted by a patch. Towards the top of the niche is a roundel with four indistinct blossoms coming from a central disk. Below this is a triangular blossom above a semi-circle containing 3 blossoms.  All these are worked in couched metal thread [silver strip close S-wound on cream silk]. The semi-circle may indicate where the rosary could be placed. There are several large patches of thick cotton twill on the back. There is evidence of a pink cotton backing. The facing is bias cut dark blue cotton.",
