This highly complex example was designed for both main course and dessert use, but can in fact be used in a number of different permutations for different stages in the meal, and indeed for meals at different times of the day.\n\nThe surviving elements comprise a tureen with attached stand on four feet, a dish, four detachable branches, four detachable salvers and four finials.  It was originally supplied with a cover for the tureen and detachable candle nozzles and drip pans.\n\nCommon practice was for a centrepiece to be laid out for the main course at the more informal meal of supper; the tureen and cover contained stews or 'ragouts', kept warm by a spirit lamp underneath, while the brackets were fitted with candles and the salvers placed directly on the table.  At dinner, the centrepiece served as a fruit stand, set out at the beginning of the meal, supplemented by further dishes of fruits and sweetmeats for the dessert course.  The cover of the tureen would be replaced by the large dish and stand fitted with salvers in place of candle nozzles.  By the 1750s the composite centrepiece had developed into the now more familiar dessert centrepiece, often with hanging baskets.\n\nDecoration\nThis elaborate centrepiece (a wedding present) is richly decorated with characteristic Rococo motifs - bold scrollwork, flowers and shells - but also contains elements typical of de Lamerie's work, such as the helmeted putti.",

The helmeted putti recur, for instance, on Lamerie's teawares of the early 1740s.\nPaul de Lamerie exhibition catalogue, Goldsmiths' Hall, 1990, No. 81, (entry by Philippa Glanville)",
