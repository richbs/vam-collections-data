It was written by Gerald du Maurier (1873-1934) and Viola Tree (1884-1938). The sketches in the sketch book are signed H.Furness. \n\nThe lead role required demanded an American actress who could dance and Tallulah Bankhead (1902-1968) was cast in the part. She was given dance training by the Russian choreographer and dancer Leonide Massine (1896-1979) and the part marked her debut on the British Stage. Both the actress and the play proved a widespread success and the popularity of the production was such that demand for tickets soon outstripped supply.\n\nThe sketches in the album are signed H.Furness. Harry W. Furniss or William Henry Paul Furniss (1892-1945) was the son of Raymond Furniss, manager of the Bury Hippodrome Theatre, near Manchester. During his career his name was sometimes spelt \"Furness\" and he called himself Paul Furniss when acting in Australia. He also danced with the Imperial Russian Ballet in Britain as Paul d'Este or Paul d'Esti in the 1920's. His father was a cousin of Harry Furniss (1854-1925), the famous caricaturist who worked with Thomas Edison in film in the US, helping pioneer animated cartoon film. He appeared in the 1923 production of &lt;i&gt;The Dancers &lt;/i&gt;alongside Tallulah Bankhead.",
