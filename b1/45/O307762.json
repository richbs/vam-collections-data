K\u00e4ndler is known to have visited the menagerie housed at the royal Saxon hunting palace of Moritzburg soon after his arrival at the porcelain factory in 1731.  There he was able to copy from life the exotic creatures kept in specialised enclosures.  The extensive aviaries allowed him to produce models of all kinds of parrots, parakeets and cockatoos, as well as birds of prey and game birds.  In addition to making his own drawings, K\u00e4ndler is known to have used prints and drawings in the factory archives and mounted specimens to help him produce his life-like models.\n\nExotic birds and animals were admired for their rarity and beauty  in 18th century Europe, but were also highly prized as symbols of wealth.  Brightly coloured birds in particular were often included in murals and paintings as they were the subject of much fascination.",
