Their simple, strong construction made them ideal for use out of doors, although they would have been stored under cover. They can sometimes be seen in mid-18th-century paintings with a garden setting. Windsor chairs used outside were usually painted to protect them from damp. \n\nThe green paint on this chair could be original; it was discovered under a later layer of brown, removed by the Museum in 1969.  The seat is made of elm, carved in a saddle shape and chamfered, or shaped, at the edges. The splayed legs are characteristic of English 18th-century windsor chairs.",
