The idea of this can be gathered.\nWhen the two players are ready, ie have placed their pieces in the positions they desire (NB Pieces can be placed in any order the player desires) play proceeds as follows, it having been mutually agreed which player shall make the first move.  Each movable piece may be move one square at a time forwards, backwards, or sideways but not diagonally.\nMoves are made alternately by the players throughout the game.\nNo pieces may be placed on a river or move across one.\nThe object of the game is to capture the opponent's flag when this has been done the game is finished.\nPieces attack each other back to back only, by moving on to the square in front of an opponent and saying 'ATTACK!'.\nBoth players then show their pieces, the lower piece (according to the number on the face) is captured, ie removed from the board.  The move then passes to the player who was attacked, whether he was successful or not.\nThe following are points to be noted when various pieces `attack'.  First of all, the Flag and all Mines, remain stationary throughout the game.\nEverything attacking a Mine is blown up (removed from the board), except the Sapper, in which case the Mine is removed from the board.\nThe Spy is for one purpose only, that of capturing the Commander-in Chief, but can be taken by any other piece.\nAny piece including the Spy, can capture the Flag.\nThe Commander-in-Chief captures all pieces, except the Mine and the Spy.\nAll the other piecess capture according to their numerical value, the higher taking the lower in each case.\nWhen two pieces of the same value attack both are removed from the board, with the exception of the Scouts when both remain, the move passing in the usual way.\nSCOUTS.  The Scouts are of course, used for the purpose that the name denotes and have a special privilege.\nIn order to take up a particular position, they are allowed to move several squares at a time, backwards, forwards or sideways (but not diagonally), provided that the intervening squares are unoccupied and there is no river in the way.\nSPECIAL POINTS TO BE NOTED.\nA great deal depends upon how a player sets out his pieces to begin with.\nThe Flag should be well protected, but may not be placed on the square directly behind the three rivers, or on any of the four squares behind the three rivers, with only Mines between it and the river.  It is obvious that if this were done, the Flag could not be attacked and the object of the game would be defeated inasmuch that it would become a question of merely capturing the opponent's pieces.\nShoudl it by any chance happen, that a player has lost nearly all his movable pieces, but that his flag is still uncaptured it is possible for his oppenent to bottle up his remaining pieces so that he cannot move any of them, when it is his turn to move.\nIn this case he must surrender his Flag and loses the game.\n\nRules placement: separate sheet",
