Often salvers were circular, like this one, but they could also be square or polygonal with rounded corners. Those made in Sheffield plate were covered in silver on both sides, the layer of silver on the upper surface being thicker to withstand wear and of sufficient depth for a coat of arms to be engraved on the surface without exposing the copper core beneath. This salver is engraved with a coat of arms and branches of laurel and palm.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
