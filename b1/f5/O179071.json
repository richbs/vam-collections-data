'Jesse Tree' windows are a visual representation of Jesus Christ's genealogy which was traced back to Jesse, the father of the Old Testament Prophet/King David. \n\nThese prophets announce the coming of Christ from the line of David and appear on the Tree accompanying images of Christ's royal ancestors. The whole window would have culminated at the top with either an image of Jesus Christ or an image of the Christ Child with his mother, Mary. At the bottom of the window would have been an image of Jesse from whom the genealogical Tree emerges.\n\nThe king here cannot be identified as there are no surviving inscriptions naming him and there may not have been originally. Jesse Trees with their kings and prophets were produced in all forms of church art from the 11th century and throughout the medieval period. There was no standard convention for the depiction of the prophets and the kings. The head of the king had been replaced in the 19th century, presumably because the original was damaged. The 19th century restoration was very poor and has subsequently been recently replaced.",

Visual Representation of Tree of Jesse:\nJesse Window\nA window whose design is based on the descent of Jesus from the royal line of David, usually in the form of a tree springing from Jesse (David's father) and ending in Jesus or the Virgin and Child, with the intermediary descendents placed on scrolls of foliage branching out of each other.\nJesses appear from 11th century\n(1086.)

It is reasonable to think the representation in a window was based on an earlier minature. Because a group of prophets appears in the Chartres window, it isn't a given that it came from the Limoges prophet drama. Jesses can have or can not have genealogical tables.\n\nIV.

The whole window would have culminated at the top with either an image of Jesus Christ or an image of the Christ Child with his mother, Mary. At the bottom of the window there would have been an image of Jesse from whom the genealogical Tree emerges.\n\nTwo other panels in the museum (Mus.nos. 6D and 6E-1881) depict Kings from a 'Jesse' Tree' window but were not originally part of either of these series of prophets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis panel depicting an Old Testament King, and ten others in the museum' collections (Mus.nos. 5-E-1881 and  6-C and E-1881), formed part of 'Jesse Tree' windows.
