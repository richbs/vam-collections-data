Siva, four armed, seated on a throne with Parvati on his left knee (which is crossed), holding a trident in the back right hand and a snake in the back left, his front right hand is damaged, with the front left hand he fondles the left breast of Parvati.  Siva's left foot is damaged. A small bull is shown below Siva (Mahesvara). Part of Parvati's left leg and upper portion of her head are missing.  With her right hand Parvati (Uma) embraces the shoulder of Siva, but it is difficult to say if she held a flower (or a mirror?) in her left hand. Both the deities wear various thick ornaments. Siva has a large crown of matted hair (jata-mukuta).   The corners of the throne base are missing. The panel is chipped and weathered. The pedestal below has a donative inscription in local dialect and Nagari script which is fragmentary and difficult to deciper.  Perhaps the year at the beginning is missing.",
