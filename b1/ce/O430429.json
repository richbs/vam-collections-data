The tiles are said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal in Srinagar, Kashmir. The building dates from the mid-fifteenth century, but was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman during the reign of Shah Jahan (1628-58).",

He had been living in Srinagar as  Director of the Technical Institute of Kashmir and wrote to the museum in 1922 offering to sell his collection before he left that year to return to the UK.  The tiles are said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal in Srinagar, Kashmir.  The building dates from the mid-fifteenth century, but it was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman during the reign of Shah Jahan. The tiles were possibly made in Lahore.",
