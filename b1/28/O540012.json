Taking forms and images from previous historical styles, he remodelled and recontextualised them in his buildings and furniture. \n\nIn this early drawing, the elongated, elegant form of Art Nouveau is featured in the tall back. The chair was one of a group of nine chairs, two tables, a low table, and a sofa that Venturi designed for Knoll in 1984. The details in the shape of each piece refer to a particular period style, but the same basic forom of the carcass is retained across the set. The range also challenges traditional preconceptiosn of suitable materials used to make furniture as it was made in a thin plastic laminate and does not look substantial enough for its purpose.",
