One complete and two partial motifs in the lower row, two complete and one partial motif in the middle and the roots of three motifs just below the upper seam. The design of each motif is identical but there are two colour combinations: blue roots, green leaves and three white and brown flowers, or brown roots, green leaves and light blue and blue flowers; all outlined in metal thread.\n\nMetal Thread: silver strip open S-wound orange silk core.\nColours: silk, red, green, orange, light blue, blue, brown, all indeterminable twist.\nCut on an inward diagonal line in the lower left hand corner with signs of stitching along the lower edge: slightly shaped at the lower edge into a curve with a small triangular pieces missing; it suggests it was the lower edge of a trouser leg.\nThe band attached along the upper edge is similar in scale: there are the tops of three floral sprays in white or light blue and dark brown with green details. There is a brown butterfly to the right of the 2 almost complete motifs. The ground is dark red and the motifs are outlined with metal thread.\nMetal Thread: silver strip open S-wound orange silk core. Colours: light blue, dark brown, green and white, all indeterminable twist.",
