He was the son of one of the most famous carvers of the 19th century in Britain, William Gibbs Rogers (1792-1875), who exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851. George Alfred himself continued his father's carving workshop and published on the art of carving.  The workshop had a large number of carvings that the carvers used as models. This one is clearly a corner clasp from a picture or mirror frame, with two grooves on the back which would have fitted over the front of the frame.",
