Studied art with the landscape painter John Vincent Barber in Birmingham, and settled in London 1828. Exhibited 139 works at the RA between 1828 and 1870, 80 at the BI 1828-55, and 46 at the SBA 1829-38. Early landscapes were principally in Wales, Yorkshire and Cornwall, then Ireland (after a visit in 1837), and coastal scenes after 1848. An early member of the Etching Club, many of his works were engraved. Commissioned 1851 to paint an extensive series of views in north Wales. Elected ARA 1842, RA 1851. Admired particularly in the later 1840s and 1850s for his truth to nature and the charm of his compositions; later works were criticised for being too dark and brown in tone. Occasionally worked in collaboration with other artists such as Richard Ansdell and W P Frith. Died Bayswater, London, 28 December 1869; his studio sale was at Christie's 6-7 May 1870. The <i>Illustrated London News</i> obituarist wrote that his life and work were 'comparatively monotonous and devoid of incident'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp141-4, 1870, p53 (obit); <i>The Graphic</i> 8 January 1870, pp121-2 (obit with engr portrait); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 8 January 1870, p53 (obit with engr portrait); C Collins Baker 'Thomas Creswick RA and Mid-Victorian Landscape Painters' <i>Art Journal</i> 1908, pp104-7 \n\n<b>Landscape with Classical Ruins</b> \n1029-1886 \nCanvas, 47.9 x 69.5 cm (18 7/8 x 27 3/8 ins) \nSigned and dated 'T CRESWICK/1830.' bl \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nOnly two similar subjects by this artist are recorded: 'An Italian Scene' exhibited at the RA in 1832 (368), and 'Ruins, Sunrise' at the BI in 1831 (242, size given as '15 by 18 inches', presumably including frame). The overall mood of the painting - a classically composed Italianate landscape with a woman in ancient costume seated on a fallen column, listening to a shepherd's pipes - is that of Claude (see for example 'The Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah', which had been bought by the NG in 1824), and of works by Richard Wilson.\"",
