The Stodarts supplied the Royal family with pianos, as the inscription on the nameboard states, and William's father taught music to the daughters of George III.  This undated piano was almost certainly made before 1820, the year in which William Stodart's employees William Allen and James Thom invented tubular metal bracing.  This device, designed to keep the piano's tuning stable in fluctuating temperatures, is not used on the present piano.",
