Later it was thought to be Flemish. Subsequently it was considered to be Lower Rhenish or Westphalian.\n\nThe relief consists of nine pieces of wood joined together with several small wooden dowels and it shows Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea placing the body of Our Lord in the tomb, around which are gathered the Virgin, St. John the Evangelist and the three Maries.",
