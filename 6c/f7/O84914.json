The tiger's god: a Muslim figure, sometimes known as Satya Pir, riding a tiger and holding a rosary. Propitation of this god was thought by Bengali Hindus and Muslims as well as Santals to afford protection from tigers (see M. Archer [1977] pp.22-3 and 27). That the tiger is actually shown with a leopard's spots may be connected with the disappearance of tigers from the Santal Parganas and Rajmahal region as a result deforestation and over-shooting/ 2. Two Muslim worshippers at the shrine of the tiger's god/ 3-6. Scenes at a fairground: four seated figures; four people eating; men drumming and women dancing; two figures on a type of seesaw.",
