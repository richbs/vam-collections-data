It relates to a group of objects with a distinctive decorative technique said to have been found at Aghkand, Iranian Azerbaijan. They are dated from the 12th into the early 13th centuries. More recently, this type of ware has also been found in quantity in Russian Georgia.\n\nAghkand ware is also known as \"Incised-outline\" style. This ceramic is characterised by rims commonly decorated with painted wedges and the incised line is generally used to delimit a field which is then filled with colour, particularly green and brown. Animals, especially birds, are quite often depicted.",

It is dated to the end of the 12th to the first 1/3 of the 13th century. Then the catalogue entry says that it may have been made in Russian Georgia, where this type of ware has been found in quantity.\nThe Tareq Rajab Museum in Kuwait has a dish with the same border as well, dated to the 12th century.\nAghkand ware is also known as \"Incised-outline\" style. It was originally thought to have been made in the town of Aghkand in NW Iran but excavations further northwest in Azerbaijan and Georgia have yielded great quantities of this material. Still known as 'Aghkand ware', this ceramic is characterised by rims commonly decorated with wedges; the incised line is generally used to delimit a field which is then filled with colour, particularly green and brown. Animals, especially birds, are quite often depicted.",
