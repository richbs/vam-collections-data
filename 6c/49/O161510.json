It might have been made in Delft, the most prolific and celebrated production centre for ceramics in the Netherlands. However, the method of decoration is very close to that used by Dutch tile-makers in Rotterdam and Friesland and it is possible that they also produced this dish. They potter first painted the central decoration in blue, which they then covered with a paper or sheet-metal stencil. They then sprinkled on the purple pigments by agitating a brush dipped in manganese pigment with a knife, causing the paint to cover the rest of the surface with a random pattern of small spats. \n\nThe shape of the dish was very popular in silver during the seventeenth century.",
