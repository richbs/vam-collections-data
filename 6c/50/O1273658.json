This particular vase remained in Leach's possession throughout his life, and was selected for inclusion in the major retrospective of his work held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1977. Following Leach's death two years later, it was passed from his wife Janet to a third party, coming to light again as part of the sale of ceramics from Bernard Leach's collection held at Christies South Kensington in 2013.",
