            "public_access_description": "David Bailey rose to fame as a fashion photographer in the early 1960s, his photographs. He published 'David Bailey's box of pin-ups' in 1965 as a loose portfolio of 36 portraits of the mainly-male fashionable elite that, as the cover description states, 'belong to Bailey's own world of fashion, pop music and the Ad Lib [nightclub]'. Each portrait is accompanied by notes by Francis Wyndham. Together, they constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture of the Sixties, and many of them have become the definitive images of key figures of cultural life in London during the Swinging Sixties.\nSurprisingly, only four of the pin-ups are women, all of whom are models; as the notes explain, 'in the age of Mick Jagger, it is the boys who are the pin-ups'. Michael Cooper was a photographer who was part of the Rolling Stones entourage and worked for the influential Robert Frazer gallery in Mayfair. With the artist Peter Blake, he also created the cover for the Beatles 'Serjeant Pepper's' album. Here, he re-enacts a Peter Blake self portrait, the badgesand t-shirt declaring his enthusiasm for American popular culture, an influence on the circle of Pop artists associated with the Robert Frazer gallery.",
