During the First World War a ban on Christmas cards was mooted to conserve supplies of paper but the idea was rejected in the interests of maintaining morale. The propaganda potential of the postcard was exploited for the war effort as this satirical card at the expense of the German Kaiser illustrates.",

When the Photographs accessions register for 1969 was consulted two unrelated groups of material with the same run of numbers was discovered. One of these groups, which included this postcard was credited as being 'Given by Mrs Harrington'. Registry could find no record of a donation from a 'Mrs Harrington'.",
