The skirt of the under-dress is of red tulle hemmed with nylon net, under-skirt layers of nylon net panels and red organza.\n\nThe very full, full-length skirt is of red satin which fastens at the back with hooks and eyes.  The skirt has been altered around the waist.\n\nThe bodice is of red satin. It has two shoulder straps which have been shortened.  It fastens at the back with a zip (replacement).  It had been taken in with tucks under each arm.  It has a short peplum.  There was a detachable metal brooch at the centre-top front, shaped like a Medici coat of arms.  The brooch was removed as it was not original to the design and was damaging the textile.  Inside the bodice at the top are labels.\n\nThe jacket is also of red satin with \u00be length sleeves, fastening at the front with 3 self covered buttons.  It has a high collar, a fitted waist and a wide long peplum.  It is lined with red silk.",

His fashion house was the most successful and widely known of the post-war era, and his international sales constituted over half the Paris couture exports. \n\nThe dress shown here is called Zemire and was part of Dior\u2019s H-line collection of Autumn/winter 1954-5. It is one of his most historical designs, echoing the shape of  riding-habits, and it was successful. The original model in grey silk satin was shown to Princess Margaret at Blenheim Palace in 1954, and it appears in several magazine features. A ready-to-wear version was licensed to Susan Small, a British company that made \u2018line-for-line\u2019 copies for Harrods. It sold for 22 guineas, a fraction of what a made-to-measure version would have cost. \n\nThis ensemble was commissioned by Lady Sekers, wife of the British textile manufacturer, and made in an innovative man-made fabric produced by the Sekers company.",

Article about <i>The Golden Age of Couture</i> exhibition with paragraph about V&A 'Zemire':\nThe Zemire evening jacket and skirt by Christian Dior, which dates from 1954, had long been thought lost by historians of costume, who knew it only from photographs. Then, last year, a red version made for one of Dior's private clients came up for auction in Paris. The V&A bought it. 'I think people thought we were mad,' says Claire Wilcox, senior curator of 20th-century and contemporary fashion at the museum. 'The dress had been kept in a cellar by the Seine, and it had been badly damaged by water.' A complex restoration job duly began and, today, the ensemble looks as though M. Dior finished making his final adjustments to it only a few moments before. Zemire consists of a long, full skirt; a jacket featuring the New Look's trademark sloping, seamless shoulders and nipped-in waist; and a bodice. As party dresses go, it is up there with the best of them: dramatic, romantic, and curiously modern, for all that it is suggestive of an 18th-century riding outfit. Gaze on it, and it's impossible not to imagine yourself calmly descending a wide, curved staircase as the crowd of agog guests below stares up at you, trying to take in your absolute, feminine perfection.\n<i>V&A Magazine</i>, 'The Golden Age of Couture: Suzy Menkes looks back', Autumn/winter 2007\n'Dresses for Princesses' by Suzy Menkes: \"The dress is Red Riding Hood scarlet, its gleaming satin skirt spreading under an elongated jacket.  It speaks of glamour and dash, of history and haute elegance.  And who could have believed that this Christian Dior gown was made while Paris was still licking the wounds of war?  Or that the magisterial ensemble had been fished out a damp cellar seeping with water from the River Seine?\"\n<i>V&A Magazine</i>, 'The Golden Age of Couture: Suzy Menkes looks back', Autumn/winter 2007, p.43-4\n'Our Cinderella dress - How the V&A's conservators turned a ragged Dior classic into the belle of the ball, by Kate Jazwinski':\n\n<u>Cleaning:</u>\nThe first dilemma was how to clean a dress that needed a good scrubbing.  Tiny samples of material were tested to see how the aged cellulose acetate and other fabrics would react to different washing solutions.  The costume contains five different types of material (including an interlining made of linen and hair), which provided a complex challenge.  Cleaning in water can cause colours to run and fabrics to distort or shrink, and can weaken aged fibres, all resulting in permanent damage.  The jacket is hand-washed and quickly dried \u2013 although there is colour run, a s the tests had predicted, the pink retains its vibrancy.  Because cellulose acetate is a semi-synthetic, the fabric had to be carefully steamed to remove the creases.  \n<u>Conservation:</u>\nConservators don\u2019t usually take a costume apart, but the waist of the skirt had been drastically altered. Re-creating Dior\u2019s vision required painstaking reconstruction, using archive fashion photographs.  The only other clues were cryptic chalk marks on the inside of the skirt.  Frances made a copy of the skirt in calico and reconstructed it four times to crack the code of the original pleatwork.  After many attempts, the 5.11m of fabric were gathered into the 69cm waist, re-creating the original distinctive full shape.\n<u>The finished piece:</u>\nZemire is a symbol of the entire \u2018Golden Age\u2019 show, epitomising the art and craftsmanship of the ear.\nFilm footage Gaumont Path\u00e9 Archives, ref: 5435GJ 00008\n'Paris Images: Autumn & Winter Fashions', August 11, 1949:\nDior house models show-casing the H-line, including Ren\u00e9e modelling 'Zemire'",

            "history_note": "In 2006, the V&A acquired this ensemble (from the Cornette de Saint-Cyr auction house in Paris).  The auctioneer claimed it had been found in a damp cellar by the Seine; no more information about provenance was available. \n\nA handwritten tape inside the bodice suggests that the dress was made for the wife of the leading British textile manufacture Miki Sekers of the West Cumberland Silk Mills. The story of the dress (including the Sekers link) was published in <i>The Guardian</i> (March 16 2007), and the museum was subsequently contacted by the descendants of Miki Sekers, who recall that Miki's wife, Lady Agotha Sekers, was often persuaded to commission clothes that would publicise the company\u2019s innovative fabrics.   They also recalled that Lady Sekers (or Agi as she liked to be called) would often abandon fittings as she preferred to go sight-seeing when in Paris.  The family supplied a Sekers company brochure from 1951-2 featuring the same textile as used in the dress.\n\nWhy the ensemble was abandoned is not known.  It was clearly worn by others than Lady Agota as there were extensive alterations to the waist, shoulder-straps, and under-arms.\n\nThe original 'Zemire' model was in silver-grey satin by Brossin de M\u00e9r\u00e9 with mink-trimmed cuffs  It was one of the selection presented to Princess Margaret at Blenheim Palace in 1954. A postage stamp sized piece of the fabric survives on the couture house chart which also documents its maker (Christiane) and the model who wore it (Ren\u00e9e). Interestingly, \u2018Zemire\u2019 was not only an important design which received at least one private client commission, but was also successful in terms of commercial reproduction \u2013 it can be fleetingly glimpsed in some seconds of promotional film produced by Dior in 1954 (for Gaumont Pathe newsreels), and was featured in several magazine features. \n\nIt is one of Dior\u2019s most consciously historical designs. The \u2018riding\u2019 jacket and full skirt have a distinctly eighteenth-century flavour, and are made using archaic construction techniques. \n\nThe Theatre Museum also holds a very similar design - a Dior design for Vivien Leigh (made by Angels & Bermans) for the 1956 London staging of 'Angels & Demons'.",
