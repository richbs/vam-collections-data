The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. No independent, contemporary version of the text is known and only the sections on the back of the remaining paintings preserve the original. The story is therefore difficult to follow. Work on the project probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\n\nThis very damaged page is said to depict Sa'ad, who has fallen in love with Harum's sister, setting out for Barda in order to win her over by means of a valiant deed and fights.",
