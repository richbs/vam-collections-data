On the back is a pencil drawing of the end of the Brighton Chain Pier.\n\nNos. 302, 304-308 and 309 [294-1888, 350-1888, 199a-1888, 199-1888, 199b-1888, 199c-1888, 207-1888]\n \nNos 304-308 [350-1888, 199a-1888, 199-1888, 199b-1888, 199c-1888] appear to come from the same sketch-book, since they are carried out in the same medium and in similar technique on pages of the same size and, where they exist, the watermarks correspond; Nos. 302 and 309 [294-1888, 207-1888] can be referred to the same source.  Since the verso of No. 308 [199c-1888] bears a drawing of the Chain Pier, it may be presumed that the other coast scenes in this series were drawn at or near Brighton.  That Constable was there on 16 May 1828 is evidenced by No. 302 [294-1888].  There is no published account to show that he was there on May 30 as the identification of the subject of No. 304 [350-1888] requires.  He wrote on 11 June to Fisher \u201cMy wife is sadly ill at Brighton\u201d (Beckett, VI, p. 237) and these drawings may have been made when he accompanied of visited her there.\nFor a sketchbook which belonged to Delacroix containing drawings of Brighton by Constable similar in manner to 302, 304-8 and 309, see the article \u2018Newly discovered drawings by Constable in a Louvre Sketch-Book\u2019 by Graham Reynolds, <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. CVII, 1966, pp. 138-41 and figs. 37-44.\u201d",
