            "public_access_description": "This is a photocopy of a drawing by Circus Architects. It shows the interior of an industrial loft space in London, converted into a flat in the mid-1990s. Loft conversions are popular because they frequently offer open-plan, double-height living spaces. But this sometimes means that entrance halls and bedrooms become rather enclosed. If there were any such concerns with this project, the bird\u2019s-eye view used here helps to unify these two kinds of space. \n\nPhotocopying is one of several graphic techniques employed by architects today. Here it has been used to reproduce a traditional hand drawing. Because they can be remade many times over, photocopies are generally considered less precious than original drawings. They may be rolled up and carried to a meeting or scribbled over as the architect considers changes to the design. However they can become very important if an original drawing is lost or damaged. Some architects simply like the graphic effects achieved when a drawing is photocopied, as the pristine condition of this example suggests.",
