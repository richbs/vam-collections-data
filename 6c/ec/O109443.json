In the Cromwellian period Protestant services were usually conducted with little ritual and only a few pieces of simple silverware. It was not until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that churches could again use a Gothic chalice and celebrate the Eucharist with an elaborately chased and decorated communion set.\n\nThese pieces were presented to the fashionable London church of St James, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and consecrated in 1683. Their elaborate decoration, with embossed cherubs and fruit swags, complements the richness of Wren\u2019s interior. Although such decoration was already in use in the 1670s it was encouraged by the arrival of Huguenot silversmiths in London in the early 1680s.",

It is part of a set of plate presented to the fashionable church of St. James's Piccadilly on its consecration in 1683. The choice or ornament- cherubs and swags of fruit - is similar to that on the Easton Maudit flagon, made ten years earlier. Such elaborately chased and decorated communion silver was only used after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660.\n\nHistorical significance: The communion chalice displays a decorative style typical of the late 17th century, with the use of high relief. Although such decoration was already in use in the 1670s it was encouraged by the arrival of Huguenot silversmiths in London in the early 1680s.",

Like his contemporary Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, he regarded the Anglican church as a purified form of traditional Catholicism. Together they set out to restore the ceremonial that had been abolished with the Reformation of the previous century, including the high altar and the use of candles and incense.\n\nLaud's intentions, however, were seen by Parliament as an attempt to overthrow the Protestant religion and in 1645 he was beheaded. It was not until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that churches could again use a Gothic chalice and celebrate the Eucharist with an elaborately chased and decorated communion set.",
