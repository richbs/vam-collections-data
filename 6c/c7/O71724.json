Her interest in the arts began during early childhood. She worked as a teacher, later enrolling at the Kansas City Art Institute. \n\nIn 1936 she met Louis Freund, a painter, whom she married in 1939. In that year they established an art school in Eureka Springs (Carroll County). After various failed attempts with clay, Elsa Freund took her first ceramic classes in 1940 at the Wichita Art Association in Kansas. There she first developed a new technique, which became her trademark. Freund experimented with clay shapes which she hammered and fused with broken window or coloured bottle parts. Her husband described these works as 'Elsaramics'. At this point Freund had no experience with metals, and it was not until 1949 when the couple moved to Florida that she began to make jewellery.    \n\nFreund became best known for her jewellery and as an intuitive modernist, was compared to the greats of her time.",
