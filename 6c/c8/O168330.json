The numbers were marked on both the main frame and the loose seat, when they were made, in order to keep the right parts together. Each chair is also stamped with the initials of the journeyman (a qualified craftsman) who made it: RS on this one and two others, and IP on the fourth chair (W.79-1940). The chair by 'IP' differs noticeably in the character of the carving and in the shaping of the back legs. So it would seem that each chair in the set was made entirely by one journeyman, but at least two journeymen were employed in the workshop to complete the set. Unfortunately the names of the craftsmen involved remain unknown, as does the name of the workshop owner.\n\nCurrently on loan to Valentines Mansion, Redbridge.",
