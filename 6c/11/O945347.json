The series was originally attributed to Nicolas Poussin but were catalogued in the section dedicated to the rejected attributions (\u2018dessins rejet\u00e9s\u2019) in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 (Rosenberg, 1994). P. Rosenberg however suggests that the drawing was made by a close follower in the style of Fran\u00e7ois Verdier (1651-1730).\n\nThe present drawing depicts the allegorical figures of Peace on the left hand-side and Pride on the right. Following  the traditional iconography, they bear their characteristic attributes: Peace holds a shield, a branch of olive and the globe of the earth; and is flanked by a putto who holds a crown of flowers. Pride holds a mirror in her right hand and has a  peacock near her. \n\nIn the 17th century, Poussin merged Classical with Baroque arts, focusing on the emotional mode within a clear and fluid composition. He sometimes sculpted or drew models from the Antique and worked on the purity of contour to transmit the idea of truth and morality. A number of decorative projects and architectural designs have been influenced by Poussin, who favoured academic individual figures. In this perspective, this drawing is reminiscent of such works as the Martyrdom of Saint Erasmus (Roma, Vatican Pinacoteca) and The Triumph of Bacchus (Kansas City) drawn from Greek low-reliefs.  \n\nIn his early career, many artists worked as studio assistants with Poussin, drawing academic cartoons to help him to achieve designs for commissions and therefore imitating the master\u2019s manner. His work influenced a major part of the 17th century artists.",
