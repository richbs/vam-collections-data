He set up a special workshop in the Boboli gardens of the Pitti Palace, where a small team of artisans and scientist attempted to unravel the formula for porcelain. With the help of a potter from the East the workshop managed to produce a material based on fine clay and ground glass, which was equally white but lacked the translucency of real porcelain. Technically this 'Medici porcelain', is much closer to Turkish fritware imitations of porcelain. Greatly prized at the time, fewer than a hundred examples of 'Medici porcelain' survive today. Many of these, like this slumped jug, show technical defects associated with a small and experimental production.",

            "historical_context_note": "'Medici Porcelain' was created in Florence for the Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici from around 1575 until soon after his death in 1587.\nHis father Cosimo I (1519-74) grandson of Lorenzo de' Medici, established his power as Duke of Florence and after 1569 as Grand Duke of Tuscany. He gathered around him all the leading artists of the late Renaissance in Florence.\nOne of them, Bernardo Buontalenti (1536-1608) was the supervisor of all artistic undertakings at the Florentine court and must have played an important role also in the making of porcelain. In 1568 Vasari wrote that: \"In a short time he (Bernardo) will be seen making vessels of porcelain'.\nIt is around the same time, that the first attempts to make porcelain must have started.\nMedici porcelain was created almost under laboratory conditions in a special workshop located in the Boboli Gardens of Palazzo Pitti. Most of the makers had been trained in maiolica workshops, like Flaminio Fontana, from the well-known potters family from Urbino, who received payment for firing twenty-five to thirty pieces of porcelain in Florence in 1578. Almost all known pieces betray an experimental character by some kind of technical defect.\nMedici porcelain is not a 'real' hard-paste porcelain but a soft-paste or 'artificial' porcelain. It combines marzacotto (a heated frit mixture of sand, wine lees (sediments), and salt) with fine white sand and white clay. It was biscuit-fired at ca. 1100 C and subsequently the pieces were painted and glazed and fired again at 900-950 C.  It was close in composition to the Isnik wares made in Turkey, Persia and elsewhere in the Islamic Near East. \nIn 1575 Andrea Gussoni, the Venetian ambassador to Florence, wrote that the Grand Duke Francesco I had rediscovered the method of making Indian (i.e. Oriental) porcelain and that he had spent ten years before finding the secret, thanks to a 'Levantine'; probably a Greek or Turk familiar with Isnik potteries.\nIt was not until the 1709 that 'real' hard-paste porcelain was first produced in the West by Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger (1682-1719) at Meissen.",
