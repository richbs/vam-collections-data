It is one of a few large-scale bronze works to survive from antiquity and had a huge influence on Renaissance artists. It was also one of the most copied antique sculptures. It is thought to be a Roman pastiche from ca. the 1st century BC, using a Hellenistic body with a head of an earlier date. Napoleon confiscated the statue and brought it to Paris, where is lived from 1798 to 1815.",
