The best English embroidery of this period, known as Opus Anglicanum (Latin for 'English work'), can be seen in this example. It was of superb quality and highly regarded throughout Europe. The heraldic shields shown can be identified as those of some of the leading noble families of the age: Percy, Beauchamp, Roos, Dacre and Blount. However, the way they are arranged here suggests that they may have been selected for decorative reasons.",

A good deal of research has still to be done upon the heraldic embroidered stoles which group themselves with the Syon Cope before it will be possible to deduce the locality where they were worked.  The Willoughby stole seems to be most valuable from this point of view.  It is (speaking from the armoury) possibly slightly later than the Syon Cope, and present the arms on shields, not upon lozenges or roundels as does the latter.  It contains fewer of the well-known arms (which tell one less of locality) than Miss Weld's two stoles.
