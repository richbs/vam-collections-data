They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  It is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nIn Brittany the cross and slide were sewn onto the black velvet ribbon, rather than threaded on it.  This meant that the ribbon always remained flat, and was therefore open to further decoration.  Breton women decorated their ribbons with metal appliqu\u00e9s in all kinds of shapes, such as stars and flowers.\n\nThe V&A bought traditional jewellery from many European countries for the International Exhibition in London in 1872, including this necklace.  It cost 17 shillings and sixpence and was described as coming from Macon in Burgundy.  However, the cross is more typical of Alsace, and the whole necklace may have been made especially for the exhibition.  'Breton necklets', as they were usually known in Britain at the time, became very popular in London, and were high fashion for a few years.",
