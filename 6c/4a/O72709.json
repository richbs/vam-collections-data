            "public_access_description": "This long evening dress of aquamarine chiffon has a printed floral pattern in shades of lilac, orange and gold. The pattern is inspired by oriental designs and is outlined with iridescent sequins. The dress is straight cut with a low round neck at the front and a deep 'V' at the back. It is sleeveless. Attached at the hips are four shield-shaped panels of golden tulle outlined in golden sequins. A sunburst pattern is embroidered on them in iridescent sequins. Three graduated layers of gathered aquamarine tulle edge and join the panels. They are longer at the back than at the front. Worth probably made the dress, between 1928 and 1929.\n\nNight life became the focus for the exuberance of the years after the First World War. It gave birth to the most glamorous evening fashions of the 20th century. Throughout the 1920s, and in spite of changing fashions, the legacy of the Ballets Russes remained evident in the exoticism and luxury of evening gowns and mantles. This was seen especially in the continuing use of shiny fabrics, embroideries, tassels and sashes. Evening dresses were sleeveless, long and feminine. They were embellished with exotic embroideries, sequins and metallic threads to achieve the maximum effect of brilliance. This dress shows the characteristic flounces of the later period, when volume made a reappearance in fashion.",
