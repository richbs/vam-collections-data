Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this example in the form of an Immortal in a cloud. \n\nThis netsuke depicts the Immortal Kasenko in a cloud. Immortals or transcendents were people who practised Daoism. This was a school of Chinese thought that later became an organised religion. A number of illustrated works about Immortals were published in China in the late Ming dynasty (1368-1644). One, the Liexian quanzhuan (Complete stories of immortals), was so popular in Japan that a Japanese edition, Yusho ressen zenden, appeared in 1650. This netsuke is closely based on the illustration of the Immortal He Xiangu from this book.",
