Navy blue twill ground embroidered in coloured floss silks in satin stitch and gold thread in couched work. The waistcoat is lined with plain weave blue silk damask patterned with frets and flowers. Front panel joined to shoulder and back with five buttons fastened by black satin loops. The buttons are in the design of an enamelled clock-face bearing Roman numerals. Each clock shows a different time (1.25: 6.15). The garment fastens at each side with two similar buttons and loops (the enamel is missing from the top button on each side).\n\nThe main body is embroidered with scattered sprays of flowers (peonies, lotus, orchid) symmetrically arranged with large gold butterflies. All the borders are trimmed with a narrow black satin bias cut band, a wider black satin band embroidered with flowers in shades of blue, white and gold and Buddhist auspicious symbols in gold thread and a narrow warp-patterned ribbon. \n\nThe style of horizontal closure is called 'yi' in reference to the number one in Chinese which is written with a single horizontal stroke.",

The vest as an item of woman's clothing may have had its origins either in a woman's ceremonial vest known as the xiapei, or perhaps even the riding jacket known as the gua. \n\nThis vest is unique in its construction: usually, vests have only a sideways opening held by buttons, but in this case, the entire front panel is held to the shoulders and back-piece with buttons. The buttons have a white enamelled face decorated as a clock-face with Roman numerals: if these had not been a later alteration by the vest's subsequent European collectors, it may be an indication of a Western influence on Qing dynasty dress.",
