Short straight skirt with a dropped waist and drape of chiffon at the side of the skirt. The full sleeves are gathered into the yoke and tight wristbands.\n\nThe white silk fabric of the dress has been dyed using a Japanese shibori-dyed technique in shades of rich purplish-rust brown (combined blue, red and green) and a deep sulphur yellow. The bodice and sleeves feature simplified plant forms on a diamond patterned ground whilst the skirt is patterned with irregular vertical trails.\n\nThe main body of the dress has been ironed to remove the natural pleating and crinkled texture of the shibori process and conform it to the fashionable Western silhouette, although the sleeves retain the original dimpled pleating and texturing. The narrow band cuffs fasten with small black hooks and eyes.",

            "history_note": "The silk chiffon of this dress was dyed using the traditional Japanese <i>shibori</i> technique, an elaborate form of tie-dying which involves folding, wrapping, clamping and/or stitching fabric, and then adding or removing colour to create swirling, sweeping and geometric patterns. On close examination, the needle marks left in the thin silk chiffon where it was pleated and stitched together before being dyed can be clearly discerned. <i>Shibori</i> was a labour-intensive and expensive process, which means that this deceptively simple dress would have been costly to purchase.\n\nThis dress was worn by Miss Emilie Grigsby (1876-1964) who was a wealthy independent American who came to England from New York. She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.",
