After the recitation of the Creed, the Aer is folded and placed on the Chalice as a cover, to be removed only at the consecratioon of the bread and wine.\n\nWhen a bishop celebrates the Eucharist, the Aer is held and lightly shaken above his head by priests, to symbolise the ancient custom of lowering a curtain from the conch above the altar to protect the prepared Gifts.",
