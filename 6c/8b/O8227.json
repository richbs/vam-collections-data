Its inner moulding of regular egg and leaf pattern indicate that the mirror  was designed by an architect. The double shell cresting suggests the involvement of  William Kent. \n\nPeople\nWilliam Kent designed a barge for Frederick, Prince of Wales (George II's eldest son, who died in 1751). The cresting of this mirror is similar to the stern of the Prince's barge. Both feature the Three Feathers, the badge of the Prince of Wales. John Boson carried out the carving on the barge and may also have made this mirror.  He executed Kent's designs at Chiswick House, London, for Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and at Kew Palace, Surrey, for the Prince of Wales. A bill survives to show that in 1733-1734 Boson provided the Prince of Wales with another mirror: 'A Rich Tabernacle' mirror for the drawing room at Kew. It cost \u00a38 and the bill describes it as having a frieze of carved flowers, festoons at the sides, a shell on the pediment and foliage at the base.",

Baroque style decoration was preferred by promoters of the Palladian style, although the Rococo style was already flourishing in Europe, its asymmetry was alien to Palladian principles. However, the influence of the rococo can be seen in the light treatment of the shell cresting, the ragged C scrolls and the floriations of the apron. This could support the suggestion that the mirror has been altered at some point.",

The barge is now on display at the National Maritime Museum. The frame might have been carved by John Boson or Benjamin Goodison. The similar carving on the barge was carried out by Boson, who is known to have supplied another mirror to Frederick, Prince of Wales [Accounts of Frederick, Prince of Wales, Office of the Duchy of Cornwall, Vol. IV, p.238]. However, the carving style is also similar to pieces by Goodison.",
