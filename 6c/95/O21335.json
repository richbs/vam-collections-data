During the 18th century tea was made in front of family and guests in well-off households, rather than in the kitchen. Initially an expensive luxury confined to the wealthy, tea became more widely drunk as prices fell during the course of the century. Very few delftware tea trays survive. The shape of this tray is based on silver examples made between about 1710 and 1730. A tray of the same shape is shown in the tea-party scene painted on the tray itself. A teapot and tea bowls are depicted on the tray, while a black servant boy can be seen bringing a kettle of hot water to the table.\n\nTechniques\nItems of tin-glazed earthenware, such as this tea tray, were fired twice. The first firing was done before any decoration or glaze was applied. The wares emerged from this 'biscuit' firing in a hard and slightly porous state. The pots were then dipped in glaze and set on boards to dry. The raw glaze was delicate and liable to come off, and once dry had a powdery and highly absorbent surface. Painting of considerable refinement could be carried out on this surface, as is demonstrated by the exquisite painted scene on this tray. However, the absorbent nature of the unfired glaze meant that mistakes could not be erased. Once the decoration was complete the wares were fired for a second time.",
