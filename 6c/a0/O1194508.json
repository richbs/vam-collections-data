In fact, it is made entirely of glazed porcelain skilfully fabricated to resemble the forms and surfaces of these other materials. The sculpture is important historically because it was included in a seminal exhibition of work by Richard Shaw and Robert Hudson at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1973. Simply entitled Ceramics, the show represented a key breakthrough for West Coast ceramics, representing a crossover between craft and sculpture. Among the other objects in the 1973 exhibition was the much-reproduced S on a Pillow,which shares Cup's seemingly precarious stacked construction. Both works exemplify Shaw's engagement with the proto-postmodernist bricolage aesthetic that was then much in the air.",

            "history_note": "Regarding the title of the work and its history, Shannon Trimble, Director of the Braunstein / Quay Gallery, stated:\n\n\"In the 1973 catalog published by the San Francisco Museum of Art (later to become the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) - Robert Hudson/Richard Shaw Work in Porcelain - the work appears on page 18 and is simply listed as \"Cup\", but there are a number of cups in the catalogue and over the years people have taken to calling it the Cup on a Rock to differentiate it from other works from this period.  The actual title is \"Cup\" and I suggest parenthetically (on a Rock), but that is completely your call.\n\nThe work has remained in the possession of Richard Shaw since its creation.\n\nIt was exhibited in the exhibition Robert Hudson and Richard Shaw:  Collaborations at American University Museum Katzen Arts Center.  The exhibition ran from June 6 - August 9, 2009.  It appears in the accompanying catalogue on page 19 and is listed as Cup on a Rock, 1973.\"\n\n(Email of 22 March 2011 on V&amp;A Registered File 2011/241.)",
