It was probably intended for a small village or wayside shrine. Here Kubera  is seated in the attitude of \u2018royal ease\u2019, holding a long purse in his raised hand and a bowl of flowers in the other. His large, corpulent stomach is a sign of his prosperity and worldly comfort. His divine status is indicated by a nimbus (halo). \n\nThe panel belongs to the Gupta period (320-about 540 AD), when secondary deities such as Kubera assumed a secure place in the Hindu pantheon. The concept of Kubera as god of wealth also exists in a Buddhist context, where he is known as Jambhala.",

In Hindu cosmology he also serves as a directional guardian (dikpala), presiding over the north. He serves the same function in later Buddhism, where he is also acknowledged as Jambhala, the god of riches. \n\nThis small sculpture from the Mathura district of northern India, carved in the pink sandstone characteristic of the region, exhibits the distinctive Gupta-style treatment of the deity\u2019s hair, ornaments and nimbus.
