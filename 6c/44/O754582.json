The album was compiled by the architect Charles Heathcote Tatham, and is entitled in ink <i>A Miscellaneous Collection of Original Designs, made and for the most part executed, during an extensive Practice of many years in the first line of his Profession, by John Linnell, Upholsterer, Carver &amp; Cabinet Maker. Selected from his Portfolio's at his Decease, by C.H. Tatham Architect. AD 1800</i>. Two of the drawings in the collection are by Henry Holland, and about twenty-six by Tatham himself. The pencilled inscriptions of plate numbers on many of the designs is evidence that Tatham had gathered them together with a view to publication.\n\nLinnell's two designs include several 'Chinese' motifs: the first mirror frame incorporates a Chinese musician flanked by two ho-ho birds, and the other is an arched structure based on a double flight of curving steps and surmounted by an oriental figures carrying a pagoda-shaped umbrella. The mirror on exhibition embodies elements from both these designs, possibly adapted from common engraved sources. The central Chinese figure, although not carrying an instrument, is similar in pose to the musician in the first of Linnell's drawings, and the alcove supported on tapering columns with two symmetrical flights of steps at its base, echoes the composition of the second.'",
