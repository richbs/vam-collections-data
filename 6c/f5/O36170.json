The legs are separately atached and the rider is only attached by the yellow string reins which the figure holds in its left hand. The tail is black nylong hair and the pale green saddle blanket and red saddle are of vinyl. From the middle of the chest is a green plastic wire which leads to the battery holder. The rider is moulded in red; blue; black and yellow with a pink face. The battery holder is a tube of grey plastic with metal connectors inside. It is hinged and hooked so it can be opened and the batteries placed inside. On the outside is a switch. When operated the horse appears to gallop along. \n2. box; card printed in colours to show the title; maker's mark and illustrations of a cowboy on a horse at a rodeo.",
