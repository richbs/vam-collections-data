            "public_access_description": "The Church of San Simeon Piccolo was founded in the IXth century however the current building was rebuilt, in 1738, after a design by the architect Giovanni Antonio Scalfarotto (1718-1738) who was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. He also added Veneto-Byzantine metal-covered dome and a Palladio-influenced temple front decorated with a marble low relief by Francesco Cabianca (1665-1737). The drawing shows the fa\u00e7ade front door surmounted by a pediment behind a series of Corinthian columns supporting a large pediment decorated with figures in low-relief. A receding squared structure surmounts the fa\u00e7ade. A floor-plan beneath the fa\u00e7ade shows the interior structure with the placement of the columns and stairs.The egg-shaped dome and long flight of stairs leading up to the entrance are reminiscent of the Church of the Salute.\n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
