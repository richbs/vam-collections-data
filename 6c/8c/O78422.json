They often resemble reliquaries (a container for holy relics) and other ecclesiastical containers.\n\nOwnership & Use\nAs a chrismatory this object would have been used to contain the holy oils necessary for ritual anointing: oleum infirmorum, used for the sick; oleum catechumenorum, used at Baptism; and chrisma or balm, used for the sacraments of  Confirmation (the ceremony in which the  baptised are admitted to full membership of the church) and the ordination of priests, and for certain consecrations.\n\nInscriptions\nThe inscription  reveals that this object is a chrismatory. This appears to be a bungled version of 'Confirma hoc Deus quod, operatus es in nobis'  meaning 'Strengthen, O Lord, that which you have wrought for us'  (Psalm 67/68: 27/29). This phrase was used during the Confirmation service.",
