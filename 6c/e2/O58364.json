Though they did function as music stands or writing tables, they were essentially decorative pieces. They appear to have been designed specifically for a female clientele and for the small rooms such as boudoirs that fashionable women of the time decorated to their personal taste. Many of the tables were decorated with porcelain plaques or, as here, with panels of Japanese lacquer. These materials were very expensive and it would have been Daguerre who bore the capital cost of ordering the porcelain or buying the lacquer, supplying the panels to the cabinetmaker.",
