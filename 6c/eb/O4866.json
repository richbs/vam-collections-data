A socially-engaged artist, much of her work is developed through collaboration and she has worked extensively with schools and other organisations. Process is as important to Amidu as finished piece and her collaborative approach embraces discussion, discoveries and changes of direction. Hence, the finished work can be quite different from the initial idea. Amidu frequently chooses to work with glass; its varied qualities (of strength, colour and texture) suiting her responsive approach. \n\nThis glass sculpture was purchased by the V&A in 1996. The trace elements to which the title of the work refers are minute quantities of a group of chemical elements needed for the growth and development of an organism.",
