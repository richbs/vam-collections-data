Counted thread embroidery worked regularly across an even and open grid work of gauze silk is the main technique used on this intricately-patterned frontal. Vertical stitches are used throughout and, except for the dragons on the lower section and the small roundels on the pelmet, these regular stitches cover the ground material completely. An unbroken herringbone pattern is formed by the straight stitches, and this goes right across the piece regardless of the colour changes of the embroidery thread. In addition to this underlying pattern, there is a more obvious one of diamond and octagonal lattices, each ogive containing a tiny lotus, long life character or bat. Long satin stitches and couched gold thread form the sinuous spotted dragons as well as the floral circles above them.",
