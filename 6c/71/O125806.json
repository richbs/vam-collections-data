He is kneeling and his body forms a diagonal across the canvas from his feet at bottom right to his head top left.  His head is thrown backwards, and he is looking upwards.  A rope is tied around the top of his outstretched left arm, and is pulled across his torso, and disappears out of the picture frame to the left; it appears also to have gone behind his back and is pulled under his right armpit, and also disappears out of the picture frame to the left.  Branches of a tree run from top left to right against a cloudy sky, and roots of the tree and trunk entwined with ivy (?) are on the left.",

He spent two years in the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp and from 1620-1627 traveled in Italy, where he was in great demand as a portraitist and where he developed his maturing style. He toned down the Flemish robustness of his early work to concentrate on a more dignified, elegant manner. In his portraits of Italian aristocrats he painted idealized figures with proud, erect stances, slender figures, and the famous expressive \u201cvan Dyck\u201d hands. Influenced by the Venetian painters Titian, Paolo Veronese, and Giovanni Bellini, he adopted their rich, jewel-like colours. In 1632 he moved to London and became court painter to King Charles I, who knighted him shortly after his arrival.",

He spent two years in the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp and from 1620-1627 traveled in Italy, where he was in great demand as a portraitist and where he developed his maturing style. He toned down the Flemish robustness of his early work to concentrate on a more dignified, elegant manner. In his portraits of Italian aristocrats he painted idealized figures with proud, erect stances, slender figures, and the famous expressive \u201cvan Dyck\u201d hands. Influenced by the Venetian painters Titian, Paolo Veronese, and Giovanni Bellini, he adopted their rich, jewel-like colours. In 1632 he moved to London and became court painter to King Charles I, who knighted him shortly after his arrival. Van Dyck painted most of the English aristocracy and his style became lighter and more luminous, with thinner paint and more sparkling highlights in gold and silver. He set a new style for Flemish art and founded the English school of painting; the portraitists Sir Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough of that school were his artistic heirs.",
