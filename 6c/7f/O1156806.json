It stars 'The Amazing Chang' and his 'Chinese Fantasy' of magic and illusion, and an assortment of other acts including Wee Duncan 'the Perky  Wee Scot' and Arthur Astill and Gwen Fontaine, billed as 'Mirth, Mimicry and Ventriloquism'. One of their acts, which they may have performed at Stockport, was entitled 'Impressions of Country Life', and included mimicry of birds, animals and children. \n\nThis hanging card was part of a collection made by Arthur Astill (1887-1962) of advertisements from theatres where he and his wife Gwen Fontaine appeared. It is typical of the format of two-colour printing used in the 1940s to advertise Variety, with the names of the most popular stars literally appearing at the 'top of the bill'. The names of Astill and Fontaine are at the bottom of this bill.",
