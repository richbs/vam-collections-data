Subscription by season was a dependable source of income for theatres, and was also influential in a theatre\u2019s status and earning power, as only those in wealthy and important positions could afford it.\n\nThe token is inscribed with the name of the theatre: The Royal Italian Opera, later the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. When the first building on the site was opened by John Rich in 1732, the theatre was named the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and presented only spoken word drama, having been granted this patent by Charles II. The only other theatre in London allowed to perform spoken drama was the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nBallet was first presented at the theatre in 1734, and the first season of opera in 1735, with a performance of Handel\u2019s work. This building was destroyed by fire, however, in 1808 and was rebuilt and re-opened in 1809.\n\nIn 1846 Michael Costa, then conductor at Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre, got into dispute with the management and transferred his allegiance, and opera and dance company, to Covent Garden. Following a remodelling of the auditorium, the theatre was thus reopened in 1847 as the Royal Italian Opera, by which name it would be known until 1892. It became simply the Royal Opera House, dropping the \u2018Italian\u2019 from its title as it performed more French and German compositions.",
