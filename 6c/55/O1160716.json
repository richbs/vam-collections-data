The soft toy was introduced at the BIF, Feb. 1926 and made until 1935, according to company records. It was also a mascot for the England cricket team as well as the ladies' changing rooms at Wimbledon. He was one of the most successful toys of the 1920s. Desmond remained in production until the World War II, and was reintroduced in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThis paper sign was probably made for Dean's Rag Book Co. to help with their sales of the soft toy and would have sat in a shop window.",
