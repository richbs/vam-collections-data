            "public_access_description": "This is one of series of carved teakwood ceiling panels with reliefs of various Hindu deities. They came from a temple hall demolished in 1874 in Cochin, south-west India. Such halls (\u2018mandapa\u2019) were used for theatrical, dance and music performances within a temple compound.\n\nThis panel shows the monkey god Hanuman, who is much loved as the devout and loyal ally of Vishnu, as witnessed in the \u2018Ramayana\u2019 epic. The painting is dominated by the use of red, associated with Hanuman\u2019s heroic nature. \n\nHere Hanuman is shown seated, his eyes cast skyward and his hands raised in veneration (\u2018anjali\u2019) of his lord Vishnu. He sits in a yogi\u2019s pose, with his knees resting on a meditation strap (\u2018yogapatta\u2019). This underscores the Indian belief in yogic practices as a path to garnering supernatural powers, for which Hanuman was famed. He is richly adorned with jewellery, as befits his role as general of the monkey armies.",
