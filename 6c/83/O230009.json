Both organisations also have important ties to cultural activity in the fields of photography and other arts practice in a global context too. Rivington Place, opened in 2007, is the first public building in the UK by David Adjaye, one of Britain's leading young architects.\n\nThe artists (Sonia Boyce, Isaac Julien, Glenn Ligon, Hew Locke, Chris Ofili, Carrie Mae Weems) who contributed to this fund-raising portfolio were approached because of what they represent in terms of cultural difference and identity, both in this country and the USA. Although they all now have established, international reputations, they exemplify those who have been helped and encouraged to achieve such reputation through the activity of both organisations. They have all worked with print previously but are better known for work in other media. This portfolio is a fascinating case study of ideas re-presented and given a new dimension through the character and potential of print.",
