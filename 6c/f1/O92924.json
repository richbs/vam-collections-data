The blade is signed \u2018Fujiwara Kazuhide saku kore o\u2019 (\u2018Fujiwara Kazuhide made this\u2019) and \u2018Man\u2019en gannen hachi gatsu hi\u2019 (\u2018a day in the eighth month of the first year of Man\u2019en\u2019), equivalent to 1860, when the Man\u2019en period began. It is typical of a sword of the period and was probably made especially for the gift at the request of the shogun and his advisors. The presentation of the gift was discussed from about 1859, so the date of 1860 on the sword seems to fit well with this theory. \n\nAn interesting aspect to this sword is that it has never been repolished, as has so often happened with other Japanese swords, especially those of greater age. Consequently it displays the exact taste of the period for the final polish of a sword and reveals something of the development and styles of Japanese swords.\n\n\nThis slung long sword (tachi) was given to the V&A in 1865 having originally been given to Queen Victoria as part of a diplomatic gift from the last but one shogun of Japan, Tokugawa Iemochi.
