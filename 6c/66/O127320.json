His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nSheridan\u2019s The School for Scandal (1777) was first performed at the Det Ny Theatre, Copenhagen in 1958.  Directed by Sam Besekow and featuring  Bodil Kjer as Lady Teazle and Olaf Ussing as Sir Oliver Surface, the production received critical acclaim.   Messel\u2019s exuberant pastiche of eighteenth century period style was well suited to the artificiality and wit of Sheridan\u2019s comedy of manners.\n\nMessel designed a colourful and lighthearted costume for Sir Benjamin Backbite.  According to Messel\u2019s notes, the breeches and waistcoat would be made from \u2018Velveteen dyed to special dark purply mushroom\u2019.",
