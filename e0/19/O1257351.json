Turquerie began to appear not only in fashion, interiors and painting but also entered the realms of literature, theatre and opera. Despite never having visited the Levant, artists like Carle Van Loo made a speciality of representing interiors with western women depicted as sultanas at their toilette, and often at their  looms or embroidery frames. This woman has the coiffed and powdered hair, and pale complexion, of a European beauty in fancy dress.",
