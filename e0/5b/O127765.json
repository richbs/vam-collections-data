Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"",

            "historical_context_note": "This painting was executed by an anonymous artist in the style of Patrick Nasmyth in 1831, the year in which Nasmyth died. At the back of the painting is a label which reads, \u2018View near Norwood, Surrey, with wagon passing along the Road in the Distance\u2019. Patrick Nasmyth was known to have painted several views in and around Norwood, for example: <i>View nr Norwood Watermill, Carshalton</i> (Fitzwilliam Museum, 1787) and <i>View from Norwood looking towards Dulwich</i>, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 and possibly exhibited later at the British Institution in 1822 (Peter Johnson and Ernle Money, <i>The Nasmyth Family of Painters</i>, see \u2018Appendix 1\u2019, 1977). \n\nIn its choice of subject matter, 505-1882 reflects closely Nasmyth\u2019s penchant for painting the immediate neighbourhood of London in which he lived, in various states of picturesque decay (Johnson and Money, p.31). It also reflects the influence on Nasmyth of 17th-century, Dutch landscape painting, particularly Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/9-82) and Meindert Hobbema (1638-1709).",
