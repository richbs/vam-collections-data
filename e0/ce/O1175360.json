            "public_access_description": "This costume was worn by the actor Henry Irving (1838-1905) when playing the role of Romeo in the 1882 production of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. \n\nBy the time Irving decided to stage Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum he was forty-four and his leading lady, Ellen Terry (1847-1928) was only nine years younger. As such neither performer seemed a wise choice for the young lovers at the centre of the tragedy. Although many members of the press ridiculed Irving for his ambition to play a youthful Romeo initial sales were good, and the Prince and Princess of Wales were amongst the audience when the play opened on the 8th of March 1882. \n\nThe production ran for twenty four weeks (160 performances) and received widespread praise for the staging, establishing the Lyceum\u2019s reputation for spectacular Shakespearian productions. It was briefly revived at the beginning of the following season, but, as critics remarked, neither the temperament nor the appearance of Irving suited the dashing hero, and the play soon vanished from the Lyceum repertoire.\n\nHenry Irving became a professional actor in 1856, and learnt his trade in regional theatres until 1866, when he came to London.  In 1871 he joined the Lyceum Theatre company under the management of H. L. Bateman.  Irving remained at the Lyceum until 1902, taking over the management of the theatre in 1878, thereby achieving the status of an \"actor-manager\".  At the Lyceum, Irving produced a range of plays both old and new, including melodrama, Shakespeare, historical drama, and literary adaptations.  He worked tirelessly to raise the status of the Theatre profession both in the view of the public and among official bodies, especially religious organisations.  His success in this field was recognised in 1895, when he became the first actor to receive a knighthood for services to the Theatre.\n\nMany of Irving's productions were spectacularly staged with large casts of performers.  He created desired effects of colour and movement using scenery, costume and lighting, set to music appropriate to the action, played by a full orchestra.  Although from the 1880s electric lighting was available for theatres, Irving always used gas, as well as lime-light (a form of spot-lighting).  Gas lighting gave a softer appearance to the general stage picture, whilst lime-light could be used to highlight Irving as the focus of attention at key points in the play.  Outside of London, Irving toured complete productions, taking the full London company, scenery and costumes, throughout the United Kingdom and also across the United States and Canada.  His was the first generation that could do this through the rapid development of the railway system.",
