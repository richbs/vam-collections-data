The pattern of scrolling stems bearing flowers and fruits is typical of embroidery design in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  \n\nUntil the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.",
