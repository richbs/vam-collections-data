In the portrait Elizabeth I is dressed in the fashin of the late 1590's in the Queen's colours - white for virginity and black for constancy.  She wears a black velvet gown covered in pearls and jewels and a spectacular stomacher and petticoat featuring flowers, birds and sea monsters.  The skirt and stomacher are thought to have been a gift to the Queen from Bess of Hardwick, the pattern of flowers and beasts is both symbolic and reflects an interest in the wider, more exotic world gleaned from Elizabethan exploration.  The Marvic studio has taken many of the floral elements, eglantines, pinks, pansies and irises, from the original embroidery and added contemporary motifs.  The strawberries, dragonflies and butterflies celebrate the relative peace, freedom and environmental awareness of the second Elizabethan age.",

            "historical_context_note": "In celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's Jubilee Year, Marvic Textiles launched a new upholstery fabric entitled Elizabeth.  The inspiration behind the design is the ornate skirt in a portrait of Elizabeth I which hangs in Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire.  In the portrait Elizabeth I is dressed in the fashin of the late 1590's in the Queen's colours - white for virginity and black for constancy.  She wears a black velvet gown covered in pearls and jewels and a spectacular stomacher and petticoat featuring flowers, birds and sea monsters.  The skirt and stomacher are thought to have been a gift to the Queen from Bess of Hardwick, the pattern of flowers and beasts is both symbolic and reflects an interest in the wider, more exotic world gleaned from Elizabethan exploration.  The Marvic studio has taken many of the floral elements and birds from the petticoat to create a lampas redolent of the original embroidery with symbols to celebrate the second Elizabethan age.",
