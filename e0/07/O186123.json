During his career, he worked first as an Actor, but then as a Theatre Director, Designer and Wood Engraver. He is often viewed as a pioneer of modern stage craft whose influence has shaped theatre techniques and performance today.\n\nWhile still working as an actor, Craig met artist and designer James Pryde on a train. This was his introduction to print-making. Pryde's brother-in-law William Nicholson subsequently taught Craig the technique of wood-engraving. \n\nWhile Pryde and Nicholson found fame as poster makers under the name the 'Beggarstaff Brothers', Craig - who enjoyed the challenge of wood-engraving - created works of art for pleasure as well as commercial gain. He exhibited and sold prints throughout his life to generate income, but more importantly he used them as a means of exploring and disseminating his revolutionary ideas about the theatre. \n\nUsing the controlled practices of wood-cutting, wood-engraving and etching, as well as freer techniques such as watercolour, Craig investigated the core elements of dramatic art: movement, light, space and the performers.",
