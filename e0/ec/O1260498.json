He attended the Bradford Regional College of Art from 1950 to 1957 .  Oxtoby has captured Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Roger Daltrey, Stevie Wonder, and Mick Jagger to name but a few. Most of them painted from collections of photographs rather than from life. Oxtoby said \"I try not to meet them, I don't want to spoil my image of them\".\n\nRichard Starkey, or Ringo Starr (b.1940), was a highly respected drummer on the Liverpool beat music scene when he joined The Beatles in 1962. The drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, he first played with The Beatles when they were in Hamburg. The other Beatles encouraged their manager Brian Epstein to replace Pete Best with Ringo, and his slightly off-beat drumming following the singer's lead became a key element in The Beatles' sound. Ringo discovered a talent for acting whilst in The Beatles' films A Hard Day's Night and Help!, and went on to make films with Peter Sellers, Mae West and David Essex. He became well known as the most popular voice for the televised cartoon Thomas the Tank Engine, and continues touring with his All Starr Band.",
