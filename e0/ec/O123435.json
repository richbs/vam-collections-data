            "public_access_description": "The earliest porcelain figures were made for the dessert course of grand dinners and replaced the sugar paste and wax figures made since medieval times for royal feasts. Originally intended as expressions of dynastic power and to celebrate political allegiances, allegorical themes had been introduced into these table settings by the 16th century. By the 18th century many were entirely decorative. Meissen in Germany was the first factory to make porcelain figures for the dessert. It set the sculptural conventions followed by porcelain factories elsewhere.\n\nIn the 1760s, at the Chelsea, Bow and Derby factories, porcelain figures acquired a leafy bower or \u2018bocage\u2019 and moved from the table to the mantelpiece where they have remained. This figure, one of a \u2018Pair of Moors\u2019, was produced at Derby around 1770-75. It depicts a black woman in richly decorated clothes wearing a headdress to which three feathers are attached. Her right arm is raised and she holds an apple in her right hand. Black Africans offered exotic associations and were a marker of luxury within the English home. In the 18th century about 10,000 Africans are estimated to have been living in England. Many worked as, often unpaid, domestic staff.",
