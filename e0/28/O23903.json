The pointed end is bound with black satin and has a border of blue satin stitch embroidered in a floral pattern. One side is made of very dark blue satin and has a design of flowering stems worked in gold thread, green silk and seed-pearls, rising from a series of scallop forms worked in gold thread couched with red and green silk. The other side is made of red material entirely covered with a background of gold thread couched in rows of loops with red, except for the area nearest the border which has a series of scallop forms in couched gold thread and green silk. On the gold background is worked a design of a dragon, its body head and eyes worked in seed-pearls, amongst clouds worked in shades of pink, red, mauve, blue and green. At the top of the smaller end of the ribbon and on the border of the pointed end are small loops for attaching the ribbon to the cap.",
