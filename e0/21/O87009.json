It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nAmerican-born Godfrey Tearle was raised in England and made his first stage appearance as a child at Burnley in 1893 as the young Duke of York in Richard III. He began his acting career in earnest in 1899 with his father's company. He made his first London stage appearance in 1906 at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, and went on to become one of the most respected character actors on the stage in Britain, and universally known from his parts in numerous films. The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse came to the Comedy Theatre in February 1938 after its out-of-London tour, and it was made into a film the same year with Edward G. Robinson as the psychiatrist Dr Clitterhouse and Humphrey Bogart as his accomplice in crime, 'Rocks' Valentine.",
