The foot is made up of a network of cast C-scrolls and S-scrolls soldered together, with puncutuating granules and rosettes with fretted edges at regular intervals. A small cast hexagonal abacus separates the foot from the stem. The openwork stem is similarly made up of cast elements soldered together with a reinforcing silver-gilt pole down the centre. The shell is held by two straps: one is a cast female figure with a bowl of fruit on her head, the other a female bust. Hinges connect the straps to the gold band that forms a lip round the edge of the shell. The lip has a burnished, profiled moulding and a row of hatched stylised leaf section holding the shell. The lid has a border which is chased and matted with flattened gadroons. The centre of the lid is openwork made up of similar C-scrolls and reverse C-scrolls to the stem and foot, and with slightly larger rosettes alternating with the granules. The same small hexagonal moulding separates it from the finial, a bunch of branches and foliage emerging from an arrangement of brackets and beaded scrolls.",
