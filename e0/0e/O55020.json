The design, based on a Roman marble tripod table purchased by Hope in Rome in the late 1790\u2019s, was published in Hope\u2019s Household Furniture and Interior Decoration in 1807.  In the publication it is described as a \u2018tripod table supported by chimaeras\u2019 (chimeras were mythical creatures with lion's head, goat's body and serpent's tail).\n\nThis stand and its pair are thought to have been at Clumber Park, a large house in Nottinghamshire which has now been demolished.  It is possible that the stands came to be at Clumber because they once belonged to Hope\u2019s descendant, the 5th Duke of Newcastle, owner of Clumber Park.",
