The two seams and the edges have been decorated witha woven silk and silver braid and the whole has been edged with blue fabric.  A finely pleated and starched cotton (or possibly linen) frill has been roughly tacked along the inside edge.  A long (159 cm x 9 cm) blue silk ribbon has been pinned to the lower  right hand side of the bonnet. It is patterned with a small black flower against a white sprig. Fine silk and silver braid has been looped to form a chain.  Two lengths of this have been stitched along the top and sides of the bonnet and form six long (18 cm) loops along the lower back edge.  They have been divided into two groups of three by two long chains (28 cm) each ending in a tassel.",
