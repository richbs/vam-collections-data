The neckline is crossed over and there is a bow at the nape of the neck. Despite its simplicity, the expensive fabric, quality finish, and couturier name meant a high price-tag of 42 guineas. Beaded evening dresses, such as a dress called 'Fougere' in the Museum's collection (see T.139-1998), cost even more.\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R.L.Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes went to high-end London boutiques. This particular design, 'Tessa', had a wholesale price of 25 guineas (\u00a326.25), with \u00a32.13 tax.",

Salmon Ltd. This was a London dress manufacturer who acquired exclusive rights to make and sell the couturier Jacques Heim's designs in London from 1957. In most instances, R.L. Salmon Ltd used the French fabrics that Heim recommended, and Heim always approved the end product.\n\nThe fabrics for this particular design are in the design book dated Autumn 1967, attached to the sketch for \"Tessa\", number 3253. A price list also exists; this dress was available at a wholesale price of 25 guineas, with tax of 2.13, and suggested retail of 41 and a half guineas. The price list identifies the fabric as being made by Staron.",
