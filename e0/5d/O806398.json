            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter, <u>Italian Drawings Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 133-134. The following is the full text of the entry: CORNACCHINI, AGOSTINO (1683-1740 994 Design for a cornice Inscribed in a 17th century hand 'Cornacchini in Casa Gabburi di stucco' Pen and ink and wash over black chalk 8 7/8 x 13 1/2 (225 x 342) 8638G PROVENANCE F. M. N. Gabburri; given by Miss Georgiana Lornlin, 1880 Notwithstanding the inscription, the drawing was formerly catalogued anonymously. Francesco Maria Niccolo Gabburri (1675-1742), one of the most respected collectors of his day, was a patron of Cornacchini and wrote a short biography of him. The manuscript is in the Biblioteca Nazionale at Florence and has been published in English by H. Keutner in the <i>North Carolina Museum of Art Bulletin</i>, 2, pp. 37-42. Gabburri states there that he commissioned the sculptor to execute in his Florentine home 'various stucco decorations, which were praised by his patron and by all professional artists and connoisseurs'. This was some time before 1712, when Gabburri took his protege to Rome. The house, according to Keutner, was the former Palazzo Giuntini, Via Ghibellina 30. The decorations were defaced when the house was altered 1820-30. A catalogue of Gabburri's drawings made in 1722 shows that he had some 25 drawings by Cornacchini. Item no. 52 in the third volume, which may possibly refer to our drawing, reads: 'Due disegni a penna e acquerello, uno per traverso, soldi 12, alto 8, fatto per l'ornato di una camera terrena in casa il sig. Cav. Gabburri, l'altro etc ... ' (G. Campori, <i>Raccolta di cataloghi ed inventari inediti</i>, Modena, 1870, p. 584). For more on Gabburri see Lugt, Supplement 2992b and the preface of a catalogue of a collection of Fra Bartolommeo drawings formerly in Gabburri's possession sold anonymously at Sotheby, 20 November 1957. The British Museum has a design of a capital and two masks in pen and ink by the same hand (1906-31-2: photo: Gernsheim 2711 and 2712). It is inscribed in 134 Cornacchini - Creti an old hand: 'Agostino Cornacchini fece in (word missing) per Casa Gabburri. 1713.' This is doubtless the drawing of a capital and some masks listed on p. 29, vol 3 of Gabburri's collection (Campori, op. cit., p. 583). On the back is a design of a console table, similar in manner, though done in black chalk. The City Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham, has a drawing of Judith and Holofernes that may be attributed to Cornacchini because it is connected with a bronze by him in the same museum. But this drawing is in a different manner, being elaborately and minutely worked. It is possible that Cornacchini had a careful as well as a hasty manner.",
