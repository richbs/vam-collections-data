It forms part of a matching bride-groom's outfit, which in addition to this jacket consists of an overcoat, waistcoat, underjacket, undertrousers, leg ties, belt, boots and a hat. When worn, the off-white collar of the underjacket is clearly visible and with its diagonal, right-sided closure, it delicately contrasts with the oval neckline of the jacket. \n\nThe jacket is closed in the front with two spherical buttons in gilded and enamelled metal openwork, which are decorated with longevity symbols. Korean costumes are normally tied with ribbons, buttons traditionally only being used on formal wear. Nowadays, buttons are also seen on men's, and occasionally women's, jackets and waistcoats worn on important occasions, such as weddings and birthdays.",
