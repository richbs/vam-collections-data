ISBN 1851770712.\n'The basic hard white earthenware 'Kilta' range was launched in 1952 by Kaj Franck and issued in a limited range of colours - white, black, green, blue and yellow. In the post-war austerity years the range was intended as an inexpensive basic choice which would - and did - become standard everyday ware in many Finnish homes. It was designed to be once-fired, keeping production costs to a minimum. Franck used basic geometric forms - squares, spheres or hemispheres, cylinders, cones, etc. Some of the shapes could be used for different purposes. The small dish, for instance, could also act as a saucer for the cup. He intended that the individual items should be anonymous enough to be used in any combinations and with designs other than the 'Kilta' series. The series also included hemispherical bowl, not acquired by the Museum. In addition, the factory produced new or separate shapes by Franck, which were not part of the 'Kilta' series, and also some by others in the design team such as Ulla Procop\u00e9 (see cat. No. 147) [Circ. 45&A-1964], using the 'Kilta' glazes and marketing these with the 'Kilta' range. In 1981 the range was completely reworked by Franck and reissued as 'Teema' (cat. No. 174) [C. 48&A-1988].\n\nThis set was originally on loan to the Museum's Department of Circulation which arranged a travelling exhibition of Scandinavian ceramics in 1957. The initial selection was made in Finmar, the retailers for Finnish and other Scandinavian products, by Hugh Wakefield of the Museum with advice from Professor H.O. Gummerus of the Konstflitf\u00f6reningen, Helsinki.'",
