They were placed on the table as tea was served and were therefore decorated in a variety of fashionable styles.\n\nOwnership & Use\nTea was a popular drink even in middle-income households in the later 18th century although the price was high owing to import restrictions and duties.  Tea canisters had locks to safeguard the valuable tea. All tea came from China until 1839 when Indian tea began to be imported. This canister has two compartments inside to keep different types of tea apart. Black teas were Bohea, Congou and Souchong, and the more expensive green teas Singlo or Hyson.  Blending the teas was an essential part of the tea-making ritual.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis metal tea canister is hexagonal, a popular shape for canisters and the angled sides would have shown off the sparkling effect of the metal in the incised patterns and the gold  stars, border patterns and lozenge shapes. The inside is lined with metal foil.",
