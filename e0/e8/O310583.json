Hering was born in Kaufbeuren to the goldsmith, Michael Hering (d. 1490).  His early training was in Augsburg with the sculptor, Hans Beierlein, and he later was employed in the workshop of Jacob Murmann.  He likely moved to Eichst\u00e4tt between 1512 and 1515, where he established a large and profitable independent workshop, and was also charged with a number of important civic positions. According to Chipps Smith, he was 'the most prolific and financially successful German sculptor of the period' (1994, 57) and he regularly received commissions from important clerical and noble patrons. He specialised in tombs and epitaphs made from the local fine-grained solnhofen limestone, and his most well-known sculpture is the monument to St Willibald at Eichst\u00e4tt Cathedral.\n\nWhile many of Hering's small-scale reliefs of secular subjects and nudes were closely dependent on prints by Albrecht Durer, Hans Baldung, and Lucas Cranach, the dynamic poses and fanciful draperies and headresses of the female figures in these escutcheons are independent inventions.",
