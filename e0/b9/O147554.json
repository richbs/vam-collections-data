These were the Council medal, the Prize medal, the Exhibitors medal, the Jurors medal and the Services medal.  \nThe exhibition was divided into thirty classes, with juries appointed for each. Exhibitors showing remarkable originality were rewarded by receiving the Council medal, given by members of the Council following the recommendations of the Jury. Over 170 Council medals were awarded to exhibitors, with their name and class engraved around the edge. \nSets comprising all five medals were offered to the Commissioners, the governments of the participating countries, and a number of senior officials. As this medal does not bear the name of an exhibitor to its edge, it probably formed part of one such set.\nThe medals were housed in a presentation box bound in red leather with heavy brass hinges and clasps with gilt tooling and lined with blue velvet and watered silk. The silk inside the lid is inscribed with gold lettering naming the recipient\n\nWilliam Wyon, the Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint, produced the design for the obverse of the medal, presenting conjoined heads of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The reverse was chosen by a competition open to international artists. The winning entry, designed by Hippolyte Bonnardel of Paris, depicts Britannia crowning Mercury and Industry with a laurel wreath.",
