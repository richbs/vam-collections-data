We see the mountain from the Kiyomigaseki Barrier, looking across Miho Bay with its famous grove of pine trees. The Barrier was located on the Tokaido Highway between the 17th and 18th post-stations of Okitsu and Ejiri in Shizuoka Prefecture. Kiyomigaskei was an old barrier station set up as part of the provisions of the Taika Reforms in the 7th century. It subsequently fell into disuse and was absorbed into the grounds of the nearby Seikenji Temple. However, its name survived because of its proximity to the Miho pine grove and its poetic literary associations. Hiroshige has considerably skewed the topography for this composition, as did other artists who depicted this area. If we were actually at the site of the Barrier looking towards Mount Fuji, the Miho pine grove would be well out of sight to the right.",
