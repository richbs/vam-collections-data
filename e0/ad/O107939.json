The viewer\u2019s eye is drawn to sunlit snow-covered mountains in the distance and on the right-hand side. Bourne writes about the difficulty of photographing this landscape: 'In taking views of snow, unless you get broad masses of it well lit up by the sun, it does not \"come out\" in the photograph with that purity which conveys the impression of snow.\u2019",

Below is a  section in which he talks about the difficulty of photogrpahing snow on the mountains: \n\nIn taking views of snow, unless you get broad masses of it well lit up by the sun, it does not \u2018come out\u2019 in the photograph with that purity which conveys the impression of snow\u2019.\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, March 4 1870, pg 98.",
