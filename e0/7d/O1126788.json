The form of this layette was to last for almost a hundred and fifty years, and the long gown, having been previously associated with rituals such as Christening or Circumcision, became daily wear.  The baby was freed from swaddling, but enveloped in more and heavier garments than previously: binder, nappy, pilch or nappy cover, shirt or vest, two caps, bodice, barracoat (flannel wrapper), petticoats, gown, cape or shawl, bib or pinafore, socks and shoes.  Mass production techniques introduced during the 19th century created increasing consumer choice, and led to the abandoning of much of the exquisite but labour-intensive embroidery and finishing of the garments which had previously characterised infants' clothing.",
