            "historical_context_note": "Artus Quellinus (1609-1668) is considered to be the greatest Flemish sculptor of the Baroque period. His sculpture was strongly influenced by Northern classicism, and his nude sculptures reveal his familiarity with the art of Peter Paul Rubens, and that of the sculptural school which surrounded him, including the artists Hans van Mildert and Lucas Faydherbe. After early training with his father, Erasmus Quellinus (1584-1640), in 1634 he travelled to Italy to work in the studio of Fran\u00e7ois du Quesnoy (1594-1643), a Flemish sculptor working in Rome. \n\nQuellinus returned to Antwerp by 1639, and in 1648, he was commissioned to design decorations for the fa\u00e7ades, walls, ceilings, and chimney pieces of the new Amsterdam Stadhius (now the Royal Palace), which was constructed by the architect Jacob van Campen (1595-1657). Quellinus' assistants included Rombout Berhults, Gabriel Grupello, Bartolomeus Eggers, and Artus Quellinus II, his first cousin. \n\nThe Amsterdam city council envisioned that the Dam Square surrounding the new Stadhuis would rival the Campus Martius in ancient Rome and the Piazza San Marco in Venice in physical grandeur. The paintings and sculptures in the Stadhuis would represent allegorical glorifications of Amsterdam's republican-minded government, and they would be based on the Bible and on texts by Livy and Cicero. Schoten writes that Quellinus' programme symbolised 'peace, prosperity, and Amsterdam's pivotal position in the world' (2010, 15). \n\nThe present sculpture is from the galleries leading to the Burgerzaal (the offices of government officials), and is one of eight reliefs of the earth and planets depicted as Roman gods. These are considered to be among the most refined sculptures produced by Quellinus and his assistants.",
