It was the first men's boutique to open in the Carnaby Street area and traded in sophisticated European styles. Vince quickly became popular with actors and models.  John Stephen started work there as a shop assistant in the early 1950s and saw the potential popularity of more exuberant menswear for the mainstream youth market. Building on what he had learned at Vince, he had opened four shops in Carnaby Street by 1962 and established the area as the heart of youthful, informal fashions. The colourful clothes, cheap prices and fast turn-over of styles instigated a turning point in British menswear fashion and retailing.",
