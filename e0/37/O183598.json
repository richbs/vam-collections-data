Starring Joseph Grimaldi as Squire Bugle and Clown, with Jack Bologna as Colin and Harlequin, this pantomime was a great hit, running for 69 nights and assuring the supremacy of the character Clown in pantomime above that of  its previous favourite Harlequin.\n\nSamuel Simmons was a lifelong member of the company at Covent Garden Theatre after he played his first adult role there in November 1796 as Momus in O'Keefe's Olympus in an Uproar.He made his first appearance on the London stage as the boy actor Master Simmons when he played the Duke of York in Cibber's Richard 111 at the Haymarket Theatre in September 1789.  A diminutive actor, he was nicknamed 'Little Simmons' and coined the catchphrase 'What do you think of that, eh?'",
