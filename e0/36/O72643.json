The 'Babu' is sporting 'Albert' hair-style, after the Prince Consort and suitably dressed for the period. He is completely under her influence, so much so that she can walk all over him. A parallel is drawn between Goddess Kali trampling over prostrate Shiva.",

Distinguished by his parted, 'Albert' hair-cut (so named after the Prince Consort), the Babu is being trodden on by the courtesan who has enthralled him in a manner reminiscent of the iconography of Kali standing on the prostrate Shiva, see no.115.\n\nPublished: W.G.

By the 1830s, artists had arrived from rural villages in Bengal and began to produce paintings that reflected local history, mythology, customs and conflicts of a colonised society. As a popular art form, these artists are recognised for their use of brilliant colour, simplified images and swift brushstrokes that became the hallmark of Kalighat painting in the 19th and early 20th century.",
