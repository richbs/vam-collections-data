The original figurine by Albert Toft was reproduced in white metal, and as a porcelain figurine issued by Royal Doulton in 1913. \n\nWilliam Sydney Penley (1851-1912), a boy chorister at the Savoy Chapel, first appeared on stage in 1875 in the original production of Trial By Jury.  He made his name as Reverend Robert Spalding in The Private Secretary at London's Globe Theatre, 1884 and was associated with this part until 1892 when he produced Charley's Aunt at Bury St Edmunds.  He starred as Lord Fancourt Babberley, the luncheon guest who finds himself obliged to impersonate Charley's aunt from Brazil, 'where the nuts come from'.  It was produced at the Royalty Theatre in London that December, transferred to the Globe in 1893 and was a huge success, achieving the record-breaking run of its day of 1,466 performances.  Several different souvenirs were produced as mementos of the play in general, and Penley as Charley's Aunt in particular.",
