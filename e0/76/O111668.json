Hull Grundy and Mrs. Ann Hull Grundy, in 1978.\n\nHistorical significance: This medal was the winning entry of a competition sponsored by the Goldsmith's Company for a medal commemorating the exhibition; it was used as the official award medal for exhibitors and was presented unnamed. The original concept of a series of awards and competitions connected with the exhibition lay with the Royal Mint and the resultant matt finish and dark toning of this and some other medals connected with the event are due to a series of experiments that were being carried out by the Royal Mint at the time. The two engraver employed for this medal also engraved coinage dies for Great Britain and the colonies. The bust of the King used here is the same as that used on the colonial coins.",
