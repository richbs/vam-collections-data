Copied works by George Morland, and studied watercolour painting with John Varley. Entered RA Schools 1805. Associated with William Henry Hunt, William Mulready, Dr Thomas Monro, and later William Blake. In a long and prolific career, he exhibited 176 works at the RA between 1807 and 1881, 91 at the BI 1808-59, and 52 watercolours at the OWS (Member 1812, Treasurer 1817). Subjects mainly portraits up to the late 1840s, then landscapes. Worked also in engraving, etching and mezzotint. Surprisingly, he submitted his name unsuccessfully for election to ARA 1821, and withdrew 1842; the RA later offered him membership, which he refused. Died Redhill, Surrey, 20 January 1882; a memorial exhibition was held at the RA 1882-3. Three of his sons (James Thomas, William, and John junior) were also artists, and his daughter married Samuel Palmer. \nLIT: \tRedgrave Cent; Art]oumal1882, p262 (obit); A T Story Life ofJohn Linnell 2  vols, 1892 \n\nOn the Beach Near Cullercoats, Northumberland \nP58-1980 \nPaper, 16.1\u00d7 22.8 cm (6 3/8 \u00d7 8\u00be ins) \nPurchased 1980 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
