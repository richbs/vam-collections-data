Arrested during the Revolution he was tried and executed by guillotine on 21st January 1793. \n\nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, low relief portraits in wax became popular in Britain and they were often exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Society of Artists and elsewhere. Waxes were used in a similar way to prints and medals, in order to disseminate the image of the sitter, or, like miniature paintings or silhouettes as portable mementoes. \n\nThe finishing on this portrait is astoundingly detailed. The process of making a portrait in wax would begin with a model in plasticine or soft wax which would be worked using ivory or wooden tools in much the same way as a model in clay. A plaster mould would then be made and molten wax poured into it. The relief would be hand-finished by the artist.  \n\nThis portrait is the work of Edward Coffin, an English Sculptor who exhibited wax portraits at the Royal Academy from 1783 to 1803.",
