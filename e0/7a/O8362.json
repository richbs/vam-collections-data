This washstand, designed by him, epitomises how he thought furniture should look. Brightly painted, using rich materials and with complex fitments and references to literature and myth, the washstand was nonetheless highly functional. It has a water tank in the upper castellated section with a tap. The marble basin, inlaid with silver fish motifs, is fitted with a tap in the form of a bronze animal. The basin swivels so that the dirty water can be tipped into a bucket in the cupboard below.\n\nPlaces\nThe Tower House, in Melbury Road, London, was the home of  Burges from 1878 until his death in 1881. He designed every aspect of the house himself. The outside of the house was in the Reformed Gothic style, while the inside was decorated in the most elaborate fashion. This washstand was made for the Guest Chamber, of which a visitor wrote, 'The whole chamber is like an ancient shrine or reliquary'.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Burges was an architect as well as a designer of furniture, metalwork and jewellery. His most important projects include Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, near Cardiff, in Wales. His style was heavily influenced by medieval art. He never married, was a freemason and a collector of armour, and was described by the wife of his patron as 'ugly Burges who designs lovely things'.",
