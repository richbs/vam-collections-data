            "public_access_description": "This is probably a plaster model for the statue of General Napier erected in Trafalgar Square in 1855, although it varies from the finished work in some details. The statue was heavily criticised in the Art Journal in 1862, where it was suggested that it was 'perhaps the worst piece of sculpture in England', casting shame on 'those committees who thus indecently expose their freshly dead friends to public animadversion'. Six years earlier another magazine, The Builder, had been only slightly less harsh: 'Simplicity and breadth characterise the treatment, and these are admirable qualities. We must, nevertheless, be permitted to say, rather with reference to works to follow than to this, that carried to extremes, especially in bronze, these qualities result in baldness and insipidity.'\n\nThe plaster model was made by George Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898), who was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. \n\nThe model was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.\n\nGeneral Sir Charles James Napier was a British general and Commander- in- Chief in India, famous for conquering Sindh province in present day Pakistan.",
