We know that the page was once part of a bound volume because three of the four edges of the sheet have been gilded. The textile designer James Mitten (1812-54) once owned this drawings in the early 19th century. He probably used them as source material when designing floral and foliage patterns.\n\nHerbals were concerned with how plants could be used medicinally rather than how they could be identified and the illustrations were secondary to the authoritative text. The study of bladder-senna with its inflated seed pods is accurate enough to identify the plant and shows how botanical illustrators were moving from using existing images as sources to studying directly from nature.",
