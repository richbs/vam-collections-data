After an outstanding career as a student, Breuer was made Master in charge of the carpentry workshop in 1925. He left the Bauhaus in 1927, going on to work as an architect in Germany, Switzerland and other European countries. During this period he designed buildings, interiors, exhibtions and furniture, including some of the most innovative and important tubular steel furniture of the 20th century.\n\nAfter the Bauhaus was closed by the Nazis in 1933, Breuer never returned to Berlin. With difficulty, and with the assistance of Walter Gropius and others, Breuer emigrated to Britain in 1935. As one of the conditions under which he was allowed to emigrate, he founded the architectural partnership Breuer and Yorke with F.R.S. Yorke before arriving in England. \n\nBreuer was commissioned to work on the Ventris flat while at Breuer and Yorke. The flat was in Highpoint, an ultra-modern block designed by the Russian emigre architect Berthold Lubetkin. Mrs Ventris hired Breuer to design the flat's interior, in which he used specially designed free-standing and built-in furniture to organize the space. Sycamore-veneered plywood was used throughout the flat, tying the space together with its distinctive colour and surface.",
