            "history_note": "The subject matter has never been fully explained.  Hans Baldung (1485-1545) had an interest in magic and the supernatural which is evident in his other woodcuts. In this scene the witch appears to have worked her magic through the horse whose kick has rendered the groom unconcious.  It has been noted that a book illustration of a similar theme appears as an allegory of anger in Petrarch's 'De remediis utriusque fortunae' which was first published in German in Augsburg in 1532 (Bartrum 1995, p80).  In this, a witch goads a donkey to gallop away while the rider attempts to restrain him. Baldung's coat of arms appears on the wall behind the groom, who bears a facial resemblance to the artist. Bartrum suggests that some autobiographical reference appears to have been intended and that the general effect is of a pessimistic view of man, or perhaps Baldung himself, who is ultimately unable to resist the superior and malevolent forces. \n\nBartrum argues that Baldung designed this woodcut with its unusual subject as a form of commentary on Albrecht D\u00fcrer's 'Large Horse' and that he intended viewers to make their comparison with what was by that date a famous print (Bartrum 2002, p231). Baldung has used a similar rear view of a horse to that produced by D\u00fcrer. However Baldung's horse is evidently a much angrier creature.\n\nHistorical significance: This is one of the last prints that Baldung produced before he died. It is one of his most famous woodcuts.",

            "historical_context_note": "Baldung was born in south-west Germany and probably recieved his early apprenticeship in either Strasbourg or Swabia. He probably worked as a journeyman with Albrecht D\u00fcrer in Nuremberg from 1503 to circa 1507. Baldung's interest in magic and witchcraft, evident in this print, reflected contemporary fears and social unrest arising from the Reformation. In 1517 Baldung returned to Strasbourg.  From 1533 to 1545 he was an unpaid magistrate of his guild in that city. The Reformation arrived in Strasbourg circa 1530.",
