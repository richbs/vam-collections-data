Everett Millais provided eighteen drawings to illustrate The Moxon Tennyson (1857), one of the most lavishly decorated Pre-Raphaelites poetry books; another drawing by Millais in the V&A collection (D.218-1903) belongs to the same group. The present sheet was engraved by William James Linton (1812-1898); an impression of the engraving is also in the V&A (E. 2852-1914). This image illustrates a passage from the poem A Dream of Fair Women by Alfred Tennyson (1809-1892) in which he describes the Egyptian queen Cleopatra opening her robe to reveal that she has poisoned herself with a bite from an asp.\nPoetry books of the time were initially printed without illustrations, and only those that were considered profitable were printed in luxuriously embellished editions. Interestingly, the death in 1858 of the publisher of the Tennyson volume, Edward Moxon who died at the age of 57, was attributed by some to the anxiety caused by the cost of this enterprise.",
