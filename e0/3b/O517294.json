The relevant text is as follows: TARSIA, BARTOLOMEO (1711-65) 1184 Design for a ceiling painting: the Virgin and Child in glory, worhsipped by a saint and a bishop; with the towers and dome of a twon below Pen and ink and wash, squared in black chalk 15 \u00bd x 7 7/8 (394 x 199) CAI.384 PROVENANCE J. Auldjo (Lugt 48 twice); Ionides Beques 1901 (Lugt 488) LITERATURE <i>Ionides Catalogue</i>, p. 14 (as by G. B. Tiepolo); G. Knox, <i>Catalogue of the Teipolo drawaings in the Victoria and Albert Museum</i>, 1960, p. 95, no. 330 (possibly by Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo); second edition, 1975, no. 331 (the attribution to Tarsia tentatively accepted) It is hard to see the hand of any of the Tiepolos in this drawings. Mr Wynne Jeudwine suggested the new attribution, comparing the drawing with five other ceiling designs by Tarsia. One of them is in the Hermitage, Leningrad (Larissa Salmina, <i>Disegni Veneti del museo di Leningrado</i>, Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice, 1964, no. 77, with illustration) and the other four, coloured in tempera, are in the Correr Museum, Venice (T. Pignatti, <i>Disegni veneti del settecento nel Museu Correr</i>, Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice, 1964, no. 30, with illustration). They are all five designs for the frescoes that Tarsia painted in the Petershof Palace at St Petersburg in 1750. They are like our drawing in many ways and betray the same incapacity, surprising in a ceiling painter of that period, at representing the scenes <i>di sotto in su</i>.",
