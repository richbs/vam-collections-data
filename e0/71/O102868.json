Fowke, a Royal Engineer, was Secretary of the British Commission for the exhibition and was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour for his work. He was then made an inspector in the newly formed Department of Science and Art and worked closely with Henry Cole on the development of the V&A and designed all its early buildings as well as the Royal Museum in Edinburgh, the Albert Hall and the building for the Great Exhibition of 1862.\n\nThe original owner of these medals, Captain Fowke of the Royal Engineers, became a distinguished official architect in the middle of the Victorian era, and published a number of related papers. In 1857 he became an inspector in the Science and Art Department in London; in 1860 was added the office of architect and engineer; while in 1862 he was appointed Superintendent of the construction of the South Kensington (now Victoria and Albert) Museum. He designed the new Museum of Science and Art (now the Royal Scottish Museum) Edinburgh, as well as extensions at the National Gallery, Dublin. He planned the buildings for the International Exhibition of 1862. Shortly before his death he designed the Royal Albert Hall.",
