            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nIn the 1830s the folding parasol was introduced, with a hinged central stick allowing it to be collapsed when not in use. A compact parasol had become essential as they were often on display during cramped carriage rides. This dome-shaped example is hinged just above the carved ivory handle and is held in place by a sliding brass tube. Much of the ivory carving, widely used for parasols, was imported from China, its quality and quantity went into decline during the 1840s due to mass production and the Opium wars. Restrained shades of green and brown silks were popular in this period, and this silk damask is typical of its time, woven in an irregular lattice pattern with a border of interlacing ellipses containing flowers and foliage. An ivory ring holds the cover closed when not in use.",
