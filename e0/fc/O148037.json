In 1965 he worked on A Hollywood Collection, a suite of prints, with master printer Ken Tyler, who ran the printmaking studio Gemini GEL. The Weather Series was the second major suite made at Gemini and in part is inspired by the representation of weather in Japanese prints. Here, four pieces of paper blown about by wind, reveal themselves to be four of the images from The Weather Series - in ascending order: rain, sun, snow and mist. The solid geometry of the road sign for Melrose Avenue (in which Gemini's studio is located), at the bottom of the image, serves to emphasise the nature of wind by providing a visual contrast.",
