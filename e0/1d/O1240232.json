            "public_access_description": "Floris Neus\u00fcss (German, born Lennep, 1937) has dedicated his whole career to extending the practice, study and teaching of  'camera-less', photogram, and experimental photography. The Latticed Window, Lacock Abbey, is among a series of pieces paying tribute to nineteenth-century pioneers of photography. The subject of the window at Lacock Abbey holds a special place in the history of photography because it is the place where, in 1835, Talbot created the first photographic negative. Talbot's Latticed Window has come to represent the genesis of photographic seeing. Like a prophetic window, it anticipated the notion that camera-made photographs are often perceived as windows on the world. This was an appropriate motif to herald a new medium that would prompt deeper questions concerning visual and philosophical perception.\n\nKnowing of the resonance of the place, and the philosophical implications of the window image, Neus\u00fcss covered the interior of the window with photographic paper at night. He exposed the paper by shining a light from outside. The resulting photogram recreates the subject of Talbot's negative, but in life size. The work is based on the idea of continuing the trajectory of Fox Talbot's camera-less photogram techniques (which he continued to use even after his discovery of the negative) and extending them to the images which - because of limitations in technology or personal inclination - Talbot was unable to capture himself.  Rendered in modern colour materials Neus\u00fcss's work is a visual and conceptual response to the iconic window.",
