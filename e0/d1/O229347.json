She recalled that this hat was a 'copy of a French model, purchased at the same time as the dress, and is characteristic of what was very smart indeed at that time'.\n\nThe milliner who made the hat, Miss Fox, was based in Hanover Square, which had been a popular address for exclusive dress makers and milliners since the late nineteenth century. In the 1920s Paris was still very much the leading fashion city and it was not unusual for milliners and dress makers to copy Parisian models of clothing.\n\nThe hat is made from fur felt moulded to shape with the side of the brim cut into a longer section to allow for the pleated detail.",
