            "historical_context_note": "The service was made to the order of Augustus III, Elector of Saxony, for Alvise IV Giovanni Mocenigo and to his wife Madame Pisana Mocenigo in recognition of their help and hospitality to. Friedrich Christian, the young Crown Prince of Saxony, on his visit to Italy in 1739-40.\n\nInformation about the service comes from letters written by Joseph Gabaleon, Count Wackerbarth-Salmour to Count Br\u00fchl, Prime Minister of Saxony and Director of the Meissen factory (written in French and preserved in the S\u00e4chisches Hauptstaatsarchiv, Dresden). Count Wackerbarth-Salmour accompanied Friedrich Christian, the young Crown Prince of Saxony, on his visit to Italy in 1739-40. It is clear from the letters that the Prince intended to make gifts of Meissen porcelain to both Alvise IV Giovanni Mocenigo \u2013 then Venetian Ambassador to Naples and one of the four nobles who were assigned to accompany the Prince during his stay in Venice \u2013 and to his wife Madame Pisana Mocenigo. Although the Prince did not stay with the Mocenigos in Venice, Alvise was his principal chaperone in the city. (There were also earlier family ties, as Augustus III had stayed with the Mocenigos when on the Grand Tour in 1713 and 1716.) It is evident that the gifts of Meissen porcelain were to be presented by the Crown Prince himself, as letters record his anxiety that the items should arrive before he left Italy for Austria in June 1740, and they record also that he made interim gifts to both husband and wife, apologising that the porcelain had not yet arrived.\n\nA letter of 11 February 1740 discusses the present to be given to Madame Pisana, and in another, dated 25 March of the same year, Count Wackerbarth-Salmour sent designs of the Mocenigo and Cornaro arms for use on a service of porcelain to be made for her as a present from Augustus III. This was a large tea, coffee and chocolate service decorated with battle scenes and other subjects. Each piece bears the accoll\u00e9 Mocenigo-Cornaro arms, and the armorials on this cup and saucer identify it as being from this service. Most of the service was sold Christie\u2019s, 8 July 2002, lot 261. Four pieces are signed by the Meissen enameller Bonaventura Gottlieb H\u00e4uer (1710-82). (See H.E. Backer, \u2018Ein Meissen Wappenservice von Bonaventura Gottlieb H\u00e4uer, Freunde der Schweizer Keramik, no. 13, July 1949, pp. 11-12.)\n\nA further letter, dated 18 May 1740, states that both Alvise and Madame Pisana were to receive gifts of porcelain. This was almost certainly a garniture of vases, as three vases decorated by the same hand and with the same armorials together with the \u2018AR\u2019 mark (used to indicate that the item was intended as a royal gift or for the Elector of Saxony\u2019s personal use) are recorded.\n\nSee Maureen Cassidy-Geiger, Fragile Diplomacy: Meissen Porcelain for European Courts in the Eighteenth Century (2008), and Maureen Cassidy-Geiger, \u2018\u201cJe re\u00e7us le Soir le monde marqu\u00e9\u201d: A Crown Prince of Saxony in Italy, 1738-1740\u2019, Handbook to the International Fine Art & Antique Dealers Show, New York (2004)",
