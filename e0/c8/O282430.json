There is a gold dish with colourful champleve and basse-taille enamels with the same motifs of the sun with a face of a Qajar beauty above a seated lion and floral designs in the V&amp;A (M.97-1922). The dish was a gift from Fath Ali Shah to the British East India Company and made by Muhammad Ja'far in 1233 AH/1817-1818 AD. The Shah had chosen the auspicious astrological symbol of the Sun in Leo, seen in the centre of the dish, as the official emblem  of Iran. It matched the official emblems of the Western powers with whom he tried to  establish equal standing.\n\nFath Ali Shah was the second ruler of\tthe Qajar dynasty, which reunited the country in  the 1790s. He commissioned art on a grand scale during his reign from 1797 to 1834. Iran  had been isolated for a long period. As a result, the works he commissioned mix richness with a certain naivite. Iranian houses of the Qajar period continued the tradition of a complex of rooms open porches and courtyards all linked by a series of passages and contained within high retaining walls. Floors and walls, especially in the warm regions of central and southern Iran, were furnished with pavements and friezes of glazed tiles. Here the design was as popular as it was versatile and could be extended to cover all sizes of surface and provided a good base for carpets.",
