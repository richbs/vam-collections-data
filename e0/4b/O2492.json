Extensive glass table services became increasingly popular towards the end of the 19th century. Such sets were cheaply made in press-moulded glass and became widely available. They were often elaborate in design.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of press-moulding glass with the aid of a hand-operated machine was first perfected in the USA in the early 1820s. It took only two men to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. They simply depressed a lever that lowered a metal plunger into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Britain and continental Europe, giving rise to stylistic changes in glass and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid-to-late 19th century the first real period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved the product while cutting costs even further.",
