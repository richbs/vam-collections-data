It is highly representative of Fortuny's use of luxurious fabrics and rich trimmings combined with his signature pleats.\n\nThe multi-talented Mariano Fortuny (1871-1949) was a painter, theatre designer, photographer, inventor and scientist, although he is best known as a creator of extraordinary fabrics and clothes. His distinctive creations were worn by avant-garde beauties throughout the world from the 1910s to the 1930s. He based his textile patterns on historical designs and was especially fond of Renaissance motifs. By 1920 he had established a factory on the Guidecca in Venice as well as his original Palazzo Orfei workshops.",
