The elaborate and skilful workmanship on such a large scale was intended to raise the prestige and public awareness of the manufacturer, Elkington & Co. This in turn helped to sell the firm's standard mass-produced goods such as tea wares and cutlery.\n\nPeople\nThe most successful designers in silver at this period were French. These included Leonard Morel-Ladeuil (about 1820-1888), who designed and made this shield. He worked for Elkington & Co. from 1859 after serving his apprenticeship in France with Antoine Vechte (1800-1868), the most famous of the silver designers. Vechte retired in 1862, and by the time of the Paris Exhibition five years later Morel-Ladeuil was considered by many to be the most important artist in this field. Work began on this shield in 1864 with the express intention of exhibiting it in 1867. At the exhibition it won a gold medal for the artist and received an enormously enthusiastic response. The Art Journal declared, 'There is a general impression that the work...is the best...exhibited during the memorable year of 1867'. The Museum bought the shield from the exhibition for the then huge sum of \u01532,000.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe theme was carefully chosen to celebrate the work of a great Englishman, the poet John Milton (1608-1674). The panels represent scenes from Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost. The central panel depicts the Archangel Raphael telling Adam and Eve of the 'war in heaven', when the Archangel Lucifer rebelled against God and was expelled from heaven by the Archangel Michael.",
