            "public_access_description": "This oval bronze plaquette is made by Valerio Belli in the first half of the 16th century. It depicts a scene of an antique sacrifice where in the middle is an altar and a priest is about to sacrifice a goat. It was apparently moulded from an impression of an engraved crystal.\n\nBelli (1468-1546) was born into a respected Vicentine family. He trained as a goldsmith and developed considerable skills in engraving crystals and dies. For Pope Clement VII he created his masterpiece, a crystal casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Belli was strongly influenced by Raphael and Michelangelo. He had a facility to work very quickly, and Vasari noted that Belli had flooded the world with his works.\n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.",
