Josephine was involved with the commission but eventually lost patience with the time taken to produce the set and though delivered to Ch\u00e2teau Malmaison on 1 April 1812 the service was rejected as the design was considered too severe. On return to the S\u00e8vres factory the service included 72 plates with Egyptian scenes  but when the service was given by Louis XVIII to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington  (1769-1852) in 1818 for his assistance in helping to restore the  Bourbon monarchy, only 66 of these plates were accounted for. Ten plates in total (including four extras) had therefore been dispersed or lost (Mus\u00e9e national d C\u00e9ramique, S\u00e8vres MNC.1800 and 21630 - one of the extra plates, MNC.26308 - one of the missing plates from the service, also BM M&amp;ME 1993,6-10,1 - possibly a trial plate). \nUntil 1979 the surviving service remained with the Dukes of Wellington when it was acquired by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Today one plate C.124:34-1979 is displayed at the V&amp;A, the remaining service is on loan to English Heritage and displayed at Apsley House, London.",
