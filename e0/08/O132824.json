Won the first prize medal at the RA for painting 1834, and the gold medal of the Society of Arts 1835. Exhibited portraits, historical and biblical subjects: 32 at the RA between 1832 and 1876, 31 at the BI 1833-67, and 26 at the SBA 1832-76. Entered cartoon competitions for the Palace of Westminster decorations in 1843 (winning a \u00a3100 prize), 1844 and 1847. Visited Rome 1837, Australia 1850, where he organised one of the first exhibitions of works of art, and India and Egypt. He received a commission from Queen Victoria for a 'General View of the Harbour and City of Sidney'. Returned to England 1858. Died Maida Vale, London, 28 July 1881. His two daughters were both artists. Florence Claxton's watercolour parody of the PRB, the 'Judgement of Paris', was acquired by the V&A in 1989.\n \nLIT: \t<i>Athenaeum</i> 13 August 1881, p216 (obit) \n\n<b>The Sepulchre</b> \nFA251 Neg 5642 \nCanvas, 126.4 x 174.7 cm (49\u00be x 68\u00be ins) \nSigned 'M Claxton' bl \nGiven by the artist 1867 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1843, it was adversely received by the critics. The <i>Athenaeum</i> found 'the figure well-drawn, well foreshortened, the angels commonplace; and the solemnity of effect which ought to give the poetry and religion of the subject, wanting', while the <i>Art Union</i> criticised 'his method of treating the subject. Such a display of the anatomy of the human form, with every appearance of attention from disease, is certainly revolting. Apart from this objection, there is much excellent work in this picture'. The criticism of the anatomy anticipates Charles Dickens's famous attack on Millais's 'Christ in the House of His Parents' (<i>Household Words</i> 15 June 1850, pp265-6). \n\nA later critic in the <i>Art Journal</i> was more sympathetic: \n\nThe disposition of the figure of the dead Christ is so far novel, that we do not remember it treated in a similar way in any picture by an old master; that is, with the body in a half-recumbent position, and the head resting on a raised block of stone, while <i>in the sepulchre</i>. The drawing, moreover, of the figure is good and the anatomical expression well-developed; the arrangement of the drapery is simple, natural, and without heaviness. The sentiment of the two angels flying down to take their places as watchers by the tomb is poetical; one, as if in agony of grief at the fearful sight, appears to hide from her [sic]. There is much elegance in the grouping of these figures. How far the introduction of the objects identified with the crucifixion - the crown of thorns, the mock-sceptre of reeds, the sponge, and the nails - are admissive, so far as the scriptural narrative warrants, is doubtless questionable; but they form a kind of episode in the composition which is impressive as well as pictorially valuable ... \n\nThe iconography of the painting is certainly unusual; Claxton seems to have adapted the account in the Bible by St John (chapter 20 verses 11-13) in which Mary Magdalene came to the sepulchre and found two angels where the body of Christ had been lain. The 'half-recumbent position' of Christ is not unusual in Pieta compositions from the Renaissance onwards, and the immediacy of the figure derives ultimately from Caravaggio in the early 17th century. Perhaps the present work may be most closely compared with Jusepe de Ribera's 'Lamentation', which probably dates from the early 1620s and was presented to the NG in 1853 (its earlier provenance is unclear, but there are several versions of the composition and an etching, one of which Claxton may have seen); the facial expression of Claxton's angel and that of Ribera's Virgin Mary are in particular very similar. There is also a resemblance to the 'Dead Christ' of Philippe de Champaigne (two versions, Louvre and St Medard, Paris).\n \nThe 1869 <i>Art Journal</i> commentary on the picture, which accompanied an engraving of the painting, concluded: 'Mr Claxton's liberality has made the nation the proud possessor of this interesting work: he recently presented it to the Museum at South Kensington, where it forms one - and not the least attractive - of the ornaments of the Picture Gallery'. \n\nEXH: RA 1843 (377); <i>International Exhibition</i> 1862 (520, lent by the artist)\n \nENGR: S Smith, for the <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, facing p 368 \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 27 May 1843, p511; <i>Art Union</i> 1843, p176; <i>Art Journal</i> 1869,p368\"",
