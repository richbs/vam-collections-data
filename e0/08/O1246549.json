The wallpaper formed a backdrop to a bed, as well as mirrors, stones and shovels. The artist has described the installation as exploring \u201cthe breakdown between public and private space by examining ideas about media control, power, cultural symbols, and the subjective interpretation of current events.\" The pattern consists of white silhouetted figures against an ground with an Islamic pattern in shades of blue and white. Hecht is interested in how a repeated pattern can be politicized, generating feelings of discomfort, threat and uncertainty. The V&A already holds an earlier wallpaper by Hecht, \u2018Chain Link Fence\u2019, which was made for an installation called \u2018Space Contains No Threats\u2019, 2000. (see E.1497-2001)",
