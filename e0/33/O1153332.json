She wears a high waisted gown with a long train. Her sleeve heads are padded and slashed and she wears a decorative, knee length apron. Her lace collar is stiff and upright, possibly resting on a concealed metal support. A small, feather trimmed hat is perched on the crown of her head and she wears an unsual armourlike breastplate over her bodice. The man with whom she stands hand in hand, is wearing an equally elaborate costume consisting of a gown, doublet and trousers. The gown has stiffly padded sleeveheads and hanging sleeves and is worn beneath a stiff lace collar. The loose trousers are striped and end just above the ankle. In addition to the short dagger he carries at his waist the man holds a long candle stand with a lighted candle at its head.",
