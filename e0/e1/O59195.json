Of all the Jinas, Parsvanatha is the most readily identifiable.  According to both the sects of Jainism he was dark blue in complextion and had the snake as his distinguishing mark. In the sculpture the serpent king Dharana protects the Jina with the coils of his body and shelters him with his multi-headed hood. The attendant deities are not represented, nor the triple umbrellas or flywhisks, but curiously he is provided with a nine-hooded serpent.",
