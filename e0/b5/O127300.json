One is in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool (WAG.1994.52), another was sold by the Country Seat and is now apparently in an American museum and the last chair, which has swan head finials to the back, is in a private collection in Australia.\nThe design was formerly attributed to J. Moyr Smith but an article, Cottier and Company, Art Furniture Makers by Max Donnelly, published in <u>Antiques</u> Vol. CLIX, June 2001, pp. 916-925, pl. XIV, illustrated an armchair with very similar decoration and front legs, suggesting that Cottier was responsible for the design.",
