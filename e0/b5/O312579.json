All of these plaques were loosely based on 12th century prototypes but do not copy them: the two confronted figures, for instance, seem to be derived from the paired apostles on piers from Saint-Etienne in Toulouse or similar figures on the north portal at Cahors Cathedral, and the plaques with Christ in Majesty follow the form and style of tympana in France and Northern Spain.\nThe apostles on the present plaque seem to be inspired by those on the central west doorway at Saint-Denis, of about 1140, and the overall composition is probably modelled on the central doorway of the 'Royal Portal' of Chartres Cathedral, of 1145-50.\nThe maker of these plaques was revealed to be Francisco Pall\u00e1s y Puig of Valencia (1859-1926), an extraordinarily gifted and versatile ivory carver who produced works not only in the Romanesque style, but also in Late Gothic and Cordovan manner.",
