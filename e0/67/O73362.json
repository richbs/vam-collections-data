One of a small group of Morris designs on printed silk exhibited by Thomas Wardle at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1878.  They were acquired by the V&A soon afterwards and lay undiscovered as British work until the 1960s.\n\nHistorical significance: All of Morris' printed textiles designed between 1875 and 1878 were printed at Thomas Wardle's Hencroft Printworks in Leek, Staffordshire.  From February 1878 Wardle was printing fourteen designs for Morris & Co.   This collaboration lasted throughout the nineteenth century and these patterns continued to be produced at Leek despite Morris' move to Merton Abbey in 1881-2.",

'You are quite welcome to send the prints to the India House ... As to our using them the only drawback seems to be that they are made awkward widths for our present blocks ... By the way I think the Carnation would look well on the Tussore'.  Wardle was particuarly interested in silk.  He spent a number of years experimenting with sericulture and perfecting the dyeing and printing of tussah, the ground for this example.  He was a founder member and President of the influential Silk Association and published books and articles on the subject.",
