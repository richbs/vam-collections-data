Introduced into Britain in the early 18th century, it was filled with ice to chill the wine before serving. This wine cooler is known to be one of a set of four. Paintings and engravings of the 18th century show wine coolers placed on side tables within easy reach of  the diners. By the early 19th century, these individual wine coolers were beginning to be left on the table as part of the dressing of very grand dinners.\n\nPeople\nThe wine cooler was ordered by Charles, 4th Earl of Tankerville, after his marriage to Emma Colebrooke in 1771. The arms of both form the central decoration of the salver. Tankerville was reported to be  'a very haughty honourable man ... but very communicative and entertaining ... His only remaining passion is for clever men, of which description he considers himself as one, tho' certainly unjustly'. The wine cooler was made by the silversmith Charles Frederick Kandler (active 1735-1778), now believed to be a family member and successor to the Rococo silversmith Charles Kandler (active 1727-1750), who emigrated from Germany to London in the 1720s.\n\nDesign\nThis wine cooler in bucket form owes much to French style, in both shape and decoration, as a design now in the National Museum, Stockholm demonstrates.",
