There, special objects were made to encourage alcohol consumption in a social and playful manner. So called 'Passgl\u00e4ser' [measure glasses] have between 3 and 7 divisions marked sometimes with enamel, and sometimes, as in this example, with trailed threads. During a drinking game, each participant was expected to drink exactly to the next division or, failing this, he would have to continue to the next mark down, and so on. Although this type of glass was very common for drinking beer in the late 16th and 17th century, only a few have survived. A glass like this is shown on Rembrandts painting 'portrait of the painter with Saskia' in the Pinakothek in Dresden.",
