London: HMSO, 1964.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n\"<b>ANONYMOUS: Heraldry</b> \n \nHeraldic achievements (414), mainly those of German families, most in colour, but the later ones are tricked, together with 49 additional shields in outline only, not completed with the charges.  In a volume containing 112 pages of white laid paper, some of which have additional achievements pasted on.  Many of the pages are either torn or cut, and others are missing.  Full-bound in a parchment sheet with Latin inscriptions in an early 16th century hand, and lined with an uncut sheet of the same date from a German religious publication, with letterpress and woodcuts.  Inside the front cover are 17th century pen and ink sketches of the heads of a man and a horse.  The volume is made up from paper manufactured in Germany during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, with watermarks of a crown (Br.4892); another crown (Br.4922); a bear (Br.12286); a mount with a cross (Br.11928), and a bull's head (Br.15357).  South Germany, early 16th century. \n<i>Inscribed in ink throughout in contemporary hands with the identifications of the coats of arms. \nPen and ink, water- and body-colour.  Size of volume.</i>  27.3 x 19.4 cm. \nE.99-1959 \n \n<i>Note:</i> This volume was formerly in the collections of Charles Shoppee and F. Gordon Roe.\"",
