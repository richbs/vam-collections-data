Although this is not strictly speaking an art reproduction photograph, it is closest to that category. The illustration seems to show a woman surrounded by children hanging onto her skirts, a domestic genre scene in the style of William Mulready. If Lady Hawarden intended to copy the illustration, she would have placed the book on a copying easel. That she used such a stand for art reproduction photography may be seen in a photograph by Lady Hawarden which is in a private collection; this shows an easel on which there is a mezzotint by William Sharp after a portrait of John Hunter, the surgeon and anatomist, by Sir Joshua Reynolds.'",
