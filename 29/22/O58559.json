Possibly missing two oval inset plaques either side of the strapwork cartouche (as similar ones on back are engraved in the solid). The escutcheon has been added.\nBack - Orpheus with a viol da gamba, playing to the animals, within a cartouche surrounded by drops, birds and satyrs\nRight side - battle scene with two opposing figures on horseback - a scantily-clad man (left) with a naked woman behind fighting a man in Roman armour (right), both wielding branches, with four other figures, two fallen, two standing. With later added handle, and twin holes for a delicate handle (missing) \nLeft side - Hercules fighting the Lernanean hydra, assisted by Iolaus.\nLid - a coat of arms, possibly that of Steiermark\nBottom\n\nMaterials \nThe base (consisting of 2 butted boards) and interior divider of walnut \nThe front, sides, back and lid - pear or tropical hardwood. The lid appears to consist of 3 or 4(?) narrow strips of the following widths: 58mm, 4.4cm (to split), 8.4cm\n\nThe box is of dovetailed construction, with the base (7mm thick) glued up to the front/back and sides, supplemented by 2 wood dowels into the front.\n\nLater alterations and repairs\nOn the lid, the front moulding on the lid no longer overbites the front when closed - as front and back have warped, probably caused by moving the internal brace and possibly exascerbated by some shrinkage across the lid. In order to offset this problem (of the lid not closing) the lid has been rebuilt, with added fillets of pale wood on all four edges, making it higher, added inside the edge mouldings, to accommodate the warp in front and back.  These lid bone edge mouldings have been refixed to the built-up lid with pins of dark wood (where bone pins are used on base).\n\nOn the left side, front corner at base, there is a replaced section of moulding.\nOn the front left corner a section of moulding has been replaced.\nThe bottom board has split, either because of divider being moved or because the sides prevented the bottom from shrinking across the grain.\nOn the right side, front corner, the vertical strapwork element appears to be replacement as it looks to be of ivory not bone.\n\nOn the inside, the four corner angles at top of front, back and sides are replaced.\nThe softwood T shape divider and two oak small dividers at left side appear to be replacements. Note that plain walnut divider may be original but moved so that it caused front and back to distort. The two corner blocks are additions.\n\nMetalwork\nThe 'top' handle, with replaced wood behind\nThe lock and horizontal plate over wood fillet (replacing an earlier one?) \nThe escutcheon\nThe hinges - replacing others that were tenoned into a shallow mortise in the back, the knuckle sitting in a hollow cut in the top of the back board, and nailed to inside face of lid (the original hinge fixing holes on inside of lid have been filled with wax). The fixing for the new hinge has caused loss of small section of inlay, and caused small areas to be cut out of bone moulding along back of lid.",
