A charpoy consists of four turned or carved legs joined or bound to a rectangular frame. This example is painted and gilt to simulate the effect of gold and enamel. Ibn Batuta\u2019s description of a charpoy, written around 1350, still applies today: \u2018The bed consists of four conical legs, on which four staves are laid; between they plait a sort of ribbon of silk or cotton.\u2019  In cheaper models, the frame was netted with rope made from rushes, while finer examples were laced with comfortable broad canvas tape.  \n\nMaterials used in the construction of charpoys varied from inexpensive bamboo and wood to ivory, but in all cases the form remained the same.  Cot legs were ornamented with a number of techniques including painting and carving.  A more extravagant effect was created by encasing wooden charpoy legs and frames in sheets of silver and gold encrusted with semi-precious stones.",
