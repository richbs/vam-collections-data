The classical, monumental character of the piece suggested by both the Roman triumphal arch and the classical sarcophagus or tomb shapes, recalls German Biedermeier designs for furniture from the first quarter of the 19th century. \n\nThe decorative veneers, the artistic motifs and the quality of the detail (such as the handles) express a desire to return to higher artistry and hand manufacture in furniture and cabinet-making at this time. The geometric designs inset into the door panels are similar to contemporary graphic designs and designs for embroidery.\n\nJoseph Maria Olbrich designed somewhat similar pieces of furniture for the Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse for the Altes Schloss in Giessen in 1906.",
