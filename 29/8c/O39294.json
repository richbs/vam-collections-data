Two flat bird-heads curve upwards like scrolls to look at the figure of the bird in the round perched on the cusp of the cupola. Trilobed half-palmettes are engraved on the back of the bird instead of feathers.\n The body of the burner is decorated with engraved bands of guilloche, arabesque medallions and geometric designs, the areas of ornament divided by deeply chiselled grooves of v-shaped section. Triangular grooves on the outer walls create the visual effect of four broad ribs, within these ribs typically Khorasanian motifs of the Samanid period have been engraved. These are twin circles finely incised with dividers, enclosing smaller circular discs framed by bands of square beads. On top of the incised circles trilobed fleur-de-lys motifs have been incised. The back of vessel is marked with an inscription that can be read as 'godliness'. At the bottom of the well there are borders of fine hatching consistent with 10th-11th century usage.",
