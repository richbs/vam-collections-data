It would originally have been fastened to the end of a long belt, which would have been wrapped in a knot at the front so that the decorative end hung down vertically.  Later, when this kind of belt was restricted to use with traditional dress, the end of the belt, with its decorative belt end, was cut off and sewn to the front of the belt, forming a permanent pendant of cloth or leather which was usually decorated along its length, above the belt end, with silver appliqu\u00e9s of various kinds.  The three lozenge-shaped pendants, which were used as early as the Middle Ages, are characteristic of Norwegian traditional jewellery of all kinds.\n\nThe figure on the front of this belt end is Fortune, who was a popular allegorical character in the 16th and 17th centuries.",
