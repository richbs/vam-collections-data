Their top-quality cotton fabrics retained their brightness and crispness despite frequent washing. The bold, lively prints were often designed by leading artists of the day. The combination of flowers and stripes seen in this example was particularly popular, and much copied by rival manufacturers. The dress was purchased with a matching bolero.\n\nThe Horrockses dress became an universal must-have, desired by women of all ages and social backgrounds. Whilst the dresses were relatively expensive, working women would save up to buy one for \"best\", usually as a honeymoon outfit. They were also worn by members of the royal family.",

The dress was described as closely resembling the image in the newspaper article, which was an advertisement from the Bon March\u00e9 department store in Liverpool. The donor also recollected seeing a picture of her dress featured in one of the magazines of the day, but could not remember which one. She thought it may have been Woman's Journal. Woman & Home or Woman's Own.",
