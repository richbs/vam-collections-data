The design shows courtly scenes thought to probably represent one of the Jatakas or from Burmese legend with the figures richly dressed in sequined coats with pasos or htameins of simulated luntaya cloth representing the styles of the Konbaung Dynasty (1752-1885). On the left is a court scene with a reclining princely figure in conference with two seated ministers. The pavilion is decorated with crystal chandeliers and four royal umbrellas. In the centre is a princely figure accompanied by an official stands in a rocky glade. Behind them is a male dancer wearing a headdress and entertains three ladies and two noblemen. The multiple border is formed of continuous leafy and interlacing patterns interspersed with kinnaras and men on hobby horses, enclosed in rectangular panels.\n\nRed wool baize bound on one of the long sides with green woollen cloth. Series of brass rings for hanging. Backed with cream coloured cotton. The applique is executed in shaped pieces of prepared cottons of various tints, coloured woollen fabrics, white fabrics, white gimp and copper sequins. Certain of the supplementary details are painted in Indian ink and water colours.",

            "public_access_description": "This is an example of a Burmese pictorial textile hanging known as a kalaga. The owner would have used it as a decorative wall hanging, a room partition, or as a screen hung outside the house on festive occasions. Though it is not clear to researchers yet, the artist has drawn on either Burmese legends or the Jataka stories, which chronicle the Buddha\u2019s former lives, for his subject. The appliqu\u00e9 design on red wool ground is worked in  partly painted, shaped coloured fabrics and sequins. The costumes of the figures themselves are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre, and relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay court of about 1880. \n\nKalagas were increasingly popular in the mid 19th century. This example,  however, is unique in that it refers to a hanging (seen above the dancer and seated woman) with an abstract design. Similar abstract designs can be found in early 19th-century wall paintings and court manuscripts, suggesting that earlier kalagas may well have been abstract and not pictorial in design.",
