It is made of earthenware, which is fired at the lowest temperatures of all ceramic material and thus although the pattern is  a transfer-printed outline, with hand-painted colours, the vase was relatively inexpensive to produce. It was made to appeal to the wide market long established for Mason's distinctive orientalising style.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMiles Mason (1752-1822), founder of Mason's ceramic works, began his career as a dealer in porcelain. Through this he acquired an interest in Chinese ceramics and this influenced his own ceramic production. The type of patterns common in Chinese export wares, Chinese vase shapes and dragon handles were all typical of Mason's ware  and continued so under Miles' sons George Miles Mason and Charles James Mason (1791-1856). In 1813 the latter patented 'the manufacture of English Porcelain',  which was marketed as 'Mason's Ironstone' throughout the company's existence.  It came to dominate the brothers' output and is especially associated with this type of Chinese-inspired ware.\n\nHistorical Association\nThis vase shape and style of decoration had been produced by the Mason brothers for many years.  With the addition of an extra backstamp celebrating the Great Exhibition of 1851, however,  it was given a fresh topicality.  But Charles James Mason, by then sole owner of the factory -  which moved to Daisy Bank, Lane End, Longton, in 1851 - had already been declared bankrupt in 1848. The Mason name, moulds and printing plates were bought out and continued under new owners and the Daisy Bank factory ceased to operate in 1853. The Great Exhibition was a last chance for  Mason to sell  outstanding stock.",
