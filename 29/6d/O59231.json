A very similar design was illustrated by Wagner in the publication Ver Sacrum to introduce an article on applied art, in which he hailed the emergence of art which mirrored its own time, rather than reproducing historic styles.\n\nThe armchair formed part of a set of chairs which were designed en suite with a sideboard, a vitrine and a cabinet which is also in the V&A's collection (W.14-1982)",
