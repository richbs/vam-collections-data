He then came to London and  worked as an independent designer, opening a shop in Sloane Street in 1980 and later moving to Hatton Garden. He won numerous awards and is represented in the collection of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, London.  \n\nThe brooch's delicate, swirling  ribbons are cast in gold, their forms created by hot wax which has been extruded through a tube. The method was developed by Mario Saba and the collection he based on this technique was launched in Geneva in 1994. Coming from a traditional fine jewellery background, the brooch illustrates the widespread contemporary fascination with texture in precious metals.",
