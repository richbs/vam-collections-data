Judith Rothchild (born USA, 1950) is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design. She has lived in France since 1974. This print is a mezzotint, a process which has now declined in popularity. Rothchild has chosen to work with mezzotint because it offers expressive possibilities, with the characteristic rich and velvety tones well suited to representing organic surfaces such as fruit and vegetables. There is a sensual and symbolic character to this still life study, and it demonstrates Rothchild's mastery of the medium.",
