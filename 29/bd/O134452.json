He felt Islam better reflected his sense of identity as a person of African origin than the Christian faith he had grown up with.  \n\nEach pyramid is printed on all four sides with an image of the artist at a different stage of prayer. The materials and the three pyramid forms are highly symbolic. The transparency of the glass signifies the artist's desire for greater openness and communication, not only with God but with each other. Faisal Abdu' Allah believes it is only through prayer and dialogue that we can begin to find our own truth, other people's truth and the ultimate enlightenment, God's truth. The glass can also be read as a conduit to enlightenment about the contributions which Africa and African peoples have made to world history and culture, hitherto ignored. The pyramids represent that history and culture, and printed with these images, they may also highlight the continuation of Islam through the African diaspora. Faisal Abdu'Allah made this work while still a student at the Royal College of Art. He has since built an international reputation as an artist.",
