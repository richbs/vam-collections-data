Its visual impact is enhanced by the bold thumb-rest in the form of a palmette or stylised tree.\n\nEwers with pear-shaped bodies, as here, were produced in Iran in the centuries following the Islamic conquest in the 7th century. They continued the general form of metal ewers made by Iranian metalworkers under the Sasanian dynasty (ruled about AD 224 to 631) that preceded the Islamic conquest.",

These ewers are all thought to have been made in the first centuries of Islam. The only one with an inscription is in the Museum of Tbilisi, in Georgia: it mentions the name of the artisan (Yazid) and the place of production (Basra), and the date, which has been read by some as 688-689, and by others as 882-883. Previously it had been assumed that such ewers were made in Khurasan or Central Asia, but on the basis of this inscription it likely that they should be reattributed to Abbasid Iraq. Ewers made in Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) in the 10th and 11th centuries have a foreshortened version of the shape of these early ewers, and were perhaps modelled on imports that originated in the Abbasid world.",
