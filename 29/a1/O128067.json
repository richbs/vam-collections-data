Patronized by several ducal families, in particular that of Holstein, and also by the Danish court, he was a successful portrait painter. He was in England 1721-28 but his dislike of the climate made him return to Hamburg, where he settled. \n\n83 \nTHE PENITENT MAGDALEN \nSigned on wall on right <i>Denner fect. \nCopper</i> \n21 3/8 X 16 3/4 (54.3 X 42.5) \nForster Bequest \nF.4\n\nAnother painting by Denner of the Penitent Magdalen, dated 1727, showing her praying, was in the E. Ullmann sale, Kende, Vienna, 12-4 Oct. 1937, lot 4. \n\n<i>Condition.</i>When the painting was cleaned in 1959 it was found that there was an area of overpainting at the lower left which had been added in order to cover the breast and raise the neckline. This was removed and the original surface was found to be in good condition. \n<i>Prov.</i>John Forster; bequeathed to the Museum in 1876. \n<i>Lit. Forster Collection catalogue,</i>1893, p. 1.\"",
