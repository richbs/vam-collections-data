The jugs were originally designed by the Burslem pottery firm Shorter & Sons in 1940 when principals from the D'Oyly Carte Company were photographed in their costumes and in poses they felt best represented their characters. This was modelled on Grahame Clifford as the Duke of Plaza-Toro, dancing in the finale of The Gondoliers.\n\nTwo sizes of these jugs were made, as well as wall plaques, cigarette boxes and ash trays featuring the characters. As Art Director of Shorter's, Clarice Cliff was responsible for the design of the series although the figures were modelled by various artists. The outbreak of World War II meant that the range was not marketed until 1949 when an extensive advertising campaign in North America was master-minded by Colley Shorter. The set to which this jug belongs was the first of a very few produced in the mid-1980s by the owner of the original moulds who marked the jugs 'Rockingham'.",
