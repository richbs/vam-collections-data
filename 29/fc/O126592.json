The palace was built for Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, about 1475-6 and was in large part complete by 1480. There is no agreement as to the architect responsible for it, who has been variously identified as Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Baccio Pontelli and Luciano Laurana. The style both of the architecture and the ornament depends from that of the Palazzo Ducale at Urbino. The present doorway formed the inner section of the doorframe of the main entrance to the great hall of the palace. The ornament was originally coloured and gilded, and there are traces of blue paint and gilding on the cornice and the architrave. The left-hand shield is charged with the Montefeltro emblem of an ostrich with an arrow-head, the central shield bears the arms of Montefeltro, and the right-hand shield is charged with ermine. In the spaces between are distributed the letters FEDVX. The ermine relates to Federigo da Montefeltro's enrolment in the Order of the Ermine (1474), and the banner of the Church shown in augmentation in the centre refers to his appointment as Gonfaloniere of the Church in the same year."

The palace was built for Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, about 1475-6 and was in large part completed by 1480. There is no agreement as to the architect responsible for it, who has been variously identified as Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Baccio Pontelli and Luciano Laurana. \n\nThis doorway formed the inner section of the doorframe of the main entrance to the great hall of the palace. The ornament was originally coloured and gilded, and there are traces of blue paint and gilding on the cornice and architrave. The left hand shield is charged with the Montefeltro emblem of an ostrich with an arrow-head, the central shield bears the arms of Montefeltro, and the right hand shield bears ermine. In the spaces between are distributed the letters FEDVX. The ermine relates to Federigo da Montefeltro's enrolment in the Order of the Ermine (1474), and the banner of the Church shown in augmentation in the centre refers to his appointment as Gonfaloniere of the Church in the same year.",

Robinson dated 24th November, 1884. \"When I went to to Italy, on behalfof the South kensington and Birmingham Museums, , three or four years ago, these most important works of Italian quatro centro were brought to my notice in in Florence, to which they had been removed from their original situation, in the old Palace of the Dukes of Urbino at Gubbio. The doorways had been taken down ...shortly before, by a Florentine dealer, who had sold them to the duc de Chalunes, a french nobleman, who possesed a villa near Florence, where he proposed to re-erect them. The Duke, however died shortly  afterwards and the doorways, though paid for , had not been delivered. The Duke's executors thereupon abandoned the intention of re-erecting them...It now appear that only a short time ago Signor Riblet, in partnership with with Signor Tito Gagliardi ...finally succeeded in acquiring the doorways  from the representatives of the Duc de Chaulnes, and Signor Tito Gagliardi immediately wrote to me\"",

            "historical_context_note": "The doorcase originally framed the major ingress to the salone - or great hall - of the Palazzo Ducale at Gubbio. It's companion doorcase 290-1886 directly coresponded to it on the other side of the same wall.It can be established that 101-1886 was the inner section of the doorway and it follows that 209-1886 was the outer section.\nThe palce was built for Federigo de Montefeltro Duke of urbino between 1475-80. There is no general agreement as to the architect responsible for the palace, but he was almost certainly Francesco di Giorgio. (uciano Laurana and Baccio Pontelli have also been suggested, but whereas the first, a paradigm of refinement, is unlikely to have accepted the crudities of Gubbio, the second , a minor figure, is unlikely to have aspired to them. \nThe present doorcase was probably designed by Francesco di Giorgio : though depending on Laurana's known work at Urbino (for example Francesco virtualy repeats laurana's cornice from the Urbino Dala delle Veglie) it nevertheless differs from it in being rather broader handled and in its omition of the habitual basal returnswith which Laurana very properly informs his door jambs.   \nThough the doorway is skillfully carved, its most important aspect (in the era of Piero and Pacioli) was its proportions. Allowing for the restored bases of the jambs, the portal orifice is a double square which gives the object an harmonious appearance.\n\nFrancesco di Giorgio (1439\u20131501)  a painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer, born in Siena. Initially trained with Vecchietta and becamed accompalished in all the arts. His early works include cassone paintings and religious works in the tradition of Sienese painting. Eventually he assimilated stylistic traditions from Florence, noticeable in the plastic modelling of the figures in his monumental Coronation of the Virgin (1472\u20134; Siena, Pin.). As fortifications engineer in the employ of Duke Federigo da Montefeltro from about 1475, he may also have been involved in the design of the ducal palace at Urbino. A number of sculptures, including the Deposition (1474\u20137; Venice, S. Maria del Carmine) and the stucco Discord (V&A), whose forceful and classical compositions contrast markedly with his painting style, probably date from his time in Urbino.",
