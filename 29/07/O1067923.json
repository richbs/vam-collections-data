Note especially the diagonal striation of the hatching, and the tendency towards an imp as to around the features. On these grounds the miniature should be early in her career, c.1675, a dating \nsubstantiated by the costume and hair-dressing. \t\n\nThe identity of the sitter, which should be established by the cypher and ducal coronet on the beautiful locket, has attracted much speculation. \n\nThe previous owner, who consulted Dr Williamson, wondered whether she was Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, but then decided she was not. Reading the cypher as <i>JCM</i>, she suggested Lucy Walters or the Duchess of Buccleuch, on the strength of the initials being those of <i>James Croft Monmouth</i>; she also suggested Anne, Countess of Sunderland, Marlboro0ugh's daughter. (1) In 1974, having seen the miniature at the Samuel Cooper exhibition. (2) Mr Anthony Keaney wrote to suggest that the sitter was Nell Gwyn, on the grounds that she resembled the sitter for no. 198 in the exhibition. This led Graham Reynolds to consult John Harthan, the Keeper of the Library, and other colleagues at the V&A about the cypher. They concluded that it could be read plausibly in three ways: <i>JGM, MS</i>, or <i>JM</i>, but did not offer an identification. \n\nThere are, however, other possibilities. Earlier, Reynolds had himself cited another miniature' of similar dimensions said to represent Mary of Modena at Windsor'. (3) In the mid-1670s, Susannah-Penelope Rosse's father was employed in the household of the Duke of York. The cypher here can be read simply as an M, perhaps as two Ms intertwined. Possibly therefore the sitter was Mary, the 2nd Duchess of York, 'Mary of Modena', whose putative image at c.1677 was promulgated through a full length portrait by Lely, (4) in which a ducal coronet accompanies her image as part of the decoration on a carved vase. Without such clues to identity, judgements of \nMary's likeness in the years immediately after her arrival in England are hazardous; she is often confused with Anne Hyde, James's 1st Duchess, with Court ladies such as the Duchess of Richmond, and even with Nell Gwyn. (5) But of the suggestions so far made, Mary of Modena seems to have both inherent and circumstantial plausibility.\n\nA 1673 image identified as of Mary of Modena, Duchess of York, by Gibson is at Welbeck Abbey (6) The likenesses are compatible. \n\n1 MS notes c.April 1920; departmental files.\n2 NPG 1974. \n3 Reynolds 1952, p. 82. \n4 Version at Hampton Court; Millar 1963, vol.
