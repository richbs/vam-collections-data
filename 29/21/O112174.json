He is chiefly remembered for organising an exhibition of post-impressionist paintings at the Grafton Gallery in London in 1910 which caused a sensation at the time. He set up the Omega Workshops (1913-1919), with the painters Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant as his co-directors. The purpose of the workshop was to design and decorate items of everyday use in a new and colourful style. This included toys such as this dolls' house, a toy theatre and some animals. It is possible that this house was modelled on Fry's own home near Guildford in Surrey.",

It is possibly based on the artist\u2019s own house, \u201cDrubins! Near Guildford which he had designed five years earlier.\nThe dolls\u2019 house was one of several toys made and sold by the Omega Workshops, including wooden jointed animals, windmills with revolving sails at the pull of a string, and puppet theatres. (see right). Some of the dolls\u2019 houses were known to be fitted with electric lighting but this house does not appear to be so equipped. \nThe toys and a similar dolls\u2019 house were also included in a design  for an Ideal Nursery (below) as part of an exhibition of 3 rooms at the Workshops\u2019 premises.\n\nThe Omega Workshops were started by Roger Fry in 1913 with the painters, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant as his  co-directors. It was based at 33 Fitsroy Square, Bloomsbury (near Tottenham Court Road) and its purpose was to bring together young artists to design and decorate items of everyday use in their new free and colourful style. The workshop sold an enormous range of items from painted furniture and ceramics to rugs, cushions and painted fabrics. All were sold stamped with their trademark, the Greek letter omega (\u2126). Complete interiors were eventually designed. However, it was a short lived concern, lasting only six years due to rows between members as well as disruptions caused by the First World War",
