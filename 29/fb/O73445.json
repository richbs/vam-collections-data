They were ranked together in geometric patterns and held by the most delicate and discreet platinum settings.\n\nThis brooch, in the form of a clip, was commissioned by Ernest Schwaiger for his wife, the actor Adele Dixon (1908-1992).  \n\nShe was best known for appearing in West End and Broadway musicals and British musical films of the 1930s and 40s. She also had the honour of being the first performer in the original BBC high-definition television broadcast in London on 2 November, 1936. She performed a speciallly commissioned song called 'Television' whose first verses went: \n\n'A mighty maze of mystic, magic rays\nIs all about us in the blue,\nAnd in sight and sound they trace\nLiving pictures out of space\nTo bring a new wonder to you'\n\nErnest Schwaiger worked for the firm of Cartier which was founded by Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cartier in Paris in 1847 and became one of the most glamorous jewellery firms of the twentieth century.",
