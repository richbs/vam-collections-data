ISBN 0 85488 047 X\nVotive elephant\nAcquired at Shantiniketan, Birbhum District/ 1944\nBrass, cast on a clay core/ 9.3cm high\n\nThe method of casting is a variety of the 'lost wax' process in which strips and threads of resin prepared from the gum of the 'sal' tree and mustard oil are coated over a clay core, covered by a mould and then burnt out by the ingress of molten brass. The craftsman, known locally as 'dhokras', belong to the 'Kainkuya Mal' community. The name 'dhokra' distinguishes migratory metalsmiths from those who have settled in a single locality but is also applied to a branch of the community which has settled at Rampur on the outskirts of Bankura town. A full account of the technique is given by Reeves [1962], pp.36-54.",
