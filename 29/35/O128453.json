He advertised his portraits in the press stating that 'The likeness taken by the photographic process serves merely as a sketch for the miniature, which is painted by  M. Mansion, whose productions on Ivory are so celebrated in Paris. They have when finished all the delicacy of an elaborate miniature, with the infallible accuracy of expression only obtainable by the photographic process. Three hand-coloured Daguerreotypes by Kilburn were shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851.",

It must want colour...and its best likeness can be only that of a rigid bust, or a corpse'.  For this reason, it was a common practice to add colour by hand.  Often this would be no more than a touch of gilding on jewellery, or a faint flesh tint on hands or face.  Sometimes, much more elaborate colouring was employed; colouring Daguerreotypes was a skilled business, since the fragile image could not be brushed over with heavy paint.  In the main, one of two methods would be used.  On involved the careful dusting-on of dry powder colour mixed with dry gum, which was fixed on the plate by breathing on it, a method patented by Richard Beard in 1842.  Alternatively, colours mixed in alcohol could be painted on with care, drying rapidly to a transparent tint, a method introduced by Antoine Claudet.  Colouring outfits cost from half a guinea for ten colours, including gold and silver, to two guineas for a box of 36 colours with all necessary implements. \nFor the first five years of commercial Daguerreotyping in the London the medium was controlled as a near monopoly by Richard Beard.  In 1846 he issued licenses to, among others, W.E. Kilburn, whose studio at 234 Regent Street offered the painted portrait Daguerreotype as a speciality; 'the likeness taken by the photographic process serves merely as a sketch for the miniature, which is painted by M. Mansion....They have, when finished, all the delicacy of an elaborate miniature with the infallible accuracy of expression obtained by the photographic process' (from an advertisement in <i>The Athenaeum</i> 10 April 1847).  There was stiff competition among the leading studios for the best miniature painters; the combination of high quality Daguerreotypes and overpainting flourished until the closure of the studios of Kilburn and his great rival Claudet in 1862.  Both studios were awarded medals at the Great Exhibition of 1851.  That is the traditional date given to this portrait, which is supported by the style of the sitter's dress.",
