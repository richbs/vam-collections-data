These are chevron lines in yellow and dark green.\nThe design is very indistinct. There are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark green ground with pink trefoil flowers and yellow and white ones; the trefoil points alternately to the bottom or to the right.  In between these is a narrow diagonal arrangement of a round pink vase with a straight stem with blue petals.\n[2] wider stripes with two designs: [a] right-facing horizontal pink flower on angled green and yellow striped stem.  There are two pink flowers either side of the top of the pointed flower and some blue star-like blossoms.  This arrangement alternates with a horizontal arrangement of small floral motifs, the most obvious one being a spray of small flowers in pink, light blue, blue and beige outlined with dark brown.\n[b] diamond section filled with small floral motifs: a yellow vase outlined in dark brown with two blue leaves, pink and yellow flowers and a straight line of three pink flowers.\nThere are no side borders because the sides have been cut.\nThe bottom border has downward pointing faded pink blossom on straight yellow and green striped stem alternating with very stylised yellow and blue flower.\nThreads: 2S silk: pink, light pink, yellow, light blue, blue, light green, green, dark green, dark brown/black, white, beige.",
