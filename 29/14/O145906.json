His subject matter, which includes natural history, portraits and seascapes, is often drawn from the suburban garden, bringing together nature and artifice in  a series of images which are both kitsch and sinister, familiar and surreal. His  images are often adapted from illustrations in gardening magazines and his working method often relies on processes of photography and collage, through which he re-configures the original images and then overpaints before transferring the image to the printing plate or screen. This print is a pair with Circ. 214-1972.",
