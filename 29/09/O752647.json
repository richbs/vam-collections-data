The edition is fixed in advance, and the method proceeds by continuous overprinting on the same sheets. The subject is first designed and made out on the block, and those portions of the surface which it is desired should appear white in the finished print are cut away. The block is then inked by hand with the lightest of the colours to be used, and the entire edition printed in this colour. The process is continued until only the darkest portions remain on the block, all the rest having been cut away. It is most successful when the number of colours is limited to three or four.
