A beardless figure on the right of the panel is shown wearing a belted gown and pulling down the cross with his right hand. Christ is led, with a rope tied around his waist by another clean-shaven figure on the right of the panel. He wears a long-sleeved, belted doublte and hose and pulls on the rope which passes over his right shoulder as he looks back at Christ. A similar figure, wearing a bag-crowned hat stands on the left of the panel, striking Christ's lef with a scourge. A fourth figure stands behind him striking Christ's head with the handle of a scourge. \n\nThe top of the panel has a embattled canopy, a feature popular in the early 15th century.  This feature links it to four other panels in the V&A (A.152-1946, A.154-1946, A.171-1946, A.172-1946) which must originally have formed an altarpiece showing scenes from Christ's Passion.  This larger altarpiece is thought to have originally been in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Palma de Mallorca.",
