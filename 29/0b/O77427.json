They might have been used for holding wooden spills (splints of wood for lighting candles) or flowers. Alternatively, they may have been purely decorative and displayed on chimney-pieces or furniture in domestic interiors.\n\nMaterials & Making\nJasper is a very fine-grained white stoneware that could be stained in a range of colours. Josiah Wedgwood developed this material in the early 1770s in response to the rise in popularity of Neo-classical styles of interior decoration. Antique reliefs set against coloured backgrounds played an important part in Neo-classical interiors.In the development of Jaspar Wedgwood made thousands of meticulously documented experiments. The ware became his greatest invention and is what he is most widely remembered for today. This vase is made of white Jasper and stained with cobalt blue, which was painted on with a brush. The best cobalt blue was imported from Saxony, Germany.\n\nTrading\n'Ruined Vases' were sold for 15 shillings from Wedgwood's Staffordshire factory site in 1787.",
