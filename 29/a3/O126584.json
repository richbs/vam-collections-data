By the 18th century it had become part of the traditional costume of women in the provinces of central Spain, particularly L\u00e9on.  It would have been worn hanging from a heavy necklace, along with other religious pendants and symbols.  \n\nIt was described as Scandinavian in origin, from the first half of the 16th century, when it was acquired by the Museum in 1898 but every element of it is typical of Spanish traditional jewellery.  The suspension ring, with its later French mark, was not part of the original jewel.",
