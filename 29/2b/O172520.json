The two sets of overlapping rectangles face each other, with a space between them, so that the longer of the vertical sides face each other, hence there is a kind of rough symmetry in the overall pattern.\n\nSome of the rectangles have apertures within them, so that the underlying rectangle shows through. The rectangles are distinguished one from the other by varieties of shading or tone. On the left side, a rectangle shaded by irregular, parallel horizontal lines, lies over a matt dark-toned rectangle; it has an irregular rectangular aperture, so the underlying rectangle shows through. On the right  a much smaller white rectangle lies over a shaded rectangle (shaded like the one on the left) which in turn lies over a matt dark-toned rectangle (like the one on the left).",

He is best known for these later works, but even his earliest productions suggest his future interests.\n\nDuring the 1920s and very early 1930s he was teaching at the Bauhaus and working with glass, furniture and typography, but in 1933 when the Bauhaus closed, he emigrated to the USA. He began making woodcuts and lino-cuts again. These prints are characterised by a mix of straight and parallel lines, large planes of black and white, areas shaded with black lines, and a sense of movement created through the use of angles and sloping or curved planes.",
