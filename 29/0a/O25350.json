With this technique a picture is made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper.  \n\nHistorical Associations\nThere was much opposition to the initial plan for an exhibition in Hyde Park. It was the design for the Crystal Palace that the architect Joseph Paxton published in the Illustrated News that caught the nation's imagination, and  further images continued to be published to encourage sustained support for the scheme.  The accompanying text emphasises the construction details and the skill required by Paxton and the construction company, Fox, Henderson & Co., to create a building covering such a large site.",

Above the left of the building can be seen the colossal statue of the Duke of Wellington that then surmounted the triumphal arch at the top of Constitution hill, the classical screen at Hyde Park Corner and Apsley House, the Duke's London home.  To the right is the area that after the exhibition was bought with its profits of a quarter of a million pounds and, as it developed came to be known as the Albertopolis, a vast complex of museum and educational institutions.  In the distance can be seen St. Paul's Cathedral, the Thames and Buckingham Palace.",
