It was made for exhibition at the Great Exhibition which was held in the famous Crystal Palace, Hyde Park, London, in 1851.\nThe elaborate decoration includes a rustic scene in the style of the French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), while nasturtiums and Morning Glory appear to creep over the lid and shoulder of the vase.\nAn engraved metal band around the vase and an accompanying manuscript letter indicate that at the close of the Great Exhibition, Prince Albert (1819-61, husband of Queen Victoria and from 1857 Prince Consort) presented the vase to Sir William Cubitt to thank him for his work as Chairman of the Building Committee for the Crystal Palace.  Cubitt (1785-1861) was a skilled and highly successful civil and mechanical engineer. \nAfter Cubitt's death, the vase moved from London to Wales and then by inheritance to South Africa and later Zimbabwe before being sold to a ceramics collector whose widow offered it as a gift to the V&amp;A shortly before her death.  As the V&amp;A was built from the profits of the Great Exhibition, the vase has satisfyingly 'come full circle'.",

The letter is now in the N.A.L. special collections.\n\"You must allow me to seize this moment of the close of the Exhibition to make my thankful acknowledgements to you for the important assistance, which the great work has received at your hands.  You have not only given us an undue share of your most valuable time, but materially aided us in getting over all our difficulties of construction, which have usually proved the stumbling blocks of commissions.

            "history_note": "Prince Albert presented the vase to Sir William Cubitt (1785-1861) at the close of the Great Exhibition (where it had been exhibited) in October 1851. Along with his knighthood, it was a gift to thank Cubitt for his work as Chairman of the Building Committee (among other roles) for the Crystal Palace.  William Cubitt should not be confused with his building contractor namesake whose dates were 1791-1863.   \n   Following Cubitt's death in 1861, the vase passed to his widow Elizabeth Jane and thereafter to his son Joseph, also an engineer. After Joseph's death in 1894, it passed to his son William who displayed it until 1932 at Rumney House, his house near Cardiff.  As his eldest son John Joseph was killed in action in 1915, the vase passed next to his second son, Lewis (1891-1976) who had emigrated to South Africa to farm in 1910.  Lewis married Daphne, a South African-born Englishwoman and on retirement, they moved to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). When their daughter Halcyon married George Beale in 1956, the couple were given the vase as a wedding present.\n   Finding space limited and the vase delicate and hard to keep clean, the Beales lent the vase to the Salisbury (now Harare) Museum in 1957. When the Museum returned it to the Beales in 1977/78, they decided to sell the vase to a local antique dealer. The vase was purchased by a ceramics collector, George Griffiths, and his second wife Joan. In 2002, Mrs. Griffiths offered the Meissen vase to the V&amp;A as a gift shortly before her death.",
