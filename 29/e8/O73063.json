Adams exhibited two busts of Napier at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, the first in 1854 (no. 1506), the other a year later (no. 1444). A plaster cast of a closely related bust of Napier by Adams, dated 1853, was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1899. \nAdams began his career as a medallist, training at the Royal Mint under the tutelage of William Wyon (1795-1851).  In 1840 he commenced studies in sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in London, and in 1846 travelled to Rome to train further under John Gibson (1790-1866).  He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1841 and 1885, mainly portrait busts and medals.  George Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe bust was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture.",
