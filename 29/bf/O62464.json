It was made by the Carron Iron Company and is likely to have been designed by Robert Adam. The Carron Iron Company was founded in 1759 near Falkirk, Stirlingshire, by John Roebuck, Samuel Garbett and William Cadell.\n\nTrading\nThe Carron Iron Company sought to manufacture practical objects for the mass market using the most up-to-date designs, in this case by employing the Adam brothers. Making stoves and grates was a major part of the Carron Company's business, especially after Robert Adam had been enlisted to provide ornamental patterns.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis stove demonstrates the elegance achievable in cast iron. Its design is very similar to a Carron Company drawing in the Scottish Record Office which has been attributed to Robert Adam and is replete with Neo-classical ornament in the Roman manner.",
