The reflection from the mirror increased the effectiveness of the candlelight. Being highly prestigious pieces of furniture, they were surmounted with elaboratedly decorated crests during the 17th century, but these were often removed by owners and dealers in later periods.\n\nTime\nSince about 1618 various attempts were made to create monopolies for producing looking glasses. However, Venice dominated this luxury market in Britain until 1673, when George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (1628-1687) established works in Vauxhall, south London. The diarist and collector John Evelyn (1620-1706) claimed that Vauxhall mirrors were 'far larger and better than any that come from Venice'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe moulding and crest of this mirror frame is decorated with marquetry of walnut and other woods.",
