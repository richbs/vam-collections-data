They are positioned symmetrically within a round arched architectural setting shown in steep receding perspective. On the masonry wall in the centre is a bowl-shaped brazier giving off flames and smoke, with the date 1505 inscribed above and the artist's monogram inscribed on a block of masonry at the bottom middle of the image below the horse's body.",

            "public_access_description": "The horse appears as a subject in a number of D\u00fcrer\u2019s engravings, often as a focus for depicting movement and proportion, or in a moral or spiritual sense as an emblem of man\u2019s control over himself and the world. In The Small Horse, it has been suggested that the horse is a symbol of sensuality. It seems as though the lively, unbridled animal would like to escape, but is restrained by his groom. The horse is also at the centre of a tightly controlled composition: shown in profile in a heraldic style, its sense of energy and motion is arrested by the strong force created by the intersecting diagonals of the architectural setting and the pike. D\u00fcrer uses a Classical idiom of balance and idealisation influenced by Italian Renaissance art and antique sculpture, for example the bronze horses in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, absorbed during his visits to Italy. This is even more apparent when the image is compared with its companion print from the same year, The Large Horse, which is a more naturalistic depiction of a much more docile, muscular animal in a foreshortened pose, standing patiently with its groom.",

The horse seems to have reached a dead end in the form of a stone wall and, in fact, if the structure signifies intellect, it has a prison-like quality. The animal\u2019s tail has been restrained by a knot, yet it is unbridled, while the wingfooted warrior with his butterfly-winged helmet has been trying to keep pace with it, paralleling its stride. His open mouth suggests that he is somewhat out of breath from the attempt. The proposals that he should be identified as Perseus or Mercury have not found acceptance for lack of sufficient evidence.'\n\n(From<u>The Illustrated Bartsch 10 (Commentary): Sixteenth Century German Artists, Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>. edited by Walter L.

Its features, as well as the fantastic helmet of the knight who leads it, are Leonardesque, perhaps transmitted by Galleazzo da San Severino in whose stable at Milan Leonardo had made studies. Galleazzo, after the fall of the Sforzas, spent many weeks at [D\u00fcrer's close friend and patron Willibald] Pirckheimer\u2019s house in Nuremberg during 1502. The horse is also akin to the one in D\u00fcrer\u2019s drawing in Venice.'\n(From <u>The Illustrated Bartsch 10 (Commentary): Sixteenth Century German Artists, Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>, edited by Walter L.
