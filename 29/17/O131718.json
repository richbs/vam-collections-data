The front legs are turned, and the front rail carved with a cherub's head and scrolls.  The back legs and the stretchers are plain.\n\nAbout 1660.\nFrom:  H. Clifford Smith, Catalogue of English Furniture & Woodwork \n(London 1930), cat. 549.\n\nThe front legs are made up of alternate turned round and square sections (three square sections, with two round sections in between and a round section foot at the bottom).  The front left leg has been replaced up to just below the middle square section.  The leather seat upholstery is nailed down with three rows of nails over the side of the seat rails so we cannot see if the legs are tenoned up into the seat frame or the rails tenoned into the tops of the legs.  A cross-bar, quite naively carved with a cherub's head and scrolls, joins the two front legs at the level of the central square section .  Two square section stretchers (two on each side) are tenoned and square-pegged into the front and back legs.  The upper stretchers are at the level of the front cross-bar, the lower stretchers just above the feet at the level of the lowest square section of the front legs.  A square section stretcher joins is tenoned into the two lower bars at their middle.  The back legs are joined by a further stretcher tenoned in, also just above the feet.  All four feet appear to be replacements.  The back legs and stiles are one, the feet separate.  The bottom rail of the seat back is tenoned into the stiles approximately 1/3 of the way up the height of the seat back.  On the inner face of the right back stile, just below the bottom rail of the seat back, there is evidence of another mortice.  The equivalent area on the left back stile is covered with upholstery.
