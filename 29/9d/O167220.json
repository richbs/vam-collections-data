At the point of juncture of the arms are bosses in the form of lion masks. The statuette is modelled with a flat back, excavated below the Virgin's shoulder's and beneath the seat. A broad horizontal strip between these two hollows is decorated with a diamond pattern, and perhaps represents the back of the throne or chair. The Virgin's knees conform to the front plane of the seat, and her right elbow rests on the rear arm. Her two hands meet on her lap, and her head is inclined slightly to her left towards the Child, who is represented with both arms round her neck pressing his head against her cheek. Her robe is drawn in by a tight girdle beneath the breasts, and is covered by a voluminous cloak with a  turndown collar embroidered with imitation Cufic and terminating in tassels. The robe is edged with a fringed border decorated with imitation Cufic; its end emerges between the feet of the seat on the right. The Child's thighs are covered with a cloth which falls over the Virgin's left hand.",

These terracottas are most closest stylistically to the work of the Florentine sculptors Lorenzo Ghiberti (1378-1455) and Donatello (about 1386-1466), and to that of the painter, Massaccio (1401-1428), and must have been produced in a Florentine workshop in their circle.",
