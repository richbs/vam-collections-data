Paolo, Bologna, in 1641. The altar was designed by Borromini on the commission of Cardinal Bernardino Spada.\nIn technique it is closely reminiscent of 111-1869. The detail of the robes and background is, however, more highly chased. \n\nAlgardi was an Italian sculptor, architect and draughtsman. Alongside Bernini he was the most important sculptor in Rome active around the middle of the 17th century. He produced the classizing antithesis to Bernini's High Baroque sculpture. They were seen and experienced at the time as rivals and equals.",
