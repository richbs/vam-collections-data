A lithograph is a picture made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate) on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance like chalk. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper. To make a colour lithograph, a separate printing surface is required for each colour.\n\nThe size of this poster is known as 8-sheet. British poster dimensions were based on the double-crown sheet unit which measures 30 by 20 inches.  Since this poster measures roughly 60 x 80 inches, its size equals 8 double-crown sheets.  Standardisation of sizes (4-sheet, 8-sheet, 16-sheet, etc.) meant that bill posters could paste posters on the hoardings in modular fashion.\n\nTrading\nBy the end of the 19th century, hoardings covered with brightly-coloured posters were a familiar sight. Many of these posters advertised convenience foodstuffs like dried (desiccated) soup, cocoa powder, tinned sardines and bottled sauces, reflecting new consumer demand and retail practice.  Advertisers like Samuel Benson, whose firm S.H. Benson produced this poster, were quick to develop techniques of branding and campaign management to exploit new markets.",
