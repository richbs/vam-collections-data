It depicts scenes from the story of Pyramus and Thisbe.\n\nThe story of Pyramus and Thisbe is frequently represented on such caskets. It is suggested that the story is a French romance of the fourteenth century which was borrowed from Ovid. The story was also introduced by Shakespeare in his 'Midsummer Night's Dream'.\n\nThe Embriachi workshop was a north Italian family of entrepreneurs and carvers. The precise location of the workshop is unknown, except that it originated in Florence and in ca. 1431 there was apparently a workshop in Venice, in the area of S Luca.\n\nThey employed local workers specialising in 'certosina' (inlay of stained woods, bone and horn), and the workshop produced items carved in bone (usually horse or ox) with wood and bone marquetry.\n\nAs well as altarpieces, the workshop also made caskets as bridal gifts to hold jewels or documents, and these were often decorated with scenes from mythology.",
