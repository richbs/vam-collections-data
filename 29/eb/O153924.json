The figurative scenes almost certainly depend from engraved sources, as yet untraced. \n\nThe character of Susannah originates in the biblical story of Susanna and the Elders from the Apocrypha. Susanna was a beautiful and righteous wife who walked each afternoon with her handmaidens in the garden adjoining her wealthy husband's house. Two Elders, newly appointed as judges, watched her in the garden every day and began to lust after her. The Elders waited for an opportune moment to take advantage of her, finding it one hot day when Susanna decided to bathe and sent her maids to the house for bath oils. The Elders shut the garden gates and ordered Susanna to lie with them or they would falsely accuse her of adultery. Despite their power as judges, Susanna chose the virtuous course, rejecting the Elders, and was condemned to death upon their testimony to the people's assembly. She was saved by Daniel, in whom the Lord - hearing Susanna's cries of innocence - instilled the spirit of truth... The story of Susanna is one of the few biblically justifiable opportunities to depict female nudity.",
