The attribution to Selwyn Image can be found in the facsimile edition of <i>T</i><i>he</i> <i>Royal School of Needlework Handbook of Embroidery</i>, 1880 (East Molesey, Royal School of Needlework, 2010) in Lynn Hulse's introductory essay on. p. 66, note 235. The Musicians panel was designed by Image for the RSN in c. 1879 (Image's association with the School began in the late 1870s; for more information see Lynn Hulse's essay, pp. 45-46). The panel is discussed by E W Godwin in an article on the RSN's 1879 winter exhibition entitled 'A note on needlework' printed in T<i>he British Architect</i>, 12 December 1879, p. 229: '...we have to congratulate to Rev. S. IMAGE on his very excellent figure composition, in illustration of music. The subject is a wood, in which are four damsels and two or three small angels, all in outline; the wing of one of the angels is so nervously good in drawing, that it makes us regret more time was not spent over the angel's face.' The panel is illustrated in an article on Image published in <i>The Ladies Field</i>, 4 November 1899, pp. 380-82. In the RSN archive there is a design card (sent out to customers on 24-hour approval) of The Musicians, attributed to S. Image and described as a piano back (D1/509). Another version of the embroidery was sold through Paul Reeves in 2011.",
