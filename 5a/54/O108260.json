Also, from the head of the fish creature, attached to long black waving cords, are three placenta-like shapes, also in blue and gold. At the lower right two red and gold, globular shaped fish 'swim' to the right.The paper ground is white.",

His inspirations are diverse: they include Kashmiri shawls, Hieronymous Bosch, Japanese prints, Aubrey Beardsley, and natural history illustrations. Strands from all of these are drawn together here by a fine pencil line, embellished with car spray paint (the swirling patterns are achieved by careful application of a porcupine quill), and with glitter which he ground himself, using a domestic food-processor. His predominant subjects in recent work are metamorphosed creatures - half human, half animal - engaged in curious acts of sexual congress. His work is erotic, playful, and witty, but with an underlying seriousness - his imaginative cross-fertilisation of styles and sources references current concerns about genetic engineering, cloning, and mutations caused by environmental pollution.",
