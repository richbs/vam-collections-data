One of the most popular designs was the girandole, with three drops hanging from a central boss.  This 17th century pattern survived until the end of the 19th century with traditional costume in Italy.  \n\nItalian women have always loved lavish display.  Most Italian traditional earrings are very large, but they are usually much lighter than they appear, and made of very thin gold.  This silver earring is heavier, and might have been uncomfortable to wear.  At the top of the wire there is a large double loop, through which the wearer threaded a ribbon, to help relieve the strain on the ear-lobe.",
