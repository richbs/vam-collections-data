Beyond her are other figures walking on the beach, varying distances away, and another cart by the water's edge. Behind and to the left of the cart in the foreground is a stone-built ou- crop over which the sails of boats on the water on it's other side can be seen.",

During his lifetime he exhibited 171 landscapes at the Royal Academy, 131 at the British Institute and 24 at the Society of British Artists.  He mainly painted views of Devon, which was where he was born, but also elsewhere in England, Wales and Scotland.  This particular painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1836 and is possibly of the Lincolnshire coast.",

Served in the army, retired because of ill-health, and entered RA Schools 1818. Exhibited 171 landscapes at the RA between 1824 and 1870,131 at the BI 1822-55, and 24 at the SBA 1825-37. Subjects mainly views in Devon, but also elsewhere in England, Wales and Scotland; visited, in his yacht, France, Spain and Italy. From 1847 he collaborated regularly with the animal painter T S Cooper and sometimes with Sir Edwin Landseer. Elected ARA 1834, RA 1838. According to Cooper, he saw painting 'more of a pastime than as a business, and he always gave me the impression that he considered the profession beneath him'. Retired from the RA 1871, and died at Vleeson Bank, South Africa, 5 June 1879. \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 12 July 1879, p58 (obit); Art Journal 1879, p184 (obit); T S Cooper My Life 1890, I, pp325-30 \nGathering Seaweed FA 107 Neg GA1192 \nCanvas, 76.1 X 91.4 cm (30 X 36 ins) Signed and dated \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1836. The Athenaeum critic commented: 'The first two pictures, which struck us on entering the Great Room, though both landscapes, could not be more strongly contrasted, unless we could find a pencil more literally true than that of Mr Lee's, or one more rich, sparkling, and peculiar than that of Mr Constable's'. The Constable painting was 'The Cenotaph' (NG). According to the MS Register, the scene is probably on the Lincolnshire coast. \n\nEXH:  RA 1836 (8) \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 7 May 1836, pp330-1 \n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
