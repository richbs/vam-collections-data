The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.\n\nThis figure does not appear to be theatrical but may be a representation of Hercules and the Lion. Flatbacks were modelled on a variety of subjects including Royalty, literary, political, mythological and theatrical figures, and children and animals.  They were either press-moulded by putting lumps of clay with the consistency of dough into moulds made in two halves which were pressed together, or slip-mopulded by pouring clay with the consistency of cream into hollow moulds.  When hard, they were decorated by hand, glazed and fired.",
