Early in the Museum's history, probably before 1863, a large number of folios were acquired from a single German Antiphonal. One of the leaves is inscribed '149[-]'. Sets of such choirbooks were often produced over a period of years, and the date may represent a local tradition for some event with which the books were associated. The ornament is difficult to assign to a particular centre as it is found over a wide area, but the attribution to the region of Mainz may be correct. The text and music are for the Divine Office of several feasts and saints' days. This leaf is for Christmas Day and shows a Nativity scene within an initial H. Feasts for St Benedict perhaps indicate that the choirbook was made for a monastery.",
