In his letter, Schmidt observes that the Seutter family were no longer in Ulm in the 1580s (at the time the salt was presumably commissioned) but that a daughter of the family may have remained and married there.\nStriations in the silver surface of the coats of arms suggests these areas were keyed to prepare them for the application of enamels.
