Along with its companion panel (Museum number: 763-1907), it probably formed part of a Last Judgement scene. \n\nIn Christian teaching, at the Second Coming of Christ the dead will rise from their tombs to be judged and sent to heaven or to hell. The angels are God's messengers, and blow trumpets to awaken the dead.\n\nAt this time, depictions of the Last Judgement usually show Christ seated on a throne surrounded by the Apostles, who sit in judgement with him. Below, the dead are seen rising from their tombs. On the right of Christ, angels conduct the favourably judged souls to heaven. On the left, devils carry the damned down to the torments of hell.",

The angel is blowing a trumpet and along with its companion panel (Museum No. 763-1907) it was likely to have been part of a 'Last Judgement' scene. \n\nIn Christian teaching, at the Second Coming of Christ the dead will rise from their tombs and be judged and sent to heaven or to hell. The angels are God's messengers who blow their trumpets to awaken the dead.\n\nThe usual depiction of the Last Judgement at this time is one of Christ seated on a throne surrounded by the Apostles who sit in judgment with him. The dead are seen below rising from their tombs. On the right of Christ angels conduct those who have been judged favourably to heaven. On the left, devils carry the damned down to the torments of hell.\n\nAngels appear above blowing their trumpets.",
