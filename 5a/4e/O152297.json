Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nPieced and embroidered over the seams. Cream/white ground, a large motif of two conjoined peacocks [there are scalloped feather or peacock eyes on the body] terminating in an upward vertical trefoiled stalk is worked in laid and couched metal thread over cotton padding with straight stitched details [eg. The 'eyes' of the feathers] in green and coral pink - now both faded and some light blue. The composite motif is edged with dark blue resht work and outlined with green and coral red, now both faded, cord.\nA meandering embroidered stem emerges from each bird's back, splitting into a number of branches. One curving around and down the side of the bird while the main stems form two irregular stems criss-crossing each other.  These hold multi-coloured blossoms and buds and blue and black leaves.  A crested bird perches on the side branches.\n\nThe outlines are worked in either metal thread laid in a cord of four threads Z-twisted or a cord of two red silk and silver Z-twisted threads.\nEmbroidery thread: 2S; yellow, red[ faded to pink], white, black, grey, cream, light blue, blue, pink, red, beig\ne and light green.\nMetal thread: silver and silver-gilt strip close S-wound on a white silk core.  The thread used for couching is 2S cream and grey silk. Inserts: yellow, two mid-blues, dark blue, light brown, white, two shades of light green, black, red, purple and pink.\n\nSee also 787-1899 which is probably the top part of this panel. A section of about 22 cm would complete the panel. \nA similar panel is incorporated into an early 19th century tent sold at Sotheby's in April 1991 and now in a private collection.  See Hali issue 59 October 1991 p.118.",
