It has a flaring straight-sided bowl bearing a crocketed and ogee headed gothic canopy, with panelled tracery and a frieze above to the rim of the cup. Under the canopy, on a foliage corbel stand statuettes of saints, probably the 12 Apostles. the statuettes are divided by columns which rise into a vault to the canopy, and their bases on the rounded bottom of the cup join an arcade of intersecting pointed arches. The stem is hexagonal, with gothic panelling. It has a large swelling of foliage where it joins the bowl and a small one where it joins the base. The knop consists of a complicated knot of entwined threads. The base is hexagonal with an ogee profile, the hexagonal panels decorated with traceried motifs, the largest of which is shaped quatrefoil, one of which contains the Sacred Monogram with rays, the other five floral motifs.",
