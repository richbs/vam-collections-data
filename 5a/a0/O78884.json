This presentation set of two knives in a carrying sheath was probably given as a wedding gift to a bride. Knives were used for cutting food and carrying it to the mouth, with the  fingers. The use of forks became widespread in England only  after 1660, following the example set by Charles II (ruled 1660-1685). The formal place setting of knife, fork and spoon was not established in England until about 1700.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe hafts (handles) of the knives have been set with pieces of amber. Before the 18th century most knife hafts were made of organic materials, including ivory, bone and shell. Amber (fossilised resin) was a rare and precious material, found mainly on the Baltic coast of Prussia and traded from Germany. It was traditionally believed to be an effective amulet against disease.\n\nManufacture\nCutlery manufacture involved a number of specialists: the blademaker, grinder, hafter (the person who made the handle), sheather (the maker of the sheath in which the knife was carried) and the furbisher or cutler, who assembled the parts, forging the blade, and sold the finished items. The London Cutlers Company, set up in 1415, regulated the trade until the 18th century. It obliged cutlers to mark their wares with their personal devices.",
