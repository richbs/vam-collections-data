They were given papal approval in 1199. They oversaw the colonisation by German settlers and the imposition of Christianity in what is now Poland and Lithuania. Like their counterparts, the Templars, they operated a system of banking to get money 'to the front line'. (The Templars had suffered brutal suppression, and their assets were nationalised by the French crown soon after 1300.) This Bible was made in Li\u00e8ge for their house of Nieuwe Biesen in Maastricht, where the Teutonic Order owned property. The ornament in the initials is inhabited by dragons, heads and grotesques, which spill over into the margins.",
