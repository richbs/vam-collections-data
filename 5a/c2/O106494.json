It was revived in Europe during the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Occasionally, as in this case, later engravers were so skilled at reproducing the techniques and styles of the ancient artists that it can be very difficult to decide which era a gem comes from.  Cupid, the god of love, here leans on a knotty staff which may represent the club of Hercules. In this guise he symbolizes the power of love to disarm the strong.",

Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.",
