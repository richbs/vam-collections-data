It has three drawers veneered <i>sans traverse</i>, and is fitted with lacquered brass mounts.\n\nThe top is decorated with a basket of flowers on a sycamore(?) ground, within a rococo cartouche, flanked on either side by parquetry panels that are shaped to follow the serpentine outline of the top. This composition is framed by two wide cross-banded borders - the inner border in green-stained sycamore(?), decorated with trailing branches, scrolling cross-banded strapwork, and with profile busts in medallions at each corner; the outer border in diagonally banded kingwood(?), edged with a plain brass moulding. \n\nThe front, comprising the three drawer-fronts, is decorated to echo the top - but with a ribbon-tied bouquet of flowers instead of a basket of flowers - and fitted with rococo escutcheons and apron mount, and classical bail handles (the handles replaced). The sides are decorated more simply with bouquets of flowers, on a sycamore(?) ground and with two cross-banded borders echoing the treatment of the top and front. The front uprights are fitted with rococo angle-mounts, emphasizing the rococo form.\n\nThe marquetry is enhanced by staining and mastic-filled engraving to give it more pictorial realism. The green stain surviving in the inner cross-banding and in several details is an indication that originally it would have been stained with a variety of colours (most of which fade from exposure to light). On the top the engraving has been largely reworked, but most of the engraving on the front and sides is original. \n\nThe pine carcase has four thick uprights at the corners, to which the rest of the frame is tenoned, nailed or glued. The back and apparently the top are of framed panel construction, but the bottom and sides are made of boards, glued and in places nailed together, and nailed or tenoned to the frame. Two open-framed dustboards, to support the drawers, are joined to the uprights by housing and tenon joints. \n\nThe drawers are made with pine fronts, in laminated sections, and oak back and sides, dovetailed together at the front and back corners. The drawer-bottoms, made of oak boards grained from front to back, are housed in grooves in the front and sides and nailed up to the back. \n\nThe carcase has been extensively repaired, the drawers to a lesser extent.",

            "public_access_description": "This commode was at one time thought to be German, but more recently it has been suggested that it was made in Britain by an immigrant (German) cabinetmaker. Its swelling, bomb\u00e9 shape, the style of the marquetry, and certain features of the construction are very Germanic, but it also closely resembles some commodes that appear to have been made in Marlborough, Wiltshire, in the workshop of a cabinet-maker named Henry Hill. Other pieces from Hill\u2019s workshop also show similarities to German furniture, and some have drawers lined with a decorative paper made in Augsburg, so it appears very likely that Hill did employ immigrant craftsmen, possibly from southern Germany.",
