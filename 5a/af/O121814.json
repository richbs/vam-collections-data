Small enamel panels of this sort were incorporated into various types of object, especially book covers and icon frames. They were also sometimes re-used in new contexts - the famous Golden Altar Frontal in St Mark's, Venice, includes a number of similar Byzantine roundels. They were not made for the frontal, but were added to it, as plunder from the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Similar traces of re-use are visible on the V&A panel in the form of the two mounting holes at the top of the panel. Byzantine goldsmtihs did not pierce enamels of this sort. It is, however, impossible to date when these holes were made, and they may be as late as the nineteenth century.",

As they could easily be incorporated into different types of setting, they were often re-used in new contexts as time went on.

            "historical_context_note": "This enamel is of a type usually referred to as the 'typical' Byzantine enamel. In other words, it is set into a metal plaque, in this case gold, where the outlines of the figure and of the inscription are depressions in the metal. Within the depression, gold wires have been used to form the compartments for the enamel to fill. This type of enamel, a combination in effect, of cloisson\u00e9 and champlev\u00e9, produces a figure on a gold metal ground, and is sometimes referred to by the German term 'Senkschmelz'. Researchers now believe that the earliest example of this technique occurs on the reliquary of the True Cross in the cathedral treasury at Limburg an der Lahn, made 963-989. The technique remained popular in the Byzantine world into the twelfth century.\n\nThe St Paul was probably one of a series of panels, and indeed, close similarities have been noted between the V&A enamel and another now in the Martin d'Arcy Collection, Loyola University Museum of Art, Chicago.\n\nSmall enamel panels of this sort could be incorporated into various kinds of objects, especially book covers, icon frames and the like. They were also often re-used in new contexts - for example, the famous 'pala d'oro' of San Marco, Venice, includes a number of Byzantine roundels of apostles broadly comparable to the V&A St Paul. They were not made for the pala, but were incorporated into it, probably at the time of the pala's renewal in the early thirteenth century, with plunder from the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Similar traces of re-use are visible on the V&A panel in the form of the two mounting holes at the top of the panel (there are traces of a third mounting hole, now trimmed away from the lower edge of the panel). Enamels of this sort were not pierced by Byzantine goldsmiths in order to be mounted. It should, however, be noted that there is no way of dating the holes on the V&A enamel, which may be as late as the nineteenth century.",
