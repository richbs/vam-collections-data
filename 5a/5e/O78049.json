Race prizes, such as this ewer, became an important element in the silversmith's trade of the period. Some of the traditional markets for silver, such as tableware, were declining. The demand for expensive and glamorous sporting trophies and presentation silver allowed the silversmith to demonstrate skill and artistry.\n\nTime\nTwo-handled cups, the standard form of 18th-century trophies, were replaced by more adventurous designs in the 19th century. Many of the grandest examples used sculpture as part of a bold design concept. These represented the high point of Victorian trophy production. These large pieces dominated the displays of  prominent British silversmiths at international exhibitions and gained them valuable publicity. By the late 19th century smaller, more commercial trophies, particularly in the form of a cup, could be ordered from manufacturers' catalogues and engraved with the date of the sporting event and the name of the winner.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis trophy appears to be specifically designed as a race prize for yachting, as it features scenes of yacht racing around its elongated neck. The waves in the sailing scene complement the Rococo ornament of C-shaped scrolls and shell feet. However, many manufacturers advertised trophies with similar decoration which could be 'embossed for any sport'.",
