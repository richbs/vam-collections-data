This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nGilbey was a support act on the evening\u2019s programme, which starred Charles Prinz and his 17 Lions. But the review in the local newspaper noted,\n\nA patter comedian of the first water is Mr George Gilbey who was last night cheered to the echo for his account of a football match, and his no less funny song \u2018Why Should I?\u2019 Gilbey has a style all his own, and his jokes have the virtue of being strictly original.\n\nWhen he appeared at the Grand the following September the reviewer noted the excellence of Gilbey as Spouty the footballer.",
