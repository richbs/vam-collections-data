By 1700 they were produced in very large numbers, particularly in the Netherlands. \n\nThe patterns were created by carved wooden moulds, into which the dampened panel of leather was pressed.  When dry, the raised areas were decorated with silver-coloured metal foil, varnished to give the effect of gilding. The ground areas were coloured with paints or varnishes, which might also be used to add highlights to the foiled areas.  Such panels are usually referred to as 'gilt leather' although no gold leaf was used.  They were particularly popular for dining rooms, where they did not trap food smells as textile hangings would do. \n\nThis pattern must have been highly popular.  Several versions are known, with different coloured finishes, both in museum collections and surviving in houses and public buildings as far apart as Brussels and Denmark.",
