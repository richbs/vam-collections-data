            "public_access_description": "Silver buttons were an important element of traditional dress in Spain.  Unlike in most other European countries, women were just as likely to wear them as men.  Both sexes wore them in extravagant quantities, along the seams of jackets and trousers and in bunches at the wrist, as well as to fasten clothes.  \n\nThey were rarely sewn directly on to the clothing.  In Spain, buttons usually had toggle fittings, consisting of a bar permanently attached to the button by an oval loop.  They were used to fasten the clothing in the same way that cuff-links are still used today.\n\nThis button was made in Salamanca.  Salamanca was famous for its filigree buttons in the 19th century, and is so associated with them that they have become the unofficial emblem of the town.  The most typical kind have a sheet metal back with scalloped edge, like this one, and an open filigree front, but the quality of the filigree work on this button is much finer than usual.  It was bought, with two others, for eight shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
