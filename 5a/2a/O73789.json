Its position may have varied according to the nature of the occasion, for it has designs on both sides. Such brilliant and showy pieces were frequently presentation items. Here the celebratory theme is the popular scene of the birthday party of the 'Royal Mother of the West', (Xi Wang Mu), who is being given the peaches of everlasting life by the Eight Immortals. The technique is one peculiar to China, used during the 17th century but not often after that. The picture elements were carved through the built-up coats of dark lacquer on each wooden screen panel. Tinted lacquer and oil paints were then applied to the cut areas, producing a polychromatic effect on a black ground.",
