            "public_access_description": "Front cover of music sheet for The New Crystal Palace, a polka by J.E. Field. Illustrations drawn and lithographed by Augustus Butler. Published in London by Harry May, ca. late 19th century - early 20th century.\n\nIn 1851 Britain trumpeted it\"s technical supremacy by staging the Great Exhibition. The exhibition was planned by Prince Albert, and was based in the Crystal Palace built in London\"s Hyde Park. The exhibition building was vast, and had an area of 69 892 sq. m (772 289 sq. ft). Joseph Paxton designed the building using new technology, mainly prefabricated glass and iron panels. The amount of glass in the building lead the magazine Punch to nickname the building the Crystal Palace, and that name stuck. When the exhibition closed the Palace was taken down and rebuilt near Sydenham in London, but it later burnt down in 1936. However, the building\"s name lived on, and that area of South London is now known as Crystal Palace.\u00ac\u00acThe polka sold with this music cover celebrates the opening of this beautiful building. Polkas were fast dances, in quick duple time with steps on the first three beats and a small hop on the fourth. They originated in Bohemia in the early 19th century and quickly spread throughout Europe. Polkas were first introduced to Prague in 1837 and then to Vienna and St. Petersburg in 1839, Paris in 1840, and finally London in 1844.",
