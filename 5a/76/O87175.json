In the background is an Italianate landscape with a bridge leading to a village, with mountains in the distance.\n\nThe picture fills the fan leaf and has been arranged to conform to the shape of the leaf. The composition and subject appear to have been influenced by the paintings of Claude-Joseph Vernet (1714-1789). The painting technique is of a high standard for a fan.\n\nThe reverse is of paper, painted in watercolours with a sketchily painted scene of a seascape showing a man and a dog running across a rickety bridge towards a ship anchored beside a ruined building. In the distance are a group of cottages around a tower with a mountain beyond.\n\nThe sticks and guards are of finely carved and pierced ivory decorated with cupids, lovers and musical instruments. The upper portion of each guard is backed with mother of pearl.",

He was famous for his harbour scenes, and his paintings characteristically show groups of fishermen and fishing boats.  The painter of the fan leaf has faithfully reproduced Vernet\u2019s style and composition. The wide, closely spaced ivory sticks are typical of the 1750s. The scene carved on the guardsticks shows a gentleman talking to a cherub.  As usual, the image on the sticks bears no relation to that on the leaf. This is because each part of the fan was usually designed by different artists and made separately.",
