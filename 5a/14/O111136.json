Although ivory, wood and stone are relatively easy to carve, other materials such as gemstones are much more demanding. Most of these carvings were made for wealthy patrons and collectors, who delighted in the rarity of the material and quality of the carving. \n\nThe sculptor of this cup and cover, Philipp Senger (Filippo Sengher) was an ivory turner to Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1642-1723) and made this object in 1681. He appears to have made this piece entirely on a lathe, including the figure that supports the cup. The elegant shape recalls silver vessels, but it was designed as a work of art and was not destined to function as a goblet.\n\nThis virtuoso piece epitomises the artist's skill as a turner. It is interesting to see here that the one figurative element, the supporting putto, is turned, rather than carved.",
