She established herself as one of the leading jewellers of the 1960s, winning many major jewellery awards and became the first woman to become a Freeman of the Goldsmiths Company in a professional capacity. \nShe was particularly noted for her innovative yet elegant rings, described by the jewellery historian Peter Hinks as 'deft and wearable' . This example was part of a series of rings using interlocking forms which she made in the 1970s. She also pioneered the use of  interlocking wedding and engagement rings. \nShe also promoted modern jewellery through her work as a teacher, as Professor of Jewellery and Silversmithing at the Glasgow School of Art and then at the Sir John Cass Department of Silversmithing, Jewellery and Allied Arts of London's Guildhall University.",
