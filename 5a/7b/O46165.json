The figure wears an elaborate pantomime costume that imitates a bag of the popular confectionary sweet known as \"Jelly Tots\".  The costume consists of a yellow pleated dress which gathers in a large ruffle at the neck.  On the dress, below the breast and ending at the knee is a decorative panel which takes the form of an enlarged version of the graphics and artwork from the cover of a \"Jelly Tots\" bag or box (\"Jelly Tots\" logo in orange, red blue, and green; and the face of a smiling male child on a white background).  The figure wears orange gloves and a pair of orange shoes which have a decorative pom pom in the style of a \"Jelly Tot\".  The outfit is completed by a large white hat which is covered in variously coloured pom poms, also in the style of a \"Jelly Tot\". The figure wears an orange wig, and a large pair of white glasses with green lenses.  Annotated by artist.",
