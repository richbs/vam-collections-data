It was made by one of the Pajots, either Gilbert (d. 1853) or his son, Jean-Baptiste (1817-1863). This family produced the most sought-after hurdy-gurdies in France during the 19th century and was based in Jenzat, in the Auvergne.",

Jean Pajot, the father, was the first known member of this hurdy-gurdy-making family. He made his first instruments at Jenzat in 1795 and died in 1847. His son Gilbert carried on the business until his death in 1853, when he was succeeded by his son, Jean-Baptiste (1817-1863). The hand-written date on the label could either be 1835 or 1855, and the <i>mention honorable</i> may possibly refer to the <i>Exposition Universelle</i> of Paris (1855). The earlier date would make Gilbert the maker and later one his son, Jean-Baptiste.",
