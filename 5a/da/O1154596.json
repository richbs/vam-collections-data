Gibbs.\n\nAccording to the text, this mandrill could be seen drinking his grog and smoking his pipe \u2018with great  dexterity\u2019, at the Royal Menagerie in the King\u2019s Mews.  It was in a former royal stables, just off what is now Trafalgar Square. Exotic animals were a huge attraction in the days before the circus, when few people travelled abroad and couldn't see animals like this. Travelling menageries or \u2018beast shows' began in  Britain in the late 18th century, touring the country and appearing at fairgrounds with attractions such as an elephant, a zebra, or a lion. London had a popular  menagerie at Exeter Change, near The Strand, founded in 1773, and the Tower of London had  boasted a royal menagerie since the 13th century. By 1830 however, the heyday of menageries was over. The animals at Exeter Change went to the Surrey Zoological Gardens in Walworth, and all animals belonging to the Crown (presumably including the mandrill) to the Zoological Society who, in 1828, opened a zoo in Regent's Park.",
