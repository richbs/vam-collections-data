After Paolo's death in 1588, his workshop was run by Benedetto and his sons Carlo and Gabriele. In 1556, at age 18, Benedetto assisted Paolo on the decoration of the ceiling of San Sebastiano, Venice, and was probably Veronese's principal collaborator at the Villa Barbaro at Maser (ca. 1561), producing much of the illusionistic architecture and some of the landscapes (in situ). He assisted Veronese with two commissions at the Doge's Palace, Venice (1574-82), and the Martyrdom of St Justine, Padua in 1575. The Birth of the Virgin (1577; Venice, Accademia), commissioned for the Scuola dei Mercanti, is one of the few paintings documented as designed and executed by Benedetto Caliari, the forms are heavy, strongly modelled versions of Veronese's types, and the hand is somewhat mechanical.\nThe female figures in CAI. 166 and CAI.166 posesthe same delicate small heads with elaborate hairdress and heavy  muscular bodies with attenuated limbs employed by Veronese and Benedetto although executed with less skill. They appear to have been painted as an overdoor (or modello?) much like the feigned sculptures painted in fresco by Veronese and Benedetto in the Sala dell'Olimpo in the Villa Barbaro ca. 1560 which are similarly mounted over a triangular pediment.",

Subsequently Berenson (1957) ascribed CAI.166/67 (nos. 384-85) to Zelotti. This is a reasonable attribution which does not entirely contradict Venturi's, for Zelotti collaborated with Veronese on the fresco decoration of the Villa Soranza and the differentiation of their respective contributions remains controversial (<i>Mostra Paolo Veronese</i>, Ca' Giustinian, Venice, 1939, no. 3 ff.; for the villa itself see G. Bordignon Favero, <i>La Ville Soranza</i>, Treviso, 1958, and E. Langenskiold in <i>Michele Sanmicheli, studi raccolti dall'Accademia di Agricoltora, Scienze e Lettere di Verona</i>, 1960, pp. 69-73; for a recent discussion of the frescoes, M. Levey, 'An early dated Veronese' in <i>Burl. Mag.</i>, cii, 1960, p. 11 ff.). As some of the Villa Soranza frescoes were sold in England in 1825, and in view of the fact that Venturi described CAI.166/67 (nos. 384-85) as 'transferred to canvas', it might have been inferred that they formed part of this series. However, they are clearly painted in oil on canvas; a fact which must be taken to exclude this possibility. Indeed, they are closer in style and technique to other grisaille canvases by Zelotti, in particular the allegory of Cyprus on the ceiling of the Consiglio dei Dieci in the Palazzo Ducale, Venice (Hadeln, <i>op, cit.</i>, p. 215, fig. 28) and the allegories of the Four Seasons in the Cumner Art Gallery, Jacksonville. CAI.166/67 have also been tentatively linked with a study by Veronese on the reverse of his drawing of the Coronation of the Virgin at Christ Church, Oxford (repr. <i>Disegni veronese del Cinquecento</i>, exhibition, Venice, Fondazione Cini, 1971, no. 64). \nVenturi identified CAI.166/67 as allegories of Music and Poetry. This is a convincing explanation if the object held by the figure in CAI.166 is indeed a musical instrument. Certainly the suggestion that it is intended to represent a string instrument is more convincing than Long's (1925) interpretation of it as a 'piece of carving', but in view of the large amount of repainting it is no longer possible to speak with certainty on this point. \n\nCondition.

            "history_note": "The painting is mentioned, with CAI 167, in a letter dated 18 March 1873 (private collection), from the painter Legros to his friend and patron Constantine Alexander Ionides. Legros, then in Venice, attributes the two figures to Veronese and asks his patron the authorization to purchase the works on his behalf, for the sum of \u00a3100. However, there is no mention of such a purchase in C. A. Ionides' exhaustive personal inventory (private collection), which was initially compiled in November 1881 and maintained until 1899. Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\n\nThe work and its companion were part of the large bequest made by C. A. Ionides to the V&A in 1900.\nThe collection formed by Constantine Ionides includes works of a wide variety of schools, periods and artists. His collection includes Old Masters, 17th century works, contemporary British works and French 19th century works. Constantine formed friendships with artists of the day, especially Legros, who, having spent 17 years in Britain, became a naturalise British citizen. Constantine proved a stable and generous buyer of Legros work, while Legros, in turn, became an advisor in the matters of art to the attentive Constantine. \nConstantine\u2019s plans concerning his collection conformed to a more \u2018public-welfare\u2019 vein of thought than his father or brother. He decided to donate his collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum, instead of privately distributing it or disposing of it in a Sales room.\n\nHis will states:\n\n'All my pictures both in oil and water colours and crayon or coloured chalks (but subject as to my family portraits to the interest herein before given to my said Wife) and all my etchings drawings and engravings to the South Kensington Museum for the benefit of the nation to be kept there as one separate collection to be called \"The Constantine Alexander Ionides Collection\" and not distributed over the Museum or lent for exhibition. And I desire that the said Etchings Drawings and Engravings shall be framed and glazed by and at the expense of the authorities of the Museum so that Students there can easily see them.'\n\nThe collection bequeathed to the museum in 1901 comprises 1138 pictures, drawing and prints, to which a further 20 items were added on the death of his widow in 1920. The works are listed in the V&A catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection.\n\nHistorical significance: Benedetto Caliari (1538-1598) was an Italian painter and brother of Paolo Caliari, better known as Paolo Veronese. After Paolo's death in 1588, his workshop was run by Benedetto and his sons Carlo and Gabriele. In 1556, at age 18, Benedetto assisted Paolo on the decoration of the ceiling of San Sebastiano, Venice, and was probably Veronese's principal collaborator at the Villa Barbaro at Maser (ca. 1561), producing much of the illusionistic architecture and some of the landscapes (in situ). He assisted Veronese with two commissions at the Doge's Palace, Venice (1574-82), and the Martyrdom of St Justine, Padua in 1575. The Birth of the Virgin (1577; Venice, Accademia), commissioned for the Scuola dei Mercanti, is one of the few paintings documented as designed and executed by Benedetto Caliari, the forms are heavy, strongly modelled versions of Veronese's types, and the hand is somewhat mechanical.\nThe female figures in CAI. 166 and CAI.166 posesthe same delicate small heads with elaborate hairdress and heavy  muscular bodies with attenuated limbs employed by Veronese and Benedetto although executed with less skill. They appear to have been painted as an overdoor (or <i>modello</i>?) much like the feigned sculptures painted in fresco by Veronese and Benedetto in the Sala dell'Olimpo in the Villa Barbaro ca. 1560 which are similarly mounted over a triangular pediment.",

            "historical_context_note": "Illusionism in painting describes the attempt to make images that seemingly share or extend the three-dimensional space in which the spectator stands. The term is also applied in sculpture, for a presentation of figures that attempts in some way to make them seem alive, and occasionally in architecture, for a presentation of structures that attempts in some way to enhance their dimensions. \nFor imagery, the painter may represent a flat surface from which planes jut and recede to a slight depth or great distance- an effect also known as <i>trompe l'oeil</i>. This practice was common in antiquity and in Italian painting from the 15th century.\n\n<i>Grisaille</i> is a term applied to monochrome painting carried out mostly in shades of grey. The use of the French word can be traced only to 1625, although grisaille painting was done in preceding centuries. The origin of monochrome figure painting is to be found in Italian wall painting such as Giotto's painted the stone-coloured allegories of the Virtues and Vices, conceived as statues facing each other in fictive niches on the walls of the nave in the Arena Chapel in Padua (1303-06). The allegories, subordinated by their stone quality to the coloured (and therefore more lifelike) figures in the scenes from the History of Salvation, have nonetheless the highest degree of reality within the picture programme because of their illusionistic presentation. \n\nGrisaille painting increasingly appeared in thematically or formally subordinate areas, however the explicit imitation of stone continued to play an important role. In the large fresco programmes of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries grisaille helped to spread illusionism to painting in colour. Michelangelo's polychrome prophets and sibyls (1508-12) on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome for example are placed between grisaille figures appearing like reliefs or caryatids on pilasters and are thrust by them into the beholder's space. The case is similar with Annibale Carracci's frescoes (1597-1600) of the Galleria of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome or Paolo Veronese's wall paintings (1561-2) in the Villa Barbaro in Maser.",
