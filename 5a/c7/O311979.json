Unlike most other French medals of this date, a simple image is used: the figure of the imprisoned soldier, isolated from family and friends, whose only hope of contact is the letter he writes. \n\nThroughout the Great War, a total of half a million French soldiers were taken prisoner, and their treatment as prisoners of war was in theory governed by conventions laid down by the International Red Cross.",
