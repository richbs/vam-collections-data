The main band of decoration has a central line of oval shaped motifs (buff, light and dark brown). This line is bordered on either side with a line of Islamic script (blue and buff). On the outer side of the script are two rows of honeycomb shapes (pink and blue) with four dots within each segment. Cursive script is visible in one small area on one side. The next band of decoration repeats the line of oval shaped motifs but not much remains. The fabric is stained and torn.",

The next band of decoration repeats the line of oval shaped motifs but not much remains. The fabric is stained and torn. In the Abbasid  period (AD750-1258) fabrics, called tiraz, were made in present  day Iraq and Egypt. The word  came to mean honorific robes with  woven  or embroidered inscriptions. Text from the Koran was  embroided across the fabric with a line of geometric shapes above  that were probably for decoration. Text might also include  information such as the name of the reigning caliph, place of  production and date.",
