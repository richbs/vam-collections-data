The Villa Borghese was begun in 1605 for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul v. It was a showcase for the famous Borghese collection of antiquities. This vase, of calyx-crater form, decorated with two satyrs\u2019 heads and a hanging ox-skin, is illustrated in Francesco Aquila\u2019s Raccolta di Vasi, 1713, (Berlin 1939, II40), pl.6, with the lettering \u2018vaso antico di marmot bianco collocate sul piano della scala che introduce nel Palazzo della Villa Borghesiana di Roma\u2019. While clearly showing the same object, there are many differences in detail, especially in the base. \n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
