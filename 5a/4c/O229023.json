He discovered his talent for  woodcutting and engraving when introduced to it by the artists James Pryde and William Nicholson. His produced his first wood engraving in 1893, and by 1899 he had engraved nearly 200 blocks, specialising in the new technique of 'white line' wood engravings in which the lines are un-inked and the image emerges from the surrounding ink. \n\nThis is an engravings Craig made after his 1903 production of The Vikings at the Imperial Theatre. Ellen Terry took over the management of the Imperial Theatre and with complete artistic control she chose the works in which she would appear. The new venture focused on the plays of George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen, including Ibsen's  The Vikings of Helgeland by Ibsen in 1903, with Terry as Hiordis",
