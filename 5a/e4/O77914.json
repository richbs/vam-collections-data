            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is a very rare English example of the art of painting on the reverse of glass. Backed with a metal foil, the colours take on a jewelled effect. This technique is commonly known as 'verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9' after the Parisian picture-framer Jean Baptiste Glomy (died 1786), who practised it in the 18th century. The invention of verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9 dates far before then, however, and the Museum has several earlier Italian devotional plaques made in this way. Certainly the technique was known in England as early as the 13th century, but by the 17th century the art seems to have died out.\n\nHeraldry\nDesigned to hang on the wall of a domestic interior, this heraldic panel bears the arms of Anthony Shuckburgh of Warwickshire impaled with those of his second wife, Anne Skeffington. Plaques such as this were used, like stained-glass windows, to advertise a family's status and ancestry. A shield of arms almost identical to this decorates a window in Upper Shuckburgh church and is thought to be the work of the same glass painter.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe production of verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9 involves many stages. First, the outline of the design is painted on the reverse of a pane of clear glass and thick black enamel is applied to those areas that are to remain black. Where areas of shading are required, the glass is coated with a thin wash of reddish-brown enamel which can be scratched away with a needle to create fine details such as the boys' hair. Transparent enamel colours are finally applied and backed with silver or gold leaf foils.",
