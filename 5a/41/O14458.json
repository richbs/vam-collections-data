Imports of technically superior Venetian glass were made throughout the 17th century and in the 18th century massive importation of English lead glass took place. Indian glass is usually not of high quality, and relies for its aesthetic effect on bright colours and bold surface decoration which has the additional benefit of concealing the many imperfections usually found in the glass. Tobacco was introduced into the Mughal empire at the beginning of the 17th century, and the habit of smoking it through water pipes, or huqqas (\"hubble bubbles\"), such as this, spread quickly.",
