They were made of fragile  materials such as ribbed silk although leather ankle boots were also becoming more and more fashionable.  Many women protected their boots from the dirt and damp by wearing overshoes known as pattens or clogs.  The overshoe was usually flat with a square toe cap to match the shoes and had  leather straps for fastening.  Ankle boots went out of fashion during the 1880s.\nThe square toe became popular in about 1825.  The fashion for square toes lasted until the 1870s when broad and rounded toes were favoured by both men and women.  By the 1880s pointed toes were in fashion",
