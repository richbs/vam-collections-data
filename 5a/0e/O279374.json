The central field is decorated in reserve against a ground of golden-brown lustre. It is divided into compartments by an octagon which closes off the points of the star, which are filled with simple palmettes. The octagon has a double border filled with a pearl motif. Inside the octagon is a seated animal with a bushy tail, perhaps a fox, whose body is decorated with stippled spots in lustre. There are palmette flowers and leaves in the background. Around the edge is a border inscription in large cursive script, the letters outlined in lustre on a white ground; the background to the border is painted in cobalt blue with the letters left in white. Made in Iran (Kashan), early 14th century.",
