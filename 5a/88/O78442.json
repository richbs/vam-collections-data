The basic form of knives and forks had also become standardised by this date.\n\nHistory\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, the rapid advance in mechanisation had led to a standardisation in the shapes and designs of flatware (spoons and forks). Because ceramic or enamel handles were prone to damage, their use gradually declined, and forks made entirely of silver came back into use. The fork was generally die-stamped in one piece, with four tines (prongs) and a flattened handle. This pattern is known as the 'Hourglass', a variant on the standard  King's pattern, itself based on 18th-century French designs. The ends of the stem were usually turned up, a practical measure, so that the fork was more comfortable to hold. Forks were placed on the table with their backs uppermost.",
