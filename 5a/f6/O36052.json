            "public_access_description": "A ciborium is a covered cup used to hold the Host for the Catholic ceremony of the Eucharist. It usually resembles a chalice, the cup used to hold the wine for the Eucharist, but with a bowl of a rounder shape and a lid surmounted with a cross or other sacred design. Ciboria and chalices are usually made of, or plated with, precious metal because of their holy contents.\nThis ciborium, made in Naples in 1720, probably by the goldsmith Francesco Avellino, is a striking design. The gilt receptacle at the top is in the shape of a flaming heart. The symbol of the flaming heart, a rayed or burning heart topped with a small cross or crown and often pierced with a spear or ringed by a crown of thorns, is also known as the inflamed heart or Sacred Heart. It is a Christian devotional image; as a heart is traditionally a symbol of love and courage, the flaming heart is designed to represent Jesus' humanity and inner spirit. \nThe silver stem of this ciborium is in the shape of an eagle standing on a rocky base with its wings upraised, supporting the flaming heart on its shoulders. The eagle is the symbol of St. John, one of the four Evangelists, the authors of the Gospels in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The Evangelists are often represented by symbols in art, and the eagle is the symbol of St. John as his Gospel is considered to be the most spiritually uplifting and revelatory of the four. The idea that St. John in his Gospel contemplates God directly links with the mythological idea that the eagle was the only creature which could look unflinchingly into the sun. Church lecterns (book desks) were often made in the shape of an eagle with outspread wings as a symbol of divine inspiration, but the use of the same design here for a ciborium is unusual.",
