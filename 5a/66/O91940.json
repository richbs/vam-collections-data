In France during the 18th century, fashionable women and men wore black patches of gummed taffeta on their faces to emphasize the beauty or whiteness of their skin. \n\nThis example has been decorated using the intricate technique of piqu\u00e9 which was perfected in Paris in the 18th century. It required skilled craftsmen to inlay turtle shell (now known as tortoiseshell) with tiny gold pins (known as piqu\u00e9 point) or strips of gold in shallow grooves (piqu\u00e9 pos\u00e9). The extremely fine piqu\u00e9 point work on this box depicts a flower basket, a popular motif in France during this period.",
