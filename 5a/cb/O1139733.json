Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk programme was produced for a performance of The Pink Dominos by Charles Wyndham's company at the Criterion Theatre, Piccadilly Circus, the intimate underground theatre that opened in March 1874 and which became known as one of the leading light comedy houses in London. Charles Wyndham (1837-1919) had made his name in London in 1866, playing in a burlesque at the Royalty Theatre. He was in his element in the type of risqu\u00e9 farces often adapted from French originals produced at the Criterion, including Doe and Rose's version of The Great Divorce Case, James Albery's The Pink Dominos and W.S. Gilbert's On Bail.\n\nCharles Wyndham (1837-1919) who starred in The Pink Dominos as Charles Greythorne was associated with the Criterion for over 20 years. He first appeared at the Criterion in December 1875 in the comedy Brighton. By Easter 1876 he was a profit-sharing partner in the Criterion, leased by Alex Henderson. Wyndham was in his element in the risqu\u00e9 farces at the Criterion often adapted from French originals, including The Great Divorce Case, The Pink Dominos and W.S. Gilbert's On Bail.",
