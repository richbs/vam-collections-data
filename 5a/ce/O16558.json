He based his methods of working on those of Constable, evidenced in this painting by the fresh colours and sparkling light.  Watts's favourite location for painting was the countryside around the river Wye from central Wales to the estuary of the river Severn, with its gently rolling hills and lush foliage. Also like Constable, Watts preferred the landscape in high summer, the sun at its most powerful and the sky at its brightest.  The scene is populated: a mother and child stroll along the river path, birds soar in the sky, cows graze by the water's edge, and the boats slowly drift along, hardly disturbing the mirror reflections on the water's surface.",

Probably entered RA Schools (a William Watts of the same age is recorded winning medals 1819-21). Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1821 and 1860, 108 at the BI 1823-62, and 71 at the SBA 1825-38; almost all were landscapes in England, Scotland and Wales, and two Rouen subjects. Based his style closely on Constable and, like him, lived in Hampstead, London. Full-size paintings and oil sketches frequently have been confused with Constable's work, even in their lifetimes, particularly when the subjects are similar. Died Hampstead 4 July 1870. \nLIT: \tC R Leslie Memoirs of the Life of John Constable ed A Shirley 1937, pp1xxxiii-iv; Constable Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1976, pp193-4; I Fleming-Williams and L Parris The Discovery of Constable 1984, pp205-11 \n\nOn the Wye \n262-1866 Neg70948 \nCanvas, 85.1 X 118.4 cm (33\u00bd \u00d7 46 \u00bd ins) Purchased 1866 \nWatts exhibited several scenes on the river Wye: five at the RA between 1828 and 1848, three at the BI 1824-34, and two at the SBA in 1831 and 1834. The landscape around the river from central Wales to the Severn estuary provided his favourite subjects. The exact location of the present scene has not been identified. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
