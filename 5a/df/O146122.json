This is followed by a blue border, cut from a lozenge strip - it is decorated with a white stem meander carrying red rosettes and brown star flowers, red pointed buds and isolated yellow leaves. Then a narrow red border edging a wider dark pink ground, pieced before being embroidered.  A white interrupted meandering stem with blue leaves and yellow star shaped flowers.  There is a narrow red border followed by a repeat of the blue ground border and a narrow yellow border ending with an undecorated outer red border. \nAll the major seams are concealed by a thick black and white silk cord.\nEmbroidery thread: mostly unplied but the red silk in 2S. White, light blue, light green, yellow, light brown, red, pink.\nInset wool: scarlet, olive green, blue, two shades of yellow, dark pink, light brown, black, white, off-white, dark green, purple.\nFacing: bias cut striped wool; dark blue stripe with a small leaf motif in 2 variations and a white stripe with a dark blue leaf meander with a small floral sprig - in white, pink, pale green and deep yellow.\nIt was originally backed with yellow silk satin, but only traces remain.",
