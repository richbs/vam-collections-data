The long sleeves are set in at right angles; there is a diamond shaped gusset under the arm.  The neck is straight across the back but has been cut into a slightly angular circle with a very deep slit, almost to waist level.  The back is undecorated, but there is a broad band of embroidery around the rest; silver-gilt thread forming rough lozenges edged with black and silver reciprocal triangles. A black silk cord has been attached to the inner edge; this forms a loop at the top left hand side.  A piece of black thread suggests there might have been a button on the top right hand side. The same border pattern forms a band along the bottom of the front centre panel.  This panel has a horizontal seam across the top which seems to cut through some of the embroidery.  Down both sides it is attached with a narrow silk insertion.  The embroidered design forms a truncated arch shape: a spray of 3 pink carnations with dark and light blue details alternates with a spray of 3 mauve carnations [faded] with dark pink, dark and light blue details.  These two are in off-set rows.  There is a rolled hem.  There is a selvedge at each wrist.\nCotton Thread [or is it silk?]: Z-spun\nSilk Thread:2S; dark pink, light pink, light mauve, light blue, dark blue, very light green, black.\nMetal Thread: [1] silver stripe open and close S-wound on white silk core; [2] silver-gilt open and close S-wound on cream silk core.",
