This vase was made after an English porcelain original with a striped ground and medallions painted in grisaille made at the Chelsea-Derby factory, some of which have marks that have recently been dated to around 1783-\u20134.\n\nNeo-classical shapes were especially popular at the Derby factory after 1770 and Chinese copies may have been made after 1785. The vase is decorated with an oval medallion on either side, one containing a woman holding a garland and the other a landscape. The female figure in classical dress reflected the new European taste for neo-classical designs, while the landscape may have been inspired by views of the Derbyshire countryside that were painted on the Derby originals. Chinese copies of the Derby originals would have first been made in Jingdezhen and sent to the workshops in Guangzhou to be painted. Enamelled copper versions of the Derby vessels were also produced in the workshops of Guangzhou.",
