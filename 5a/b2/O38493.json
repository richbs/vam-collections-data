The woman, who is barefooted, and whose clothes show signs of wear and mending, is dressed in a blue jacket over a drab-coloured bodice and short full red skirt.  She is standing knitting, her ball of yarn pegged on a three-legged rustic stool, near the baby's cradle, which is of the traditional tapering European shape with rockers, a partly boxed-in head and knob finials.  The cottage walls are of bare stone, and there are few other items in the room: a large book (probably a family Bible) and a ceramic jar on the window ledge; items stored on the wall (a string of onions, a pot lid, a pair of boots, a cooking pot and a lantern); and a tub, a kettle, and a pair of shoes on the floor. Up a low flight of steps (upon the bottom of which the young woman is partly standing) a kitchen grate with a lighted fire is visible through an open door.\nThe frame is a modern reproduction one (see Condition).",

The mothers of even the youngest children in such communities usually had to work to make sure that the family could afford food, so a relative or neighbour would look after (\u2018mind\u2019) the baby for a while.",
