Audrey Gotch was born in 1892, a child of the physiologist Professor Francis Gotch of Oxford University, and his wife Rosamund Brunel Gotch (n\u00e9e Horsley) and died in 1952 or 1959.  Family papers are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford: Francis and Rosamund's other children included Oliver, Veronica and Nancy; Rosamund's aunt Mary was the wife of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.  The exact identity of the 'C. Gotch' marked on four of the garments with the date 1899 is unknown: Caroline (Carrie) Gotch, the wife of the artist Thomas Cooper Gotch had only one child, Phyllis, who was born in 1882.",
