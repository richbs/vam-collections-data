The Weld children were second cousins of Richard Whitmore who was also painted by Bernard Lens in 1718 (Museum no. P.13-1971), and Katherine Whitmore, painted by Lens in 1724 (Museum no. P.14-1971). The Whitmore childrens' grandmother's maiden name was \u2018Weld\u2019, and Elizabeth Weld is one of the children of her nephew. \n\nThis family relation is of interest with regard to the way in which a miniature painter such as Bernard Lens worked in the early 18th century. Lens was based in London, where he taught drawing and miniature painting. He was a member of the convivial \u2018Rose & Crown\u2019 club for artists, and sketched regularly at the artists' academy set up by the Queen's principal painter, Sir Godfrey Kneller. Lens also regularly travelled through England, helping to restore and frame miniatures in old collections, painting copies for collectors, and, presumably with the recommendation of one family to another, visiting family homes to paint miniature portraits of family groups.",

Six of the miniatures, including this one, depict members of the Weld and Wolryche families.  The Welds of Willey, Shropshire,  and the Wolryches of Dudmaston, Shropshire, were related to the Whitmores of Lower Slaughter, Gloucestershire (See Burke\u2019s Landed Peerage).  In 1971 the V&A had acquired two miniatures of members of the Whitmore family, also by Bernard Lens (see P.13-1971).",
