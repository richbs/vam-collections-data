            "public_access_description": "Wilfrid R. Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland Advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis chalk drawing shows a Hawker Tempest plane with an enemy German plane. The German plane has been hit and is shown nose-diving to the ground, while in the distance its pilot is landing in a parachute. Black and white chalk has been used to define the markings of these planes. There is a feeling for the atmosphere of the scene through the use of black chalk to emulate the smoke that issues forth from the tail of the German plane. The viewpoint makes the audience feel that they are up in the sky and in the immediate vicinity of the action being positioned just below the spitfire while also having the dramatic viewpoint of looking down on the distant fields below. The revolutionary elliptical wing of the Spitfire meant that it was able to fly at a high top speed. This resulted in its being used by British and other Allied forces during World War II (1939-1940), in particular during the Battle of Britain (10th July - 31st October 1940). Illustrations such as this one showing an enemy aircraft being defeated by a Spitfire were popular at boosting morale during World War II.",
