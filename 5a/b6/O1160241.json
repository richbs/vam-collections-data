London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Peter Henry Emerson   American, worked in Britain   1856-1936\nIn the Barley Harvest, Suffolk   Published 1888\nPhotogravure\n237 X 243 mm   Mus. no. 2117-1896   Given by the photographer</i>\n\nPhotogravure printing in the improved form developed by Karel Klic came into use around 1880 and was the first widely used photo-mechanical printing process (excluding Woodburytype) to adequately reproduce the half-tones of a photograph.  Rather cheaper than carbon printing or Woodburytypes for quantity production, photogravure allowed prints of good quality to be run off quickly and at relatively low cost.  The largest commercial use of the process was in art publishing- the printing of facsimile copies of paintings (often coloured).  Their grain structure, which can be seen with the naked eye, distinguishes them from true photographic prints. \nThis example first appeared in Emerson's handsome (20 X 16 inches) book <i>Pictures of East Anglian Life</i> (1888) (Plate VI).  Afterwards Emerson made up portfolio sets of 10 prints and presented them to every photographic society in the country - and to the Museum as well.  They were part of his vigourous opposition to prevailing taste in art photography, represented by crude combination printing, glossy albumen papers, wholesale retouching and disregard for the aspect of natural conditions.  His position, deriving from a study of contemporary art (notably Whistler and Millet), was published as <i>Naturalistic Photography</i> (1889).  Here he states his preference for photogravure as the finest medium in which to present pure photography, exceeding even platinum.  The range of tints available in printing inks, carefully matched with the appropriate paper, 'beats mezzotint out of the field in its subtlety and delicacy'.  He schooled a number of photogravure companies into carrying out the completely unretouched results he required.\n<i>Pictures of East Anglian Life</i> carried epigraphs from Millet and from Oliver Goldsmith - 'But a bold peasantry, their country's pride/When once destroyed can never be supplied' - and was dedicated to the painter T.F. Goodall.  Emerson wrote with close observation:\n<sub>Here one man is honing his scythe, while another, his face streaming with perspiration, has taken off his hat with which to fan himself, and now stretches forth his hand to his mate, who, leaving his rake in the field, has brought the bottle of 'home-brewed' from which they will all quench their thirst.  Through the hot day they will work under the boiling summer sun until 4.30, or 'fourses', as it is now locally called, its name formerly being 'beavers'.</sub>\nHis text attacks rapacious 'upstart' landlords but although a Liberal as a young man, he described his politics as 'uncompromising Tory' and wrote that his political ideal was 'Bismark \"without the religion\"'.\"",
