There is an outer band with an undulating line forming a rounded arch enclosing a blue or red pointed carnation.  There is a pair of pale leaves where the line touches the inner border.  This band is not quilted and also forms the inner rectangular panel. There is a main border on three sides: it contains isolated, inward facing sprigs of 3 carnations, blue alternating with red except in the lower right hand corner where there are 2 blue ones.  It is quilted in a scale pattern.\nThe central rectangular panel contains a lobed niche.  Above it the spandrels have been filled with a diamond lattice, each diamond contains a bud.  The same blue or red carnation sprays are in irregularly spaced offset rows and there is a random scattering of a small snowdrop-like flower. 5 of these plus 9 buds form a ring around a circular medallion at the top of the niche which contains an illegible inscription.  The ground of the niche is quilted with a scale pattern.\nFacing: striped silk with a small floral motif.",
