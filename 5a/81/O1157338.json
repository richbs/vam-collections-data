The musical notation is in pen and ink but pencil annotation has been used to add phrases, presumably lines from the play, which the music is intended to accompany.  The sheets of manuscript paper have been tied together with thin lengths of cord.\n\nThis music comes from a collection of manuscript music relating to the 'Cooper Family', one of whom, Alfred Edward Cooper (1840-1901) worked as a 'Chef d'Orchestre'/Master of Music at the City of London Theatre and playhouses in South East England. Throughout his career Cooper collected and composed 'melos' to provide incidental music for Melodramas. \nThis piece, though perhaps not composed by Cooper (the composer is not recorded), is likely to have provided incidental music for productions of Burnt at Sea or The Fate of the Falcon at the City of London Theatre on the 3rd June 1844. These plays were written by Frederick Fox Cooper (1806-79) a dramatist, theatrical manager and journalist and the father of Arthur Edward Cooper. \nMelodramas such as these were a form of drama which was popular in the nineteenth century. They often featured a limited number of 'stock' characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent and a comic man engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. \nIn the melodramas produced in Paris, London music supplanted dialogue or, more often, augmented stage language, actors' gestures, and dramatic action, to evoke an emotional response or provide an aural signal of the true nature of a character.",
