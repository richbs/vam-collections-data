She says 'My work is a sculptural statement which is complete when off the figure... I am intrigued by the idea that the human body is capable of carrying large objects... therefore, I often construct form on a scale which puts the work into the category of body sculpture rather than jewellery.' It is a large piece, but because it is made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, it is very light.",
