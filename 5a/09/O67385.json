This oratory is known to have been no longer in existence by 1833.\n\nAndrei was keen on sponsoring building works, and was also responsible for the construction, in Pistoia, of the church of Sta Maria Maddalena (completed 1290) and for the rebuilding of the church of S. Marco.  His monument, by Gano da Siena, is in the Collegiata at Casole d'Elsa.",
