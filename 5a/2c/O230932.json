The two panels are stitched together, one above the other, both with their patterns facing the top. A border, with a seam across it, has been added to the right hand side. A border has been added across the top.\nSilver ground [silver strip close S-wound on pale yellow silk core] with 4 black and silver [silver strip open S-wound on white silk core] dishes on a blue leafy base with green and pink leaves and flowers, a pink cypress edged with green, more green leaves and a pink blossom either side of a trefoil-shaped medallion with a silver ground and 3 mauve and pink flowers. A large pink fan-shaped carnation is at the top. The integral border also has a silver ground [silver strip close S-wound on pale yellow silk core] with a discreet meander linking an upright blue iris and a round pink blossom along the bottom and a blue star-like flower, pink blossom and diagonal iris up the left hand side. The added border down the right hand side is bias cut with a cockerel, pink flower and blue flower. There are traces of silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core. In the upper panel a pale turquoise silk has been used instead of light green in the leaves immediately above the dish.\nBacking: pieced; white cotton twill with a light red check.\nThe piece has a partial interlining of paper or parchments below the seams, probably to reinforce them; bits of paper can be seen protruding through the stitching.",
