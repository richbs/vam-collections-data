            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 216-17\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"NEWTON, Gilbert Stuart, RA (1794-1835) \n\nBorn Halifax, Novia Scotia, Canada, 20 September 1794, of American parents; his uncle was the portrait painter Gilbert Stuart with whom he studied in Boston. Travelled to study in Florence, and visited Paris, where he made friends with C R Leslie (see entry above) and returned with him via Brussels and Antwerp to London 1817. Entered RA Schools. Exhibited 27 works, mostly portraits and literary subjects, at the RA between 1818 and 1833, and 22 at the BI 1819-31. Elected ARA 1828, RA 1832. Several of his works were engraved. Visited America 1831-2 and married there; on return, confined in the Chelsea asylum for the insane, where he died 5 August 1835. The Art Journal in 1864 thought him 'not a painter of great originality or power; but his works are characterised by much elegance both in design and execution'. \n\nLIT: \tGentleman's Magazine 1835, pp438-9 (obit); Athenaeum 15 August 1835, pp625-6 (obit); H Murray The Gems of Stuart Newton, RA 1842 (collection of engravings after his works); Art Joumal 1847, p280, 1864, pp13-15 \nSir Walter Scott \nF23 Neg 55905 \nCanvas, 22.8 X 19 cm (9 X 7 \u00bd ins) Forster Bequest 1876 \nAlmost certainly a version, about a third original size, of the three-quarter length oil painted by Newton for the publisher John Murray in 1824, which was presumably the portrait exhibited at the RA in 1825 (102) (Russell, cat no 141). The Murray portrait was engraved by W Finden and published by Murray in 1833; other prints, with variations, were also published. \nF G Kitton reproduces the Murray Portrait, but claims the original was that painted at the cottage at Chiefswood on the Scott estate in 1824, the cottage given to Scott's daughter, who lived there with her husband J G Lockhart, Scott's biographer. Russell (see Lit: below) is surely correct to see the latter as an oil sketch for the Murray portrait. Kitton also quotes Lockhart's opinion that it was 'the best domestic portrait ever done', and describes Scott as 'seated at table, holding a stick, and wearing his usual country dress - a green jacket, black neckcloth, and a leather belt round his shoulders for carrying a forester's axe' (F G Kitton 'Some portraits of Sir Walter Scott', Magazine of Art XIX, 1895, p4; the Murray painting repr XXVI, 1902, p59). \nRussell documents the painting of the Abbotsford portrait, beginning with John Constable's note on 10 July 1824 that C R Leslie was going to Abbotsford to paint Scott and 'Newton is going to do the same' (ed R B Beckett John Constable's Correspondence II, Ipswich 1964, p359). Newton stayed with Lockhart, who Russell suggests may have commissioned the portrait, at Chiefswood in August. Scott himself referred to Leslie's 'very ingenious countryman Newton'. Russell identifies the Abbotsford portrait as a preliminary sketch for the Murray picture, and the present work as certainly autograph, although the 'realisation of the features, notably like that of Finden's engraving of the Murray picture ... is a good deal less faithful than in either of the earlier versions'. \nRussell lists several drawings of Scott by Newton. There are many portraits of the famous poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832); the fullest published iconography is in Russell and in R Walker Regency Portraits 1985, I, pp442-5. Scott was painted several times in 1824 alone; Sir David Wilkie wrote on 1 November that 'Sir Walter Scott ... expects me at Abbotsford, and is ready to sit. He has, however, sat so frequently of late to artists ... that I grudge going on such an errand' (quoted by H Miles Sir David Wilkie of Scotland North Carolina Museum of Art exhibition catalogue, 1987, p199). The artists included Leslie and Landseer as well as Newton. There is a small copy of the Murray portrait in the SNPG, another of similar size and format of the present work in a private collection USA, and Russell records a small copy sold in New York 19-24 November 1934. \nAccording to a letter in the Forster collection written 7 March 1866 by Charles Meer Webb in Dusseldorf, Forster bought the painting in Germany in 1866 for \u00a375. Webb had drawn his attention to it, and stated that it had belonged formerly to a Countess Bernay (or Berney) who had married a waiter. Forster owned editions of Scott's works in poetry and prose, and of the Waverley novels, and seven of his manuscript letters; all were included in the Forster Bequest to the V&A. \n\nF Russell Portraits of Sir Waiter Scott, a study of Romantic portraiture 1987, p61, cat no 142 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
