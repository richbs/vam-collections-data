Studied at the drawing schools, Royal Dublin Society; exhibited his first oil-painting there, moved briefly to London June 1813, then settled in Bristol, until returning to London probably early 1824. Exhibited 48 works at the RA between 1821 and 1860, and 17 at the BI 1820-52. His earlier Bristol works were landscapes and topographical views, but in about 1820 began literary and mythological themes, and biblical subjects in the epic manner of John Martin. Elected ARA 1825, and visited Norway. After difficulties with money, his marriage and the RA, moved abroad 1829, living in Paris and Geneva, until returning to London 1838. Exhibited 'The Deluge' (1837-40, now Tate Gallery) in 1840 with great success. Moved to Exmouth, Devon, 1847, where he died 9 February 1861. His studio sale was at Foster's 15 May 1861. Described in the <i>Athenaeum</i> obituary as 'England's most distinguished painter of the Romantic School'; his most characteristic works are 'poetical' landscapes, often depicting a sunrise or sunset and with a melancholic or stormy subject. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, pp77-80, 1861, p118 (obit); <i>Athenaeum</i> 2 March 1861, p294 (obit); G Grigson <i>The Harp of Aealus</i> 1947 [1948], pp66-78; H W H\u00e4userrnann 'Francis Danby at Geneva', <i>Burlingtan Magazine</i> August 1949, pp227-30; E Adams <i>Francis Danby: Varieties of Poetic Landscape</i> 1973; F Greenacre <i>The Bristol School of Artists</i> City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery exhibition catalogue l973, pp33-41; A Staley 'Francis Danby' (review of Adams's book), <i>Burlington Magazine</i> November 1975, pp732-5; F Greenacre <i>Francis Danby</i> Tate Gallery and City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1988 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>Liensfiord Lake, Norway</b> \nFA67 Neg 0225 \nCanvas, 82.5 x 116.7 cm (32\u00bd x 46 ins) \nSigned 'F. DANBY' diagonally bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1841 with the fuller title 'Liensfiord Lake, in Norway; a sudden storm, called a flanger, passing off - an effect which in [not 'on', as is usually quoted] their lonely lakes occurs nearly every day in autumn'. The <i>Athenaeum</i> critic, comparing it with 'The Enchanted Castle' (FA66, p59) also exhibited at the RA in 1841, described it as 'a sterner scene of beetling rocks and black waters, canopied by a passing storm, Nature is again poetized - but finely and forcibly'. \n\nDanby was in Norway in 1825 and possibly, although there is no evidence, again in 1840. He left London 21 June 1825 and was away for two months. Or EH Schiotz has pointed out (in correspondence with the V&A) that the artist was recorded in Norway in a newspaper article by the Rev Niels Hertzberg: 'An English painter Danby, a resident of London, came here [Hardangerfjord] from Stavanger via Odda three years ago. He was sent by a wealthy Englishman, for whom he should paint Norwegian views. He showed me some interesting sketches which he had drawn in these regions' (<i>Morgen bladet</i>, no 336, 1 December 1828, translated by Dr Schiotz}. Hertzberg also recorded Danby's visit to Hardanger in his diary on 4 August 1825 (published in <i>Arbokfor Den Norske Turistforening</i> 1929, pI7). Greenacre (1973) quotes from a letter from Danby to his patron John Gibbons of 26 August 1825: \n\nI was much disappointed with Norway, it is of a totally different character from what I expected, yet there are <i>very</i> beautiful scenes and extremely picturesque on a small scale, indeed by far the most beautiful I ever saw but in Grandure they fall short. God knows the country is <i>wild enough</i>, these kind of scenes are better in pictures than in reality, and faith I own I was heartily sick of them, from the extreme difficulty of travelling and the distance that I went in a short time, my sketches have been forced to be very slight, yet as they are new I shall make a set of drawings as well as I can, endeavouring to preserve the effect that I saw. \n\nGreenacre (1988) also quotes the following passage from Edward Price, who visited Norway in 1826, a year after Danby: \n\nMr Danby, the painter, was very awkwardly situated on one of the western fiords ... The mountains on all sides rose abruptly from the water, which was perfectly still, and canopied by an azure heaven. The boat was resting under the stillness of the day. At this moment the silver line of a cloud rose above the lofty barrier in front, the fiord heaved its bosom, and an approaching gale flapped the sail; fear was depicted on the faces of the boatmen, who lowered the sail and lashed the mast and a pair of oars across the boat; immediately the heavens were black with clouds, and the fiord boiled like a cauldron; destruction seemed inevitable, when the boat swung against the rock, the projecting mast snapped, and the boat whirled again into the ebullition. The violence of the storm was now over, and at length the fiord resumed its wonted quiet (<i>Norway, Views of Wild Scenery</i> ... 1834, pp43-4). \n\nThe location of Liensfiord Lake is problematic, as there is no place of this name in Norway; moreover, the combination of a fiord (salt water) and a lake (fresh water) is unusual. Or Schiotz has suggested the Lifjord, near Rutledal, which is near other locations certainly visited by Danby, or, less likely, the Loen Lake, between Bergen and \u00c5lesund. Or Schiotz finds Adams's suggestion of Fensfjord unlikely. However, Danby seems to have been sure of the name; a letter to Gibbons of 19 May 1831, cited by Greenacre (1973, p89) mentions a drawing 'Approach of a Storm on Liensford in Norway \u00a33' (see also the inscription on the Tate Gallery version discussed below). \n\nThere is no convincing evidence that Danby made a second visit to Norway in about 1840, and it does seem unlikely in the light of his opinion of the scenery quoted above, so the present work must have been painted from memory and the 1825 sketches. Apart from the drawing mentioned above, a 'Vue d'un Lac en Norvege, avant que le soleil ait dissip\u00e9 les vapeurs du matin' , exhibited at the Geneva Salon in 1835, owned by a J Audeoud and much admired (see H\u00e4userrnann, p228), and several sketches survive. One was in his posthumous studio sale (lot 7), and others are listed by Adams (see, for example, 104, 106, 141 and 186). A reduced version with variations of detail, the mood calmer and the colouring lighter and brighter, is in the Tate Gallery (oil on panel, 41.1 x 54.2 cm/(16 1/8 x 21 3/8 ins); it was sold from a private collection, Switzerland, at Sotheby's 21 November 1984 (71, as 'A Lake in Norway, possibly Fensfiord, near Bergen') and is reproduced in the catalogue in colour but before cleaning). For a full discussion of the T ate Gallery version see <i>The Tate Gallery: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions</i> 1984-6.\n \nAdams draws attention to the influence of Jacob van Ruysdael's more gloomy landscapes, particularly 'Storm off the Dykes of Holland' (about 1670, Louvre) which Danby had copied for William Gibbons in 1838, and of the rocky coast scenes of the Norwegian artist John Christian Dahl.\n \nAs Greenacre (1988) points out, none of Danby's darker paintings has survived as well as the present work: 'There is an impressive richness and translucency to the blacks, and a confidence in the technique which enhances the expressive character of the painting'. Greenacre continues: \n\nThere was a feeling of remoteness in the smaller, earlier work [the Tate Gallery version; it is not certain that it is earlier]. Here there is a more terrifying sense of a desolate and inhospitable landscape where the only animal presence is the skeleton of a seal. In the foreground a small inlet is unruffled by the wind and waterlilies grow, and, behind the storm, the sky is brighter, but these intimations of the coming calm are dwarfed by the overpowering gloom. \n\nPROV: Bought from the artist by William Jones; his sale, Christie's 8 May 1852 (118, as 'View on the Coast of Norway') bought Smith (who sometimes acted as agent for Sheepshanks); given by John Sheepshanks to the museum 1857 \n\nEXH: RA 1841 (527); <i>Irish International Exhibition</i> Dublin 1907 (194); <i>Francis Danby</i> Arts Council 1961 (28); <i>Dve stolet\u00ed britsk\u00e9homal\u00edrstv\u00ed</i> (British Art 1650-1850), N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague, 1969 (41); <i>Lookalike</i>  NGS 1982; <i>James Arthur O'Connor</i>  National Gallery of Ireland 1985-6 (18); <i>Francis Danby</i>  Tate Gallery and City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery 1988-9 (41)\n \nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 5 June 1841, p443; <i>Adams</i> ppl22-3, no 48; <i>Greenacre</i> 1973, p41 n25; J Hutchinson <i>James Arthur O'Connor</i> exhibition catalogue, p58; <i>Greenacre</i> 1988, pp25, 33, 115(repr)\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
