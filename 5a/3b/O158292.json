Pieced with a seam down the centre. No borders survive. The design is very indistinct.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left. These are of green and blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a large pink blossom, smaller pink blossom and small pink buds outlined in green.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] vase with spray of small flowers alternating with vase, pair of leaves and flame-like flower.\n[b] two noticeable motifs: a rosette outlined in green and a more pointed flower with a cone-shaped centre.\n\nThreads: Silk, cannot ascertain twist and ply because of the backing: pink, green, blue and white. \n\nBacking: same as the backing on 752-1888. Striped: white ground with a meandering red, blue and white leaves with red and white flowers; red ground with white and blue flowers; blue ground with line of red flowers; very faded yellow ground with line of red flowers.
