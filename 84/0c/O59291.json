Alix Stone would often draw groups of characters together, so that everyone could see the place of each design in the overall scheme.   This was particularly important when designing opera, where the chorus usually works as a unit as well as individuals.  \n\tDesigning everyday working clothes is perhaps more difficult than recreating period clothes.  There is a danger of overall drabness or similarity of style.  This is especially true in an opera like Peter Grimes, set in a Suffolk fishing village, where most men would wear traditional gurnsey sweaters and rubber boots and women drab working dress.  Drawing groups again ensures that there is a variety to the look of the ensemble.  \nThe attached fabric swatches give an idea how the costumes were given life, ranging from drab greys to a touch or red, small sprig and paisley all-over patterns set off with shades of white.",

The libretto by Montagu Slater is based on George Crabbe's poem \"The Borough\".  The production was conducted by Alexander Gibson; directed by Colin Graham; and lit by Charles Bristow.  The cast included Richard Cassilly as Peter and Phyllis Curtin as Ellen Orford.\n\nThe production was later revived by Scottish Opera in the springs of 1973 and 1980, and by English National Opera North in the spring of 1979.",
