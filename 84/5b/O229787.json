It was labelled \"Grandad's first suit\".  Grandad was born in 1820, & was the son of the parish church minister at Grange, Banffshire.  It might be thought that this suit was a \"Kate Greenaway\", but the antecedents are perhaps against this.\" \n\n[In fact, as Kate Greenaway was not born until 1846, it would be quite impossible for this suit to show her influence anyway. Note by Noreen Marshall]\n\nThe minister at Grange between 1821 and 1844 was Rev William Duff, and was the father of the journalist and dramtist Andrew Hamilton (1830-1877)",
