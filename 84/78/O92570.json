She is unlikely to have received the formal technical training usually considered necessary to take up such a profession, but in her later adult life she became a successful freelance textile designer who lived and worked in Spitalfields from about 1730 until her death in 1763. She was one of the leading pattern drawers in the English silk industry, producing as many as eighty designs a year to commissions from master weavers and mercers. Her interest in natural form and talent for depicting it characterised her designs throughout her working life.",

Numbered \n<i>17</i> \nPen and purple ink and wash, squared in  \npencil for transfer. 32.4 x 17.1 cm \nVAM 5985-26 \n \nThe drawing is the artist\u2019s original design \nwhich would later have been squared up by a \ndraughtsman into a working drawing. The  \nspotting on the design indicates that it is for a \ntabby, or plain weave, which has a slightly \ngranular texture. The purple ink and wash \ndenote that the pattern is of one colour, and \nthe wash areas tell the weaver that extra \nthreads are to be floated over the weft to create \nthe flowers, leaves, etc. Probably the back- \nground pattern is formed by an interruption of \nthe ground weave. The design would have  \nbeen woven on a draw-loom, and the \u2018306 \ncords\u2019 in the description denote the number of \nwarp-carrying cords which will pass over the \npulley of the loom and which, when raised by \na drawn boy, will allow the insertion of weft  \nthreads by the weaver. \n \n\u2018Mr Vautier\u2019 in the inscription is probably \nDaniel Vautier (c. 1694-1760?), a master \nweaver who was one of Anna Maria \nGarthwaite\u2019s most important customers.\u201d",
