Predators and their prey were a popular subject for micromosaics; a range of such pictures can be found within the Gilbert collection.  Many were inspired by the work of the Austrian painter Wenceslaus Peter (1742-1829), who is known to have sold drawings to mosaicists in Rome.  This particular mosaic was made in Rome, whilst the box was manufactured in London.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
