Its body, neck and foot are formed of steel damascened with gold and silver.  It is bordered with silver, the outer parts of which are wrought into cupids and jasmine.  The jasmine, though deftly done, does not entitle it to have the vase called after it.  The cupids at the sides, the eagle at the top, the mask on the neck, the squirrels on the foot and the somewhat Japanese bird display on the front and the back, overpower it and arrest and absorb attention from the first look at the object as a whole.
