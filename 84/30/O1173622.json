In 1956 she moved to Canada and thence to the United States, where she directed and managed a number of theatres. She returned to England in 1987. The letters are from her theatrical contacts and cover her career from the 1930s to the 1990s. Associated production: Susannah and the Elders. Recipient and actor: Joan White. Manager and director: A.P. [Pat] Moore. Actor: Sylvia Coleridge. Duke of York's Theatre, London, 31.10.1937. Performance category: Drama. The play was given three performances at the Duke of York's on 31 October, 7 November and 14 November 1937. Bridie hoped to arrange a transfer. A.P. Moore, Joan White's husband, is mentioned in the letter: Sylvia Coleridge is also mentioned.",
