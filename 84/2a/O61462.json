He commissioned designs for interiors and furniture for his home, Eynsham Hall, Oxfordshire, from the architect and designer, Owen Jones, and the work was carried out from 1872 to 1874, by the London firm of Jackson & Graham. The chair is part of a suite of furniture in the Museum that was designed by Jones for Eynsham Hall. Jones, an enthusiast for historic styles, based his design for the shape of the back and seat, and the tapering front legs and curved back legs, on furniture of the 1790s. The use of dark and light, foreign and native timbers reflects the interest in unconventional combinations of  materials typical of furniture produced by specialist firms such as Jackson & Graham.",

It was part of a large suite of furniture designed for the drawing room, music room and card room, three interconnecting rooms which were decorated and furnished with the same colour scheme and furniture. The armchair is recorded beside the drawing room fireplace in Jones's coloured elevation of these rooms (Drawing No. 5, Eynsham Hall, Special Collections, Reading University Library, illustrated in <u>Owen Jones Design, Ornament, Architecture, and Theory in an Age in Transition</u>, by Carol A.

The success of this investment enabled Mason to buy the Eynsham Park estate in 1866. He commissioned extensive building plans and designs for interiors and furniture from Owen Jones and the work was finished shortly before Jones's death in 1874. After Mason's death in 1903, his son James Francis Mason demolished the house and replaced it with a new building, designed by the architect, Ernest George, which was completed in 1908. Jones's silks were apparently rehung in the new library and dining room.\n\nEynsham Hall was used by the Home Office as a police training college from 1946-1981. The armchair was one of four pieces of furniture from Eynsham Hall given to the Museum in 1954.",
