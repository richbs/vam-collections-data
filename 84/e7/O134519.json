As a flower and still-life painter he exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1858 and 1904. \n\nMuckley had a distinguished career within the government schools of art run by the Department of Science and Art from their headquarters at the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A): in the late 1850s he was appointed head of the Burslem School of Art and, shortly afterwards, was made headmaster of the Wolverhampton art school. In 1862 he became principal of the Manchester School of Art. \n\nMuckley presented this sumptuous painting of muscat grapes on a silver salver to the V&A in 1905, the year of his death.",
