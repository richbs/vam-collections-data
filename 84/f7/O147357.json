The main field is covered with a series of large stylised rosettes formed of concentric circles in light blue, red and mauve outlined in red with an outer edge of outward facing lotus flowers and  buds outlined in mauve.  These rosettes are arranged in rows and the space in between is filled with an ogival band or stripe formed by two mauve meandering stems with blue leaves.  The inner ogival space is filled with a red flower head.  The stems arise from a small central red and blue lozenge. Bordering the field is a composite band [a] formed by a narrow, plain mauve stripe either side of a wide white band filled with a leafy mauve meander carrying blue and red leaves and a large red flower head in three variations.  This leads into a wider white band filled with large isolated red floral sprays facing inward with blue stems and leaves and large red floral fan-shaped blossoms with blue, mauve and white highlights.  Above and below the fan blossom are little floral infills.  The penultimate band  is a repeat of band [a]. there is one selvedge which is red with mauve lines.",
