Beaumont in  1926.  \nThe drawing came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: The drawing shows one of the leading dancers of the Daighilev Ballets Russes in one of his celebrated roles.  The costume was designed by Leon Bakst, and seems to have first been used ca. 1915; he reused the design for the Bluebird pas de deux in The Sleeping Princess in 1921 and a version of it continued to be worn in the subsequent production of Aurora's Wedding both by the Diaghilev Ballets Russes dancers and those of the various Ballets Russes companies of the 1930s and when Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre)  produced Aurora's Wedding (as Princess Aurora), reproducing the Bakst designs, in the early 1940s.  Although different in colour, line and decoration, this costume derives from the costume Bakst designed for Nijinsky in L'oiseau de feu, performed in Paris in 1909.",
