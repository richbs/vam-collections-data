Hines, Stroud & Co., London. The Art Nouveau image of a woman wearing ornate jewellery and a flowing gown, as well as the swirling vegetation, is typical of Mucha's style.\n\nMucha was a painter and designer born in Moravia who went to Paris in the 1880s to study art. This was a time when barriers between fine art and the applied arts were breaking down and  Mucha became celebrated on the Continent for his posters, particularly those of the actress Sarah Bernhardt. Mucha is one of the artists most closely associated with the Art Nouveau period.",
