The cross therefore has long been the central symbol of Christianity and a focus of veneration. \n\nAccording to the Gospels, Christ was stripped of his clothes to be crucified, but medieval artists seldom showed him naked. In this depiction, as was common in the early Middle Ages, Christ wears a long tunic and a crown to symbolise his kingship and triumph over death. The skull engraved below the cross alludes to Golgotha (\u2018the place of the skull\u2019), by tradition the site of both the Crucifixion and Adam\u2019s burial.\n\nThe cross is inscribed with the sacred monogram \u2018IHS\u2019 (a contraction of the name Jesus Christ in Greek).",

From the earliest times the cross became the archetypal symbol of the religion. \n\nThe figures of Christ in this display would all originally have been fitted to metal crosses and used for veneration on the altar or carried in procession. The crosses themselves have been lost or melted down but the figures have been preserved, probably for their artistic and spiritual value.\n \nThroughout the Middle Ages the image of Christ underwent a remarkable evolution, reflecting the gradually changing theology of Christ. The Gospels tell of him being stripped of his clothes to be crucified, but artists never depicted him naked. Early examples project an image in full length tunic or long skirt, eyes open, wearing a royal crown and epitomising the concept of his kingship and triumph over death. From about 1200 western artists focused on Christ's human suffering and depicted him in death, or dying, broken and tormented.",
