His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel designed Edwardian costumes and settings for the musical play, Tough at the Top, C.B. Cochran\u2019s 127th production.  A romantic tale of a Ruritanian princess and an American prizefighter, whose love, unsurprisingly, triumphs against the odds, it played for four months at the Adelphi Theatre in 1949.  The librettist, A. P. Herbert, said that Messel\u2019s ornate sets were \u2018quickened by costumes which constantly fling new and unexpected patterns across the stage\u2019 (The Times, 16 July 1949), and complemented the fantasy of the musical.\n\nMessel's set model recreates the atmosphere of an Edwardian Derby racecourse day for Act I, scene iii.  The model includes a cut-out card figure of the princess, played by Maria D\u2019Attili.",
