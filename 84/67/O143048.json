Goble made this instrument in 1939, when he had a workshop in Haselmere, before moving to Headington, Oxford, in 1947. Like the Carl Dolmetsch Tenor Recorder (W.12-2006) this instrument serves as a bridge between the 'Pre-Raphaelite' world of Arnold Dolmetsch's Early Music Revival and the explosion of popularity in Early Music that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.",
