As a member of Vienna's Jewish community, she fled the advance of Nazism in 1938. Arriving in London, she established a pottery studio on the ground floor of her home,18 Albion Mews, Paddington. After her death in 1995, the contents of her studio were preserved and moved to the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent.  A selection of items from one corner of Rie's studio were redisplayed in gallery 143 of the V&A in 2009 as part of the redevelopment of the ceramics galleries.  The exact positioning of these items was replicated as far as possible from old photographs in order to evoke Rie's working conditions and show some of the equipment and materials she used to produce her pots and buttons.",
