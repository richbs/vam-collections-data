            "public_access_description": "The former parish church of St. Fantino is said to have been founded in the IXth century however the earliest documentary evidence dates from 1134. The old church has been demolished in 1506 and a new edifice begun after a design by Scarpagnino (Antonio Abbundi, 1465/70-1549) who worked on the building until his death. Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570) took over, designing the domed apse and adding the larger chapel. The building was completed in 1564. The drawing depicts the fa\u00e7ade and its main bow-door surmounted by a pediment and flanked by two Corinthian columns. A cornice runs above surmounted by a bow-window and a broken pediment with a cross on top. The interior longitudinal section shows the stairs leading up to the main altar surrounded by narrow bow-windows. There is an altar on both side surmounted by a pediment and a small dome. The drawing also depicts the upper inner structure of the church with a cupola and a pediment above. In 1810 the church of St. Fantino became a subsidiary of S. Maria Zobenigo.\n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
