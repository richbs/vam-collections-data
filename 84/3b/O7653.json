Christianity inherited its devotion to angels from the Jewish faith from which it emerged. \n\nFrom early on, the great theologians of the Christian church devoted much effort to identifying and understanding the role of angels in God\u2019s creation. About the year 500, one scholar wrote a treatise called \u2018The Celestial Hierarchy\u2019. He scoured the Old and New Testaments for information relating to angels. From this he compiled a list of different types of angels according to their functions. He claimed that there were nine orders of angels, divided into three hierarchies. Each order had a specific function, such as the Order of the Archangels, who act as messengers between God and mankind. The author of this treatise is known as the \u2018Pseudo-St Denis\u2019 or \u2018Pseudo-Aeropagite\u2019, because he was once thought to be the St Denis (or Dionysus) the Aeropagite who is mentioned in the New Testament book of Acts.\n\nAll the orders were considered to be attendant on God and continually sang his praises. It became common in medieval art to show angels singing or playing musical instruments in adoration of God.\n\nThe angel in this roundel is playing a rebec, an early form of the violin. The instrument was known in England as early as the 11th century. The musician would rest it on the shoulder or across the chest, as depicted here.",
