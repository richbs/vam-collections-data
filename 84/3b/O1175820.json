            "public_access_description": "The Fillmore in San Francisco is a historic music venue, named after its original location at the intersection of Fillmore Street and Geary Boulevard. Known as the Fillmore Auditorium in the mid-1960s, concert promoter Bill Graham began a series of concerts featuring bands from the counterculture of the time. In 1968, due to his spiralling success, he moved to a larger venue which he named Fillmore West. Having closed in 1971, and after extensive repair work to fix earthquake damage, Graham's venue was revived when Live Nation reopened the original Fillmore venue in 1994.\n\nSan Francisco in the mid-1960s was the hub of the LSD and Hippie scene and the cultural and political rebellion of 1967's Summer of Love. The resulting influence of these factors on the artists of the area created the fantastic psychedelic posters of the Fillmore. Art dealer Jacaeber Kastor said of the posters, \"They couldn't just tell you the information about the show. They had to tell you what kind of people you might meet, what kind of far out trip you might have or perhaps even reveal the mysteries of the universe. Wow. Quantum mechanics, visual mudwrestling, Acid test pop quiz on a phone pole!\"\n\nRandy Tuten, the artist of this poster, was born in San Francisco but moved to Los Angeles with his family at a young age. He was a self taught artist, into cartooning and surfing. By 1966 he was hitchhiking between Los Angeles and San Francisco, to catch bands at the Avalon Ballroom and Fillmore West; he finally decided to stay in San Francisco upon seeing Stanley Mouse & Alton Kelley\u2019s Fillmore West posters. Tuten was hired by Bill Graham in 1969. His style, influenced by Alton Kelley and Rick Griffin\u2019s, was in keeping iwht the commercial art formats of American advertising. He drew trains, ships, classic automobiles and planes with a mix of photographs and lettering. He became Graham\u2019s first in-house poster artist, which he stayed as for ten years.\n\nHeadlining this gig was Taj Mahal, a blues musician who folded various forms of world music into his offerings, including sounds from the Caribbean, Africa and the South Pacific.",
