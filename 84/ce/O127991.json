The jewellery was designed around organic shapes, often merging to become miniature sculptural elements. Finely crafted silver was the preferred material, often in combination with inexpensive gemstones in unconventional cuts and asymmetrical compositions. \n\nSaara Hopea-Untracht studied at the School of Arts and Crafts in Helsinki. She became a designer for furniture, lighting and glassware. It was not until 1959 that Hopea-Untracht began making jewellery. She was one of Finland's leading twentieth-century designers. From a family of goldsmiths, she began designing jewellery in 1958, and her designs were made in the family workshop in the town of Porvoo.She travelled extensively and lived in America, Nepal and India with her husband Oppi Untracht, author and metal historian.   \n\nThis finger ring with its stunning swirling form in silver and gold was designed to be worn on the middle finger. Described by Saara Hopea-Untracht as a 'Wing' ring it extends above the band and across the top of the adjoining two fingers, to create an extensive area of decoration on the back of the hand.",
