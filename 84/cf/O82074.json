However, Miss Mary Russell was born in 1783. She was therefore only three when her mother, Mrs Mary Russell, died in 1786, and only four when this miniature was painted in 1787.  This is therefore almost certainly a portrait of Margaret Cocks (1773-1847), the sister of Mrs Mary Russell.   \n\nRichard Cosway R.A. (1742-1821) was one of the most fashionable miniature painters of the day.  Around 1786 he had the honour of being made Miniature Painter to the Prince of Wales, the future Prince Regent. He also painted oil paintings.",
