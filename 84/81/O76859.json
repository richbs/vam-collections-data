The latter terminates in a long pouring lip.The handle is rectangular in section and runs from the centre back of the body, rising vertically with an outward slant then curving inwards to join the rim at the rear of the pouring mouth.The handle is engraved with a twisted rope pattern.\n\nA band of Kufic runs around the mouth.  A band of naskhi script encircles the base of the neck and a circular band in thuluth covers the flat surface area of the shoulder.  Two further bands in thuluth script encircle the top and bottom of the body on the larger ribs.  Continuous Kufic bands on the narrow ribs read vertically from top to bottom.  A final Kufic band is engraved on the waisted foot.  The centre of the ribs are engraved with knot patterns that flank cusped cartouches encircling further foliate knots and a crescent moon. The tops of the wider ribs are engraved with knotted cartouches and the narrow ribs with knotwork.\n\nTwo seated lions are raised and engraved either side of the pouring lip and a crouching lion on the sheet which covers the pouring spout.  The sides of the spout are decorated with a scrolling pattern.",

Its decoration includes elaborate knotwork, numerous inscriptions calling blessings on the (anonymous) owner, and lions crouching around the neck and spout.\n\nIn Islamic art, objects made from base materials were often transformed by sophisticated forms of decoration. Brassware, like this piece, was often decorated with inlaid surface ornament.\n\nFor larger motifs, metalworkers chiselled out small areas of brass and filled them with thin sheets of silver, gold and copper. They added details by chasing the surface of the softer metals and contrast by using a black filler. \n\nThe inlay technique first became popular in eastern Persia (now Iran)  in the mid 12th century. It then spread westwards and by 1250 was in use across the Middle East. Its popularity declined after 1500.",
