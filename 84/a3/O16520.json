Spring was purchased at auction in 1887 by Sir William Agnew of the celebrated firm of art-dealers for the very high price of 2100 (more than the price of a good oil painting by an old master); Agnew believed it to be the finest watercolour produced by Walker.  Millais in the 1860s (see catalogue no. 124) was perhaps the first exhibiting artist to 'follow up' a success in one year by producing a similar companion the following year.  Spring shows a young girl picking primroses with a boy companion; her rather tremulous expression is echoed by the trees just coming into leaf.  Autumn has a young woman, on her own, holding an apple - the fruit of the Biblical Tree of Knowledge; the mood is more languorous and reflective.  It may be that Walker is referring not only to the passage of the seasons but also to the passage of human life, and it may not be too fanciful to suspect that the woman in Autumn has lost and pines for her early love.",
