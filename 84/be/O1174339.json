They were chosen as striking and spectacular examples of costume making, characteristic of their period and representing different techniques used to interpret a designer's work.  They complement the costumes previously bought from the ENO in 1993. This costume and S.206:1/2-1998 were devised for figures mounted on giant 'horses' and are notable in evoking a medieval feel through cut and decoration while remaining firmly of the 1990s.  The calligraphic decoration is an interesting prefiguration of the late 1990s use of lettering in fashion and interior design. The production was a co-production with the Bayerische Staatsoper, Munich. Associated production: The Adventures of Mr Broucek. Designer: Marie-Jeanne Lecca. Director: David Pountney. Wearer and singer: Arwel Huw Morgan. Wearer and singer: Freier. Character: Domsik of the Bell. Performing company: English National Opera. Coliseum, London, 16.12.1992. Performance category: Opera. Freier is the singer who took the role when the production was re-staged in Munich.",
