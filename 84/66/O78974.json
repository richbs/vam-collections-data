It might have been undertaken by a carpenter rather than a professional chair-maker, because it is not strongly made.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe chair-back has trellis-work in a Chinoiserie style, but the chair seat is deeply carved in a saddle shape, like traditional country chairs, such as Windsor chairs. The top rail suggests the shape of a dairy yoke, but is also similar to those on Chinese chairs and adds to the Chinoiserie design. All four legs are chamfered into octagonal shapes.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe chair seat is made of solid elm, the other parts probably in cherry.  The parts of the chair are fixed to the seat with projecting tenons.  The tenons from the legs are visible on the surface of the seat. Small pieces of wood have been let into the seat where the elm had knots or splits. Additional pieces of oak have had to be screwed to the joint of the legs and the back to strengthen the chair-back.",
