The best-known party from this coalition is the Romanian Democratic Front, which grew out of the committee set up in Timisoara during the first days of the revolution. The Democratic Group from the Centre protested against the Romanian Salvation Front (FSN)\u2019s bid for power. The Democratic Group from the Centre participated in the biggest anticommunist demonstration in Romania, called \u2018Piata Universitatii\u2019 after the square in Bucharest where it took place. The protest began on 22 April 1990 and ended on 15 June 1990 when the local authorities brutally intervened. The ironic and playful design of the text \u2018FSNiet!\u2019 is a critical comment on the political ideology of the FSN which was considered neo-communist. The initials FSN are joined to the Russian word \u2018niet\u2019, meaning \u2018no\u2019 and can be read as a request to reject the FSN at the elections on 20th of May 1990.",
