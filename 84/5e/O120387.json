It is one of the best known examples of Minton's 'Henri Deux' ware and the largest the factory made - for the Paris Exhibition of 1878. \n\nDuring the 1850s there was great interest in the type of French faience known as 'Henri Deux' or 'Saint Porchaire'. The intricate decoration, combining painting and inlaid clays, was seen as a  technological challenge for Victorian ceramic firms keen to revive traditional and 'lost' techniques. L\u00e9on Arnoux, Art  Director at Minton's, and a designer and chemist, succeeded in reproducing the  'Henri Deux' process in 1858. Arnoux trained the modeller and designer Charles Toft senior, and he took over the production of 'Henri Deux' in the 1870s. Very few pieces using this expensive inlaid technique were made.\n\nMany nineteenth-century European designers and craftspeople were greatly inspired by other cultures and historical periods. This ranged from exact copies of existing objects to eclectic designs catering to contemporary taste. Leading commercial manufacturers, such as Minton's, became strongly associated with historicist styles, producing high-quality wares for an international market.",

Part of C.69-1997 (Lot 150) was found in the Minton factory museum collection and was negotiated as a private sale before the public sale of Minton wares offered by Royal Doulton and Bonhams, 22/07/2002. There are no original drawings or images of the fountain and the precise placing of this section is uncertain. The model is matched by another 'vase-like' section already with the fountain.
