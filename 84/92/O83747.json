At the age of 18, he won first prize for a tailoring design in a competition judged by the Parisian couturier Elsa Schiaparelli (1890-1973). He worked in Paris before opening in 1947 in London's Albemarle Street. \n\nHere, Paterson gives a modern dimension to the tweed suit.  Designed towards the end of the 1950s it anticipates the boxy suits of the 1960s.  The side-fastening jacket has a deep collar that can be worn in a number of ways.  The simple, straight-cut skirt permits the boldly styled jacket to become the dominant feature.",
