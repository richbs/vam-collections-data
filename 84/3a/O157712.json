Named after Tiburnus (circa 500 BC) the Tiburtines were defeated by the Romans at Lake Regillus in 498 BC. Forty years later the town became a place of exile for important prisoners of state. The Tiburtines were given citizenship in 90BC and the town became a fashionable retreat.\n\nGiovanni Morelli was born in Brescia in 1804 and studied with the famous hardstone artist Giacomo Raffaelli. Morelli worked at the Vatican under Napoleon (1804-9). There is an important hardstone snuffbox apparently signed 'S.Morelli via della Srofa N.8' in the Gilbert Collection which can be attributed to Giovanni Morelli. He worrked as a sculptor and stone carver on inlaid furniture, candelabra and picture frames and produced carved stone flowers and birds.",
