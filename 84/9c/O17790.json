Short hair, staring eyes and a mouth dripping with saliva are the sitter's unpleasing characteristics. The artist himself has provided the key to the painting, for his personal catalogue entry in the Klee foundation in Berne has the following addition to the title: <i>Kopf beim Anh\u00f6ren der Propaganda</i> (Head listening to propaganda). Klee, it appears, was portraying a German listening to the propaganda of his leaders in 1939 with its promises of wealth, plunder and <i>Lebensraum</i>, The quotation is adapted from Leviticus 25.19: 'and ye shall eat your fill' and the head can be interpreted as a portrayal primarily of greed whetted by promise of Nazi propaganda, and also, to some extent perhaps, of astonishment at the scope of these promises.\n \nThick, coarse outlines and features, a predominance of white and an economy of line and colour may seem out of place among the delicate intricacy, the charm and bright colouring of most of Klee's work, but they are in fact typical of the output of his last years. In 1933 he was dismissed by the Nazis, as a practitioner of 'decadent art', from his professorship at the Academy of Art in Dusseldorf, and in December of that year he returned to his native Switzerland to settle in Berne. Within two years of his return he began to suffer from the painful illness of which he was to die in June 1940. From 1938 much of his work contains the thick outlines and simple monumental aspect discernible in this head. It is a style ideally suited to the pessimism of his last years, dominated by his own illness, by Hitler's triumphs and approaching war. \n\nMichael Kauffmann\"\n<u>Paul Klee: catalogue raisonn\u00e9</u> vol. 8, edited by the Paul Klee Foundation, Museum of Fine Arts, Berne, London and New York, 2004, cat. 8794.",
