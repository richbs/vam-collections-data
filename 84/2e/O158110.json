            "public_access_description": "Cups, salvers and other commemorative objects made from a monarch's Great Seal are among the most lavish British silver with examples surviving from the late seventeenth century, when the British monarchy was restored, onwards. Keepers of the Seal were responsible for the monarch's personal - 'privy' - seal, one of the most influential roles in the kingdom in early modern times. One of the oldest offices with roots in the fourteenth century, the office still exists with the Lord Privy Seal as one of the five Great Officers of State.\n\nThe law required that the Great Seal had to be defaced upon the monarch's death. Frequently the seals remained in the possession of their respective holder and were often transformed into silver plate commemorating the office. Large cups were a typical object to be made from seals in the early eighteenth century. Sir Nathan's successor, Lord Cowper had two cups made from his seal only a few years later. The Wright Seal Cup is possibly the earliest example of such a cup and shows the portraits of the two monarchs he served in this office, William III and Anne.\n\nThis cup is part of the Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Collection on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Sir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Bequethed to his son, George Wright of Gayhurst, Buckinghamshire.  By descent to Mrs R.  L.  Cameron, sale, Christie's, London, lot 176, 26/03/1975.  (through S. J. Phillips) Christie's, New York, lot 400, 17/10/1996.\n\nThe arms are those of Wright impaling Ashby for Sir Nathan Wright (1654-1721). He married Elizabeth, second daughter of George Ashby of Quenby, Leicestershire, in 1676. Sir Nathan Wright was recorder of Leicester from 1680 to 1684 and in 1688, Serjeant at Law in 1692 and knighted and made King's Serjeant in 1697. He received the Great Seal from William III at Hampton Court on 2 May 1700 when he was made Privy Councillor. After the death of William III Wright surrendered the Great Seal to Queen Anne who returned it to him with the title of Lord Keeper. She is recorded to have remarked \"That she would not have done so, if there had been a worthier man in the kingdom to whom she could have delivered it\" (Campbell, <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i>, p. 208).  In 1705 Wright was succeeded by Lord Cowper as Keeper to whom he would have surrendered Queen Anne's seal.\n\nThe present cup therefore is likely to have been made from King William's seal. The portrait of Queen Anne was added to commemorate Wrights holding of the seals of both monarch.",
