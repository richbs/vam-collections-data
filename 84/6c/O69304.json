Westwood\u2019s career in fashion was galvanised by McLaren and together they launched memorable fashion moments, including Punk in the early 1970s and later their Pirates collection. McLaren and Westwood conducted a design relationship between 1971 and 1983. In 1990 and again in 1991 Vivienne Westwood was named British Designer of the Year; she has also received an OBE.\n\nWestwood\u2019s unique mix of practicality and inventiveness, her preoccupation with silhouette and the manner in which she manipulates fabrics result in dynamic fashion. Westwood herself once said, 'You have a much better life if you wear impressive clothes.\u2019 \n\nThis hat is from Westwood\u2019s \u2018Witches\u2019 collection (Autumn/Winter1983-4), for which the designer collaborated with graffiti artist Keith Haring. Haring submitted drawings to Westwood, for her to use as she wished. Westwood used this hat as the final, essential touch to a number of ensembles inspired by comedian Chico Marx.",
