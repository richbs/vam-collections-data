He then manipulated the electronic wave forms (Lissajous-figures) displayed on the screen and then photographed the results. He thus created some of the first graphics generated using an electronic machine and helped pave the way for the truly digital pioneers who followed.\n\nLaposky removed these mathematical curves from their scientific and technical background and put them into an aesthetic context. The first Oscillons were shown in the Sanford-Museum in Cherokee in 1953 and were called 'Electronic Abstractions'. This exhibition toured to over 200 institutions in the US. In the same year, Laposky published a book of the same name, which was intended to accompany the travelling exhibition and featured many of the images and explanatory material from the show. Laposky also gave a number of demonstrations on creating his images.\n\nThe relationship of the oscillons to computer art is that the basic waveforms are analogue curves, of the type used in analogue computer systems. The oscillons have been recognized as being the first major development in this field as abstract art creations.\n\nBen Laposky was born in Cherokee, Iowa, in 1914. He trained as a mathematician but began his career as a draftsman, owning a sign shop in Iowa. His interest in mathematics led him to begin experimenting with geometric design, including algebraic curves and magic number pattern arrangements, and, in turn, the visual effects of an oscilloscope.\nIn photographing the different 'Oscillons' Laposky is said to have produced 10,000 negatives, although much fewer of these survive today. His photographs have featured in over 150 publications since 1952. \n\nThis composite image shows thumbnail images of 28 works by Laposky, all of which are known to be held by the Sanford Museum in Iowa.  The V&A's image appears to have been re-photographed from an unknown publication or exhibition, and was given by Laposky to the American art historian Patric Prince.",

He then manipulated the electronic wave forms (Lissajous-figures) displayed on the screen and then photographed the results. He thus created some of the first graphics generated using an electronic machine and helped pave the way for the truly digital pioneers who followed.\n\nLaposky removed these mathematical curves from their scientific and technical background and put them into an aesthetic context. The first Oscillons were shown in the Sanford-Museum in Cherokee in 1953 and were called 'Electronic Abstractions'.\n\nThe relationship of the oscillons to computer art is that the basic waveforms are analogue curves, of the type used in analogue computer systems. The oscillons have been recognized as being the first major development in this field as abstract art creations.",
