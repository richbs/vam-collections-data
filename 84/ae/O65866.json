From 1837, when he first travelled to Rome, he spent most of his life abroad; after Rome he was based in Corfu, then in San Remo. He spent long periods travelling, often to remote places, and made three long journeys in Egypt, in 1849, 1853-54 and 1866-67. During these expeditions Lear made numerous topographical sketches on the spot, generally recording the precise location, date and often even the time of day of each drawing. He would work rapidly in pencil to capture the features of the landscape, then later add colour washes and pen and ink lines to strengthen the composition. \n\nAccording to Lear's inscription, this watercolour drawing was made at 3pm on 12th March 1854. It represents a qubba, or tomb of a saint, on the banks of the Nile at Minya.",
