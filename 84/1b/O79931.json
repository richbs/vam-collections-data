They could be worn to show loyalty, and may also have been given as rewards.\n\nPeople\nThis medal commemorates Sir Sydenham Poyntz, an ardent anti-Royalist who led the Parliamentary forces against the King at Rowton Heath. The obverse (front) portrays him wearing armour, his hair long. The reverse has the date and an inscription recording his victory in battle with 10,000 men. \n\nAbraham Simon (1617-1692) and his brother Thomas (1618-1665) were the most distinguished native-born medallists working in 17th-century England. They were also responsible for coinage minted under the Commonwealth. Abraham worked in Sweden and Holland in the early part of his career, and came to London in 1642 or later. He made a number of portrait medals and also modelled wax portraits which his brother Thomas had cast as medals (see museum no. 815-1904).Materials & Making\nStruck medals were produced from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. A flat disc was placed between the dies, which were then compressed, so that the design was reproduced on the metal. This technique meant that a high number of medals could be made using the same dies over and over, whereas the technique of casting medals was generally more complex and therefore usually suitable only for smaller numbers.",
