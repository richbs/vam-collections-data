Christ is shown half-length emerging from the tomb, displaying the wounds he incurred during his Crucifixion. \n\nAnother late medieval devotional theme is Christ as \u2018Man of Sorrows\u2019, a phrase taken from Isaiah (53: 3): \u2018He was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief\u2019. Images show the suffering Christ wearing the Crown of Thorns, surrounded by other Instruments of the Passion. They include whips, the nails that pinned him to the Cross, the spear that pierced his side and the sponge full of vinegar he was given to drink. We see all these on this panel, as well as the dice that the soldiers threw to see which of them would win Christ\u2019s robe.\n\nThe kneeling figure in the left foreground wears the habit of a Dominican nun. The words on the scroll proclaim her marriage in faith to Jesus Christ, an episode known as the \u2018Mystic Marriage of St Catherine of Siena\u2019. \n\nCatherine (about 1347\u201380) became a nun when she was aged 16. Her visions made her famous, and she used her political and diplomatic skills to help secure the return of the papacy to Rome from Avignon in France. Many thought that this \u2018Babylonian Captivity\u2019 meant that the pope had become a mere puppet of the French king. Catherine managed to persuade Pope Gregory XI (1331\u201378) to return to Rome.",
