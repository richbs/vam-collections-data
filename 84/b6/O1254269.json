He has since established himself as one of Japan\u2019s most inventive avant-garde ceramicists, exhibiting widely in Japan and, since 2001, in the Netherlands, Germany and the USA. As a teacher at the Gifu Prefectural Tajimi Technical High School and, more recently, at Aichi University of Education, he has played a pivotal role in cultivating a younger generation of ceramicists, who, now in their 20s and 30s, are becoming a defining force on the contemporary Japanese ceramic stage.\n\nNakashima\u2019s improvisational approach to the creation of twisting and multiplying organic forms dates back to the early 1990s. His use of uniformly distributed, mechanical-looking polka dots \u2013 a wittily incongruous contrast to the hugely painstaking method of hand-building he employs to produce his formerly stoneware but now porcelain forms \u2013 goes back to the 1980s. This particular piece is one of the final and most impressive four of a group of works that he made over a period of a year for display at his solo exhibition at Tajimi\u2019s highly respected Gallery VOICE, 10 September - 2 October 2011.",
