Most are made of cast silver, and they frequently have complex designs with Cyrillic inscriptions and iconographic details which are unique to the Russian Orthodox Church.  This cross also has a tsata or collar in the centre, another element unique to Russian crosses.\n\nLike the filigree chains on which they were worn, these crosses are very difficult to date accurately.  Their design has remained unchanged for centuries and many crosses are still being made today from old originals.  This cross was described as 17th or 18th century when it was acquired in 1866, but is more likely to be 19th century in date.",
