            "public_access_description": "Men throughout Europe wore silver buttons with their traditional costume in the 19th century.  Although filigree buttons were the most typical, many countries used buttons made of sheet metal as well.  Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats.\n\nButtons were rarely sewn directly on to the clothing.  In the north of Europe people fastened them to their costume with a strip of leather, which ran through the button loops inside the garment.  In the south, they used T-shaped toggles permanently attached to the button.\n\nThis button comes from Malta.  Its design, of sheet silver pierced to look like filigree, is one of the oldest in the Mediterranean region.  It was worn by men, on jackets and waistcoats.  The design largely went out of fashion in Malta when conical filigree buttons became popular at the beginning of the 19th century.  This one has Maltese marks from the end of the 18th century.  It was bought for nine shillings (for a set of six) at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
