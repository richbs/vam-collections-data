The music for the ballet was composed by Sergey Prokofiev, and the scenery and costumes were designed by Nicholas Georgiadis.  MacMillan created the leading roles on Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable, although the first performance was led by Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.\n\nThe ballet was an immensely popular addition to The Royal Ballet repertoire, and Georgiadis redesigned the production for The Royal Ballet on two separate occasions (1978 & 2000).  The costumes in the Theatre Museum collection date from the 1965 production.  \n\nThe ballet has also entered the repertoires of several other ballet companies including the Royal Swedish Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, the Ballet of La Scala, Milan, and the New National Ballet of Tokyo.\n\nA version of the ballet was performed on October 9th 1975 at the Spa Pavilion, Felixstowe by Ballet For All.",
