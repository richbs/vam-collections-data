It was a small industry based in East Hoathly, Lewes, East Sussex, specialising in individually handmade garments and fine hand-smocking. In her catalogue for 1992-93, the designer stated that smocking was her hallmark, and that she only used the best natural silks, soft wools and fine cotton lawn. She cited historical fashions as a great influence on her work. Each garment was  handmade to order by a small team of skilled needlewomen. Julian Akers-Douglas, who was entirely self-taught as a designer, developed her own unique smocking pattern, which she called the 'Barham', and this was used alongside other traditional patterns and smocking techniques. Most of the garments typically took 28 days to be made and delivered (through mail order), though the Barham smocked dress could take 35 days.",
