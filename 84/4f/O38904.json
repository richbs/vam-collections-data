The cover is rectangular, with a deep valence, and is rounded at the foot; the central panel trimmed with two broad bands of  white machine-embroidered insertion, with a narrow machine-made lace edging threaded with cream petersham baby ribbon, each band finished at the foot with a large bow of cream satin ribbon.  The valence is made of pleated and pin tucked organdie, gathered beneath a narrow row of white braid, and finished with a scalloped band of lace; the valence stops short of the topmost edge, probably to allow for its fitting the cradle.",
