            "public_access_description": "Lyre-like instruments first became fashionable in France in the 1780s, where they were often referred to as Lyres Nouvelles. This eight-stringed version, known in England as the French Lyre or Lyre-Guitare [sic], has a guitar-like neck with holes in the fingerboard into which one could screw a capo' and play in different keys, much like an English guitar of that date. At the bottom is an ivory button which let one play it with a shoulder strap, like a guitar. The Lyre Guitar was popular in salons and conformed with Neo-Classical fashions. Instructions on how to play this instrument were often included in tutors for the Guitar and arrangements were made song accompaniments \"for guitar or lyre\" during the early 1800s. \n\nThis instrument was once owned by a certain Captain Westwood, who claimed that it had belonged to Queen Marie-Antoinettte of France (1755-1793). During the nineteenth century, Queen Marie-Antoinette was much romanticized, and collectors often claimed to possess items that had once belonged to her.",
