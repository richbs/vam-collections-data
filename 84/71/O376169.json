Its traditional jewellery often retains many medieval characteristics lost elsewhere. \n\nThis belt is full of heraldic symbolism.  Each of the plaques along its length shows a lion confronting a griffin, and on the clasp a lion, a stag and a unicorn chase each other in an unending circle.  Although they appear old, these symbols are not traditional in Iceland, and the belt itself probably only dates from the second half of the 19th century.  However, the shape of the belt is typical of Iceland, where a silver belt was part of the wedding jewellery for every young woman who could afford it.",
