Britain's sugar came from sugar-cane plantations in the West Indies. In 1784 a French visitor to Britain noted that 'Sugar, even unrefined sugar ... is necessary [for tea] and very dear'. Sugar was also widely taken with coffee, as it counteracted the bitter taste. Surviving documents from the Bow porcelain factory mention 'sugar dishes with covers.'\n\nDesign & Designing\nBoth the octagonal shape and the painted decoration were inspired by a type of Japanese porcelain that is known as 'Kakiemon' today. The bulk of Kakiemon ware that found its way to Britain was made before about 1700. It was highly prized here, where it was often described as 'Old Japan'. The Bow factory papers include several references to 'Japan octagon' wares. The Chelsea factory also made octagonal sugar boxes: a sale of 1755 included 'a sugar bason octagon red pannel pattern'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Bow factory made a type of porcelain that was strengthened with bone ash, making it suitable for utilitarian tea- and table wares. The factory was large, employing about 300 people around 1760 and calling in receipts of \u00a311,555 in 1755.",
