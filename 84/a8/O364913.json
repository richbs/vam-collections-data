Gobrias, an elderly Assyrian prince, asked for King Cyrus' help to avenge the death of his son, and offered his daughter's hand as part of his pledge. The main source of stories of Cyrus' life was the Cyropaedi,  a biography of him  written in the 4th century BC by Xenophon of  Athens. The Cyropaedia was rediscovered in  Western Europe during the late medieval period as  a treatise on political virtue and social organization, and continued to be widely read and respected through to the 18th century.",
