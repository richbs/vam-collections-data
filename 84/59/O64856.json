The archangel Raphael, in disguise, leads Tobias to the lands of his kinsman Raguel. Raguel gives his daughter Sara in marriage to Tobias but warns him that Sara's seven previous husbands had all been devoured by demons on the wedding night.\n\nWith Raphael's aid, Tobias prepares a potion, the smell of which drives the demons out. He and Sara are able then to successfully consummate their marriage.\n\nThe dog sleeping on their bed belonged to Tobias and accompanied him and Raphael on their journey. In this context he may also symbolise marital love and fidelity.",

The Renaissance decoration of the architectural surround, especially the putti heads in the spandrels, can be matched exactly in glass in Cologne Cathedral, possibly originally from the cloister of the Cistercian abbey of St Apern in Cologne.",

It was removed from the official new Bibles and labelled as 'Apocryphal'.",
