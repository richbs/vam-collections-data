            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is a supremely functional, single-handled mug in strong, salt-glazed stoneware.  It was made in Lambeth, London, in the 1870s when plain stoneware, mocha and banded ware mugs were commonly used in public houses. Mugs as decorated as this one  (without the obligatory capacity excise mark) were used either for the consumption of bottled beer at home or for lemonade. They were often accompanied by matching beakers and their elaboration may have been intended to entice a female market.\n\nOwnership & Use\nWhile the major part of their commercial production was of plain utilitarian wares, Doulton & Co. also made a smaller more specialised range of useful but artistic wares serving a wealthy, predominantly London clientele.  For these clients, beer-drinking had attractive connotations with a mythical 'merrye England', without the adverse status as a purely working man's drink which it later acquired.\n\nPeople\nGeorge Tinworth studied at the Lambeth School of Art under John Sparkes and at the Royal Academy.  In 1866, he was among the first students employed by Henry Doulton to work for Doulton's Lambeth factory.  Over a long career he made panels, (often religious in inspiration), figures and, as here, applied and incised decoration on a wide range of Doulton's art wares.",
