The precision and high finish of industrial weaving is here put to good effect on these silk fabrics, some bearing designs related to Qing prototypes and some of a more innovative nature, but both aimed equally at a global luxury market. The names woven into the selvedges of the weaving companies attest to the ongoing practice of identifying for customers the name of the manufacturer in a highly competitive market place. These textiles were woven to be made into clothes although the range of garment types for which they were destined, from the neo-traditional <i>qipao</i> to western evening wear, was of an unprecedented variety and richness. Bright silks like these were eminently acceptable gifts from travellers returning from Hong Kong and China, their price advantage over Italian printed silk, for example, making them unmissable bargains.",
