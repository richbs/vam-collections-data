Her stock included pots by Bernard Leach and Norah Braden, wallpapers by Edward Bawden and Phyllis Mould, and batiks by Marion Dorn, as well as textiles. Nash gave her considerable encouragement, although his original intention of forming some kind of advisory committee with Mrs Kennington and the architect, R.E. Enthoven, came to nothing. The name of the shop 'Modern Textiles' was his idea; he painted a signboard for it and designed its writing paper.'",

Lewin, by whom presented to the museum in 1975.\n\nHistorical significance: Paul Nash was a painter, printmaker and designer who served as an official war artist in both the First and the Second World Wars. He was a pioneer of modernism in Britain between the wars, promoting avant-garde European ideas of abstraction and Surrealism in the 1920s and 30s. However, he also worked in the English Romantic tradition, and his treatment of landscape recalls the visionary painters William Blake and Samuel Palmer. \n\nAlthough better known as a fine artist, throughout his career Nash was very much involved with design and the applied arts. He created numerous textile designs, book illustrations and jacket designs, costume and set designs for the theatre and advertising posters.  \n\nNash painted this sign to hang outside a shop opened by Elspeth Anne Little called Modern Textiles in the fashionable Beauchamp Place, South Kensington, which opened in 1926. The shop closed the following year but the business continued to function for a number of years from Miss Little's home. Little had studied painting at the Central and Slade schools of art, and become involved with textiles and block printing when she was employed in a theatrical workshop after leaving college. Modern Textiles was founded to promote good design and to sell fabrics printed by designers such as Phyllis Barron, Enid Marx and artists Paul Nash, Eric Kennington and Norman Wilkinson. Little printed her own textile designs from lino blocks in a small workroom behind the shop. (See Hazel Clark, 'Printed Textiles: Artist Craftswomen 1919-1939', <u>Ars Textrina</u> 10, 1988, pp. 53-70.) Nash designed the letter paper for Modern Textiles also, a sheet of which is in the V&A's collection (E.68-1975). \n\nThe sign is double-sided; on one side the name of the shop is painted, and on the other is a version of the 'arches' motif which Nash often used in his designs, with a columbine flower emerging from the darkness.",
