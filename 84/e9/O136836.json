He travelled to northern  India to paint portraits and  watercolour landscapes and  returned to England in 1870.\n\nThe scene was originally thought to have depicted the Imperial Assemplage of India at Delhi for the proclamation of Queen Victoria as Empresss of India in 1877 - hence the inscription on the mount.  By this time, however, Landseer was back in England.",
