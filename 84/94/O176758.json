On the verso, a profile of a vase with a head on the shoulder and a figure composition on the body. The technique and paper of this drawing places it among the English drawings made c.1756. It should be compared with cat.rzr, a Kent chair from Tottenham Park, both in technique and in terms of design. Udy (1976) has argued that both chairs represent Kent types, although others have suggested that 5712.60 has no precedent among the furniture of William Kent and that it indeed relates to the earliest French neo-classical designs by Le Lorrain or Lalive de Jully of 1756. It is probably a modification by Chambers of the actual facts, as demonstrated many times in his record' drawings, but most significantly, for this case, in 5712.150.",
