High-quality pieces like this were commissioned from professional workshops, sometimes for display in private chapels. Other pieces with religious subjects were embroidered by amateur needlewomen for display within the home.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis embroidery was probably made in a professional workshop in London, though it might have come from Flanders (Belgium). Fine work such as this was carried out in England by members of the Broderers' Company. The Company had been granted its charter for the organisation of professional work in 1561 and had the power of controlling the quality of embroideries sold to the public.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis scene shows Saint Paul on the road to Damascus. The story, in which Saint Paul converted to Christianity, is told in the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament. Scenes from the Bible were extremely popular as subjects for embroidered pictures in the 17th century, but the great majority were taken from the Old rather than the New Testament.",
