            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nSmall portraits like these were often hung from ribbons and worn either at the neck or waist as personal jewellery. Painted miniatures were common in England and royal personages sometimes gave them to favoured courtiers. Anne of Denmark (1574-1619) wore miniatures of her husband James and her brother, Christian IV, King of Denmark-Norway (1588-1648). Producing silver medallions such as these was a contemporary Dutch practice that had been adopted in England.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThere is some discussion as to how these medals were made.  The fact that a number of copies exist has led some scholars to suggest that they were cast from a mould. Close examination shows, however, that there are small differences between them. One possibility is that they were partly cast and then engraved. We cannot determine exactly how they were made without analysing the structure of the metal.\n\nPeople\nAnne of Denmark married James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) in 1589 and gave birth to seven children, three of whom survived to adulthood. In 1603 James acceded to the English throne. Anne is particularly remembered for her interest in the arts. She commissioned work from the architect Inigo Jones (1573-1652), poetry from the playwright Ben Jonson (1572-1637) and supported several theatrical troupes.\n\nSimon de Passe (possibly born in 1595, died 1647) trained as an engraver in Utrecht in The Netherlands.  He spent time in Copenhagen working for Anne's brother, Christian IV. In England James I ordered from him  a series of portrait medallions in silver, perhaps as gifts for favoured courtiers. One at least is dated 1616 and the series was completed by 1619.",
