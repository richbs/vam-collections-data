Since this implies that its specific function was for use during prayers, and this may not always have been the case, modern usage prefers the term 'single niche' carpet.\n\nIt is woven from goat hair, with a red niche in the centre, and the spandrels occupied by flowering stems on a blue ground. The border is composed of symmetrically-arranged floral designs and has narrow bands of flowers on either side.\n\nThis carpet shares many features with that on the left [409-1880] - the same shape of niche, the same decoration in the spandrels and in the panel above the niche, the same number of borders - but this carpet is a more balanced and spacious design, which may indicate this is an earlier version. Both were made in the Ghiordes region of western Turkey.\n\n[information combined from old labels from Gallery 42, and Jennifer Wearden's carpet binders]",
