The trousers have a waistband of 3.5cms in depth with 4 belt loops, two at the front, two at the back. The trousers have a button and concealed zip fly. They have 5 pocket style, usual in classic- the front two are cut away with an additional watch pocket on the proper right hand side. The back pockets are rectangular in shape and open at the top. They have matching decorative trim of two parallel horizontally placed white lines on each pocket. The back left hand pocket has a TODDS \u00ae label sewn to the pocket side. The right hand back pocket is similarly branded with a larger sewn on TODDS label in brown fabric with white lettering. The jeans still have the card tag attached which they would have been sold with attached at the back right of the waist band.",
