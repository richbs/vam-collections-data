These plain glasses, strongly constructed and made from lustrous lead glass, could be adapted to almost any size, from small 'dram' glasses to huge ceremonial goblets with covers.\n\nMaterials & Making\nGlassmakers found that English lead glass, perfected by George Ravenscroft (1632-1681) in the 1670s, was slow to cool and therefore difficult to manipulate into fancy shapes. No frills or ornament of any sort were added to this glass.\n\nTime\nThe development of lead glass in the late 17th century finally broke the British dependence on imports from Venice. The new heavy material suited British taste so completely that by 1700 the influence from George Ravenscroft's London-based Italian glass workers had disappeared. Instead, a limited range of finely proportioned glasses and decanters were made in London, where the glass industry was then centred. It was to be some years before immigrant German glass cutters began to extend their craft from mirrors to drinking glasses.",
