At the centre is a bust-length portrait of George III within a circle resting on a trophy of banner, anchor and cannon intertwined with the thistle, rose, shamrock and oak. Above is a crown and sceptre. The inscription beneath reads 'THE REIGN OF GEORGE III. From his Accession to the Throne October 25th 1760 to the PRESENT PERIOD'. This is followed by an explanation of the chart of events which is printed in a spiral from the centre towards the outer edges of the handkerchief. The last entry in this spiral shell gives information as to the population of Great Britain and the amount of the Funded Debt., etc. and is dated 1st July 1812.\n\nIn the corners are busts of Pitt (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Fox (Secretary of State) with drapery upheld by a winged Fame, and bust-length portraits of Nelson (Duke of Bronti) and Wellington (then Viscount), with appropriate emblems. Between the corners is scrolling foliage with emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the crown and motto or the Royal Arms supported by the lion and unicorn.\n\nThere is a narrow outer border of chequerboard. In the corner by Wellington is embroidered in red silk the name 'THOMAS ABRAHAM'. The handkerchief is printed in blue on white silk.",
