On the reverse there is a <font i>fenghuang</font> (Chinese Phoenix) standing on rocks and a cloud. There is a bat on one shoulder and around the neck a border of palmate leaves, elongated at the shoulder.\nThe faceted foot is partly formed by green overlay, with very slight indentation underneath,\nThe modelling of the overlays is fairly crude and they may have been stamped out in a mould rather than carved.\nThis and the oblong shape suggest a date in the second half of the nineteenth century, perhaps during the period of upheaval in the 1850's and '60's.",

The habit of snuff-taking spread to China from the West during the 17th century and became established in the 18th century. People generally carried snuff in a small bottle. By the 20th century these bottles had become collectors' items, owing to the great variety of materials and decorative techniques used in their production.",
