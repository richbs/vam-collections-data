            "public_access_description": "For well over three decades Vivienne Westwood, along with her one-time partner Malcolm McLaren, has been at the centre of British fashion and one of its most inventive and influential designers. Westwood\u2019s career in fashion was galvanised by McLaren and together they launched memorable fashion moments, including Punk in the early 1970s and later their Pirates collection. McLaren and Westwood conducted a design relationship between 1971 and 1983. In 1990 and again in 1991 Vivienne Westwood was named British Designer of the Year; she has also received an OBE.\n\nWestwood\u2019s unique mix of practicality and inventiveness, her preoccupation with silhouette and the manner in which she manipulates fabrics result in dynamic fashion. Westwood herself once said, 'You have a much better life if you wear impressive clothes.\u2019\n\nThis ensemble is from Westwood and McLaren\u2019s \u2018Buffalo\u2019 collection (also called \u2018Nostalgia of Mud\u2019). Many of the garments in the collection featured asymmetrical cuts and rough materials such as sheepskin and horn details. Full skirts, such as this example, were made of patchily-stained, fragile wadding, and were inspired by a picture of dancing Peruvian women (Wilcox, C., 'Vivienne Westwood', V & A Publications, 2004, p. 18).",
