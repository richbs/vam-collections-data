Briefly at school in London, then Leeds Grammar School. Returned to London 1827 to study at Sass's art school and 1828 at RA Schools. Travelled to Paris 1832 and Italy 1833-5. Exhibited 134 works at the RA between 1833 and 1882, 14 at the BI 1836--43, and one at the SBA 1837. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre; the fact that he was Roman Catholic may explain his choice of many of the subjects. Founder member of the Etching Club in about 1840. Awarded one of the three first prizes in the 1843 competition for the new Palace of Westminster decorations with 'An Early Trial by Jury'; travelled again to Italy to study fresco painting before painting several frescos at Westminster. Elected ARA 1843, RA 1848; appointed Professor of Painting at the RA 1867, and examiner in painting for the South Kensington Schools of Art 1870. Visited America and Canada 1876. Died Bournemouth, Hampshire, 21 August 1890. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, ppl77-9; CH Cope <i>Reminiscences of Charles West Cope</i> RA 1891 (referred to below as <i>Reminiscences</i>) \n\n<b>The Hawthorn Bush</b> \nFA54 Neg V1937 \nCanvas, 87.6 x 106.7 cm (34\u00bd x 42 ins) \nSigned and dated 'C W Cope 1842' br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1842, where, according to the <i>Reminiscences</i>, it was hung in the right corner of the middle room (the West Room according to the RA catalogue), and was bought by John Sheepshanks. \nNo title was given in the exhibition catalogue, but the quotation: \n\nThe hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade, \nFor talking age and whispering lovers made - Goldsmith. \n\nThe quotation is from the opening verse of Oliver Goldsmith's famous poem <i>The Deserted Village</i> (1770). Cope first treated the subject as one of a series of etched illustrations to the poem published by the Etching Club in 1841; a copy of the etching is in the V&A collections. Another etching in the series 'The Schoolmaster', was also worked up into a painting and exhibited at the RA in 1842 (8). \n\nThe <i>Art Journal</i> critic described it as 'perhaps the best of his lighter poetical subjects'. The picture was painted with mastic megilp, and has badly cracked, notably around the heads of the young lovers. The paint is also badly rubbed for half an inch along the top and bottom edges of the canvas. \n\nEXH: RA 1842 (507) \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1857, p240; <i>Reminiscences</i>, pp136, 378\"",
