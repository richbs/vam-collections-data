            "public_access_description": "Between the 1520s and 1600s it was particularly fashionable in England to embellish stone- or earthenware tankards with silver lids and mounts. The tankards, referred to in contemporary texts as 'pots' or 'jugs', were relatively inexpensive; adding silver mounts increased their value and aesthetic appeal. However, even the modest amount of silver needed for this would have been unaffordable to the average day-labourer. In the 1550s, the silver alone for such mounts would have cost around \u00a32 while a journeyman's wage was around a shilling a day (about 5p in modern British currency).\nThe skull motifs on the lid of this example are unusual: many tankard lids of this date are embossed with leaf or flower patterns, or with designs inspired by Classical ornament. The mounts do not quite fit the rim of the pot (they are abruptly cut away at either side of the handle and thumb-piece, where it would be more usual for them to be joined), which suggests they may have been transferred from the original vessel. This is supported by the appearance of the pot itself. The turquoise colour and glossy surface finish of the glaze suggest a date no earlier than the late seventeenth century and therefore much later than the mounts.",
