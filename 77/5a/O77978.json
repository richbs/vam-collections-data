Methods of consuming it varied over time, however, and it wasn't until the 16th century that steeping the  leaves in a pot became commonplace. In Britain, however, when tea-drinking became fashionable from the late 17th century onwards, the use of teapots was standard. The shape of this teapot is typical of vessels used for both tea and alcohol in 18th-century China. It was the prototype for the archetypal, rounded form of English teapots of this period onwards.\n\nPlace\nThis teapot was made in about 1750 at a kiln in the huge porcelain production centre of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province in central southern China. It was exported to Europe as a blank, undecorated item and was subsequently decorated with a design taken from an early print by the Paris-based designer and painter Antoine Watteau (1684-1721). This was done at a workshop in England, possibly in Birmingham, around 1750-1755.",
