It also provided opportunities to get involved in fun activities such as camping and pack holidays.\nHere are three Guide badges that all girls would have on their uniform, two of which feature the promise logo. The other badge is circular with a bird perched on a branch. This is a patrol emblem. These could be hand embroidered or bought ready made. A patrol was an important part of being a Girl Guide and teaches girls about individuality but also close team work.\nThe 1979 edition of the Guide Handbook  explains a Patrol: 'A patrol is 4-8 Guides with a Patrol Leader whom the members choose, and a Patrol Second who the leader chooses. no two patrols are the same, because a Patrol is made up of individuals....You all contribute your own characteristics to your patrol, so if you ever feel like grumbling, that your patrol is half dead, unoriginal, and unkeen, take a look at yourself",
