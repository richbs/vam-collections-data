ISBN 1851773088.\nThis boldly geometric dress was designed by the performance artist Stephen Willats so that the panels could be rearranged by the wearer in a variety of combinations, according to mood and environment. Willats chose PVC instead of more conventional materials because he felt that the new synthetic materials of the 1960s embodied the forward-looking spirit of the period. He designed similar dresses for sale in boutiques and other small outlets. Willats has staged his performance pieces in a variety of venues - from housing developments to museums - with the aim of making art a dynamic public event. Such activities blur distinctions between painting/sculpture, theatre, and design, making the art form difficult for museums to collect, record, illustrate, and explain. The acquisition of associated documentation and materials is one way of \"collecting\" this art. The Museum acquired the dress, the designs for it, and an accompanying helmet only in the 1980s; by then it had become clear that Willats's experimental design concepts were at the forefront of the artistic sensibilities of the 1960s.\n\nCHARLES NEWTON\"",
