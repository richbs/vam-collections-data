He is shown bejewelled with his crown of triangular panels, elaborate earrings and torque-style necklace, all emphasising his aspect of universal sovereignty.  He is shown with a close-fitting robe carved with concentric folds covering both shoulders, emblematic that he has already achieved Enlightenment. On either side of him are two smaller standing figures of Buddhas in monks' robes in <i>abhayamudra.</i> Above them within the niche  are two further seated Buddhas in<i> padmasana</i> (meditation mode) on single lotus thrones. The top register has a row of a further three small-scale seated Buddhas in trefoil-arched niches resting on bulbous columns.  The central one is in <i>bhumishparsa mudra</i> while the other two are shown in <i>padmasana</i>.\n      The main niche has faceted columns rising out of rounded pots decorated with lotus petals and fleurons within the interstices of the petals. The pillars are decorated with looped strings of pearls and jewels hanging from bands of pearls.  The moulded capitals above have a half fleuron suspended from their centres to an upper plain band on the pillars. Each capital has a <i>hamsa</i> facing outwards resting on top behind which rises a foliated scroll along the trefoil-shaped arch, at the top of which is a <i>kirtimukha </i>( face of glory). Immediately above, but below the seated Buddhas are the mirrored halves of a <i>caitya</i> window with further scrolling leaves . The slab has remnants of the pearl beaded decoration which ran as a border up its two sides.",

However, Stanley Clarke suggested that the Buddha Vairocana piece (IM.4-1917) stayed in the Indian Section of the V&A. Eventually, the pieces being held at the Bethnal Green Museum were transferred and now all 4 pieces are part of the V&A's collection. \n\nSee I.M.4-1917 for a slab with a similar architectural composition.",
