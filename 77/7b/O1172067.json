By defying traditional concepts of couture , this influential group of Japanese designers, have brought a  fresh look to Western dress.\n\nThis ensemble features a ruched sweater obscured by the voluminous kimono-sleeved  dress with a large cowl collar. The fullness of the dress is gathered in  by a deep elasticised band which rests on the hips beneath the folds  of the cross-over tunic.",
