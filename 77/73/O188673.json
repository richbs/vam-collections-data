He had made a journey to Constantinople in 1840 to intercede with Sultan Abdul-Mecit of Turkey. For a full description and illustrations of the Biblical and emblematic representations see The Illustrated London News, March 4, 1843.  The figures were modelled by E. H. Baily R.A, and the piece executed by Messrs. Mortimer & Hunt.\nThe composition is surmounted with a figure of David rescuing the lamb from the lion.  Below are four panels in low relief, showing the landing of Sir Moses Montefiore at Alexandria, his Audience with the Sultan of Turkey, the Liberation of the captives at Damascus and the Thanksgiving at the Synagogue.  There are four figures at the corners.  Moses, Esra, a Jew in chains and a Jew liberated.  On the base, four panels in low relief showing the Passage of the Red Sea, the Destruction of the flocks by Lions and Wolves, the Lion lying down with the Lamb, and an inscription.  The whole composition is supported with four sphinxes.",
