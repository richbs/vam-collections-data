His tomb has some of the finest examples of marble work in India. The intricately carved screens (\u2018jalis\u2019) are the work of skilled Gujarati craftsmen.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
