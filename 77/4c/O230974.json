Her hair is bound by a double fillet, one part of which runs behind and the other in front of the ear; at the back the hair flows loose. The shoulders are covered by a loose veil which leaves the breasts exposed. The body is cut off above the elbow and below the breasts. The relief has an arched top and is recessed within a moulded border, which is cut low down on the right hand side by the edge of the cloak. The marble is broken horizontlly across the centre. There is some plaster make-up in the neck and in two triangular areas in the border at either side. A large break at the top extends to the top of the head and is made up in plaster. The marble is broken roughly across the left bottom corner.",
