A detail of this frieze shows a maid servant warming her bottom in front of an oven. Beham's popular woodcuts illustrated the months using scenes of contemporary and mostly rural life. The frieze around the bottom of the beaker shows hunting scenes copied from prints by Hans Brosamer (1500-1554).",

The dining scene around the lip is an adaption of a woodcut for the month of January by the artist Hans Sebald Beham (1500-50). His series of woodcuts illustrating the months by scenes of contemporary and mostly rural life was a popular design source for goldsmiths. A detail of this frieze shows a maid servant warming her bottom in front of an oven. The frieze around the bottom of the beaker shows hunting scenes copied from prints by Hans Brosamer (1500-1554).",
