The success of a set design cannot be judged until it is translated into three dimensions by the set painters or builders. \nIt is often difficult from a set drawing to see how the design will be realised.  The designer usually conveys an impression which is then translated into detailed scale drawings and set models. Some designers build their own set models, others are realised by specialist model makers or set builders.",
