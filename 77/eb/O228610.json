The ground is light blue with 4 rows of birds, facing the opposite direction in alternate rows. There is a large plume from the bird's head and its wings are speckled.  It sits on a small diagonal branch with  blossom and a bud in front of it and a spray of flowers behind it.  There is a butterfly above this spray.  There is a vertical 'fish' motif between the birds and a schematic cloud motif below the 'fish'. Pink and green are the main colours but alternate birds and 'fish' have dark brown details. The metal thread is silver strip open S-wound on a pink silk core.\nBacking: dark pink silk\nFacing: bias cut black silk\nAdded Border: bias cut with black binding along the inner edge.  Pink warp and yellow weft.  There is a narrow border along the sides.  The main pattern has a diagonal blue carnation, a diagonal pink carnation and a white bird with a blue tail. The metal thread is silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core.\nThere are four pronounced creases in this piece which indicate that the cloth was folded to form an envelope, possibly to cover a small book, such as a prayer book.",
