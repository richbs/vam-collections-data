Photograph attached (1); a somewhat similar table and bench, though later in date, illustrated in Macquoid. English furniture, Vol.I. fig. 178 [actually a very different design of table]. One foot rail is missing.'\nRF M2661/1908\n\nOn loan to the National Portrait Gallery, London, June-October 1975\nOn loan to Mary Newman\u2019s Cottage, Saltash since 1984\n\nThis table, and an ensuite boarded bench were acquired as early 16th century, said to have come from Broadway near Ilminster (Somerset). The table (and possibly the bench which awaits review (2011) appears to be of late 19th or early 20th century manufacture as it lacks evidence of natural wear, and the timbers, especially the top are implausibly straight-edged. The use of some apparently old oak (for the top), and the creation of wear, for example on the stretchers, suggest a deliberate attempt to deceive.",
