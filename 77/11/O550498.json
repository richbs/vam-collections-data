The idea of an illustrated book of designs was attempted on several loose sheets by Pugin in 1831 with his 'Designs for Silversmiths'. 'The Chest' gives his book a theme which is continued in 'The Shrine', 1832, which was probably his next book. 'The Chest' marks a turning point between Pugin's early furniture and metalwork designs and his desire to train himself as an architect, also revealed in works such as 'The Shrine' and 'St Margaret's Chapel'.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In \u2018Contrasts\u2019, published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",

            "history_note": "This design is from 'The Chest', a volume of finished drawings of designs for an imaginary medieval chest and its contents which are mainly of an ecclesiastical character, based on Pugin's knowledge of 15th-century artefacts.\n\nThis book is the earliest of the group of bound volumes of Pugin's youthful ideal schemes in the V&A and it may be the earliest one there is. The idea of an illustrated book of designs was attempted on several loose sheets by Pugin; his Designs for Silversmiths, 1831. 'The Chest' gives his book a theme which is continued in 'The Shrine', 1832, which was probably his next book and which almost has a story to it. 'The Chest' marks a turning point between Pugin's early furniture and metalwork designs and his desire to train himself as an architect, which is also revealed in works such as 'The Shrine' and 'St Margaret's Chapel'.",
