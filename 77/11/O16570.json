Most portraits painted in miniature are sufficiently small to be mounted in lockets and could have been worn as jewels. However, many miniatures were also kept in a cabinet or in a small case to be carried and viewed as we would today a snapshot. According to the descendants of the sitter, this miniature was originally kept in a shagreen case (artificially granulated leather) lined with blue velvet.\n\nPeople\nSir William Palmer of Warden, Bedfordshire, was knighted 18 April 1641, presumably for military service. The following year saw the outbreak of Civil War, ending with the execution of the King in 1649.  Palmer seems to have lived quietly through the Interregnum, although, like many men at this time, he is painted wearing his armour. He married Dorothy, daughter of Sir John Bramston of Maldon, Essex, and was buried on 7 March 1682.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis miniature epitomises Cooper's skill at capturing character.  Cooper does not smooth the features to flatter.  Instead the sitter's face is shown almost in profile and raked by strong light, so that deep shadows emphasise each curve and crease.  Cooper's approach is very different from that of the outstanding miniature painter Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619), who followed his patron Elizabeth I's command to 'shadow not'.  Here the sitter's craggy, rugged features are subjected to close scrutiny.",

According to Long, (1)the miniature was formerly in a shagreen case lined with blue velvet. Long thought this was probably original.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> By descent in the sitter's family (called Palmer-Morewood from 1825); acquired by 1929 by A FW Gourlay (husband of Violet, elder daughter of the fourth son of Charles Rowland Palmer- Morewood, 1819-1873, see Burke, Landed Gentry); bequeathed to his son Peter Gourlay; bt by the Museum with funds from the R H Stephenson Bequest, April 1956.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> NPG 1974, no. 72, repro.; New Haven etc. 1981-2, no. 45.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Foster 1914-16, vol.
