It was made during the war and at that time Wedgwood were manufacturing mainly army mugs and utility ware which vould be produced by semi-skilled labour. Even the moulding weams were part of the design and the forms were simplified so that the workers who finished the mugs with a sponge were able to use the same process on the bull without any extra care or skill. The decoration of the zodiac signs were drawn by myself on the lithographic plates and all the decoration including eyes, nostrils etc., were mechanically achieved thus eliminating the necessity of any special skills and preserving the original quality'",
