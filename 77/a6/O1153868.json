Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increases the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nOlly the Kookaburra is one of three Olympic mascots designed by Matthew Hattan for the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000. Together, Syd, Olly and Millie represent earth, air and water. Syd the Platypus reflects the environment and captures the vigour and energy of Australia and its people. Olly the Kookaburra epitomises the Olympic spirit of generosity and Millie an Echidna is a techno-whiz and information guru with all the facts and figures at her fingertips for the new millennium. \n\nIn providing a historical narrative for the mascots it is hoped that the public will accept and relate to them. The public remained ambivalent to the three official mascots but Waldo, a character from a comedic television programme gained wide popularity.",
