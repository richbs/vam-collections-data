Known as the Doncaster Cup, it was awarded to Vedette, the winner of the Fitzwilliam Stakes run on Tuesday 15 September 1857. \n\nThe Illustrated London News reported, 'This race\u2026was most hotly contested. Vedette\u2026never came till opposite the Grand Stand, when Osborne made a splendid effort with him, and, by aid of unlimited steel and whalebone, landed him first by a bare head.\u2019 \n\nHugh Henry Armstead (1828-1905), who designed the cup, was a leading sculptor and silverware designer in the 1850s and 1860s. Here he drew on the Greek myth of Atalanta and Meleager. The story, which is engraved on the rim, culminated in Meleager presenting the body of a wild boar to Atalanta. This is the scene depicted by the group of figures at the top of the tazza-shaped cup. \n\nDesigns for race cups in the period 1840-1860 often bore little relation to their function. Such pieces were more often vehicles for sculptors and silversmiths to demonstrate their craft by depicting romantic versions of historical subjects, as here.",

Shallow bowl has cast frieze of 3 scenes from the story of Meleager (Ovid, Metamorphoses, VIII, 260-546) each separated from the next by a head of Diana. 1st scene: Oeneus, King of Calydon, arranging sacrifices to gods in thanks for a fruitful harvest but omitting altar of Diana. 2nd scene: Meleager, his son, & Atlanta hunting the boar sent by Diana to ravage the kingdom. 3rd scene: Meleager\u2019s mother, Althaea, is seen to be tossing a log onto the funeral pyre of her 2 brothers whom (she was told by the Fates at Meleager\u2019s birth that he would live until a particular log had been burnt) Meleager had slain in argument over his presentation of a boar to Atalanta after the hunt.\nThe cup was the prize in the Fitzwilliam Stakes run on Tuesday 15 September 1857, the first day of the St Leger meeting. The Illustrated London News reported, 'This race, with which the meeting opened, was most hotly contested. Vedette, who gave 3lb. for his year to Lady Alice and Princess Royal, never came till opposite the Grand Stand, when Osborne made a splendid effort with him, and, by aid of unlimited steel and whalebone, landed him first by a bare head. Fisherman, who was fourth, was only beaten by half a length from him.' \nDesigns for mid 19th-century race cups often bore little relation to their function, but were romantic, historicist vehicles for sculptors and silversmiths to demonstrate their craft. The Doncaster Cup of 1857, designed by Hugh Henry Armstead, was, according to the Illustrated London News, a 'superb work of art' in which 'the artist \u2026 returns to the \"\"Cup\"\" in its most classic form, but with finely modelled figures prominent in its ornamentation. In other words, the Doncaster cup of this year, is a tazza, in silver, surmounted by a group, which ... illustrates the \u2026 story of Meleager's Atalanta, from the \"\"Metamorphoses\"\" of Ovid' \u2026 The poet's story is here exquisitely told in oxydised and burnished silver.' \nIn Greek legend, Meleager set out to hunt a wild boar, sent by the goddess Diana to ravage the countryside, after Meleager's father, Oeneus, King of Calydon, had offended her. Atalanta, whom Meleager loved, struck the first blow, so when the boar was killed Meleager presented it to her. A dispute followed, during which Meleager killed his two uncles. His mother then threw a log of wood representing Meleager onto a fire, as the Fates had decreed he would die when the log was consumed. The group on the lid of the cup shows Meleager presenting the boar to Atalanta.\nThe importance of designers and sculptures to the silversmith was at its most pronounced during this great age of trophy production. The designer, Hugh Henry Armstead, studied in the School of Design at Somerset House and at the Royal Academy before working as a designer, modeller and chaser of silver for Hunt and Roskell and Hancocks.\"",
