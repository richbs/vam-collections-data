ISBN: 1854375830.\nExhibition catalogue.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 90, 94, 95\nThe following is an extract from the text on the entry:\n\nThis drawing is the basis of the painting \u2018Hadleigh Castle\u2019 exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1829 (Opp\u00e9, <i>Old Master Drawings<.i>, Vol. XI, 1936-7, p. 56; Davies, pp. 39 and 40).  The Tate Gallery has the full-scale oil sketch for the exhibited picture, which is in the note on Nos. 124-128 [D.228-1888, D.230-1888, D.229-1888, D.234-1888, D.231-1888] below, Constable says \u201cAt Hadleigh there is a ruin of a castle which from its situation is really a fine place\u2014it commands a view of the Kent hills the nore and the north foreland & looking many miles to the sea\u201d.\nA pen in drawing based on our No. 127 [234-1888], extending the composition to the right as in the Tate Gallery\u2019s full-scale sketch, is in the collection of Mrs. A. M. Austin, having been given to her father, Dr. G. D. D\u2019Arcy Adams, by Miss Isabel Constable.  It measures 4 x 6 5/8 ins.  (102 x 167 mm.) and may have been of about the same date as the oil painting.\n\nNos. 124-128 [see above] are leaves from a sketch-book used by Constable while on a visit to the Rev. Mr. Driffield, vicar of Feering, Essex.  Constable describes the visit in a letter of 3 July 1814 to Miss Bicknell, the original of which is in the Library of the Victoria and Albert Museum, No. D.236-1888.  In addition to the passages quoted above (Nos. 124 [D.228-1888], 127 [234-1888]) the following are relevant to the sketch book \u201cI have been absent from this place [East Bergholt] for near a fortnight, on a visit to the Rev. Mr. Driffield at Feering near Kelvedon\u2026 Some time ago, I promised him a drawing of his house and church at Feering; and, during my visit, he had occasion to visit his living of Southchurch, and I was happy to embrace his offer of accompanying him; by which I saw much more of the county of Essex than I ever had before, and the most beautiful part of it; as I was at Malden, Rochford, South End, Hadleigh, Dansbury, etc. etc\u2026.I have filled as usual a little book of hasty memorandums of the places which I saw, which you will see\u201d.  The water-colour \u2018Feering Church and Parsonage\u2019 in the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, was a result of this visit.  The Minories, Colchester has acquired a page from the same sketch-book, washed with a blue tone; it is inscribed by the artist <i>18 June feering Bury mill</i>.\nWith the drawings Nos. 124-128 [see above] is another page from the same sketch-book, with no drawing on it and no Museum number but bearing on one side a copy with variations, in ink, not in the artist\u2019s hand, of the inscription of No. 128 [231-1888], and inscribed in pencil on the other <i>M.C.</i> [Maria Constable].",
