Behind him on the left side of the panel stand two bearded figures of disciples, carrying closed books in their left hands, their right hands raised. A third beardless figure stands behind them next to a tree. On the right of the panel stand two veiled women and two bearded men with their hands raised. A youthful figure wearing a short belted tunic kneels in front of the donkey, spreading a garment under its feet. The figures on the panel are represented with their eyelids carved. Beneath the donkey lies a branch, and it has been suggested that the branch in this panel may represent a willow branch bearing male catkins. To the right of Christ's head are the remains of what appears to be a tree with two legs in it, which remained when the rest of the figure was broken off with the top of the panel.\n\nThe top of the panel is missing and the bottom corners are chipped. Christ's right hand, which was doubtless originally raised in blessing, is missing. The alabaster shows iron staining in the middle and bottom of the panel. No paint remains on the panel. The back of the panel bears a ridge where two saw cuts appear to have met. The ridge goes vertically from top to bottom. There are two holes filled with lead. The bottom has been slightly cut away.",
