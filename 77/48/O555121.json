Entitled 'Clip on bins - trays', the rendering shows how easy the products were to fit together and maintain. The accompanying advertising brochure stated, 'With the Crayonne Bathroom Range you have somewhere to put everything which leaves more room in the bathroom for you'. The finished products came in fawn, white, 'refreshing' pink and blue, which at the time were cutting-edge colour treatments. Made in polished ABS plastics, it had the added advantages of being scratch-resistant, shatterproof, non-corrosive and easy to clean around. The range, which was not at the cheap end of the market, could be bought in total or as separate items, but the marketing emphasis was on its advantage as a space-saving, co-ordinated, continuous system which could be easily put together by the homeowner.\n   The rounded forms copy ceramic precedents for fittings of the same kind. Despite the fact that plastic could be moulded into almost any conceivable form, it was often the case that when it was introduced as a new material into an established area it copied the traditional form before establishing its own distinctive shape. Although plastics had been used as surfaces in bathrooms since the 1950s, plastic goods were not at first popular in homes: its lightness and fragility, despite its obvious waterproof properties, was somewhat distrusted. There was also a certain British discomfort with throw-away products, which much plastic merchandise encouraged. Its advantages, despite its initial expense, eventually won its place in the market and in most homes, and the Crayonne rounded forms were very characteristic of mid-1970s plastic domestic products.\"\n\n",
