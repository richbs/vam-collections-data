Stated by the vendor to have come from the Monsieur Alphonse Kann (Kahn?) collection. Ralph Edwards (acquisition papers) wrote that \"I was also attracted by several of the French Renaissance chairs. One in particular I feel would be a very desirable acquisition, an example of the true \"caquetoire\" type carved with a mask at the top of the back. I do not imagine that this chair will fetch a very high price.'\n\nThis chair appears to have been expertly restored in the seat and feet, the other parts apparently original, but if the crest is also a 19th century addition, as suspected from the feel of the carving the original appearance of this chair - probably of similar form - is uncertain. If the carving is deemed original, then the chair may be substantially right in appearance. \nThe closest analogy is a chair published in plate 71 (PARIS, Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, catalogue et description des objets d\u2019srt de l,antiquit\u00e9, du moyen-age et de la Renaissance (Paris, 1855)) possibly now Ecouen, also apparently rebuilt at the feet and stretchers.",
