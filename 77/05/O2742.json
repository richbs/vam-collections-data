The initials \u2018C.K.\u2019 are thought to be those of the client. The beaker was probably painted by Gottlob Samuel Mohn (1789-1825), who learned the art of transparent enamelling on glass in his father's workshop in Germany, and at the Dresden Academy. In 1811 he moved to Vienna, Austria, where he became famous for his beakers painted with panoramic views of towns, buildings, flowers and allegorical scenes, such as this one.",

Kothgasser is recorded in the records of the Vienna Porcelain Factory as specialising in flowers. The garlands and borders on this beaker may be more typical of the Kothgasser style which throws some doubt on the attribution for this beaker. It is an early piece and may be by either Mohns or even Kothgasser.",
