The back is fan-shaped, with perforated acanthus scrollwork, flanked by terminal figures and surmounted by two sphinxes forming a pediment.\n\nThe back is fitted to the seat using the three vertical mouldings which pass through the seat and are wedged. The chair is heavy and the joints generally tight. Possibly constructed using old seats and fronts. Gesso is visible below the gilding.",

They were often highly ornately carved, and would have been very uncomfortable to sit on without a thick cushion, held in position by a circular dished area carved into the seat. This sgabello formed part of a set that belonged to Jules Soulages (1803-1856), a lawyer from Toulouse. His collection was bought piecemeal by this museum, after being exhibited at Marlborough House between December 1856 and January 1857. Many pieces, including this example, were heavily restored, or made up of a mixture of old and new pieces.",
