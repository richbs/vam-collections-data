Ward was deeply moved by a German girl who danced on the rope, playing with her feet as if assisted with the wings of Mercury; the proportions of her limbs and vivacity of her movements inspired him to think ''that if she be but as nimble between the sheets as she is upon a rope, she must needs be one of the best bed-fellows in England''. This may be the performer usually known as ''the famous Dutch Woman'' - the corruption of deutsch to Dutch was not uncommon'.
