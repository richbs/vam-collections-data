Both involved creating a pattern of grooves to hold ink in a metal printing plate. The image on the printing plate was the reverse of the final image. The etched lines were made using acid, while the engraved lines were scored by means of a sharp tool called a burin. The grooves were then filled  with ink and the image was transferred onto a blank sheet of paper.\n\nPlace\nHoughton Hall is a magnificent country house in Norfolk. It was built by Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister, in the 1720s and early 1730s. The bust on the mantelpiece is a portrait of Walpole.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nWhat appears to be a painting over the mantelpiece is in fact a sculpted relief depicting a Sacrifice to Diana. Diana was the classical goddess of hunting, recognisable by the crescent moon on her head.\n\nUse\nIsaac Ware's book on Houghton Hall was published only a few years after the house was finished. It was a forerunner of the magazines available today, featuring the homes of the rich and famous.",
