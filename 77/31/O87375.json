In 1897, Hoffman joined the Vienna Secession led by the painter Gustav Klimt.  In 1899, Hoffman was appointed Professor of Architecture at the Vienna Academy of Applied Arts; a post he held until 1941.  In 1903, Hoffman visited England with Koloman Moser.  Inspired by the example of Ashbee's Guild of Handicraft and supported by the wealthy businessman, Fritz Warndoffer, Hoffman and Moser founded the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte the following year.  Moser left in 1905 but Hoffman remained associated with the Werkst\u00e4tte until 1931.  At first Hoffman's metalwork for the Werkst\u00e4tte was severely rectinlinear, owing much to the Scottish architect, CR Mackintosh but towards the 1920s, Hoffman turned to a much more curvilinear style which was in marked contrast to his earlier manner. \"",
