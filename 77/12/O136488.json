According to the Revd Walsh\u2019s text accompanying this picture `the caffinet, or coffee-house is something more splendid, and the Turk expends all his notions of finery and elegance on this his favourite place of indulgence' (p.59). This coffee house is typical of the ornate rococo style in which many coffee houses were built. They were timber-framed, the interiors carved and painted, and often equipped with small decorative fountains to cool the air in summer. Here the customers could drink their coffee while listening to music, have a shave, smoke their pipes, listen to storytellers, meet their friends or just relax.  As these structures were made of wood, they were particularly vulnerable to the terrible fires that broke out frequently in Istanbul. It is doubtful if a single example of a nineteenth century rococo wooden coffee house still survives.",
