Nuremberg was the major centre of production of brass bowls but not the only one. Other centres of brass production were Dinant in Flanders and its immediate neighbourhood, from Bouvignes to Aachen.  \n\nDuring the period 1500-1600 when this dish was produced, refugee metalworkers had fled to other areas after the downfall of Dinant in 1466. Dishes exported from one area of manufacture were being copied in another. As a result metalworkers in Northern Europe used styles and techniques from other regions which can make it difficult to identify exactly where some brass bowls were made.\n\nDishes exported to England were sometimes used as alms dishes.  Elsewhere their function was primarily secular. European paintings of domestic interiors show that they were frequently used in conjunction with lavabos or ewers for washing hands after a meal. Before diners regularly ate with forks, such equipment was essential to any dining table.",
