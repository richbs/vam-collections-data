These hang down from the hatband, which is worn on top of the head. The design is an early example of Frederick Fox\u2019s work and shows the variety of materials (fabric, velvet, straw, feathers) that he used.\n\nSir Frederick Fox retired from the millinery business in 2002, following 40 years of hat-making. Australian born Fox moved to London in 1958 to work with milliners Otto Lucas and later Mitzi Lorenz. In 1964 he opened his own salon in London's Brook street. Milliner to the Queen since 1969, Fox designed classic styles made to the highest standard and worn by an international clientele to imporatant public and private events.\n\nFollowing his retirement Fox returned to Australia and became a patron of the Australian Millinery Association.",
