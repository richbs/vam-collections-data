London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Heinrich K\u00fchn   German, worked Austria   1866-1944\nPortrait of Alfred Stieglitz   1907\nOil pigment print\n289 X 227 mm   Mus. no. 38-1977   Purchase</i>\n\nThe variations of the oil pigment process, which relied on the selective taking up of fatty inks or oil-based pigments by a selectively hardened gelatin layer, are difficult to distinguish from each other, at least from their end products, especially since the ink image was often transferred to a paper or tissue sheet.  This example is almost certainly by the oil pigment process in which an inked-up gelatin relief was used to transfer the ink image to a thin paper tissue.  The oil pigment process used contact printing from a large negative to produce the gelatin relief.  The later Bromoil process allowed prints to be made from small negatives by enlargement.  This portrait was made in his studio in Innsbruck by the leader of Austrian art photography, whose prints were collected and published by the leader of American art photography, Alfred Stieglitz.  In the summer of 1907 K\u00fchn and the Americans Frank Eugene. Edward Steichen and Stieglitz experimented together with the new Autochrome process in Bavaria.  In the same year also Stieglitz's journey to Europe resulted in his famous photograph <i>The Steerage</i>, which represented his commitment to straight photography and modern subject matter.  He had little stylistic influence on K\u00fchn and it has been suggested that his main importance for K\u00fchn may have been as exemplar of the photographic impresario.  The manipulative oil pigment process allowed K\u00fchn to represent the cloaked figure of Stieglitz as a personage rising out of and above darkness, an aesthete of the Pictorialist epoch.  Two years later K\u00fchn achieved triumph by arranging for the acquisition of photographs from the artistic section of the 1909 International Exhibition by the Dresden Museum, a precedent applauded by Stieglitz in the pages of <i>Camera Work.</i>\"",
