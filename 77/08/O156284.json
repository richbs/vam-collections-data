The arch is delineated by 2 composite diagonal bands of narrow trellis pulled thread, a pulled thread zigzag section, either side of a band holding a row of 8-pointed stars. The spandrels are patterned with narrow diagonal bands of pulled thread trellises alternating with bands of straight stitch in zigzags, small lozenges, or squares.  All around this central area is a wide composite band made up of:\n[a] diagonal pulled thread work\n[b] needlewoven row of joined lozenges\n[c] trellis of straight stitched lozenges within a pulled thread trellis.\nThen a repeat of [a] and [c].\nA row of straight stitched 4-leaf fans finishes the section.  The ends of the 3 raw edges have been deliberately frayed.\nLinen [?] thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
