This small wood engraving is typical of his lyrical style, which was influenced by early German and Flemish woodcuts and the work of British engraver Thomas Bewick (1753-1828).  In hindsight, the rather menacing subject - the shadow of a plane falling on a hill - seems to foreshadow Ravilious's untimely death.  An official war artist from 1939, he died in a flying accident off the coast of Iceland in 1942.",
