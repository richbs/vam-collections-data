The palette comprising opaque colours also imitates the large scale Safavid tile panels with scenes of entertainments in gardens.\n\nThis tile may have been installed in a building in Iran as part of a 'procession' theme within a continuous wall frieze; initially they were thought to have been removed from the ruins of the palace of Shah Abbas II (1642-66).  However, this type of tile was also available singly, acquired by Western visitors as souvenirs of a visit to Iran. It was an immensely popular model, pulled from the same mould, evidence of a degree of mass production. A similar tile in the Bargello Museum, was donated in 1888 by Louis Carrand.",
