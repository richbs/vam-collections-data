Above all, his pieces are beautiful - considered as works of art.\" But the chairs \"were not really comfortable to sit in for the average person.  The dimensions were somewhat too generous.\" \n\nFinn Juhl was a master of sculptural, organic forms and natural materials, and learned from both handcraft traditions and mass-production techniques.
