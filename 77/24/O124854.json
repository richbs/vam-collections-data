This object is designed to carry two vase-shaped, open-topped containers, a flat container held up by two fauns, with a globular bottle behind drawn by an anonymous designer about 1780. This design and drawings for alternatives for the globular bottle are by the same hand and for the same project (E.897:14-1988 and E.897:310-1988). They were made for an elite client possibly of the Court of Louis XVI, King of France from 1774 until 1791, at Versailles, Paris. \n\nThe designs are from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and include those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
