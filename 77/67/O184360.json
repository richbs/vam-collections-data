Roger Daltry (b. 1944), the lead singer, became more flamboyant in his dress sense and this jacket and these trousers are an example of his break away from the trappings of 1960s style. \nDaltrey has stated in interview that his reasons for choosing this approach was his interest in Native American culture and also, simply, that \"a friend of mine was making buckskins so I had a suit made\". (Hearn, 2005 p.110). The jacket was worn without a shirt revealing Daltry's toned body; a display of virility that many other rock stars utilise to this day.\n\nRoger Daltry wore this outfit on stage during several seminal performances by The Who, including 1969's Isle of Wight Festival and their famed Woodstock appearance, where their performance was delayed until 4am. It was, nevertheless, considered one of the highlights of the festival and cemented their place in the American music charts from that point on.",
