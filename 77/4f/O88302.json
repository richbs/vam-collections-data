The firm opened a small London factory in 1898 for the production of Art Nouveau silver and became a major supplier to Liberty & Co. and foreign retailers including Citroen of Amsterdam. It is likely that Harris worked from the London factory.\n\nHer work, chiefly in the Art Nouveau style, was enthusiastically received. The Studio journal described it as 'gracefully conceived and executed'.  A number of her designs were executed by William Hutton & Sons and retailed by the Goldsmiths' and Silversmiths Company. These included a teaset of 1898 and this floral motif cup and cover, one of the winning designs in the 1900 Paris Exhibition.",
