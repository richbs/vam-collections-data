This portrait shows an unidentified young man wearing a lavish brocaded banyan, an outfit that was fashionable in the third quarter of the 17th century, suggesting a date of execution of the painting around 1685. To judge from his rich outfit, the sitter was probably a member of the upper society. Louis Ferdinand Elle was best known for his portraits, most of which are known only from engravings.",

Boyer (written communication, March 2011), this portrait was most likely executed by Louis Ferdinand Elle (1612- 1689), elder son and pupil of his father, the painter Ferdinand Elle, whom he succeeded as court painter. Like his father he mainly painted portraits even though he also produced mythological scenes and allegories. Most of his paintings are now known only from engravings.\n\t\nThe present portrait depicts a gentleman wearing a banyan of rich brocaded silk lined with mauve silk, a lace cravat and lace cuff to match within a painted oval truncated at top, bottom and sides. The costume suggests a date around 1685 and was therefore painted in the very late period of Elle\u2019s career. Portrait paintings with sitter wearing a banyan were quite fashionable at the end of the 17th century. Pierre Mignard, for instance, executed a self-portrait in a similar outfit around 1690 ( Louvre, Paris - INV 6653). \n\nA painting, <i>Portrait of Samuel Bernard (1615-1687)</i> (Mus\u00e9e National des Ch\u00e2teaux de Versailles et du Trianon, Versailles - Inv. 4389), made as a \u2018morceau de r\u00e9ception\u2019 in 1681, depicts a portrait of a man wearing a similar banyan with a close floral pattern.  The delicate modelling of the face and diffuse light as well as the sitter\u2019s pose are characteristic of Elle\u2019s manner.",
