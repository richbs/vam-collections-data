            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of Fujin. In Japanese mythology Fujin is God of the Wind portrayed, as within this netsuke, as a horned demon carrying a large bag on his back containing windy weather. Walking above the clouds Fujin's quizzical expression suggests that he is considering whether or not to open his bag. Fujin is often depicted with Raijin, the God of Thunder.  \n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masakazu. The name Masukazu was used by eleven netsuke carvers during this period.",
