The centre of the front is occupied by two hinged doors, one pierced with a rectangular panel of tracery and the other with a circular nose.\nThe doors are bound by four long iron hinges each terminating in a rosette. At the top is a battlemented moulding.\n\n15th June 2005\n<u>Notes from Loan visit to Oakwell Hall:</u>\n\nThe main timbers about 3cm thick.\n\n<u>Anomalies</u>\nNo base or feet as such.\nOstensibly held together with very large hand-made nails, modern nails and traces (PR rear) of metal angle reinforcers.\nThe hinges old and hand-made but more solid than you'd expect.\nAll kinds of ironmongery added inside doors.\nReport of carving added to doors - carvings themselves unconvincing.\nVery unusual vertical mouldings down front stiles/legs - Germanic?\nCastellated top rail - Germanic?\nLots of exp worm on PR side (could be reused  table top).\nLots of newish nails all over it.\nBack and PL side and PL front stile of more degraded oak planks than top and PR side and PR stile.\n\n<u>Repairs</u>\nThe interior corners reinforced with pine battens on modern nails.\nAt one point fitted with 3 shelves (missing).\n\n<u>Summary:</u> Suspicious. Could be German perhaps with nasty alterations. If English then more likely to be a lash-up with old and distressed timbers.",
