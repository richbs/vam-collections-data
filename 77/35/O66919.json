            "public_access_description": "The scene depicted in this panel is a traditional representation of the Last Supper. The Twelve Apostles are gathered around the central figure of Jesus Christ, and the young John the Evangelist lays his head on Christ\u2019s lap. At the Crucifixion, Christ will entrust him with the care of his mother, Mary.\n\nChrist will soon announce that one of the Apostles is going to betray him. We see Judas in the foreground, identified by the red bag he carries. This contains the 30 pieces of silver with which the authorities bribed him to betray Christ.\n\nThis image derives from a design by the artist Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5\u20131545). It was adapted by a craftsman in the stained-glass workshop of Veit Hirsvogel the Elder in Nuremberg. The panel was originally in the Augustinian church of St Veit in Nuremberg.",
