At that time, Barbie was enjoying great success in America but market research showed that a doll similar to this would not go down well in the UK. Instead, Sindy became a 'girl next door' type doll with a natural pretty face and a smaller bust. \n\nSindy was released at a time when fashion was to see a revolution, hence why the tag line 'the doll you love to dress' was popular. In 1970, which is when this doll was produced, a new selection of clothes were available to Sindy, totaling 26 complete outfits. This particular outfit is quite rare but was produced at the same time as the range including College girl, Shiny Shopper, Sweet Dreams and Skater.",
