He sits on two coils of the snake (<i>naga</i>) deity, Muchalinda, whose body curls up behind the master's raised arm with his multi heads fanning out above the Buddha's head. This represents the scene when the serpent-king Muchalinda protected the Buddha for seven days during a violent storm after his Enlightenment. The relief is damaged on the right side so that half of the snake deity's heads are missing.  The Buddha wears a monk's robe which is shown falling over his left shoulder with the end tucked over his left arm above his hand which rests upturned in his lap. The Buddha has  a severe appearance with a turned -down mouth, deep-set staring eyes, long ear lobes and his hair shown like a cap inscribed with rough circles to denote curls rising to a shallow ushnisha.",
