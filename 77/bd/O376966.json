From 1874 to 1880, Voysey worked as a pupil in the office of J.P. Seddon, then briefly as an assistant to George Devey.  In 1882 he set up his own office, but concentrated at first on decorative work rather than architecture, selling his first designs for fabrics and wallpaper in 1883.  In 1884, he joined the Art Workers\u2019 Guild and his first house was not built until 1888.\n\nIn 1891 Voysey designed a house in Bedford Park.  Known as the \u2018Grey House\u2019 it stands out from its neighbours, by this time 15 years old and in a style which was rapidly being superseded, as a foretaste of Voysey\u2019s more uncompromising style, soon to supplant the \u2018Shavian\u2019 Queen Anne as the most potent influence on urban and suburban development.  In 1900, he completed his own house, \u2018The Orchard\u2019 at Chorley Wood in Hertfordshire, for which he designed much of the furniture, the decoration and the fittings.  His characteristic style, simple linear and with almost no surface decoration, was to be widely copied in \u2018artistic\u2019 interiors of the period.\n\nIn 1924, he was made Master of the Art Workers; Guild.  His work was known in Europe through his participation in a number of exhibitions; he showed architectural work in the Salons de la Libre Esthetique in 1894 and 1897 and he also exhibited alongside the Glasgow School \u2018Four\u2019 at Liege in 1895 and in Turin in 1902.",
