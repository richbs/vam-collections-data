He specialised in erotic and pastoral subjects which were later engraved. His style betrays the influence of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-1770), Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732-1806) and Pierre-Antoine Baudouin (1723-1769) as well as Antoine Watteau (1684-1721). \n\nThis painting is a good example of Schall's genre scenes, a category for which he is best known. This painting shows a lady seated on her with an empty bird cage, which probably suggests that she was abandoned by her lover. It is a good example of the late Rococo movement still in fashion although in decline in France at the end of the 18th century.",

He visited Italy in 1755-56, and became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1769. His output includes portraits and genre scenes as well as the female heads, for which he is well known. His great popularity did not survive the Revolution. \nLit. C. Mauclair, <i>Greuze, with a Catalogue raisonn\u00e9</i> by J. Martin and Ch. Masson, Paris, 1907. \n\nFollower of Jean-Baptiste GREUZE \n\n160 \nGIRL WITH A BIRDCAGE SEATED ON A BED \nPanel \n9 \u00bc x 11 \u00bc (23.5 x 28.5) \nForster Bequest \nF.10\n\nThe bird appears to have flown, for the cage is shown empty, and the young lady is left alone on the rumpled bed. \nThe old ascription to Greuze has not gone unchallenged and attributions to Nicolas Bernard Lepici\u00e9, Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schall and Michel Martin Drolling were suggested in the 1920S, and '30s. Cleaning in 1958 not only revealed a higher quality than had previously been suspected but also led to the discovery of an old inscription on the back of the panel: <i>Greuze 1787. Vte Vaudreuil 1002, Vte Cochu 540</i>. \nAn 18th century provenance of this kind might be taken to support the picture's attribution to Greuze, but unfortunately it has not proved possible to verify this at any point. The painting does not appear in the Vaudreuil sales held in Paris (Lebrun) on 24 Nov. 1784 and 26 Nov. 1787, nor in the sale of Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Cochu, M\u00e9decin, Paris, Regnault, 6-9 Mar. 1796. The catalogue of the second Cochu sale, 21-2 Feb. 1799, is not available in London or in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris. \nThe subject and treatment are very close to various genre pieces painted by Greuze in the earlier part of his career (considerably earlier than 1787, the date inscribed on the back of the panel). A similar composition, for example, is the <i>Vertu Chancelant</i> of ca. 1770-76 in Munich (3 1 \u00bc x 24 \u00bc in.; <i>France in the 18th century</i>, R. A., 1968, no. 311, fig. 235). However, F.10 is very much smaller than works of this type by Greuze and in details the painting betrays weaknesses which militate against its being by his hand. Edgar Munhall has suggested Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schall (1752-1825) as a possible alternative (letter of 1963 referring to two paintings by Schall in Exhibition of paintings of the 18th century, H. Terry-Engell Gallery, 1963, nos. 31-2). This is a reasonable attribution and one which would overcome the objection of size, for Schall frequently worked in a small format. Yet the subject-matter is more akin to Greuze than to Schall and the latter's rather broad brushwork is not paralleled in F.10. Until further evidence is forthcoming, this painting is best described as a contemporary work reproducing Greuze's type of composition on a reduced scale. \n\nProv. (?)

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990.  p.xix\n\nJohn Forster (1812-1876)  was born in Newcastle, the son of a cattle dealer.  Educated at Newcastle Grammar School and University College London, he was a student in the Inner Temple 1828 and qualified as a barrister 1843.  Began his career as a journalist as dramatic critic of the <u>True Sun</u> 1832; he later edited the <u>Foreign Quarterly Review</u> (1842-3), the <u>Daily News</u> (1846) and most famously the <u>Examiner</u> (1847-55).  He was the author of numerous works, notably the <u>Life and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith</u> (1848) and the <u>Life of Charles Dickens</u> (1872-4).  He bequeathed his extensive collection of books, pamphlets, manuscripts, prints, drawings, watercolours and oil paintings to the V&A.  \nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.  The Dyce and Forster Collections. With Engravings and Facsimiles</u>.  Published for the Committee of Council on Education by Chapman and Hall, Limited, 193, Piccadilly, London.  1880.  <u>Chapter V. Biographical Sketch of Mr. Forster</u>. pp.53-73, including 'Portrait of Mr. Forster' illustrated opposite p.53.\n\nHistorical significance: Formerly catalogued as \u2018style of Jean-Baptiste Greuze\u2019, this painting shows striking similarities with the oeuvre of Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schall who specialised in small scale genre scenes on panel (an attribution supported by E. Munhall, verbal opinion 1963). An old inscription on the back of the panel: <i>Greuze 1787. Vte Vaudreuil 1002, Vte Cochu 540</i> implied that the painting was a genuine work by Greuze however the painting does not appear in any of the Vaudreuil sales held in Paris (Lebrun) on 24 Nov. 1784 and 26 Nov. 1787, nor in the two sales of Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Cochu, M\u00e9decin, Paris, Regnault, 6-9 Mar. 1796 and 21-2 Feb. 1799. \nThe present painting shows a lady seated on her bed with an empty bird cage, a subject matter that is quite typical of Schall\u2019s small genre pieces (see for instance <i>Le fid\u00e8le indiscret</i>, formerly in the collection of Emile Delagarde, Paris, <i>La belle cachette</i> formerly collection of G. Alexis Godillot, Paris and <i>Le bouquet impromptu</i>, formerly Jacques Lehideux\u2019s collection, Paris.) The compositional idea showing a lady with her breast half hidden is quite recurrent in Schall\u2019s oeuvre also the facial type does not bear the prettiness of most of his female figures. \nThis painting can be somehow interpreted as a moralising image. In the 18th-century iconography, the gift of a caged bird from a man to a woman signified her capture of his heart. Here the bird had flown away, which suggests that the lady has been abandoned by her lover and in fact, is shown alone seated on her bird, with her corset wide opened. \nThis type of pictures was much in favour during the 18th century following the taste for libertine tales in French literature.",

            "historical_context_note": "Genre scenes and pastoral in 18th-century French art involve usually some idealized shepherds and shepherdesses set in a beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century in fact, the Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had became an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.",
