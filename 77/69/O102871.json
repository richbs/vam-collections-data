Around her neck is a fitted necklace.  The square-neck has a modesty frill and bodice finishes centre front in a point; the short sleeves hang long at the back over the fitted sleeves, which finish at the wrist with a cuff and a frill. The full-length underskirt is edged with a fringe and over it is a hem-length scalloped skirt, pleated into the bodice.  The bodice, skirt and sleeves are covered with braid to form graduated 'scales' set with 'jewels'.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
