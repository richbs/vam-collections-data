            "public_access_description": "Hester Francisca Burn (known as Francisca) visited Beatrix Potter (1866-1943) at her home in Sawrey in August 2011.  Francisca was five years old and spent the holiday that summer in the Lake District with her parents, Andrew and Celia Burn, her three siblings, Robert, Cordelia and Augusta (Gussie), and her cousin Barbara Ruxton.  The Ruxtons were staying near Beatrix Potter and arranged for Barbara and the Burn children to meet Beatrix Potter.  Beatrix introduced the delighted children to her pets Tom Kitten, Jemima Puddle-duck and her favourite sheepdog, Kep.  Francisca later recalled, 'I don't remember much about that visit to Sawrey. We all knew the books and we knew who we were going to see, and I have always understood that we went for tea.' \n\nOn 25 August 1912 Beatrix wrote to Francisca's sister Augusta stating that she had found the hand of Francisca's doll in a cupboard - presumably left there when the children visited Beatrix the year before.  Beatrix also wrote and illustrated this letter to Francisca the same month to explain how the doll's hand might have been removed. The letter is written by Tom Kitten who admits that it was he who shook hands with Dolly so hard that 'her hand comed off! After you went away Miss Potter saw a funny little thing lying in the middle of the hall, on the matting.  She could not think what it was, and when she picked it up, it was a hand! I am nearly grown up now. The big cat Fluffy is teaching me to catch mice'. Beatrix addressed Francisca as \"Double Dutch\" because she could not remember her full name Hester Francisca; it was probably also a reference to Francisca's blue and white checked dress and pigtails that she wore when she visited Beatrix the year before.\n\nWhen she was 21 years old Francisca spent a year visiting her sisters in India with her mother after the death of her father and grandmother. When she returned to England she trained as a Froebel teacher before her marriage to William Fellowes.",
