A drawing of the time of Sch\u00f6ngauer, but not fine enough for him in sentiment; showing a very curious treatment of the subject. The Virgin is seated at a reading-desk with hands crossed upon her bosom, a Gothic canopy behind her; the angel bringing a sealed paper, but not, as usual, a lily. An inner chamber is visible through a doorway, in which a bed is partially shown; a lozenged window behind the angel. Pen and sepia, highly finished and washed in some parts.  359 \n<i>Height,</i> 7 9/12 <i>inches.  Width,</i> 5 11/12 <i>inches.</i> \nCollections-Sir Peter Lely, John Duke of Argyll, Thomas Thane, and William Esdaile.'",
