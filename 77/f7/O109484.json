Catholics who refused to attend Church of England services were known as recusants and until the late 17th century they had to worship in secret. However, the Dukes of Norfolk and aristocratic families such as the Arundells at Wardour Castle encouraged Catholic communities to use their private chapels and so kept the faith alive.\n\nThe Catholic plate that survives from before the 1660s is mainly limited to chalices, paxes and pyxes. These earlier pieces are rarely marked. After 1688, Catholic plate was more often hallmarked and the range of forms expanded to include sanctuary lamps, cruets and incense boats. \n\nIn London, Catholics could worship openly in foreign embassy chapels. The silver from the Sardinian Embassy chapel can be seen in the case to the right. During the reign of Charles II, Catholic courtiers could also attend the queen\u2019s private chapel and that of the Queen Mother, Henrietta Maria.\n\nCharles Kandler, a German-trained goldssmith embroiled himself in the Catholic and Tory community. He had many Roman Catholic patrons and made plate for the Duke of Norfolk's private chapel at Arundel Castle. He also worked for William Meynell, 3rd Duke of Cleveland and Hugh, 3rd Lord Clifford of Chudleigh.",
