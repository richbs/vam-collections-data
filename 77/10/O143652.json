On their return to England she published privately Journal of A Tour In The Holy Land, in May and June, 1840, [published 1841.]  From this most of the sketches can be dated between 28 April (their arrival at Jaffa) and 6 June (an excursion to Baalbek); they arrived in Ancona on their return journey on 17 July.  In 1841 Egerton published Lithographs made from sketches made in Syria by Lord Francis Egerton.",
