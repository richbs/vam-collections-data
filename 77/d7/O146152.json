Its use as a wedding flower emerged in the early 19th century, and by 1840, imitation orange blossom was a popular trimming for bridal attire. It was believed to symbolise purity and innocence, and so was generally not worn for second marriages.\n\nImitation orange blossom could be made from wax, paper, cloth, or even feathers. This example is made from cream cloth which has been dipped in wax to reproduce the texture of the flower petals. The buds are made from paper pulp or composition, which has been painted and waxed. The leaves are embossed waxed paper.\n\nSprays such as this were sold separately, and would have been used as all-purpose wedding decorations. They were used on wedding cakes, for table-decorations and to trim favours as well as decorating the bridal garments.",
