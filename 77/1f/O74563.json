Opals occur in a great variety of body colours. Those with an iridescent play of colour are known as 'precious', those without are termed 'common'. Opals contain up to 10% water. This makes them particularly vulnerable to damage from dehydration and from immersion in some cleaning products. Fire opal is a variety of opal which is often reddish or orange. Unlike other kinds of opal, it can be cut with facets.\n\nThe V&A owns an important collection of 154 gems bequeathed by the Reverend Chauncy Hare Townshend, a cleric and poet. Sir A. H. Church gave additional specimens, including this one,  in 1913. He also compiled the first catalogue Precious Stones: A Guide to the Townshend Collection. The first edition appeared in 1883. The stones are mounted as rings, although they may not have been intended to be worn.",
