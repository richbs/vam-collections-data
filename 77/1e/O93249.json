The fabric was designed to be made into dresses or waistcoats. The pattern is of leaf shapes and decorative meanders in blue and two shades of red.  A bright palette was a dominant feature of mid-Victorian textile design. In 1856 the first truly chemical dye, Perkins' mauve, appeared, followed by aniline red two years later and then a rainbow of bright, garish colours. Few of the shades had been seen before and they had a strong novelty value. With this type of colour so inexpensive to produce, many people could afford fabrics dyed in, until then, unusal hues.",
