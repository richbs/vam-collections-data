The saint is dressed in a light blue mantle and green robe, and seated on a wooden Gothic throne, whose brown colour is created by a lightly tinted transparent flux over the plain silver. The arms of the throne are of buttress form, its back is engraved with a diaper pattern. The saint holds a martyr's palm in her right hand, and her attribute of a wheel in her left. She is wearing a crown, rendered by outlining in brown enamel, as is her halo. The background is delicately pounced with two plant sprays, smaller versions of these sprays decorate the convex upper surface of the broad moulded frame within which the enamelled panel is recessed.\nThe frame acts as the upper section of the relic case. It is decorated with ten broad quatrefoil rosettes, orginally covered with <i>rouge cler</i> enamel on the petals, the plain silver studs represent the stamens. The underside of the frame originally had a sliding cover slotted from the top into the two vertical sides of the case; this is now missing and the octagonal crystal cover of the relic now forms the back cover of the whole. This cover is held by four silver corners engraved with naturalistic trefoils with serrated edges. The case is held within a stylized hedge-shaped frame with lopped boughs to which it is attached by fourteen naturalistic leaves whose stems clasp the bough frame below. At the top two loops for suspension.",
