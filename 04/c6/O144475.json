She designed and made jewellery for Liberty's, London, from 1977 to 1982 and for Butler & Wilson from 1978 to 1982. She then went on to work in her artist studio to create bold and colourful jewellery, mainly using non-precious materials. The forms she used were in the main geometric, as in this necklace and bangle, or stylized motifs from nature in vibrant colours. Acrylic was her favoured medium.\n\nCathy Harris's death was premature and came at a point when her career was about to take off. In the words of Wendy Ramshaw, her acclaimed contemporary, 'she was a coming star'. \n\nHer work is represented in the following public collections: Crafts Council, London; Contemporary Arts Society, London; Hove Museum and Art Gallery, Hove; Ulster Museum, Northern Ireland.",
