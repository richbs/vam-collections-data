Cheaply made, in pressed glass, such elaborate sets became widely available.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of press-moulding glass with the aid of a hand-operated machine was first perfected in the United States of America in the early 1820s. It took only two people to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. By simply  depressing a lever, a metal plunger was lowered into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Europe and Britain, giving rise to stylistic changes and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid- to late 19th century the first period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved quality while cutting costs even further.\n\nPeople\nIn 1847 John Sowerby established the first factory in Britain devoted exclusively to the manufacture of pressed glass. By 1882 it had grown to the largest in the world, employing between 700 and 1000 people.\n\nDesign\nThe pattern is made in imitation of expensively cut lead glass.  Pressed glass never rivalled the prismatic brilliance and precision of real cutting, but it provided a cheap substitute, affordable to all but the poorest.",
