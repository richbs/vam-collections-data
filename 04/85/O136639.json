            "public_access_description": "Dummy boards are life-size, flat, wooden figures painted and shaped in outline to resemble figures of servants, soldiers, children, and animals. The taste for using illusionistic painted figures as a form of house decoration probably originated in the trompe l\u2019oeil, or life-like interior scenes painted by Dutch artists in the early 17th century. Dummy boards continued to be produced into the 19th century. They were placed in corners and on stairways to surprise visitors, or in front of empty fireplaces in the summer. Most were made by professional sign-painters, who also produced the hanging street signs prevalent until the late 18th century.\n\nThe clothing on this figure dates from about 1640 and suggests that she is a wealthy lady rather than a servant, although she is holding a broom. The Museum also has a companion board with the same figure holding a mirror (Museum no. W.89-1921), so the pair probably represent 'industry' and 'vanity'.",

Although servants formed a large proportion of dummy boards, these figures do not appear to be servants at all, judging by their expensive dress. Figures of ladies sweeping may have been set up to encourage house-maids in their work.  This figure has a companion dummy board, of a lady holding a mirror, so together they probably represented 'vanity' and 'industry'.",
