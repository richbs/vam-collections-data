An inscription on the minar states that building started in 1199, although only the first storey was built in Qutbuddin Aibak\u2019s lifetime. It was designed as a place from which to call people to prayer and as a symbol of victory. The photograph shows the main section of the first storey leading into the second storey and divided by a balcony from which the call for prayer was probably made. The diameter at the base is 14.32m. \n\nThe first storey is characterised by a 24 alternating angular and rounded flutes. The second storey only has rounded flutes but they are aligned with those of the first storey. An interesting feature of the minar are the balconies, one of which can be seen here. They are held up by a technique called stalactite vaulting. A series of mini arches support a system of little brackets which support the balcony. The Gothic balustrades which surround the balconies were added later by Major Robert Smith in 1828. \n\nThe inscriptions that can be seen in this photograph are the fourth, fifth and sixth from the base up of the first storey, and the first line of the second storey. The fifth line consists of the ninety-nine lines names of God and the sixth line contains versus from the Quran.  Source: Architecture of Ancient Delhi, Henry Hardy Cole, 1872, p80.",

The rival that will occur at once to most people is the campanile at Florence, built by Giotto. That is, it is true, 30 ft. taller, but it is crushed by the mass of the cathedral alongside; and, beautiful though it is, it wants that poetry of design and exquisite finish of detail which marks every moulding of the minar. \n\nThe only Muhammadan building known to be taller than this is the minaret of the mosque of Hasan, at Cairo; but it has a far nobler appearance, and both in design and finish far surpasses not only its Egyptian rival, but any building of its class known to me in the whole world.\u2019\n\nA History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, James Fergusson, London, Vol II. 1910, p206.\n\n\n\nBourne took this photograph on his journey through India during the 1860s. In the published account of his journey, on his first encounter with Delhi on June 25th 1863 he wrote: \u2018Of course Delhi can\u2019t fail to be interesting to the photographer: the Cashmere Gate, the fort, and other noted places must be taken, while its mosques and similar buildings will be photographed for their own merits. About eleven miles from Delhi is the famous Kootub, of which many of my readers have seen Beato\u2019s large photograph, published by Hering, of Regent Street.\u2019\n\nBourne, S, Photography in the East, The British Journal of Photography, September 1 1863, pg  345.",
