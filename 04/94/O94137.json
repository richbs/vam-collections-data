The series of medals orSchautalers made for Friedrich der Weise from 1508 to 1519 are arguably amongst the first German Renaissance medals. Although Friedrich was appointed Lieutenant General by Maximilian (later Emperor Maximilian) for only a few months, he retained the title until Maximilian died in 1519. Schautalers were legal currency, but were primarily intended as show-pieces, as the name implied, and were produced partly for propaganda purposes, to publicise the Elector's title. The newly-discovered silvermines in Saxony were used to provide the metal. The medals were based on a stone model by the court-painter Lucas Cranach, and some were produced in Saxony; most however were made in Nuremberg, where the Elector's agents, Anton Tucher and Anton Tetzel, negotiated for him with the Mint-masters Hans Krug, and later Hans Krafft. This medal is based on one of the versions made by Hans Krafft the Elder between 1512 and 1519. However the diameter is slightly smaller, and the weighed greater than those measured and weighed by Grotemeyer. This implies that this medal is a later aftercast.",
