            "public_access_description": "Alexandre Leferre, the maker of this box, was one of the most prolific box makers of the 19th century. Probably working with his brother, Jean-Louis, he is first recorded in 1806 and was still active in 1852, when this box was marked. The engraved signature on the bezel shows that it was retailed by the royal goldsmith, Jules Fossin. \n\nThe box is set with a miniature by the French enameller Jaques Bordier. Bordier's work with his brother-in-law Jean Petitot had a great influence on subsequent enamellers.The portrait, which dates from around 1651, shows the celebrated Parisian printer Antoine Vitr\u00e9. Vitr\u00e9's greatest achievement was a psalter printed both in Latin and Arabic. He was patronized by the Cardinal Richelieu and was appointed printer in oriental languages to Louis XIII and later director of the royal presses.\n\nA letter in the Chaumet archives (the firm who eventually took over Fossin's workshop), indicates that the box was commissioned by the Russian prince Anatole Demidoff. Demidoff was a passionate collector, his fortunes based on the family's mining interests in Russia. Demidoff approved the scheme put forward by Fossin to create a box to fit this 17th century miniature. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
