It would have been worn by a member or official of the Laudable Association of Antigallicans, a society founded to promote British manufacturing and fight imports from France. The society met in London four times a year.\n\nPeople\nTwo of the three partners of the Battersea enamel factory (where this badge was made) are known to have been members of the Antigallican Association. One of these was John Brooks (active from around 1730 to 1756), an Irish engraver who attempted to patent the transfer-printing process used at the Battersea factory, and who had probably invented the technique in Birmingham around 1750-1751. Brooks was described as an Antigallican 'Brother' on an engraving of about 1752. Another partner, Stephen Theodore Janssen (born about 1658; died 1748), was Grand President of the Antigallicans. Of Huguenot extraction, he held a number of other posts, including Lord Mayor of London. The Battersea partners' dislike of the French did not extend to the French-derived Rococo style, which they used on their printed enamels, nor to French artists, one of whom was employed to engrave their printing plates.",
