His work may be described as Symbolist and has much in common with that of figures such as Odilon Redon and Gustave Dor\u00e9, although Hieronymus Bosch, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Francisco de Goya have also been cited as possible influences. \n\nBrandel\u2019s imagery often includes architecture or disturbing landscapes. Both are frequently inhabited by men, women and animals engaged in strange or ritualistic behaviour and sometimes endowed with supernatural powers such as the ability to float or fly. Even when devoid of human or animal life, Brandel\u2019s landscapes are often disturbing and eerie, as in this view of the edge of a forest, which suggests darkness and  impenetrability beyond its leafy exterior.",
