Although ivory, wood and stone are relatively easy to carve, other materials such as gemstones are much more demanding. Most of these carvings were made for wealthy patrons and collectors, who delighted in the rarity of the material and quality of the carving. The quality of the carving in this chess piece makes it unique. Although slightly damaged, it is one of the finest 13th-century ivory carvings in existence. As well as a king, the carving shows seven soldiers defending a castle, its walls covered with leafy foliage.",
