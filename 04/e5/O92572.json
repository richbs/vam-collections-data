It was made in Italy during the period 1500-1600 when highly decorated copperwares were very popular. Copper was as easy to work as silver and metalworkers used similar sophisticated decorative techniques for the two metals. Here the maker has decorated the surface with scrolling foliage and shields. \n\nBy about 1650 warming pans were common household objects. They were used to warm the bed but they were not left in it. Just before the master or mistress retired, a servant would fill the warming pan with hot coals from the fire and, using a long pole, swiftly stroke the sheets with it. Some dexterity was needed to avoid scorching the linen.",
