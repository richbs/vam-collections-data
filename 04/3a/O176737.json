            "public_access_description": "This plaquette depicting Hercules between Minerva and Venus, is made by Valerio Belli, in the first half of the 16th century. Apparently moulded from an impression of a crystal engraved in imitation of the antique. The subject and inscription (INSTAR) allude to the well-known allegory of the choice of Hercules.\n\nBelli (1468-1546) was born into a respected Vicentine family. He trained as a goldsmith and developed considerable skills in engraving crystals and dies. For Pope Clement VII he created his masterpiece, a crystal casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Belli was strongly influenced by Raphael and Michelangelo. He had a facility to work very quickly, and Vasari noted that Belli had flooded the world with his works.\n\nHercules (Greek name is Heracles) is one of the most important heroes in Greek mythology. He was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, a Theban princess. He is regarded as the embodiment of physical strength and courage. His two main attributes are the club and the lion's skin, which he won at his first labour. He had to undertake 12 labours as a penance for slaying his own children in an act of madness.\n\nThe Roman goddess Minerva is equivalent to the Greek Pallas Athena. She was the goddess of wisdom and the arts. One of her frequent attributes is the owl.\n\nVenus is a major Roman goddess principally associated with love, beauty and fertility. Her Greek equivalent is the goddess Aphrodite.\n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.",
