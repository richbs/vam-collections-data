Lockplates and key escutcheons, made of highly reflective materials, provided the finishing touches to decorative schemes. \n\nEnglish locksmiths were based mainly in London and the Midlands and were renowned for their ingenuity. Wolverhampton produced, according to one writer in 1686, locks \u2018curiously polisht and the keys so finely wrought, that \u2018tis reasonable to think they were never exceeded\u2019.  The diarist John Evelyn recorded in 1654 that a lock with \u2018rare contrivances\u2019 could be viewed as a masterpiece, \u2018esteem\u2019d a curiositie even among foraine princes\u2019.",
