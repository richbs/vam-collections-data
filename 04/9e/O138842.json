As she describes it: 'Political commentators sharpen their knives as Defence Secretary Geoffrey Hoon faces a grilling by MPs over his role in the invasion of Iraq. But he plays the boredom card, avoids eye-contact, and does his best to act like the dull civil servant who merely follows orders. As Hoon stonewalls the Commons, not even the eagle-eyed press can pin him down, and Hoon slips the net \u2013 again.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
