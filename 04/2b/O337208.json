He moved to Paris in about 1851 as overseer for the Dumas stove and tile firm and in 1855 opened his own studio and, later his own retail shop, with his brother Xavier. He invited many well-known painters of the day to design decorations and also to paint some wares directly. Ernest Carri\u00e8re (1858-1908), the painter of this large dish, appears to have specialised in birds; he decorated at least one other with a scene of a rooster and hens.   In 1887, only three years before his death, Deck, who had researched glazes and colours throughout his career,  became Director of the National Manufactory at S\u00e8vres.",
