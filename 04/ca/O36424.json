This design was made for the pantomime, Dick Whittington, at the London Palladium, 23 December 1969. The production was directed by Albert J. Knight. Mary Hopkin played Alice Fitzwarren.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of pantomime costume design of the second half of the 20th century and of the work of a designer who specialised in pantomime and variety design.  It illustrates a feature of pantomime of  the 20th century: the employment of stars of popular music, entertainment and television in leading roles, rather than established actors.",
