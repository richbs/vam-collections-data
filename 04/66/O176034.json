The donor stated that the paper was removed from a wall of 'Nacton Hall, Suffolk', but such a building cannot be traced. There is, though, a Broke Hall at Nacton, Suffolk, which was built in the first half of the 16th century. There is also a Necton Hall, Norfolk, which has been in the possession of the Mason family since the reign of Henry VIII. A similar armorial design is no 4. See J.
