The couple have every material comfort in a luxurious London house, furnished in the latest style, but they take no pleasure in each other's company.\n\nThe husband has returned from an evening of womanising and fighting, while the wife has been at home entertaining. The man on the right is their disapproving steward, in despair at the couple's lifestyle and their financial state - many expenses and very little income.",

Thus instead of working the plates with his own functional lines, Hogarth had them, according to an advertisement, 'engrav'd by the best Masters in Paris', taking particular care 'that there may not be the objection to the decency or elegancy of the whole work'.'",
