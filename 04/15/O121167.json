The garment has been pieced together at a later (Qing Dynasty) date from fragments of silk from an earlier period, (Ming Dynasty).\nThe original robe would have been looser and wider and in tailoring the present garment the most worn sections have presumably been discarded.\nAgainst a blue ground the design consists of a bold peony scroll into which are set roundels containing spotted deer and blue long life characters (shou). At the hem are gnarled rocks, more deer, and cranes.\nThe silk is patterned by the tapestry weave technique (<i>kesi</i>), and is executed on undyed twisted silk warps. The patterning wefts are also of twisted silk and are in red, bright blue, bright yellow, green, and gold-wrapped thread. A variety of tapestry weave effects and colour joining techniques are employed to produce the design.\nThe garment is lined with bright yellow satin weave silk incorporating plain weave dragon roundels.\n[Fragments] 11 detached pieces of the material used in the robe.",

The front and back of the robe indicate that the textile was consciously woven to be tailored later as a garment.  \n\nThe various symbols used indicate that this textile might have been associated with a birthday. The Chinese word for deer is \u2018lu\u2019, and the deer becomes a symbol of rank and remuneration which are also signified by \u2018lu\u2019. The peony motif signifies wealth and distinction, while the crane and the longevity (\u2018shou\u2019) characters are emblems of good wishes for a long life. This robe is the earliest datable whole garment in the V&A's collection of Chinese textiles.",
