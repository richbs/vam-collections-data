            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nA mezzotint is a form of tonal engraving. To make the design,  the surface of a metal plate is pitted  with a serrated tool called a 'rocker', then scraped and smoothed so that different areas of the plate will hold varying quantities of ink. This creates a range of velvety tones and white highlights when the image is printed onto paper. The rougher areas of the plate hold more ink and print dark tones, while the smooth  areas hold little or no ink and print light.\n\nPeople\nThe print is taken from a portrait of the Queen painted in 1688 by the Dutch painter and engraver Jan van der Vaardt, who moved to England in 1674. The portrait is now at Audley End, Essex.\n\nJohn Smith, the printmaker, was one of the most important mezzotinters of the period and published a large number of portraits using the technique. Although the mezzotint was invented in Holland, it was perfected in England and became known on the Continent as the mani\u00e8re anglaise. Prince Rupert, a nephew of Charles I, is said to have introduced it to England.\n\nSubject Depicted\nImages of royalty were always a staple of print production. This example shows the Queen dressed in the height of fashion, in the style set by the French court. She is wearing a formal gown or 'mantua' made of striped and figured silk. Her highly elaborate lace headdress was called a frelange, while the ribbon bows behind the lace were known as fontanges. The whole ensemble was held up by a wire frame called a commode.",
