In 1785 Bohea, the most popular type of black (fermented) tea, cost about two shillings a pound, and green (unfermented) tea cost between three and five shillings. Within ten years of this legislation, figures for imports of tea had quadrupled.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe pot is made from 'true' or hard-paste porcelain, made by combining china clay and china stone (or 'petuntse'). Although the secret of its manufacture had long been known on the Continent, no British factory succeeded in making it until 1768. In that year a patent for hard-paste production was granted to William Cookworthy (1705-1780) at Plymouth, who had identified Cornish deposits of the raw materials in the 1740s. Cookworthy experienced great difficulties in making and firing the wares, and in 1782 his successors sold the patent to a consortium of Staffordshire potters, who established the New Hall works. New Hall adapted Staffordshire potting techniques to the new material, and were commercially successful, making tea- and tablewares.",
