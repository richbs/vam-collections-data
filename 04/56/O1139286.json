            "public_access_description": "Norman Wisdom performed during the war as a musician and tap-dancer in army concert parties and discovered his talent for comedy when he found that his ability to fall over realistically made everyone laugh. He made his professional debut as an entertainer in the summer of 1947 aged 31, appearing as a straight man to the magician David Nixon with the Fol de Rols, a variety troupe based in Scarborough. His costume of a flat tweed cap with turned-up peak and under-sized suit become his trademark, and he went on to become a huge star and box-office draw in British films of the late 1940s and 1950s, featuring as the lovable but pathetic character Norman Pitkin. He spent much of the 1960s and 1970s appearing on television, including the 1973 programme Nobody is Norman Wisdom.\n\nThe artist Stacey Hopper was born in South Wales and taught art before the war at Ealing. In 1934 he published the caricature The Origin of the Nazi Salute which credited the salute as a tribute to an image of Hitler holding up n a paintbrush. During the war, whilst serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, Hopper's artistic talent led to his providing artwork for the Army Medical Department, notably to warn soldiers of the dangers of malarial mosquitoes. He returned to teaching after the war and continued producing caricatures for publication, especially of actors and entertainers.",
