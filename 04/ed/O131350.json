Pupil of the watercolourist James Stark 1839. In the 1840s painted landscapes principally in watercolour; elected Member of the NWS 1843, but resigned 1847 to paint in oils. Exhibited 68 works at the RA between 1836 and 1868, 75 at the BI 1836-67, and 19 (including two watercolours) at the SBA 1836-69. His landscapes were English and on a few occasions Scottish, and were usually richly wooded scenery with rustic figures especially children; the <i>Art Journal</i> (1865, p75) referred to 'the mannerism of the well-known \"Jutsum tree touch'\", Died St John's Wood, London, 3 March 1869. His studio sales were at Christie's 19 February 1870 and 17 April 1882. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1859, pp269-71, 1869, p117 (obit) \n\n<b>The Foot Bridge</b> \n1419-1869 \nCan vas, diameter 48.9 cm (19\u00bc ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nJutsum exhibited 'The Old Bridge' at the BI in 1865 (341), for which the price was \u00a350.\"",
