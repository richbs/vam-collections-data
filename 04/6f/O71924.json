The obituarist noted that 'the present complete system of circulation of works of Art to provincial museums ... owes much to the late keeper of the Art division.'\n\nOriginal acquisition information records that the Museum board was pleased to accept this bust as a gift from the subject's family 'in memorial of the valuable services rendered by Mr George Wallis to the Science and Art Department'.  In a letter Wallis's children described the bust as 'a most admirable work and a striking likeness'. In British Sculpture and Sculptors of Today (1901) M. H. Spielmann recorded: 'In his portraiture Mr Toft is dexterous and quick, and his busts are life-like; it is that kind of work which pleases sitters, for, besides resemblance, there are character, refinement, and style.'",
