The design of the back references shield-shaped chair back designs by the 18th century cabinet-maker George Heppelwhite.\n\nThe editor of Country Life, Edward Hudson was a champion and patron of Lutyens. Lutyens designed and built Hudson's home in Berkshire, Deanery Garden, between 1897 and 1902, before taking the commission for the Country Life headquarters. One of the chairs designed by Lutyens for Deanery Gardens is also in the collection. (see W.5-1990)",
