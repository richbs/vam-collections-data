By September of the same year, the magazine noted that 'unless it's a formal ball, dresses are short and full and rely for glamour on exquisite fabrics'.  The House of Worth designed just such styles, including the pretty 1955 pink princess-line evening dress (plate 44) with bands of paillette embroidery on bodice and skirt.\nde la Haye, A., 'Material Evidence' in Wilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, 2007), p.101\nIn the early 1900s the Paris couture house Wroth opened a London branch, which merged with Reville in 1936.  Clients were offered designs by Elspeth Champcommunal, a former Parisian designer and editor of British <i>Vogue</i>, alongside Parisian ones.  In 1953 Owen Hyde-Clark, who had worked with Maggy Rouff in Paris and Bradley's in London, was engaged to design Worth's boutique range.  About the same time the Parisian couture house Paquin bought Worth and in 1954 sold the name to Sydney Massin, who launched Worth (London) Ltd.  Once client, Mrs Roy Hudson, was a friend of Miss Whistler, Worth's head <i>vendeuse</i>.  She purchased Worth's gowns between 1947 and 1962.  Dating from c. 1955, when Hyde-Clark was also responsible for couture, are two pink silk evening dresses worn by Mrs Hudson, one long [T.124-1973] and the other in the fashionable shorter length [T.217-1973] that was acceptable for all but the most formal occasions.  Worth was known for delicately embroidered dresses in shades of champagne and rose, and these dresses are typical of the house's output (pl.4.10).  However, the V&A also recently acquired a plain navy satin evening dress with matching stole.  Worth (London) Ltd closed in 1967.",
