It was originally wider: the right-hand border has been cut, the width of the carpet has been reduced and the border has been re-attached, probably to make the proportions more acceptable to a European buyer.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIn a pile fabric, such as this panel, the foundation consists of two sets of threads, warp and weft, which interlace at right-angles. The pile is created by tying a knot of coloured thread around two adjacent warp threads, building up the design row by row while the foundation is being woven by the insertion of weft. It requires only a small, simple loom, and is easily done by hand.  In this panel there are 1,403 knots per square decimetre.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe pattern of this carpet is unusual: the palmettes arranged in diagonal stripes surrounded by a border of stylised stems and blossoms is often found on embroidered covers and wall hangings, but this is the only known example of it worked in knotted pile.",
