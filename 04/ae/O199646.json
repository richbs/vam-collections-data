On the outer surface of both the pommel and the cantle is depicted a family badge known as a mon.  The mon, which is composed of three lozenges, was the principal one adopted by the Ichi-hashi nobles, known as Kuge, and feudal lords or Daimyo.  The connecting wooden bars are decorated with small flakes of mother-of-pearl sunk into the black lacquer.\n\nThe shell-inlaid floral design on this saddle is also seen on Korean lacquer of the same date.  Although the body of the saddle is certainly Japanese, the decoration may have been done by one of the many Korean craftsmen who were in Japan after the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s.\n\nIt dates from about 1600-1620",
