The firm of Gillow & Company, of Lancaster and London, were making chairs of this type, which they called \u2018Drapery and feather back\u2019, by 1788. The design may have been suggested by the fact that, in 1787, the Prince of Wales took power as Regent when his father, George III, suffered a temporary bout of insanity as a result of the illness porphyria. The design was clearly popular because it was published as late as 1802, in a book of designs, although without the drapery.  A design for this kind of chair back is also painted on a pattern board in the Museum that was used to show different ways of decorating such a chair (Museum no. W.11-1993) and another version of the design is also in the Museum's collection (Museum no. 1458-1904)",
