Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>95 Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham</b>\n(b. 1621 d. 1682 ) \n<b>pseudo c.1666</b> \n304-1890 \n\n<b>Oval 68x56mm</b> \n\nFeatures loosely hatched in sanguine and brown, shadowed with grey, over a thin pale carnation ground; the technique throughout notably transparent and loose, the lights mainly washed out and the dark areas gummed; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some flaking; blackened lead in forehead and end of nose; the background repaired and small retouches overall. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century gilt-metal oval locket with deep flat sides turning sharply into a tooled front which holds the convex glass; on the front, an almost flat outer section of imbricated lozenges, a narrow band of opposed leaves and a concave quadrant. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> E Joseph: his sale, Christie's 11 June 1890, lot 1050 (as by Cooper), bt on behalf of the Museum. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 9 (after Cooper' on card); Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 56 (a copy after Cooper, by whom an original 'must have existed') and p. 164; Long 1930, p. 101 (relegated to a footnote referring to 'unimportant' portrait miniatures in the collection, not worth cataloguing); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9 (as 'formerly attributed to Cooper'). \n\nThe miniature has been left in its present condition for teaching purposes - as an object lesson in the blackening of lead-based whites. This policy reflects the minimal respect paid to the portrait either as a work of art or as an image of the sitter since Long came to the Museum in 1906 and began the serious study of the miniatures. \n\nIt is clearly a poor, late (probably eighteenth-century) and loose derivation from the Heneage Finch portrait type which is attributed to the Lely studio. The type originated in sittings to Lely in 1666, and versions with the Chancellor's robes appeared after 1674; (1)  examples of the Chancellor's robes version were or are at Voelas, Carnarvonshire  (2) and at Ophemert Castle in the Netherlands. (3)  Finch became Lord Chancellor, according to the DNB, in 1674 and according to Cokayne (1887) in 1675. Thus on grounds of date alone the miniature should have nothing to do with Cooper (d. May 1672) and on grounds of style or iconography there is little to suggest any connection with him. It must be conceded, however, that the same objection could be raised against the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, (4) in favour of which it is normally argued that the Chancellor's robes were painted on by another hand after Cooper's death, 'finished' perhaps, in the terminology adopted by Terriesi. (5) Shaftesbury became Lord Chancellor in November 1672, and the miniature is signed and dated 1670. In this case the robes are quite obviously painted by an inferior hand and look as though they have been added. These arguments do not apply to the Finch, although his collar is distinctly odd and possibly represents a misunderstanding by the eighteenth-century copyist of late seventeenth-century collars. \n\n1 See Beckett 1951, p. 56, no. 397. \n2 Collection of J C Wynne-Finch. \n3 Photographs in the NPG. \n4 Trustees of the Shaftesbury Estates (NPG 1974, no. 127). \n5 See his letter of 26 February 1676/7 (Foskett 1974, p. 64).\u201d \n\n",
