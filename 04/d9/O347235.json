Mr. Pyke had devoted most of his life to the study of waxes, and was the recognised authority in the field. His 'Biographical Dictionary of Wax Modellers', published in 1973, has become the standard reference book for students of the subject. Mr Pyke's own collection was wide-ranging, and included British, German, French and Italian portraits and figure subjects from the sixteenth century up to the present day. His generous bequest augmented and complemented the then existing holdings of waxes in the Museum, many of which are on display nearby in Room 63. The Fitzwilliam Museum also received waxes from Mr. Pyke's bequest. \n\nThe sitter Reverend Garnier was Dean of Winchester Cathedral from 1840-1872.\n\nThe sculptor Richard Cockle Lucas excelled in the production of wax portraits and reliefs during the mid-nineteenth century. This example illustrates his fluent naturalistic style.",
