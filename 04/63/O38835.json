The front leaf shows a grey tabby and white kitten wearing a red bow, beneath a large figure five added in fluorescent red card on a blue outline.  Partly visible to the right is the back leaf, which shows the heroine of the nursery rhyme 'Polly Put the Kettle on' standing by the fire holding a large green kettle, while a boy with a ginger kitten at his feet is seated on a stool and holding a cup and saucer; both are dressed in the quasi-historical costume typical of nursery rhyme books of the 1950s.  When opened out, the card shows more details of the scene, such as a mouse looking at the first kitten, and a verse which reads:\n\"Polly, put the kettle on,\nWe'll all have tea;\"\nWhat a happy Birthday party\nIt will be\nWith laughter, fun and joys untold,\nBecause, my dear, you're FIVE years old.",
