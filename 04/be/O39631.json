There is a similar North Italian Crucifix of unknown provenance in the Detroit Institute of Arts, but there Christ's feet are crossed.  The crucifix shows stylistic similarities to the Christ of the <u>Deposition</u> group at Volterra (E. Carli, <u> La Scultura Lignea Italiana</u>, Milan 1960, pl.6) and to painted crucifixes of the second half of the 13th century, such as that attributed to Coppo di Marcovaldo in the Pinacoteca Civica, S Gimignano (J. White <u>Art and Architecture in Italy 1250 to 1400</u>, pl.45A). This touching and beautifully-rendered sculpture illustrates the deep spirituality inherent in the greatest works of the Italian <u>duecento</u>.",
