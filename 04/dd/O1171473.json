            "public_access_description": "This carrier bag was created for promotional purposes by the WEA record label (now known as Warner Music Group) to celebrate the release of Prince's Purple Rain album in 1984. \n\nThe bag was specially designed by the Milanese creative duo, Avant de Dormir, based on several other bags in a series started in 1984. These were acclaimed by the fashion press, and orders flooded in from all the major cities in the US. Their most famous creation involved a trout floating in water. A quote from da Materie Plastiche in 1984 described their work as such:\n   \"Putting a perfectly imitated fish in a transparent bag and taking it for a walk is like putting a moustache on the Mona Lisa, as had been done by the Surrealists. It's ignoring the rules of the established game, it's being ironic. The demystification of the material, of fashion, the satire of consumerism through a new consumerism is brought forward by the two designers who use dissonance and other clearly surrealistic effects.\"\n\nThis bag features a purple vinyl record of Prince's Purple Rain album. This album would become known as one of the best albums in rock music history, critically acclaimed and loved by all the major music press and the general public. Prince's amalgamation of different musical styles including rock and pop, R&B, dance and metal, also combined with his experimentations in sound made for a fascinating album. It would go on to become 13 x platinum in the US (sales of over 13 million).",
