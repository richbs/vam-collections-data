            "public_access_description": "Gloves were an indispensable accessory during the late 19th century. Ladies had many pairs for different occasions or to match particular outfits and strict etiquette applied to wearing them. Wrist-length gloves like these tended to be worn during the day. Long elbow-length styles were usually worn for evening dress. \n\nIt was considered extremely bad form to wear discoloured, grubby or worn gloves, and some of the pale leather or suede evening gloves might only have been worn once. Beige was a more practical colour for daywear as it did not show up the dirt.\n\nThis pair of gloves was manufactured by Schuberth & Co, based in Naples, Italy. The company was founded by Alfred Schuberth, the donor\u2019s grandfather (born 1876), and Otto Schuberth. Alfred lived in Naples and ran the Neapolitan factory and workshop from 1902 to 1935 when he retired. His brother worked in England. In due course the company was bought out and after the Second World War became known as EEC gloves. \n\nThese gloves formed part of a collection which Alfred gave to his daughter, Adeline Constance Schuberth, in 1935. She married Giovene Andrea di Girasole, and Lorenzo (the donor) was their son.",
