The same production was originally produced for Astleys in April of 1829 on which occassion the music was composed by Mr. Callcott and the piece itself by J.H.Amherst.It was described as an Equestrian, 'melo-dramatic spectacle'.\n\nThis is the first violin part. The musical notation has been written in pen and ink and additional annotation in both pen and ink and pencil indicate the action which the pieces were intended to accompany. The manuscript has been stamped F.H.Cooper and dated in ink 18th August 1845. This is section 11-23 of 23 numbered pieces.\n\nThis music comes from a collection of manuscript music relating to the 'Cooper Family', one of whom, Alfred Edward Cooper (1840-1901) worked as a 'Chef d'Orchestre'/Master of Music at the City of London Theatre and playhouses in South East England. Throughout his career Cooper collected and composed 'melos' to provide incidental music for Melodramas. \n\nMelodramas were a form of drama which was popular in the nineteenth century. They often featured a limited number of 'stock' characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent and a comic man engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. \nIn the melodramas produced in Paris, London music supplanted dialogue or, more often, augmented stage language, actors' gestures, and dramatic action, to evoke an emotional response or provide an aural signal of the true nature of a character.",
