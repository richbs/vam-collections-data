In other words, it is set into a metal plaque, in this case gold, where the outlines of the figure and of the inscription are depressions in the metal. Within the depression, gold wires have been used to form the compartments for the enamel to fill. This type of enamel, a combination in effect, of cloisson\u00e9 and champlev\u00e9, produces a figure on a gold metal ground, and is sometimes referred to by the German term 'Senkschmelz'. Researchers now believe that the earliest example of this technique occurs on the reliquary of the True Cross in the cathedral treasury at Limburg an der Lahn, made 963-989. The technique remained popular in the Byzantine world into the twelfth century.\n\nSmall enamel panels of this sort were incorporated into various kinds of objects, especially book covers, icon frames and the like. They therefore formed part of a particularly portable class of artworks, and examples of similar Byzantine plaques can be found in many church treasuries in Western Europe, as well as in Hungary, Russia and Czechoslovakia.",
