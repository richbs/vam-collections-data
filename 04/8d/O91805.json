They may have come from the sides of a casket, a shrine or perhaps the sides of a private altar. Small, cast figurines are often found on church silver, decorating processional crosses, reliquaries or chalices. Similar figures can also be found as spoon finials. Each figure holds an object which identifies him, such as a pair of keys for St Peter.\n\nSilver figures were often used in private chapels around this date. For example, the English king Henry VIII had three gold and 49 silver-gilt 'images' in the 1521 inventory of the Chapel Royal.",
