He faces to the front and is seen to the waist, the right arm and the forearm of the left is missing.  He wears a bowed moustache and joined eyebrows.  The embroidered (?) headdress is bowl-shaped with a rosette and streamer on its left.  Round the neck is a flat torque and V-shaped band, and over the left shoulder is a ribbed scarf.  The panel probably formed of a pillar of a stupa-railing.",
