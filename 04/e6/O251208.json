In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Scottish-Italian artist Eduardo Paolozzi created a series of prints called \"Moonstrips Empire News\". These captured the attention of  Jules-Fran\u00e7ois Crahay, head designer for Lanvin from 1964 to 1984. He commissioned special fabrics based on Paolozzi's designs which were exclusive only to Lanvin's Spring-Summer collection of 1971. This tailored two-piece, which Crahay called 'Malaga', was designed to be worn as day-wear. The sleeveless tunic and skirt are worn with a solid brown long-sleeved jumper, belt and scarf to focus attention on the vibrant pattern.\n\nPaolozzi requested that Lanvin donate an example of this ensemble to the V&A in lieu of his royalties. Another Lanvin/Paolozzi ensemble, 'Djerba', was also donated (see T.304, A &B-1971). The 'Moonstrips Empire News' prints also inspired a series of Wedgwood ceramics, samples of which are held by the Ceramics Collection, (see CIRC.512-1972)",

Rather than accept royalties from the sales, Paolozzi requested that Lanvin donate the ensemble to the V&A in lieu of his royalties.
