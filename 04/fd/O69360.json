Westwood\u2019s career in fashion was galvanised by McLaren and together they launched memorable fashion moments, including Punk in the early 1970s and later their Pirates collection. McLaren and Westwood conducted a design relationship between 1971 and 1983. In 1990 and again in 1991 Vivienne Westwood was named British Designer of the Year; she has also received an OBE.\n\nWestwood\u2019s unique mix of practicality and inventiveness, her preoccupation with silhouette and the manner in which she manipulates fabrics result in dynamic fashion. Westwood herself once said, 'You have a much better life if you wear impressive clothes.\u2019 \n\nThis ensemble is from Westwood\u2019s \u2018Witches\u2019 collection (Autumn/Winter 1983-1984), for which the designer collaborated with graffiti artist Keith Haring. For this they collaborated with graffiti artist Keith Haring, whose work had been discovered in New York by McLaren and was also used simultaneously in the sleeve design and promotion of McLaren's solo album Duck Rock. Haring submitted drawings to McLaren and Westwood for them to use as they wished. The jacket reflected Mclaren and Westwood\u2019s experimentation with exaggerated lapels and square-cut sleeves that hung off the shoulders.",
