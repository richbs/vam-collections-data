The prints are presented in two sets of 24 prints each and are held in four boxes. The sets provide an interesting example of the variety of artist-printmakers' responses to a single theme, the diversity of the subject, style and technique. Images such as the Millennium Wheel, hourglasses and the Greenwich Observatory, recur, but there are also intensely individual responses which give a fascinating snapshot of a group of artists' concerns at a particular moment in time. The project was aided by an Arts Council grant. \n\nThe complete set of prints were shown at the Contemporary Print Show at the Barbican, 1999, and at the Planetarium and the Royal Observatory Greenwich, 2000.",
