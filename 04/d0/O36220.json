The hen is made of three layers of thin blockboard painted with three white stripes representing the wings. The head and neck unit is jointed to the body and carved and painted red; yellow and black to represent a hen. The tail unit; also jointed to the body; has three white stripes each side representing feathers. One end of a length of white string is attached to the underside of the head unit and the another end is attached to the tail. Knotted into the centre of the string is an irregular lump of slate acting as a balance. From the top of the body is a small very light wooden post which in turn is attached to a long post set at right angles. The post is held by the operator and the weight is allowed to fall below the figure. As the weight swings below; the head and tail units move up and down making the figure to be pecking.",
