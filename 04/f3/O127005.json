The eagle on the shield faces left, a position known in heraldic terminology as contourn\u00e9. These arms were acquired with four other pieces which all came from the Pallazo Alidosio in Cesena. The palace was built in 1508 by Obizzo Alidosio a favourite of Pope Julius II. Obizzo was used as an envoy by the Pope and was made Papal Governor of Cesena in 1508. Following his appointment he was granted permission to build a palace and began work immediately, he died a year later. The palace was at one time converted into a theatre, and stood until it was demolished sometime between 1838 and 1846.",

They originated from the Onesti family and the Counts of Cunio and became a powerful family with extensive branches. Their genealogy begins properly in the 13th century, with two main branches of the family: those invested as the bishops of Imola between 1335 and 1424 and those who became the Lords of Castelo del Rio. \n\nThe family's first recorded connection with Cesena is the marriage of Riccarda Alidosio to Andrea Malatesta signore di Cesena e Fossombrone.\n\nObizzo Alidosio (d.1509) was a Lord of Castelo del Rio. A doctor of law he became a favourite of Pope Julius II. He was sent as an envoy of peace to Forli in 1505 and on 9th of April 1508 he was made Papal Governor of Cesena by Julius. On 31st July 1508 Obizzo received a from the town of Cesena a grant of land on which to erect a palace. Bazzochi and Galbucci state that the architect of the palace was built by Sapiano Merlino. Obizzo Alidosio died in Cesena on 8th September, 1509 where upon the palazzo passed with the rest of his property to his son Cesare, who bequeathed it to a cousin Ciro. The palace was later converted into a theatre known as the Teatro Spada., and was demolished and replaced between 1838 and 1846. The family was extinct by 1645 according to Litta, who recorded the Alidosio in his Famiglie Celebri Italiane in 1852.",
