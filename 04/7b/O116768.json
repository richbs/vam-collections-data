Penley (1852-1912) in the farce Charley's Aunt by Brandon Thomas, which opened at London's Royalty Theatre in December 1892. It shows Penley as Lord Fancourt Babberley or 'Babbs' disguised as Donna Lucia d\u2019Alvadorez, the aunt from Brazil - 'where the nuts come from'. The first figurine was made especially for Brandon Thomas; this model introduced by Doulton in 1914.  Two other versions were made but all were withdrawn by 1938.\n\nPenley, a boy chorister at the Savoy Chapel, made his first stage appearance in 1875 in the original production of Trial By Jury, but made his name in 1884 as Reverend Robert Spalding in The Private Secretary at London's Globe Theatre. Penley was associated with this part until 1892 when he produced and starred in Charley's Aunt at Bury St. Edmunds. It was staged at the Royalty Theatre in London that December, and transferred to the Globe in 1893.  It was a huge success, achieving the record-breaking run of 1466 performances.  Several different posters and souvenirs were produced during its run.\n\nRoyal Doulton began in Lambeth, London, in 1815 when John Doulton manufactured ceramic items such as stoneware bottles and sewer pipes. The Victorian revolution in hygiene and sanitation ensured the success of  the firm which later produced tableware and commemorative items.  Doulton moved to Burslem in the Potteries in 1882, attaining a Royal Warrant in 1901.",
