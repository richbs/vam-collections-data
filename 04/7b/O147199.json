The spandrels contain small red and blue floral sprays and the central field has alternate large and small flowering stems.  The arch is surrounded by small square forms containing lozenges in reserve and is edged with a series of narrow bands.. Either side of the central frame is a tall cypress tree from a vase, terminating in a line of bud and bulb forms.  Across the top is a decorative band with what appears to be an empty cartouche flanked by blocks with floral motifs echoing the blocks in an outer border, which has a deep lower band.  Down the sides is a line of small ogival medallions with flower heads; there is a cypress tree at the base and across the top is a band of architectural 'onion' domes and decorative spikes beautifully infilled.\nThe mat is backed with block-printed, hand-woven cotton with a cream ground and a very small floral motif in red and mauve on a grey stem in closely packed off-set bands. It is faced with bias-cut dark blue silk.",
