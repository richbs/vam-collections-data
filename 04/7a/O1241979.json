It was painted by the artist Sir Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Forestier (1854\u20131930) for reproduction in The Illustrated London News, seemingly to illustrate a story by Mark Twain. \n\nThe Bayreuth Festspielhausis an opera house north of Bayreuth, Germany, dedicated solely to the performance of operas by the 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner. The building was opened for the premiere of the complete four-opera cycle of Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung) in August, 1876. The opera house is now the venue for the annual Bayreuth Festival, for which it was specifically conceived and built. \n\nSir Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Forestier (1854 \u2013 1930) was an Anglo-French artist and illustrator. He began working for the Illustrated London News in 1882 and became known for his attention to detail and historical illustrations.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
