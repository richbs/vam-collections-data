Penley (1852-1912) in the farce Charley's Aunt by Brandon Thomas, which opened at London's Royalty Theatre in December 1892. It shows Penley as Lord Fancourt Babberley or 'Babbs' disguised as Donna Lucia d\u2019Alvadorez, the aunt from Brazil - 'where the nuts come from'. It is modelled on a ceramic figurine designed by Albert Toft and made by Royal Doulton in 1913.\n\nPenley, a boy chorister at the Savoy Chapel, made his first stage appearance in 1875 in the original production of Trial By Jury, but made his name in 1884 as Reverend Robert Spalding in The Private Secretary at London's Globe Theatre. Penley was associated with this part until 1892 when he produced and starred in Charley's Aunt at Bury St. Edmunds. It was produced at the Royalty Theatre in London that December, and transferred to the Globe in 1893.  It was a huge success, achieving the record-breaking run of 1,466 performances.  Several different posters and souvenirs were produced during its run.",
