(some col.)\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 155, 156, 166-267\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nPage from a sketch-book.\nInscribed on the back in pencil by the artist <i>Leicestershire\u2014the lane leading to Ferrars Hall\u2014Ld Ferriers</i> [?] <i>house I was on horseback with Sir G. B.</i> [Sir George Beaumont] <i>--who kindly held my horse when I made this sketch 1823  I think it was the finest ash I ever saw.</i>\n\nThe inscription was evidently added from memory some time after the drawing was made, as was that on the back of No. 257 [354-1888].  In a letter in the Department of Paintings the Hon. Andrew Shirley gives reasons for identifying the scene as Staunton Harold.  Constable\u2019s letter of 27 October 1823 to his wife contains the sentence \u201cI had the opportunity of seeing the ruins at Ashby, the mountain streams and rocks (Such Everdingens) at Griesdieu, and an old convent there, Lord Ferrer\u2019s\u2014a grand but melancholy spot\u201d (Beckett, II, p. 292).  The Lord Ferrers of the time was living at Ragdale, about 12 miles from Coleorton, where he had built a new house.  Staunton Harold had been left incomplete for thirty or forty years and was not much lived in, but being only some 2 \u00bd miles from Coleorton it is doubtless the house to which Constable refers.\n\nNote on Nos. 256, 257, 259-262, 273-278 [281-1888, 354-1888, 835-1888, 815-1888, 266-1888, 356-1888, 605-1888, 198-1888, 171-1888, 340-1888, 245-1888, 259-1888]\n\nNos. 256, 257, 259, 260, 261 and 262 [281-1888, 354-1888, 835-1888, 815-1888, 266-1888, 356-1888] all come from the same sketch-book, measuring approximately 181 x 262 mm. (about 7 1/8 x 10 \u00bc ins.) and used by Constable both on his summer visit to Salisbury and Gillingham and his autumn visit to Coleorton.  The height of the pages tapers from 178 mm. at the outer edge to 181 mm. at the hinge edge.  Nos. 273 [605-1888] and 274 [198-1888], and possibly also Nos. 275-278 [171-1888, 340-1888, 245-1888, 259-1888], come from the same sketch-book, and show that he used it at Brighton, probably on his first visit in 1824; for their possible connection with a projected group of engravings, see also the note following No. 284 [817-1888].",
