Action Man was relaunched in 1993 by Hasbro, which is the era that this particular Action Man object falls under. \n\nAction figures are particularly popular with boys because they represent traditional masculine traits and are closely associated with the public sphere which is represented by items such as tools, transportation, garages, machines, and military equipment.",
