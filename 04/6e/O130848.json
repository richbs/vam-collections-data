Text accompanying the photograph states, \u2018Tanjore Fort was built by the Nayakar Kings of Tanjore [the Nayak kingdom lasted from 1565 to 1781], but has been considerably enlarged by the kings of the Mahratta dynasty. It surrounds the entire city in which there are (exclusive of the suburbs) 20,000 inhabitants. The little fort or citadel contains a tank, the water of which is much esteemed by the people, the large temple, and a Christian church built by Schwartz the Missionary. \u2026Tanjore became the capital of the Soran kingdom early in the 16th century: but it had been a place of great importance for centuries previous, and its rulers had, alternately with those of Mysore and Madura, governed the Southern Carnatic.\u2019 Today the population of Thanjavur is 217,000.",

            "history_note": "This photograph was given by Lady Denison in 1889 during the keepership of Caspar Purdon Clarke, Keeper of the Indian Section of the V&A. It was written off in 1937, and rediscovered and re-evaluated in the 1990s. See Dewan p.467 for listings of other copies elsewhere.\nThis photograph was published as plate I of twenty-three in the album <u>Photographic Views in Tanjore and Trivady</u> 1858, by 'Captain L. Tripe, Government Photographer, with Descriptive Notes by the Rev. G. U. Pope', published in 1860. It was taken as part of Tripe's remit as the government photographer, which he himself defined broadly, as recording, \u2018before they disappear\u2019 buildings, sculptures and inscriptions\u2026' including the picturesque. This was a model for an extensive survey, including tuition of others and experimentation in his own practice. He was funded by the Madras government, but intended selling additional copies of some prints so that his practice could be self-funding.\n\nThis photograph was published with the following text in the letterpress (the following is an extract):\n\u2018Tanjore Fort was built by the Nayakar Kings of Tanjore, but has been considerably enlarged by the kings of the Mahratta dynasty. It surrounds the entire city in which there are (exclusive of the suburbs) 20,000 inhabitants. \nThe little fort or citadel contains a tank, the water of which is much esteemed by the people, the large temple, and a Christian church built by Schwartz the Missionary.\n\u2026 Tanjore became the capital of the Soran kingdom early in the 16th century: but it had been a place of great importance for centuries previous, and its rulers had, alternately with those of Mysore and Madura, governed the Southern Carnatic.\nMuch interesting information regarding Tanjore and its successive rulers may be sifted out of Taylor\u2019s Oriental Historical Manuscripts, Vol. 1.\nThe Tanjore Purana says that one Tanjan a demon, with his family, were the first settlers, but Hindu myths are constantly invented to account for names of places and persons. It is curious that the prince of a division of the Huns was always called the Tanjou.\u2019\n\nHistorical significance: Tripe's photographs of South India are an important body of work within Tripe's oeuvre, and are recognised as being some of the most aesthetically and technically competent images of India made in the 19th century.\nTripe entered as total of 50 photographs from his 1857\u20138 tour of South India in the 1859 annual exhibition of the Madras Photographic Society. The jury dubbed his photographs \u2018the best in the Exhibition\u2019 but as Tripe could not be classed an amateur, he could not win the gold medal. Tripe declined the silver medal amicably, since he considered that as an official photographer he had an unfair advantage over the other entrants. \nTripe\u2019s photographs were valued for their informational value and their technical quality. The adjudicating committee stated that Tripe\u2019s photographs \u2018illustrate admirably the architecture of the Hindoo Temples and Places of Southern India, and in particular the Madura and Tanjore series comprise in this respect all that is most worthy of record in those cities.\u2019 (See Dewan, p.16). Forty-six of Tripe\u2019s 50 exhibited images were made from paper (calotype) negatives, which the committee didn't feel were as successful as dry collodion-on-glass negatives, however, declaring that \u2018the superiority of definition given by Collodion [-on-glass] is very visible when placed side by side with them.\u2019 It is thought that Tripe prefered paper to glass negatives due to paper being easier and safer to work with.",

            "historical_context_note": "<b>The southern districts tour and Madras presidency photographs, 1857-58</b>\nThe Madras government appointed Tripe as photographer following the 1855 directive from the Court of Directors in London, who discouraged illustration in favour of 'photography as a means by which representations may be obtained of scenes and buildings, with the advantages of perfect accuracy, small expenditure of time, and moderate cash', and asked that photography be the main means of recording architecture and antiquities (Dewan, p.6).  \n\nAs official photographer to the Madras Government, Tripe set off from Bangalore on 14 December 1857 after delays due to waiting for modifications to his new English camera, and his recovery after falling from a horse. He ended his tour in Madras on 30 April 1858 after travelling via Srirangam, Tiruchchirappalli, Madurai, then Pudukkottai, Tanjore, and Tiruchchirappalli again (then called Seeringham, Trichinopoly, Madura, Poodoocottah and Tanjore). \n\nAll of these areas had been forcefully taken under British rule in the previous one hundred years, but Tripe looked for scenes or subjects with architectural or antiquarian interest rather than political significance. He had wanted to ensure his images were practical too: before he had set out he had asked the chief engineer for guidance on what would be most useful from an engineering perspective, and incorporated this input into his work.",
