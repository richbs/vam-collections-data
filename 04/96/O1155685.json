Scrapbooks may be said to have their origins in the commonplace books popular with adults from at least the 16th century: these books contained a mixture of observations, recipes, poetry, letters etc, which might be printed or hand written, and the pages were sometimes also decorated with pictorial elements.  \n\nScrapbooks for use by children became really popular from about the 1870s, when colour printing became more affordable and readily available. This meant that in addition to cutting illustrations from magazines and books, and pasting in souvenirs, the scrapbook compiler could easily and quite cheaply buy colourful and professionally produced pictorial 'scraps' or 'reliefs' showing a wide variety of subjects. These had originated in Germany in the 1800s as printed decorations for confectionery, and began to be collected as souvenirs of various occasions.  Among the more popular subjects for children were flowers, birds and animals, nursery rhyme figures and seasonal outdoor scenes such as children harvesting or skating.\n\nThe scrapbook has had something of a revival in recent years, partly in connection with the availability of digital and computer-accessible images, and is often created in digital form.",
