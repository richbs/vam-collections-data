It would  have been worn overlapping slightly in the front revealing a portion of her leg as she walked. Typical of hta-mein, the centre silk panel is the focus of decorative interest and displays the unique horizontal wave patterned \"100 shuttles\" interlocking tapestry weave known in Burmese as acheik-luntaya in golden yellow, mid-green, red and white. From this flows a striped coral train the graceful management of which was an acquired skill. It would have been part of an ensemble when worn with an ein-gyi (fitted jacket) and yinzi (breast cloth). \n\nThe Arakanese, who inhabit the western coastal area of Burma, ruled their own kingdom until 1784 when they were conquered by the Burmese. In culture and dress they are very similar to the Burmese.",
