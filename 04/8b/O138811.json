The invention of individual communion cups has been attributed to the Rev. Jowett, Congregational  Minister of Carrs Lane Chapel, Birmingham from 1895-1909. Pressure from his enormous congregation of over two thousand people combined with concerns about public health prompted the innovation. Individual cups became fashionable, particularly in nonconformist communities, and are still used today.",
