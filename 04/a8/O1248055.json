The Princess was popular with the public and her death shocked the country. There was a period of national mourning. On the eve of her funeral at St George's Chapel,Windsor, the coffin was taken from the Princess's home at Claremont House, Surrey, to Windsor and lay in state at the Lower Lodge there. Crowds gathered but, due to the smallness of the Lodge, were not admitted. The desire of the public to see the 'Splendid and Solemn Spectacle' was met by the 'fac simile' presented at Saville House.  The handbill announces that 'All the splendid Arrangements have been faithfully copied', and the coffin and bier, covered with crimson and black velvet and gold ornaments, 'have been executed by the same Artists who made the originals'. It predicts that 'By the Thousands who were disappointed in obtaining Admission at Windsor, this fac simile will be seen with Avidity, and the sorrowing Millions of the Empire will be peculiarly interested in beholding so august a Ceremonial of Respect to the presumptive Heiress of the British throne.'",
