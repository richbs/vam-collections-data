Cut on all four sides.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. There is a border along the bottom: pink flower with long petals outlined in dark blue pointing to the upper left alternating with pink blossom pointing to the lower left.  Part of a border survives on the right extending part way up the side of the panel; it seems to have a white ground.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in yellow and green.\n\nThere are three sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with angled striped stem and bunch of mauve flowers pointing down alternating with a long striped stem pointing down with a large pink flower bending to the right.  There are also small round blue and yellow flowers.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] yellow vase with large central pink blossom and 3 clusters of white flowers alternating with a pair of white and pink leaves, 2 long blue  sprays and 3 large pink carnations.\n[b] even wider stripes: more indistinct - central pink rosette with 2 blue outlined birds alternate with a mass of pink flowers with a trefoil flower outlined in black.  There are groups of small white flowers.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, white, pink, green, light green, dark green, dark blue, mauve, light mauve, yellow, dark mauve.",
