The Victoria & Albert Museum had been given a large panel of various, unrelated, fragments by the stained glass collector Henry Vaughan in 1900. This large panel was subsequently broken up and reframed with other fragments for the purpose of displaying interesting pieces of 15th century glass decorated in English workshops.\n\nEngland had a rich tradition of stained glass in the Middle Ages but the political and religious upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries destroyed a great deal and much only survives in a fragmentary state.\n\nThe central image on this panel is of an angel playing a trapezoidal psaltery. Such musical instrument-playing angels often formed part of scenes of the Last Judgement. The psaltery was a very popular stringed instrument in the Middle Ages. The instrument is held against the chest and is either plucked with the fingers, as appears here, or with a plectrum.",

The Victoria & Albert Museum had been given a large panel of various, unrelated, fragments by the stained glass collector Henry Vaughan in 1900. This large panel was subsequently broken up and reframed with other fragments for the purpose of displaying interesting pieces of 15th century glass decorated in English workshops.\n\nEngland had a rich tradition of stained glass in the Middle Ages but the political and religious upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries destroyed a great deal and much only survives in a fragmentary state.\n\nThe central roundel in this panel depicts a man kneeling in prayer. Surrounding him is a scroll, reconsructed from other fragments. This figure would have been part of a larger panel with an image of a saint. The scroll would have been inscribed with words, in Latin calling on the accompaning saint to pray for his soul after death. He is a 'donor figure' because he would have contributed to the cost of creating the window in which he appeared. \n\nAbove the roundel are two cockleshells. These are the emblems of the Apostle St James the Greater who has, to this day, a major shrine in his honour at Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Below the roundel are two letter 'M's surmounted by crowns. this is the emblem of the Virgin Mary who was crowned 'Queen of Heaven' by her son Jesus Christ.",
