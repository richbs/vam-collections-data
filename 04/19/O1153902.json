            "public_access_description": "The first Olympic mascot 'Waldi' a Daschund dog appeared at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nAmik the Beaver, mascot of the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games was chosen in a competition held by the Olympic committee. Amik was created by the Graphics and Design Directorate, a committee made of up prominent Canadian graphic artists of the time. The individual designers credited with Amik's birth were Yvon Laroche, Pierre-Yves Pelletier, Guy St-Arnaud and George Huel. \n\nThe winning name 'Amik' literally means beaver in the Algonquian which is the most popular language amongst the Aboriginal people in Canada. Like Waldi the Daschund before it Amik was designed as a symbol, minimalist in appearance it has a simple black and white shape with a red sash. Smaller Amik's were produced with sashes in black, grey and blue. \n\nAmik was a very unpopular mascot. The public were confused about what he was supposed to represent. His cold reception marked a change in mascot design, they became more cartoon-like or humanesque and aimed directly at children.",
