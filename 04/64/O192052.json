            "public_access_description": "At the end of 1989, preparations began for the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. They were the first elections to the legislature in which opposition parties participated. The reform movement Sajudis wanted a newly elected Supreme Soviet to declare Lithuania\u2019s independence and separation from the USSR. They urged a swift move to independence in fear that Moscow would pass bills making the secession of Soviet republics from the union more difficult. Sajudis was strongly and bitterly opposed the Lithuanian Communist Party which was looking for a compromise with Moscow. Having separated itself from the Communist Party of the USSR, the Lithuanian Communist Party became a serious contender for public votes.   Its nominated candidates were party members and branch leaders, or representatives of \u2018nomenclature\u2019 as they were called. They became the target of of Sajudis propaganda. \n\nThis poster designed by Jonas Varnas was hugely successful. The idea was suggested by Varnas\u2019s colleague, the designer Giedrius Reimeris who was an active member of Sajudis. The smiling \u2018hero\u2019 of the poster is a Communist Party candidate sporting a tie in the colours of the Lithuanian national flag. However the bottom potion of the tie poking out of his buttoned jacket represents the flag of Soviet Lithuania. The poster warns voters to question candidates\u2019 views and past history before voting for them. \n \nJonas Varnas (b. 1936) was deported to Siberia with his family in 1948. When he returned to Lithuania in 1957, he was mobilised into the Soviet Army, and afterwards studied at the State Art Institute in Vilnius. He created posters and logos and particularly enjoyed drawing cartoons. As a communicative artist with a great sense of humour, he has become a leader in the field of cartoons and has participated in hundreds of exhibitions in Lithuania and abroad. When Sajudis was founded in 1988, he actively participated in the movement and was a member of its Publishing Group. He currently works for Lithuanian periodicals and publishes political cartoons.",
