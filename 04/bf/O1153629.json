It advertised the release of the single C'mon Everybody, a cover of Eddie Cochran's 1950s rock and roll song, by Sid Vicious, in June 1979. Vicious had died of a heroin overdose four months before the single was released, however, and Reid had begun to clash with Virgin Records exploitation of the band name.\n\nThe photograph of Vicious was taken by prominent American rock photographer Bob Gruen, in New York in 1978, the original of which is now hung at the National Portrait Gallery, London. \n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this poster, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
