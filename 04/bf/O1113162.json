            "public_access_description": "This programme with its decorative panels and lithographic images of the interior and exterior of the building, was made to be folded in three like a paper programme, but is of silk to commemorate the opening night of the Tower of Varieties and Circus in Hurst Street, Birmingham, on 9th October 1899. This was a music hall with a circus ring which could be flooded for aquatic spectacle. It had a tall Moorish tower which can be seen in the images of the theatre on the programme cover.\n\nDesigned by the prolific theatre architect F.W. Lloyd, the interior of the theatre was completely reconstructed in 1900 as the Tivoli Theatre of Varieties, with a neo-classical interior and seating for over 2000. In 1963 the foyer and main fa\u00e7ade were completely refurbished and the tower demolished. With later improvements, the theatre is now known as the Birmingham Hippodrome.",
