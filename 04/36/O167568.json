It is one of a pair exhibited by the Russian Government at the International Exhibition of 1851.  Dr Ludmila Budrina of the Ekaterinburg Museum of the History of Stone-cutting, Russia, has said that this particular design of vase is known as the 'Medici'.  This model was produced chiefly during the period 1820-1840 at the Peterhof and Ekanterinburg Imperial stonework factories.  The design, size and proportions of 339-1886 can be compared with a drawing of 1826 signed by the Russian architect I. Halberg, with which it has close similarities.",

She compares the design, size and proportions of 339-1886 with a drawing of 1826 signed by the Russian architect I. Halberg, and finds close similarities. For this information she refers to the publication of the book <u>Malachite</u> by V. Semenov, 1987.  Copies of these exchanges of emails, together with the image of the Halberg drawing, are in the object file.",
