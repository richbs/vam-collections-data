It was obtained in 1867 from Prome, a town in central Burma lying on the Irrawaddy River, which had recently fallen under British control. Britain  annexed Burma stage by stage through the 19th century until in 1885 the entire kingdom came under British rule. Known as an ein-gyi this jacket is embroidered and quilted in yellow silk with wave and twisted rope patterns typical of Burmese design. It would have formed an ensemble, as shown, with a wrap skirt (9756 IS) and breast cloth (IM.10-1909).",
