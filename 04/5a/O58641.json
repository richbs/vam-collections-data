Flat back, and pine belly purfled with black and white stringing. The inside of the belly is covered with a layer of sand. The sides narrow towards the upper end of the body. In the side farthest from the strings are two slot-shaped soundholes. Low down on the other side a neck of guitar type is attached at an acute angle. The head of this neck, with a float-topped fluted capital of vageuly Egyptian form, is connected to the upper end of the body by a wooden arm curved in something like the shape of the neck of a harp. The neck is provided with a rosewood fingerboard flush with the belly, with seventeen nickel-silver frets and with position dots of the same metal inserted in the centres of frets 7 and 12. From an intermediate point along the curved arm a second fingerboard, hald the length of the first and with twelve frets, runs down to the body. To each fingerboard there are six strings of gut and overspun silk,  running to two pin bridges on the belly. The instrument was slung on a ribbon for holding in normal guitar fashion\" \n\nAnthony Baines: Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-keyboard insturments.

He was also famous for his 1837 patent for applying crushed glass to the soundboards of harps and harp guitars, so as to improve their sound. That technique has not been used on this instrument, however.",
