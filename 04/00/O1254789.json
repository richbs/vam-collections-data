It is a unique reinterpretation of the jogakbo, a traditional Korean wrapping cloth made by stitching together numerous left-over fabrics. Lie deconstructs the flat pattern of the jogakbo and experiment with its fragments to re-fashion a three-dimensional dress that wraps the woman's body in a crisp, structural silhouette with modern graphics. Tradition is thereby reconfigured in a compelling expression of the here and now.\n\nLie Sang-Bong is one of the most innovative contemporary Korean fashion designers. His eccentric, poetic designs draw inspiration from traditional textiles, as well as Korean folk painting, calligraphy, architecture, embroidery and shamanism. His collections also reflect an interest in western art, in particular Cubism, Bauhaus and film noir. \n\nThrough cutting-edge technology and an experimental approach, Lie creates exquisite pleats, bold shades and prints. His edgy yet feminine silhouettes combine tradition and modernity. A multi-skilled maker, Lie also works in ceramics, product design and interior design. More of his work can be seen in Room 140, Ceramics.",
