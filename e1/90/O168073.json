The designs are from a rare pattern book for glass table-ware, candelabra, chandeliers, and metal-mounted pendant lamps, of about 1824.  The pattern book is bound in a contemporary leather binding tooled with the letters 'MODELES ET TAILLES DE CRISTAUX ANGLAIS' or models and patterns of English crystal. This suggests that it was compiled as a pattern book for a French retailer of English glass. \n\nJohn Blades, the London glass manufacturer and merchant, has been suggested as a possible source for these designs. However, many other London firms produced this type of glass, and some Birmingham manufacturers also made similar glass. It is impossible to identify with certainty which firm made the designs.  \n\nWhat is certain, however, is that at this period, about 1820-1830, the English style of cut glass was much admired in France.  It is recorded that English cutters went over to France to teach the French how to do it. Perhaps an English cutter took these patterns with him to France where they were bound.  This pattern book is a rare document of the trade in English luxury glass products.",

However, you need to be careful as there were a number of other considerable manufacturers as well as glass retailers in London at this period. The book might even not relate to London - another strong possibility might be a Birmingham provenance - one of the glass showrooms in the town or a manufacturer such as Harris, Gammon & Co of the Belmont Glass Works.  \n\nHere are a few possibles for London\nThomas Bailey - 8 St. Paul's Churchyard (known for china, earthenware and glass - big exporters)\nWilliam Collins - 227 Strand\nJames Davenport - 82 Fleet Street\nGreen & Co - 35-6 Upper Thames Street\nGreen & Pellatt - Falcon Glass House\nJohn Illidge -50 High Street, Borough\nHumphrey Levi - cut glass and lustre maker\nPhilip Jacobs - Crown Street Finsbury Square\nThomas Simmons 17 Brownlow St, Holborn - known for chandeliers\nTitus Lawler - 19 Haymarket'\n\nRoger Dodsworth, Keeper of Glass, Broadfield House Glass Museum, stated that possible firms from the Stourbridge area in the West Midlands that might have produced these patterns for glass include Hawkes and Richardson. There are Birmingham firms like Osler which might also have produced the patterns.", 
            "historical_context_note": "At this period, about 1820-1830, the English style of cut glass was much admired in France, and it is recorded that English cutters went over to France to teach the French how to do it. Perhaps an English cutter took these patterns with him to France where they were bound.",
