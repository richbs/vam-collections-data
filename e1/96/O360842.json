There are some details (animal collar and animal tongues) in red wool. In the centre there is a circle containing a dot surrounded by four vases with vines between them. The circle is surrounded by a large square with naked men riding horses, with raised hands,  in each spandrel. Between these figures (at the cardinal positions) sits an animal (rabbit at north and lions at the other points).The square is bordered on the outside with scrolling waves. The naked man/warrior and lions could symbolised a fight with the bestial side of the self. The raised hand was a gesture of blessing or protection.",
