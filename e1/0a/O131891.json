Like other furniture collectors of the early 20th century he was influenced by the furniture connoisseur and dealer R.W. Symonds. Following the prevailing taste of the time, his collection focused on early to mid-Georgian carved mahogany examples and was later bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum on his death in 1962 (see R.W. Symonds, 'Mr. C.D. Rotch's Collection of Furniture', <u>Country Life</u>, 7 June 1924, pp.937-39). At the time, his bequest was describ",

            "historical_context_note": "Charles Harvey (died 1843) was the third son of Robert Harvey and Judith, n\u00e9e Onley. He was a barrister, Recorder of Norwich and M.P. for Norfolk in 1812 and also twice for Carlow in Ireland. He took the surnames and arms of Savill Onley in 1822 on the death of his maternal uncle, the Rev. Charles Onley, from whom he inherited a fine estate, Stisted, in Essex. \n\nThis portrait may have been executed upon Charles Harvey\u2019s leaving Caius College, Cambridge, in 1775 or 1776. This was at a time when Reinagle was principal assistant to Allan Ramsay (1713-1784) and responsible for painting the latter\u2019s huge workload of Coronation portraits of the King and Queen during his absence in Italy between 1775-77. \n\nThe pose of Charles Harvey is naturalistic, conveying a latent energy, with the sitter looking over his left shoulder, as if disturbed from his reading matter which lies upon the table. The placing of the sitter in an airy space and the strong diagonals of form and light and dark tonality help to reinforce his physical presence. The sitter\u2019s features are highly individualised and clear-cut. These aspects, combined with the overall candour in portraying this young man, at a time when he was perhaps poised to take his next step, show that Reinagle had assimilated Ramsay\u2019s style of portraiture. In particular P.26-1962 recalls Philip, Viscount Mahon, dated 1762 (The Board of Trustees of the Chevening Estate) and Dr William Hunter, c. 1764 (?) (Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow). Ultimately the V&A work brings to mind French portraiture, notably the works of Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin (1699-1779), possibly filtered through Ramsay, whose work betrayed a strong French influence in the 1750s and 1760s.",
