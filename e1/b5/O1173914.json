In 1897 \"The Met\" was rebuilt to a design by Frank Matcham.  The new auditorium was decorated in Flemish Renaissance style, with ceiling paintings by James M. Boekbinder which represented \"Old English Merrymaking\", \"Indian Festival\", \"French Carnival\" and \"Spanish Revelry\".  The paintings were taken down when the Music Hall was demolished in 1963.  There is a photograph of the auditorium, prior to demolition, in the book, Frank Matcham: Theatre Architect, edited by Brian Walker (Blackstaff Press, 1980), p.43.  This shows the ceiling paintings and one of the cove paintings still in situ. Associated production: Metropolitan Music Hall, London. Performance category: Music Hall / Variety.",
