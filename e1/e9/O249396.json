London: Sotheby Publications, in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1982.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>1067</b> \nPattern book containing 23 patterns; each inscribed on the back in ink with title, number etc\nPublished by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., 26, Queen Square, Bloomsbury\n1865-75\nColour prints from wood blocks\n54.6 x 77.5 cm (average size)\nBequeathed by J. R. Holliday\nE.3698-3704, 3706-3718, 3720-3722-1927\n\nOriginally in a volume, this set was split up, and E.3705, 3719-1927 are missing. One of these papers (\u2018Spray') was not designed by Morris, but was produced by the firm and was based on an earlier paper removed from a house, 'Palace Ann', near Brandon, County Cork, and given to Morris by Charles C. Townsend, architect, in 1866. (Information found on the backs of photographs of the house by Miss Caroline C. Townsend, daughter of the architect.)\n\n'Scroll', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3698); 'Branch', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3699); 'Trellis', 1864 (E.3700-3703); 'Diaper', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3704); 'Indian', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3706-3709); 'Fruit', 1862, produced 1864 (E.3710-3712; E.3710 neg GJ.9636); 'Spray', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3713, 3714; E.2807 neg GJ.9661); 'Venetian', <i>circa</i> 1868-70  (E.3715-3717); 'Daisy', 1864 (E.3718, 3720); 'Queen Anne', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3721, 3722).'\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.5</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Diaper, 18</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, first issued 1868-70 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 68.6 x 50.0 cm \nV&A (E.458-1919) Given by Morris & Co. \n\nAlthough an original design, <i>Diaper</i> sits happily with the group of adapted patterns of similar date. One of Warington Taylor\u2019s letters shows that it was issued before <i>Indian</i> and <i>Queen Anne</i>. \n\nInitially produced in two colourways, yellow and olive, another seven were added in the 1870s. In most cases the printed colours were only slightly deeper than the ground. Morris disapproved of using more than one paper in a room but, if a second was required, he recommended using a pattern like this. A non-directional design, it was also suitable for use as a ceiling paper.'",
