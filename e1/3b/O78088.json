The print is of fans with Japanese views, and the ground, modelled in relief, is of sparrows in prunus blossom. Both motifs are especially typical of British adaptations of the Japanese style. Its specially moulded shape indicates that its maker, Josiah Wedgwood & Sons, was committed to ensuring that the plate was a commercial success. This is because moulds for new shapes are always a significant investment in the ceramic industry.\n\nPeople\nWedgwood established a design studio under Thomas Allen (1831-1915) about 1879 and engaged a number of new, young designers. Several of these artists had received part of their training at the Government School of Design. They included H.J. Kane, who is thought have designed this plate.",
