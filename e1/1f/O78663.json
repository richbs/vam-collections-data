            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nMiniature painting is defined as watercolour  on a vellum (fine animal skin) support .  Most miniaturists learned the technique from another miniaturist. Samuel Cooper was no exception since he was trained by his uncle, John Hoskins (born around 1590, died in 1665). In this work there are faint traces of a landscape background, possibly two church spires, low down on the right.  Landscape backgrounds were rare in Cooper's work and show Hoskins' influence.  The low-angle view of the sitter, with the head standing out freely against the sky, shows the influence of Hoskins' son, also John.\n\nSitter\nRobert Lilburne entered the Parliamentary army at the beginning of the Civil War and played a leading role in campaigns against the Royalists.  He was nominated one of the King's judges in December 1648 and was the 28th in the list of signatures on the death warrant of the King.  When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 Lilburne surrendered himself.  He was tried and sentenced to death, but instead was imprisoned and died a prisoner five years later.\n\nIdentification\nVarious portraits have been thought to be of Robert Lilburne.  This miniature is one of four very plausible ones. Its traditional identification was supported in 1938 by a Dr Lilburne, a descendant of Robert's ultra-republican brother John, on the basis of portraits then still in the family possession.",

On the back of the case the label of Addington inscribed in ink: <i>Coll.. /Lilburn/by S Cooper/sign'd;</i> Salting's label printed 1641 amended by hand to <i>4641</i>; Propert's label, printed <i>JPLNo</i> and with 36/50 on a small adhesive label; other tied-on labels recorded in Museum files. \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Evidently a Mr Robert Graves in 1807 (see below, n. 4); Samuel Addington, his sale, Christie's 26 April 1883, lot 112, bt Wareham, 71 gns; by 1887, J L Propert; Fine Art Society 1897; purchased with others from the Propert Collection by George Salting, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910.   \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> BFAC 1889, p. 101 , case XXXIV; no. 50 (as signed Samuel Cooper); FAS 1897, no. 46.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Propert 1887, repro. facing p. 78; Propert 1901 ,p. 108 and repro. p. 107; Foster 1911 p. 548; Goulding 1914-15, p. 21 (this or Cat. No. 70); Foster 1914-16, vol. n, p. 49, no. 301 (as Signed Samuel Cooper and dated 1659), again, under a different designation, p. 78, no. 530; Long 1929, p. 88; Long 1930, p. 13 (as <i>A Soldier</i>, authentically signed); Foskett 1974, p. 112 (as Unknown Man in Armour) ; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nContradicting his published opinion of 1930, Long recorded the view (1) that the signature and date on this miniature might have been added by another hand. He had no doubts, however, that the miniature was by Cooper, and few reservations that the sitter was Lilburne.  \n \nVarious portraits by or attributed to Cooper have been called Robert Lilburne, dated variously between 1649 (2) and 1652. (3) The two dated 1650, the present miniature and the portrait in the Fitzwilliam Museum, are the most plausible candidates and have the merit of resembling each other; the present miniature is probably the basic likeness. It seems to be the source of the stipple engraving by C Watson, published 1 May 1807 by R Wilkinson, (4) and of the mezzotint by Earlom dated 1811 and published by S Woodburn. (5) The lettering on Earlorri's plate is in fact at fault; Lilburne is said to have died in 1657, and to have been thirty-nine at the date of the Cooper portrait; this error may be due to confusion with Robert Lilbume's younger brother John, who did die in 1657. The author of the letterpress facing Earlom's plate made no such mistake and there is no doubt that Robert was intended to be the subject of the illustration. \n \nThis long traditional identification was supported in January 1938 by a Dr Lilburne, a descendant of John Lilburne, on the basis of portraits then apparently still in the family possession.  \n \nThere appear to be faint traces of a landscape background, possibly two church spires, low down on the right of the miniature. This is exceptional but by no means unknown in Cooper's oeuvre. Possibly Cooper was influenced by the practice of the Hoskins studio in the 1630s and 1640s, to consider using a landscape background, and, further, to adopt the low-angle view of the sitter, with the head standing out freely against the sky, which seems to be associated with the younger Hoskins. Compare for example Hoskins, Cat. No. 33, which if it is really of Wildman, uses the same manner of presentation for a sitter of some similarity in history to Lilburne.\n \n1 In MS notes in the Museum files. \n2 Captain Spencer-Churchill; see also Chrtstie's 6 July 1965, lot 40. \n3 The late George Howard Esq.; Foskett 1974, p. 112. \n4 The miniature was then in the collection ofR Graves. \n5 In Portraits of Characters Illustrious in British History (1815), pl. 61.\"",
