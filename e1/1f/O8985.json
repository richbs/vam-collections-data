Running patterns of foliage were the most popular. Sometimes these patterns are quite distinctive and can be traced to a specific place.\n\nThis panel originally formed part of the border that ran around the outside of a large window dedicated to the Infancy of Christ. It was in the chapel of the Virgin in the choir of the abbey church of Saint-Denis, near Paris. The window told the story of Christ\u2019s childhood and the life of the Virgin Mary.\n\nSaint-Denis was an important and powerful abbey in France. From the 7th century the kings of France were buried in the abbey church. In the 1790s, during the French Revolution, the abbey was closed down, like so many other religious institutions.\n\nThe furnishings of the church, including the stained glass, were removed at that time. Some were some destroyed, some were sold to private collectors and others found their way into museum collections. By about 1900 this panel had found its way to America. With a number of other panels, it was made up into a window and inserted into an outhouse of a mansion in New England. The owner gave the glass to the V&A.",

The window was removed in 1799 and by the late-19th century this section of border was in Ipswich, Massachusetts. The border section was saved with other substantial fragments when the house in which they were installed burnt down in 1914. The resulting composite window was installed in an old laundry on the estate and only removed in 1982 when gifted to the V&A. The various parts of this composite window are the V&A objects C.2 to 7-1983.",
