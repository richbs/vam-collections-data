He was elected to the New Watercolour society (later the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours).  He was influential and active in the affairs of the society and as the DNB notes \"possessed a confident gift for self-promotion\".   He used the full force of his personality to promote the tradition of English watercolour in pamphlets and articles, and was also a great collector of watercolours.  He had a lucrative additional career as a dealer and Lord Leverhulme purchased almost all of his art collection.  But during his own lifetime, Orrock made gifts of paintings from his collection to the V&A, including 8 oil paintings.  The V&A also has one oil by Orrock himself (1829-1900), and nine watercolours; one from the Dixon bequest, two from the Ashbee Bequest, and five gifts from the artist.  \nSee B. Webber <i>James Orrock, Painter, Connoisseur, Collector</i>, 2 vols, 1903\n\nHistorical significance: Richard Wilson was a Welsh painter who had studied in Italy. Dutch landscape painting, particularly the work of Aelbert Cuyp, also influenced him. Wilson's patrons were the wealthy elite who sent their sons on the Grand Tour. He had begun as a portraitist, but in about 1752 gave up portrait painting in favour of landscapes. He continued to paint landscapes in the Italian manner even after he returned to Britain. Wilson was a founder member of the Royal Academy and enjoyed considerable success until the early 1770s. Although his career then went into decline, his treatment of landscape strongly influenced the next generation of artists, particularly J.M.W. Turner.\n\nNote on Departmental file for P.2-1912: \"W.G. [William George] Constable [author of <u>Richard Wilson</u>, Routledge and Paul, 1953] (9.viii.39) believes to have been painted after Wilson's return to England.\"\n\nSee, W.G. Constable, <u>Richard Wilson</u>, Routledge and Paul, 1953. Constable reproduces another version of P.2-1912 (Pl.63b), coll. H. G. Babington Smith, Eton College.  Apparently accepted by Constable (Lago d'Agnano).  A  note on the Departmental file for P.2-1912 comments \"there are some differences in the figures, the foliage left, and the near building\".\n\nNote on Departmental file for P.2-1912:  \"[P.2-1912 was] seen by Mr Brinsley Ford [author of <u>The Drawings of Richard Wilson</u>, London, Faber and Faber, 1951] and Mr Douglas Cooper on 3/6/48.  Undoubtedly by Wilson and undoubtedly based on our drawing Dyce 639\". [V&A, museum number Dyce 639: Richard Wilson.  Grotto del Cane, Lago d'Agnano, near Naples.
