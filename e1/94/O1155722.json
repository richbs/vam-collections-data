It has a wide, shallow neckline, edged with self-piping, which can be adjusted with a silk ribbon drawstring cased in a narrow silk sleeve. The bodice opens at the back and fasten with four metal hooks and eyes. The front is cut with two side pieces and a centre front panel; the back is cut in two pieces joined to the front side pieces under the arm; the two back pieces extend over the shoulder forming a shallow piped yoke. The waistband has a depth of 4.5cm. The fabric is shaped over the body with pleats from the waistband. The bodice has elbow length sleeves made into two puffs, with the larger over the upper arm. The puffs have been made separately and stitched together with the seam covered by self-piping. White ribbons, tied in bows, have been lightly attached to the piping, probably at a later date. The fabric from which the sleeves are made has been cut on the cross. The sleeve ends are bound with silk with piping on the sleeve side. A belt, which extends into a 'U' at the centre front, has been stitched over the waistband, probably shortly after the dress was made to up-date it. A narrow band of silk, to which blonde silk lace has been attached,  is loosely stitched round the neckline of the dress, over the bodice and around the 'U' shaped extension of the belt to emphasise its line.",
