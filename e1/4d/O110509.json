They were kept in a shrine, or in special containers called reliquaries whose design sometimes evoked the relic itself. Both shrines and reliquaries were lavishly decorated with gold, silver, enamels and precious stones.\n\nThis realistically modelled reliquary is now empty, but it probably once held a relic of the saint\u2019s head. His name, San Gennaro, is inscribed on the frame of the moonstone on the head. St Januarius (as he is called in English) was a bishop of Benevento in southern Italy. He was martyred about 305 and his relics are housed mainly in Naples Cathedral.",
