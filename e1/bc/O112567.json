London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 177-9, cat. no. 219.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nSchool of MANTUA, ca. 1480 \n\n219 \nSIX MALE PROFILE BUSTS \nTempera on spruce \nAverage size 18 x 17 \u00bd (46 x 44.5) \n663/68-1904\n\nThese heads, representing illustrious men, originally formed part of a frieze below a ceiling in the castle of San Martino di Gusnaga. Twelve others from the same frieze are in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, four were in the Henry Harris Collection (Sotheby's, 20 Aug. 1941, lot 92, bought Wengraf), two in the Engel-Gros Collection (sold Petit, Paris, 30 May-1 June 1921, lot 4, repr.; Gal. Charpentier, Paris, 6 Dec. 1952, lot 2, repr.) and another belonged to Sir Martin Conway(Christie's, 31 Jan. 1951, lot 23, bought Agnew; 1952, private collection). \nThe panels have had various attributions (see Lit.), including those to Bramantino (H. F. Cook) and to Ferramola of Brescia (J. Pope-Hennessy) but, as will be seen, these can no longer be sustained. \nSan Martino di Gusnaga is near Ceresara, which is exactly half-way between Brescia and Mantua, but well within the boundary of the Province of Mantua. It belonged to the Gonzaga but passed into the hands of the <i>condottiere</i> Francesco Secco (1423-96) at the time of his marriage to Caterina Gonzaga in 1451. The palace was built by Luca Fancelli ca. 1460, but the pictorial decoration is after 1477, for it incorporates the arms of Aragon, which were conceded to Secco by Ferdinand of Naples in that year. There is contemporary evidence for the magnificence of the decoration and the contents of the Palace (see F. Secco D'Aragona, 1957) but in 1491 Secco's quarrel with Francesco Gonzaga forced him to abandon it to the sack of mercenaries from the Marches. Much of his magnificent collection was totally destroyed. The Mantegnesque garland decoration of San Martino has therefore been dated 1477-91, and it seems most likely that the profiles may be placed in the same period. \nThis accords well with their style. It is clearly impossible to attribute them to any leading artist; the connection with Bramantino now seems very remote and the attribution to Ferramola (c. 1480-1528) does not fit with the date ca. 1477-91 indicated by the internal evidence. A fairly close comparison can be made with the profile heads in the Parmiggiani collection at Reggio Emilia (Terni di Gregory, 1958, fig. 42). The Mantegnesque setting and the fact that we are dealing with a Gonzaga palace support an attribution to the Mantuan school.\n\nProv. San Martino di Gusnaga; 1881-82 Henry Willett of Brighton (set of 35); 25 of them (but not those in the Museum nor that belonging to Sir Martin Conway) sold Christie's, 10 Apr. 1905, lots 97-105. Willett lent the six to the Museum some years before they were bought in 1904. \nExh. <i>.Old Masters</i>, R.

Willet lent the six to the V&A some years before they were bought in 1904.\n\nKauffmann, 1973, p177.\n\nHistorical significance: According to Federico Zeri (1986), these 6 panels are part of a large series, of which 21 others can be traced: 12 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (nos. 05.2.1-12); two in The Cornell Fine Arts Centre, Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida (nos. 57-5-P and 57-6-P); two belonging to Francesco Zeri, Mentana; and five belonging to Vittorio Frascione, Florence. Twelve additional panels, whereabouts unknown, were in the following collections: two in the collection of W.B. Chamberlin (Christie's, London, 25th Feb. 1938, lot 41) and four in the Henry Harris collection (Sotheby's, London, 20 Aug. 1941, nos. 92); three in the Payne Whitney collection (Parke-Bernet, New York, 6-7 Feb. 1946, no. 258), one in the collection of Lord Conway of Allington (Sotheby's, London, 31st Jan. 1951, lot 23); and two in the Engel-Gros collection (Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, 30th May-1st Jun 1921, lot 4, bought in; Galerie Charpentier, Paris, 6 Dec. 1952, lot 2). \nEach panel shows a bust figure in profile set against a marble niche with a garland above their head. The series was removed from a small room in the palace of San Martino Gusnago, situated between Mantua and Brescia, subsequently the property of the Gonzaga family and Francesco Secco (1423-1496) whose arms (the arms of the Aragon conceded to Secco by Ferdinand of Naples in 1477) appears indeed in the pictorial decoration. \nThe panels decorated a beam and were probably divided into four groups of eleven panels, with a figure in three-quarter view in the centre of each group, flanked symmetrically by profiles and possibly grouped by pairs. All V&A panels show a male bust profiles but the original series include female bust profiles such as the ones in the Metropolitan Museum collection. \nAccording to W. Terni de Gregory, this kind of ceiling decoration was far from rare and profile figures dressed with all sorts of outfits and headgears were in fact the most favoured by the noble class. As a matter of fact, each of these six panels displays a different and extravagant outfit such as a hat with a turban underneath, a classical helmet etc.\n One of these ceiling decorations is still <i>in situ</i> in the Banca Popolare of Crema and was executed ca. 1500 to celebrate the wedding of Ottaviani Vimercati and Domicilla Lupi of Bergamo. \nThese series of portraits may either have constituted the genealogy of the family living in the palace with at the centre the couple recently married and the arms of the families or an ideal genealogy which displays illustrious men particularly admired and regarded as great examples to follow for a learned citizen. In this case, Virgil, Julius Cesar and Alexander the Great can be portrayed side by side and included among the family members.\nSome of the panels are closed to Bramantino, especially for the deep perspective of the niche in the background and Boltraffio's manner, to whom they have been attributed in the past. According to Zeri, the most plausible attribution is to Floriano Ferramola, of whose work an example is featured in the Museum's collection, see 8878-1861. However these panels display a highest quality and cannot be therefore attributed with certainty to any of leading artists of the time. The Metropolitan Museum formerly attributed his series to a follower of Bramantino but called it now 'Lombard school'.",
