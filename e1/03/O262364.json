The Romans marched under the Eagle standard while for Christians the eagle was a symbol of St John the Evangelist. The huntsmen are dressed so that the battle they fight is mortal and not spiritual with a hunt symbolising an attempt to chase evil our out one's life. The tree may be the Tree of Life, which was a common motif in Coptic art.",
