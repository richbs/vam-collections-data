The workmanship is French, but they came from Russia, and may have been made in St Petersburg by French embroiderers to cater for the deeply Francophile taste of the Russian court in this period. They have a design of exotic foliage similar to that seen in contemporary silk dress fabrics, among which are scattered small scenes. These include still lives with fruit and blue and white porcelain, garden statues and urns in the style of those used to ornament Versailles, and genre figures based on the paintings and tapestry designs of the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger (1610-90).",
