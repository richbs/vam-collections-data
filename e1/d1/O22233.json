The horsehair crown and the brim, made of bamboo strands, are joined together then lacquered. The height of the crown and the diameter of the brim have changed with time, and the gat\u2019s size became smaller after the decree of 1895 prohibiting hair topknots. This hat was also made after the 1895 decree. An official hat, called gat, was kept in this hat case. The lock does not match the copper lock plate in the shape of an elixir plant. A cross-shaped hat support is installed inside the case to hold the hat in place. The lid and body use a halving joint to tightly fit each other when the hat case is closed. The bottom panel is connected to the walls by a dado joint and the top panel of the lid is gently rounded off. Every corner is strengthened by metal braces in the shape of a pepper leaf, and handles are attached to both sides of the body.",
