It is signed by Clodion and made in the early 19th century.\nClodion, whose real name was Claude Michel, was a Frenchman who lived in Rome between 1762 and 1771. There he studied classical Roman sculpture, as well as the work of Michelangelo and Bernini.  He specialised in terracotta and became a master of a style that was both intimate and dynamic. He was the greatest master of lyrical small-scale sculpture active in France in the later 18th century.",
