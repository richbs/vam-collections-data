He performed in Russia for seven years, spoke several languages fluently and had thirteen children. When they were old enough the two eldest children were trained to join him in the family act The Moxon Trio. His thirteenth child Eileen used the stage name Levanda and performed the act in circus and cabaret in the 1940s with her daughter Judy under the name Levanda and Van.  Judy went on to travel the world with the act independently in the 1960s, performing tricks passed down from her grandfather who features on this playbill with The Moxon Brothers.\n\nThis circus also featured Max Schumann's horses the Arab stallions Lord William and Abdulla, and Cromwell who performed a Manege act. Archibald O'Brien was 'the bounding jockey', there was an equestrian act by J. Madigan with the clown W. Matthews, the mule Barney provided comedy and thirteen 'gentlemen of the company' posed as Greek statues in a 'poses plastique' act illuminated by limelight.",
