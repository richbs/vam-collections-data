There are six costume designs and the set design for this ballet in the Cyril Beuamont collection.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of a costume design by one of the leading dance designers of his period, who worked extensively with the emerging British ballet companies in the 1930s and 1940s.  Although not revolutionary in style or concept, Stevenson's work, in its sympathy with both the subject and mood of the works he designed, and the needs of the dancer, exemplifies the best in dance desikgn at that time.",
