The skull cap is formed using the same band across the centre of the cap with either side filled with semi-circles of silk and linen.  The outer layer is of an olive green silk; the thread is thick and  flat in one direction (olive) with the other direction being a very thin brown silk. There are two linen linings. The upper most has been poorly dyed blue; approx. 18x18 tpc; z-spun; plain weave. The inner lining is undyed; approx. 13x13 tpc; s-spun; plain weave. The fabric does not meet at the centre of the cap, but attaches either side to a band (20mm wide). On the inner side two lines of running stitch, in blue linen, lie either side of the band. These lines do not meet the edge of the cap; one line of stitching runs around the edge of the skull cap. The head band around the edge of the cap is the same as that across the middle. It is of undyed linen but with gilded, linen threads running throughout. The band has four, thin lines of a dark brown running vertically, approx. 5mm apart; nineteen the linen in undyed; there are (once) gilded,  horizontal threads running around the band, that stand apart from the background. The edge of the band is created with small loops. On either side of the band are the reamins of a ties, made of woven blue linen (poorly dyed). The inner lining is complete but stained and the outer layers are damaged. Some of the head band is missing.",

The cap is made of a large skull cap and a small width head band. The skull cap is formed using the same band across the centre of the cap with either side filled with semi-circles of silk and linen.  The outer layer is of an olive green silk; the thread is thick and  flat in one direction (olive) with the other direction being a very thin brown silk. There are two linen linings. The upper most has been poorly dyed blue; approx. 18x18 tpc; z-spun; plain weave. The inner lining is undyed; approx. 13x13 tpc; s-spun; plain weave. The fabric does not meet at the centre of the cap, but attaches either side to a band (20mm wide). On the inner side two lines of running stitch, in blue linen, lie either side of the band. These lines do not meet the edge of the cap; one line of stitching runs around the edge of the skull cap. The head band around the edge of the cap is the same as that across the middle. It is of undyed linen but with gilded, linen threads running throughout. The band has four, thin lines of a dark brown running vertically, approx. 5mm apart; nineteen the linen in undyed; there are (once) gilded,  horizontal threads running around the band, that stand apart from the background. The edge of the band is created with small loops. On either side of the band are the reamins of a ties, made of woven blue linen (poorly dyed). The inner lining is complete but stained and the outer layers are damaged. Some of the head band is missing.",
