In the centre of the panel is a roofless building where sits an elderly sage with four younger men around him. Two men stand on the steps up to the buildings, a third carries a basket descending them, and a fourth is about to ascend. The building is situated in a rocky landscape with several trees. Nearest the building part of a lake or river is shown with two women in a boat. One of them is seated and the other propels the boat with a wooden pole. At the top of the panel there are several clouds on one of which a goddess is riding on a phoenix attended by two women. A crane is flying near her. At the top right-hand corner there is a roofed building. The colour scheme of the panel is in muted shades of brown, blue, cream and green with touches of scarlet and gold thread. It has a narrow frame of black lacquer with a decoration of dull red dots.",
