This bucket, which probably served domestic purposes in a wealthy household, typifies Venetian brassware of the period. It is engraved and inlaid with silver wire that has been beaten into the grooves, in a technique known as damascening. The decoration is usually extensive and features arabesques \u2013 rhythmic scrolling patterns based on a stylised plant with a winding stem. \n\nThe source of such decoration was the Near East. During this period Venice traded and fought extensively with the Turkish and Arab empires that bordered the Mediterranean basin. Thus Venetian merchants brought back to the city Near-Eastern craftsmen and goods. Both had an immediate influence on the local population, and eventually the rest of Europe. The Venetian Muslim community produced many splendid damascened brass vessels, some of which are signed in Arabic by their makers.",
