ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Four Stages of Cruelty is a series of four images described by scholar Ronald Paulson as \"Hogarth's most shocking, most purely expressive prints...clearly intended both to horrify...his usual customers and to appeal to a lower, more general audience\". Hogarth is much admired as a major history and portrait painter, even as he is most widely known for the sharp satire of the morality tales he narrated through such engraved series as The Rake's Progress and Marriage \u2026 la Mode. Acknowledged as an unusually astute observer of the English national character, Hogarth tailored the medium of his expression to the socioeconomic class he targeted. The Four Stages of Cruelty, according to the artist, was designed \"in hopes of preventing in some degree that cruel treatment of poor animals...\" For this purpose, Hogarth reported that the prints needed \"neither great correctness of drawing or fine engraving\", which would have \"set the price of them out of...the reach of those for whome they were chiefly intended\". Accordingly, the set of four images was engraved, with some impressions printed on lighter-weight, less expensive paper (and sold more cheaply than those on heavier paper); the last two of the four images were also cut in wood (though the technique proved too expensive to complete the other two images in the series).\nThe Four Stages of Cruelty tells the story of \"Tom Nero\", a barbarous character whose inhuman behaviour escalates from the killing of small animals (plate 1, First Stage of Cruelty) to his sadistic beating of a disabled dray horse (Plate 2, Second Stage of Cruelty) to Cruelty in Perfection (Plate 3), in which Tom Nero has murdered his pregnant lover (\"Ann Gill\") for the valuables he had cajoled her into stealing from her employer. This graphic horror is but a preamble to the final Plate 4 (The Reward of Cruelty), in which the murderer Tom Nero is disembowelled before onlookers in a shockingly grisly scene. In eighteenth-century London, Paulson writes, \"cruelty was much more than a source of criminal behaviour; it was a way of life... Dissections of malefactors following execution were also often public and were included as part of the sentence imposed on the prisoner\".\nHogarth's \"popular\" prints - including the Four Stages of Cruelty - were morality tales for rich and poor alike, for the \"respectable\" upper classes as for the alleged criminal element trapped in poverty. In each of the four plates, Nero is the centre of a scene of communal cruelty; he is surrounded by fellow citizens committing various acts of torture, though only Nero's behaviour is noted and condemned as criminal.\nCruelty in Perfection is from a collection of 217 works by, or relating to, Hogarth, all of which came to the Museum as part of the 1876 bequest of John Forster that also included manuscripts by Charles Dickens (cat.155) and the Leonardo da Vinci notebooks (cat.62).\n\nLit.South Kensington Museum, 1893, p.14; Paulson, 1965; Paulson, 1971\n\nBRENDA RICHARDSON",
