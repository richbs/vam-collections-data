London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 273-274, cat. no. 340.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nJohann Friedrich August TISCHBEIN (1750-1812)\nGerman School\nA member of an extensive family of painters, he was the pupil of his father Johann Valentin in Hildburghausen and, after his death in 1768, of his uncle Johann Heinrich in Kassel. He continued his studies in Paris in 1772-77 and then went to Rome in 1777-79, where he met Mengs and David, and to Naples in 1779-80. Subsequently he worked in Weimar and at The Hague and from 1791-94 in Amsterdam. From 1795 until 1798 he was in the service of Count Leopold III of Anhalt in Dessau and thereafter from 1800 until his death in 1812 he was director of the Academy in Leipzig. \nFriedrich Tischbein was the leading German portrait painter of his time; \nhis work shows the influence of both the French (especially Vig\u00e9e Lebrun) and the English school. \n\nLit. A Stoll, <i>Der Maler J. Friedrich August Tischbein und seine Familie</i>, 1923; H. Rosenhagen, <i>Johann Friedrich August Tischbein</i>, 1924.\n\n340 \nPORTRAIT OF A LADY IN A WHITE CAP \nSigned on the back of the sofa on the left <i>Tischbein P.1793</i> \nCanvas \n34 \u00bd  X 26 \u00bd  (87.7 X 67.3) \nJones Bequest \n576-1882 \n\nOriginally described as a portrait by Greuze of his mother, it was catalogued as Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein (1751-1829; the 'Goethe Tischbein') when the signature was discovered (Long, 1923). However, it is much closer in style to the work of Johann Friedrich August Tischbein. The date 1793 indicates that it was painted during his residence in Holland and it may be compared with similar portraits by Tischbein of this date, such as that of Frederika Sophia Wilhelmina of Prussia, wife of William V of Holland (The Hague, Gemeentemuseum) and that of Madame Lublink (Amsterdam, Historical Museum, no. 2303C). \n\nCondition. Poor; there are numerous wide cracks in the paint surface. \nProv., John Jones; bequeathed to the Museum in 1882.\nLit. Long, <i>Cat. Jones Coll.</i>, 1923, p. 40, pl, 39.",
