ZANCHI, ANTONIO (1631-1722) 815 The Elector of Bavaria, Prince Ferdinand Maria, with his family, and a model of the Theatiner Church at Munich Inscribed in pencil in a later hand 'Liberi\u2019 Red chalk; squared II X 15\u00bd (280 X 394) D. 322-1885 PROVENANCE Bought 1885 LITERATURE G. Ewald, 'Eine unbekannte Entwurfszeichnung f\u00fcr das Hochaltarbild der Theatinerkirche in M\u00fcnchen', in <i>Das M\u00fcnster</i>, August 1960, pp. 261-63 It is a study for the painting over the high altar in the church. On the Elector's left is his wife Henriette Adelaide of Savoy; before him his heir Max Emanuel; on the right of the drawing his other children; kneeling on the left the Electress's physician Baron Simeoni. The drawing is a study for the lower part of the altar-piece. In the upper part was represented the Apotheosis of St Adelaide and St Gaetano. The picture, destroyed in the last war, was unveiled in 1675. But the drawing was evidently made before 1673 because the Princess Violante Beatrix, born that year, is not present, whereas she is shown in an oil sketch in the Munich Pinatothek which also served as a preparation for the picture. According to Ewald the drawing is the only one known which can be connected with an executed painting by Zanchi. The painting and the oil sketch are both illustrated in the article quoted.",
