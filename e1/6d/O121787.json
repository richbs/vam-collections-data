Ginori was an important statesman and entrepreneur who, above all for reasons of prestige, wanted to re-establish porcelain manufacture in Italy, as none had been made there since the closure of the Vezzi factory in 1727.  On the death of the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1737, Ginori, a Senator of the Florentine State, went to pay homage to the new ruler of Tuscany, Francis Stephan of Lorraine, husband of the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria.  While in Vienna he visited the porcelain factory of Claudius Innocentius Du Paquier and persuaded the painter, Karl Wendelin Anreiter and the kiln technician Giorgio delle Torri, to follow him back to Florence and work at his new factory.\n\nThis beaker and saucer is part of a documented service (probably intended for chocolate), made in 1742 with the arms of the Marchese Francesco Brignole of Genoa.  The saucers have landscape panels painted in iron-red and are typical of Anreiter's work.",
