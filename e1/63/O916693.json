The engraving is excellent and the impressions brilliant.   There are no indications as to date, but the contents and syle suggest somewhere between 1790 and 1810.   A few details are of special interest.   The bed caps, used to cover up the sunk screws in the wooden posts, were round and oval discs with a screw lug or eye on the edge.   Some of these had stamped centres set in cast rims.   (A \" bed cap\" was the device of the 18th century cabinet maker, employed to cover the hole in which the head of the bed screw was sunk.)   Chair ornaments are described as \" with spikes to drive.\"   Every article is numbered, by the engraver, but prices are written in, as also are the page references in the index.   Bell-pull fittings were gorgeous, round for ropes, and oval, with a slot in them, for ribbon.   The illustrations represent the complete article, but the manufacturer is particular to explain that the \" tassell is inteded to match the curtains in color, and not included in the charge.\" Commode handles are strongly represented, but the motifs differ from those shown in other lists.   The lion with the ring through its mouth appears ; the acanthus leaf is effectively utilised, as also are the feathers of Wales, the Irish harp and the Scotch thistle.   The United States of America is represented by a design incorporating thirteen stars and the motto <i>E pluribus unum</i> (suggesting a date between 1777 and 1792).   The end folding plates show crank-bell furniture, some of the patterns being described as \" New ornamental cranks &amp; leavers.\"\"",
