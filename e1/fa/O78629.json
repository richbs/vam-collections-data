In the 13th and 14th centuries the language of the posy was  usually French, but from the 15th century English became increasingly common.  Rings were given on many occasions. They often seem to have been declarations of love, rather than formal betrothal or marriage rings.\n\nWith many posy rings, it is reasonable to suppose that the initials after the declaration of love were those of an ardent lover.  In this case the initials are 'KS', which are also found on another posy ring, accompanied by an identical declaration of love.  This seems a considerable coincidence.  Although no proof can be produced to support it, the inscription on these two rings, 'KS', may stand for 'Kiss' or 'Kisses'.",
