Barrie's children's play Peter Pan which opened at London's Duke of York's Theatre on 27th December 1904. Barrie was very unsure of the reaction it would provoke, and when he read an early draft to the actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree the previous April, Tree decided Barrie had gone mad since it was so unlike any play ever written before and called for complicated technical flying effects.\n\nDespite not wanting Barrie to mount Peter Pan at his theatre, Tree may have suggested the poster artist since Charles Buchel had a professional association with Tree who owned His Majesty's Theatre.  For over 16 years Buchel produced an immense amount of work for Tree, designing posters, souvenirs, programme illustrations and portraits in connection with 35 productions or more. This was not the only poster used to advertise Peter Pan though, since another was printed from a Red Indian painting by Ben Nicholson, the young son of the designer for the production.",
