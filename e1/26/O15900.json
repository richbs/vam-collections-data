These were simple, inexpensive chairs made and used in rural communities\n\nMaterials & Making\nIndividual regional makers often added characteristic details to the turned and shaped elements.  For example, it was usual for the ash rear uprights of ladder-back chairs to be steam bent in a slight reclining curve.  However, Ernest Gimson's chair has straight uprights.  The rush used to make the seat was either harvested from British rivers during July, or imported from The Netherlands.  It was an arduous and skilled job to weave rush seats by hand. They were often undertaken by out-workers after the chairmaker, known as a bodger, had made the frame.\n\nPeople\nPhilip Clissett, a traditional chair bodger from the village of Bosbury, Herefordshire, sold some of his chairs to the Art Workers Guild in London in 1888. There, they influenced leading Arts and Crafts architects and designers. In 1890 he taught Gimson how to make ladder-back chairs. Gimson gave up making chairs himself in 1904, after which his designs were made by his assistant, Edward Gardiner.",
