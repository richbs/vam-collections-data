The uprights of the back are joined at the top by a deep rail of irregular outline finely carved in low relief with scrollwork and leafy designs and inlaid with a marble plaque. It has two turned drops. The arms which terminate in ram's heads are carved with leaves. The framework below the seat is ornamented with two grotesque figures in low relief and is inlaid with a marble plaque. The front legs are column shaped. There are four plain stretchers.\n\nCrest integral with top rail\n\nReplacement parts\nAll rails (except front?) and all stretchers; back plank of seat, brackets below rear panel\nRear stiles repaired at feet with spliced in sections\nProsaic quality of the carving and incised lines might cast suspicion on the back panel.\nFast growth oak?\nThe banding around the marble plaques looks suspect, and the marble plaques themselves could also be additions. Overall this chair should be considered cautiously in terms of its integrity. There must be a suspicion that it was created in the 19th century.\n\nThe Frick chair 16588 similar in form 'completely reconstructed using old and new elements'. Note the appearance of similar chairs in 16th century illustrations, eg Thirion p.138",
