Two pieces are in plain weave, the third is a twill weave, which creates diagonal lines. We are not sure what these pieces would have been used for, although they probably had a practical function.\n\nThe explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862-1943) brought this fragment back from Central Asia. It was recovered from the site of Miran Fort on the eastern verge of the Taklamakan desert. Here archaeologists discovered material in the remains of a fort held by the Tibetans during their domination of the southern Taklamakan in the 8th century AD.\n \nThe V&A has around 700 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein at the beginning of the 20th century. Some are silk while others, as here, are made from the wool of a variety of different animals.",

When Tibetan troops occupied the area in the late eight century AD, they built the fort to guard one of many routes through which they moved into Central Asia. In 1907, Stein excavated rubbish heaps at the fort and found wood slips, dating from the eight to the ninth century AD, which provided early examples of Tibetan writing. He also found fragments of wool rugs in bright colours and pieces of silk. The V&A holds a large number of textiles from the Miran Fort on loan, including spun wool, pattern and plain woven silk and wool, woven and spun hemp, woven horsehair, cords and painted silk.",
