The end is formed in from the head of an open-mouthed dog with open muzzle and sharp teeth, surrounded by further decorative foliate carving. A metal ring is attached to the top, above the dog's head, presumably for a sash or leather handle, now lost, which would have been held by another metal fixing, also now missing, although the drill hole remains. On the other side an unidentified coat of arms is carved in an elaborate cartouche and the date 1695 is inked in underneath. The silver rim is engraved with further hunting scenes in a landscape. Patterned in between and the mouthpiece in the form of an animal's head.",

Powder flasks or horns are portable containers of wood, horn, metal, leather or ceramic used to hold the priming powder or gunpowder for firearms. They normally terminated in a metal nozzle which also served as a powder measure, closed by a plug or spring cap, and are often highly decorated.\nGunpowder began to be transported in pouches or more rigid containers at about the same date as the introduction of hand-held firearms in the fifteenth century. Such flask might have a military purpose, or be used for hunting. The very decorative pieces were above all a singn of rank, and at the same time aesthetic objects in their own right, and probably never actually functioned as containers for gunpowder.",
