            "public_access_description": "This dress was designed by the American Couturier Mainbocher. Made of a fine silk tulle in pale green, pink and emerald green stripes, the dress is decorated with circled and scattered sequins in co-ordinating colours. The metal zip at the side of the dress has been coloured green and pink to match the stripes.\n\nThe bodice is close fitting with cap sleeves and emphasized shoulders- unable to use shoulder padding, as this would be visible through the tulle, the designer has instead used three pieces of boning, arranged in a fan shape to support each of the shoulders. The dress falls from a fitted waist into a very full, floor length skirt. It was worn over an emerald green satin petticoat.\n\nThe transparent nature of the tulle dress fabric required an opaque fabric for the underdress. The designer chose a deep emerald green silk to provide a foil for the bright stripes and sequins of the dress. The petticoat has narrow straps made from a flesh- coloured open weave tape in order to render them invisible beneath the dress.\n\nMainbocher established his couture house in Paris in 1929. Born Main Rousseau Bocher, he had remained in Paris following his army service in the First World War and had established himself initially as a fashion illustrator and editor. On setting up his own business Main Bocher ran his two names into one to create his label.\n\nIn 1937 he designed the wedding dress of the Duchess of Windsor on her marriage to the former King Edward VIII. The dress generated a frenzied interest and manufacturers across the globe churned out copies of the famous dress.\n\nWhen war broke out in 1939 Mainbocher relocated to New York and continued in business until 1971.",
