Barrie's play and on tour, from its second revival at the Duke of York's Theatre in December 1906 until its 1912 production. She retired from the stage in 1913 to marry, after the closure of the 1912 production. This plate was presented to her on the occasion of her 1000th performance of Peter Pan when on tour in Glasgow in March 1912. \n\nThe quotation around the rim refers to the incident in the play which appears in Barrie's original book in Chapter 8 - The Mermaid's Lagoon - when Peter imitates Captain Hook's voice. Hook asks Peter, whom he can hear but not see: '\"If you are Hook,\" he said almost humbly, \"come tell me, who am I?\". \"A codfish,\" replied the voice, \"only a codfish.\"'\n\nThe friend William Ogg who presented this to Pauline Chase may well have been the American designer William Ogg Fitzgerald who designed plates for Spode in England. The maker of the plate was the well-respected Scottish sculptor William Kellock Brown (1856-1934), who was at one time chief metalworker for Mackmurdo's Century Guild and who from 1888-1889 taught modelling, metalwork and repouss\u00e9 at the Glasgow School of Art.",
