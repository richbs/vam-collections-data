It was introduced into the ballrooms of France and England in 1843 and became an instant hit. 'Polka mania' became rife, and many variations of the Polka were created.\n\nGrisi and Perrot first danced the Opera Polka together in England at Her Majesty's Theatre on 11 April 1844. The London critics reviewing the performance reported that Grisi and Perrot's rendition was 'not the thing' since there were so many varying versions of the dance, whereas that of Fanny Cerito and St Leon was acceptable.  Nevertheless 'polka mania' meant that prints were soon published showing them dancing the polka, after which many objects such as this jug were soon produced featuring the dance.",

The London critics reviewing the performance reported that Grisi's and Perrot's rendition was 'not the thing' since there were so many varying versions of the dance, whereas that of Fanny Cerito and St. Leon was acceptable.  Nevertheless 'polka mania' meant that prints were soon published showing them dancing the polka, after which many objects such as this jug were soon produced featuring the dance.",

'Polka mania' became rife and many variations of the Polka were created such as the Heel and Toe Polka, Polka-Waltz, Pulka (1840), Polka-Valse, Polka-Coquette (1860), Scottische-Polka, Polka-Redowa (Slow Polka) etc., each being an obvious mixture of the named dances. Princess Marie Nicolaewna is credited with creating the Polka-Mazur (Polka Mazurka) in 1830 which was basically a waltz. Later on, Irene and Vernon Castle would \"invent\" a dance called the \"Half & Half\", which was one half of one dance and one half of another. The Berlin dance was a mix of the Polka and Galop dances.",
