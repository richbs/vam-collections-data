It could have been taken from a print of a dancer playing the part, since she is wearing a skirt which does not reach her ankles and was known as a 'ballet-length skirt' since it allowed more freedom of movement than the floor-length skirts worn by ladies at the time.  The eight of hearts playing card on her right sleeve is another indication that she is wearing a theatrical costume.\n\nPorcelain figurines became very popular during the 18th century, especially those representing theatrical subjects.  Because of its fragile nature, porcelain was an ideal material for small, delicate sculptures such as this.  The Rococo style, characterised by the shape and swirling lines on the base of this figurine, also suited ornately decorated figurines such as this.",
