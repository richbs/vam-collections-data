            "public_access_description": "This Egyptian bowl has lustre decoration. It is one of the finest complete examples of the lustre-decorated pottery produced in Egypt under the Fatimid dynasty (ruled 969 -1171). Decorators had transferred the technique of painting in lustre over the glaze from glassware to pottery in Iraq at an earlier date. However, the quality of Egyptian wares of the Fatimid period is often much higher, as in this case. \nThe decoration on the interior of the bowl shows a hooded man carrying a lamp or censer suspended on chains. The space to his left is filled with a cypress tree. The man has traditionally been identified as a Coptic priest. (The Copts are Egyptian Christians who have lived under Muslim rule since the 7th century AD and still form a substantial minority of Egypt's population.)\n The Arabic word Sa'd appears twice, back to front, on the outside of the bowl. It means 'happiness' but is also a common man's name. The same inscription appears on many other Egyptian lustre wares. It is not clear what it signifies. It may be a potter's signature, a workshop mark or the expression of a good wish by the maker for the future owner. Experts have dated this bowl to between 1050 and 1100. This is because a similar item was built into the facade of the church of San Sisto in Pisa, Italy, which was begun in 1070.",

Islamic Art Across Cultures</i>, Doha: Museum of Islamic Art, 2008, pp. 26-7.\nOriginal text for this publication:\n\nBowl with an image of a Coptic priest\nEgypt, probably Cairo, 1050-1100\nFritware under a white slip, with lustre over the transparent glaze\nHeight 10.4 cm, diameter 23.5 cm\n\nIn AD 969, there was a change of power in Egypt. The country was conquered by the army of the Fatimid caliph, whose seat was in Tunisia, far to the west. Soon after, Cairo was founded as the caliph's new capital, and the city quickly became a centre of luxury trades. Among the craftsmen attracted there were makers of lustre pottery, which had been invented in Iraq more than a century earlier. \n\nIn lustre production, a glazed vessel or tile was made in the normal way. When the piece had cooled, a design was painted over the glaze in metallic compounds. It was then fired again, this time with a restricted supply of oxygen. In these conditions, the metallic compounds broke down, and a thin deposit of copper or silver was fused to the surface of the glaze. When polished, this surface layer reflected the light.\n\nLike the earlier Iraqi wares, Egyptian lustre bowls were often decorated with a single large figure. The style of painting is quite different, however. The Iraqi figures are often schematic, probably because they were copied from objects made of precious metals. As this example shows, however, the Egyptian figures are close to those found in other types of painted decoration. In this case, there are large areas of solid lustre, but the painter has lightened the effect by scratching spiral patterns through to the white ground beneath.  \n\nThere were technical advances, too. At first, the potters in Egypt, like the Iraqis before them, made earthernware vessels, using opaque glazes to create a white ground for the lustre. By 1050, though, they were experimenting with a white body material called fritware, made predominately from ground quartz rather than clay. This was the body material used here.\n\nOn the outside of the bowl the Arabic word sa'd (happiness) is written backwards. It is not known whether this word was intended as good wishes for the owner, which were a common feature of Islamic decorative art, or was the name of the maker or of the workshop in which he worked.\n\nOn the inside of the bowl is a hooded figure carrying a censer suspended on chains. He has been identified as a Coptic priest, that is, a priest of Egypt's independent Christian church. This image does not make the bowl \"Coptic\", however. It belongs to the broader Islamic culture that prevailed in Egypt at this time, and in which Copts, like other Christians and Jews, played an important part. \n\nBeside the priest is a cypress tree. Its presence suggests a garden setting, and the priest is presumably standing in a the grounds of a monastery.  Monasteries in the Middle East have always produced wine, which was enjoyed by visitors, Christian and non-Christian alike. As a consequence, monastery gardens were often the scene of merrymaking in Arab poetry. The bowl therefore illustrates the diverse religious life of the Islamic Middle East and an aspect of Arab secular literary culture in which Christians played a notable role.\n\nVictoria and Albert Museum, London: C.49-1952.
