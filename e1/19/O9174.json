            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis vase was designed specifically for use within one of William Burges's interior schemes. Ceramics were regularly shown in his drawings for interiors, although few of these in fact appear to have been produced. \n\nPlaces\nThe commission to rebuild Cardiff Castle for the 3rd Marquess of Bute provided Burges with an unprecedented opportunity to realise his ideas on a grand scale. Not only was Bute held to be the richest man in Britain, but he shared Burges's enthusiasm for antiquarian subjects and his romantic passion for the Middle Ages. This vase was one of four designed to be placed on the stone brackets in each corner of the Summer Smoking Room, a galleried interior at the top of the Clock Tower of the Castle. The foundation stone was laid in 1869.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe shape of the vase relates very closely to examples of tulip vases in a photograph of The office in William Burges's chambers, 15 Buckingham Street, London: the Zodiac Settee, dated 1871 (RIBA7224) and a later image of the same room dated 1876 (V&amp;A 514-1933). The vases  on the mantel and settees in the photographs look to be made of porcelain with monochrome glaze (possibly red) and probably 19th-century Chinese. In the 19th century a wide variety of shapes were made in ceramic centres of production such as Jingdezhen, and some of them are adaptations of earlier types. \nBurges appears to have had a fascination with spouted or chimney shapes. A drawing of a glass rosewater vase of similar form appears in one of Burges's sketchbooks (RIBA53375). Another influence may have been the multi-chimneyed outline of one of Burges's favourite Medieval buildings - the kitchen of the French Benedictine abbey of Marmoutier.",
