The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThis chain was described as a znak, or chain to \u2018fasten on the pantoor or horn for the head\u2019, when it was acquired by the Museum in 1872.  Although there are several such chains in the Museum\u2019s collection, and also some pantoors (or tantours as they are now usually known), this description may be an error of transcription.  The central hook suggests that it was more likely to have been worn as a forehead ornament than as a chain under the chin.\n\nIt was bought for four shillings and six pence at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.  The word znak is a generic Arabic name in the region for chains worn under the chin to hold various kinds of headdress in place.",
