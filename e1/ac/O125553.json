There are dated paintings by him covering the period 1658-62; in the latter year he was a member of the Painters' Guild in Middelburg. He painted peasant genre scenes and Italianate landscapes. \n\n242 \nAN INTERIOR WITH CARD PLAYERS AND A BLACKSMITH \nSigned and dated in centre foreground <i>].

Natus are in the Heuvel Collection, Amsterdam (exh. Arnhem, Gemeente Museum, Dec. 196o-Feb. 1961, no. 40), in a private collection in Austria (W. Bernt, <i>Netherlands painters of the 17th century,</i> ii, 1970, fig. 830), and in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.\n\nProv. At the back of the panel is a seal, probably 17th century, with the papal tiara surmounted by the crossed keys.
