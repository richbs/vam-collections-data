Studied at the drawing schools, Royal Dublin Society; exhibited his first oil-painting there, moved briefly to London June 1813, then settled in Bristol, until returning to London probably early 1824. Exhibited 48 works at the RA between 1821 and 1860, and 17 at the BI 1820-52. His earlier Bristol works were landscapes and topographical views, but in about 1820 began literary and mythological themes, and biblical subjects in the epic manner of John Martin. Elected ARA 1825, and visited Norway. After difficulties with money, his marriage and the RA, moved abroad 1829, living in Paris and Geneva, until returning to London 1838. Exhibited 'The Deluge' (1837-40, now Tate Gallery) in 1840 with great success. Moved to Exmouth, Devon, 1847, where he died 9 February 1861. His studio sale was at Foster's 15 May 1861. Described in the <i>Athenaeum</i> obituary as 'England's most distinguished painter of the Romantic School'; his most characteristic works are 'poetical' landscapes, often depicting a sunrise or sunset and with a melancholic or stormy subject. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, pp77-80, 1861, p118 (obit); <i>Athenaeum</i> 2 March 1861, p294 (obit); G Grigson <i>The Harp of Aealus</i> 1947 [1948], pp66-78; H W H\u00e4userrnann 'Francis Danby at Geneva', <i>Burlingtan Magazine</i> August 1949, pp227-30; E Adams <i>Francis Danby: Varieties of Poetic Landscape</i> 1973; F Greenacre <i>The Bristol School of Artists</i> City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery exhibition catalogue l973, pp33-41; A Staley 'Francis Danby' (review of Adams's book), <i>Burlington Magazine</i> November 1975, pp732-5; F Greenacre <i>Francis Danby</i> Tate Gallery and City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1988 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>The Enchanted Castle</b> \nFA66 Negs 71925, GE2731 \nCanvas, 83.8 x 116.8 cm (33 x 46 ins) \nSigned 'F. Danby' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1957\n \nPreviously catalogued as 'Calypso Grieving for her Lost Lover' and dated about 1825, but correctly identified by Adams as 'The Enchanted Castle sunset' exhibited at the RA in 1841 with the un attributed quotation appended to the title in the catalogue: 'O! how can mortals hope for bliss,/When fairies grieve in place like this'. \n\nThe new identification rests on the fact that the subject of Psyche, Eras, and the enchanted castle, fits the painting, while that of Calypso does not; the confusion seems to have begun with the mis-cataloguing of the picture prior to its sale in 1852 (see <i>Prov</i>: below). Furthermore, the <i>Athenaeum</i> review of the 1841 exhibition described Danby's painting as 'very affected, too, in its orange tones and the formal shapes of the trees. Nevertheless, it is a picture to which Tennyson might write a ballad - so rich an air of Fa\u00ebryism is diffused over it'.\n \nThe story of Psyche is taken from <i>The Golden Ass</i>, a satirical allegory by the 2nd-century author Apuleius. According to legend, the god Eras loved the princess Psyche, and incognito took her to his palace where he would visit her at night; while he slept, Psyche took a lamp and discovered his identity. Eros woke, and banished her from the castle, although they were eventually reunited. This subject was most famously painted by Claude in 1664, 'Psyche outside the Palace of Cupid' (now in NG). Claude's picture was retitled 'The Enchanted Castle' when it was engraved by William Woollett in 1782; John Keats wrote a poem inspired by the picture in 1818, and the subject also inspired his <i>Ode to Psyche</i> and lines in <i>Ode to a Nightingale</i> of 1819, when Claude's painting was exhibited at the BI.\n \nFor Romantic responses to Claude's picture, see C. Pace 'Claude the Enchanted: Interpretations of Claude in England in the earlier nineteenth century', <i>Burlington Magazine</i> December 1969, pp 733-40; see also M Levey 'The Enchanted Castle by Claude: subject, significance and interpretation', <i>Burlington Magazine</i> November 1988, pp812-20. \n\nWilson calls Danby's picture a late homage to Claude: 'It is representative of its period in its straining after effects - a dazzling sunset, a monolithic palace of hybrid classical oriental character, and a languishing heroine. Compositionally it bears no relation to Claude's painting of the subject, although it can be regarded as a distant descendant of Claude's seaport compositions'. As Adams points out, Danby's sunset and grieving figure also recall Claude's <i>'Ezekiel Mourning over the Destruction of Tyre</i> (1667, Bridgwater House collection), while the castle itself is similar to the buildings in Turner's 'Dido Building Carthage' (1815, NG). \n\nThe source of the two lines of verse quoted in the 1841 BI catalogue is unknown, and may have been invented by Danby himself. They seem close to the sub-Keatsian poetry of \u2018LEL', Letitia Elizabeth Landon, who had written a poetical sketch, inspired by and titled after Danby's 1825 painting 'The Enchanted Island', published in the same year and aspiring to the same melancholic vein.\n \nAdams discusses two other similar subjects with which 'The Enchanted Castle' has been confused: 'An Enchanted Island', exhibited at the BI in 1825 (59), and now in a private collection (Adams, 19), and 'Calypso's Grotto - The Goddess weeps the departure of Ulysses', exhibited at the BI in 1844 (118), and destroyed in a fire in about 1940 (Adams, 178). The composition of the latter is known from the small oil study dated 1843 (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA; Adams 50). Both compositions are different from 'The Enchanted Castle'. There may be some connection, however, between the exhibiting of 'The Enchanted Castle' in 1841 and the republication in March of the same year of the 1825 mezzotint of 'An Enchanted Island'. \n\nPROV: Probably bought from the artist by William Jones; his sale, Christie's 8 May 1852 (lot 123, as 'Calypso on the Enchanted Isle', but the <i>Art Journal</i> report of the sale (1852, p152) refers to the painting as 'The Enchanted Castle'), bought by Smith, who is known to have sometimes acted as agent for John Sheepshanks; Sheepshanks by 1857 (the picture is not in the 1850 list)\n \nEXH: RA 1841 (549); <i>Exhibition of a Selection of works by Irish Painters</i> Guildhall 1904 (108, as 'Calypso's Island'); <i>Francis Danby</i> Arts Council, Bristol, Birmingham, Bradford, 1961 (15, as 'Calypso Grieving for her Lost Lover'); <i>Royal Academy of Arts Bicentary exhibition</i> RA 1968-9 (210, as 'Calypso Grieving'); <i>The Art ofClaude Lorrain</i> Arts Council, Newcastle and Hayward Gallery, 1969 (142); <i>Irish Art in the 19th Century</i> Crawford Municipal School of Art, Cork, 1971 (31); <i>Francis Danby</i> Tate Gallery and City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery 1988-9 (42)\n \nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 5 June 1841, p443; <i>Adams</i>, pp120-2, no 19; M Wilson <i>Claude: The Enchanted Castle</i> 1982, p17; <i>Greenacre</i> 1988, pp115-6\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
