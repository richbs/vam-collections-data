Boned strapless bodice of ivory wild silk supported by flesh coloured elastic over the shoulders; attached to the elastic at the top of the shoulders are pale pink fine organza kimono sleeves bordered with bold lurex Russia braid.  The top of the bodice is edged with narrow gold braid studded with small brilliants, which continues over the elastic straps and the top edges of the sleeves and the back edge of the bodice.  Vertical bands of the same braid cover the seams down each breast and centre front and back side seams.  The top edge of the bodice is trimmed with small artificial pale pink flowers and brilliants.  At the hip line, the bodice finishes between each seam in a point, accented with a cluster of three brilliants.  From immeadiately under the bodice and over the top skirt of the tutu is a narrow sunray-pleated frill of gold gauze.  The skirt is of three layers of double silk - the innermost of white has a serrated edge and inserted hoop support.  The two top layers are formed of individual centre-seamed petals, the upper layer of white shot ivory silk, the lower, wider skirt, of white.  The point of each petal and the join between each petal on the upper layer defined by a diamond brilliant.  Trimmed throughout in gold.",
