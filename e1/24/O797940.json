            "public_access_description": "This detail, almost certainly made by J. G. Crace, is most interesting because it shows how Crace interpreted Pugin's sketch from D.879-1908. Crace seems to have kept as close as possible to Pugin's design, but details such as foliage lack Pugin's intensity.\n\nThe designs for Burton Closes in Bakewell, Derbyshire, provide a valuable example of Pugin\u2019s domestic interiors. The existence of such a complete set of design drawings and Crace\u2019s coloured trials offer an unusual opportunity to understand Pugin\u2019s original intentions. Burton Closes was a newly built house, in picturesque Elizabethan style, when Pugin and J. G. Crace were commissioned by John Allcard to decorate the house.  Allcard commented in 1848 that \u2018I am not a little astonished at the Beauty and grandeur of our doing\u2019. \n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
