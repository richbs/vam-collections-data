The body is decorated with several large rings infilled with carved vertical diaper (<i>Kerbschnitt</i>). The size of these rings and their spacing around the circumference of the vessel has not been worked out completely accurately such that one of the rings could not be fully completed. Each contains a wheel of alternating coloured segments radiating from a small lion's head. Between the rings are applied moulded human heads which alternate with stamped six-petalled flowers. Above and below the rings are registers of enamelled lozenges inside each of which is an applied berry-like prunt. The registers are contained by narrow pewter bands and the tankard has a pewter foot mount. There is a circle of alternating blue and white beads of enamel above the top register. The handle bears stamped decoration of formal leaves. The pewter lid is embossed with a bust of male aristocrat in seventeeth-century lace collar and armour, surrounded by a circle of fruit and flowers. The thumbpiece bears the face of a Baroque-looking cherub.",

Recent research suggests that such wares might in fact have been made in Dippoldiswalde, a town about 25 kilometres further east, but mounted in Freiberg pewter. This highly decorative piece combines a range of techniques including salt-glazing, carving, stamping, applied moulded decoration and enamelling.",
