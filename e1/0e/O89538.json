The painting has a series of coloured outlines framing it in black, red and green on the inner side of a gold line, which is bordered by strips of plain terra cotta-coloured paper with further black outlines at its outer edges which are ruled on the main plain ivory-coloured border of the page. This has applied strips of paper at its margins which have been painted in red over a former green margin which is apparent here and there along its inner edge and down the inside of the right hand side which has a beige woven textile strip applied as a gutter for the binding, without the addition of the red paint.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
