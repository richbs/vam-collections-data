Some of the objects owned by this former member of the East India Company's army were bought by the Indian Museum in 1868 and were transferred to the South Kensington Museum in 1879. The decoration on the cup exemplifies the ubiquitous floral style of the arts under the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658) that continued under subsequent rulers. Guthrie acquired some of his pieces directly from the royal Sikh treasury in Lahore, presumably from the auctions that took place immediately after the annexation of the Punjab by the British in 1849. Others were said to have come from the Mughal treasury in Delhi after it was seized in 1857, but no record survives to indicate precisely which of his pieces came from which source.",
