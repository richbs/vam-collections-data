            "public_access_description": "This painting depicts Ira Aldridge (1807-1867) in his most famous role, Othello. The painter is unknown - most likely of the British School - but the painting itself is unusual in depicting Othello on the stage, as opposed to treating it in a purely literary fashion.\n\nAldridge made his London debut as Othello at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in 1833. Barely two weeks after the death of Kean, who had played Othello on the very same stage, Aldridge was forced to circulate handbills defending his adoption of Kean's part. He had doubtless traded on Kean's reputation as early as 1825 nevertheless, when he appeared at the Coburg Theatre in the lead role of Thomas Southern's play Oronooko, The Royal Slave, billed as 'Mr. Keene'.\n\nSome papers protested about a black actor being permitted to appear at Covent Garden, and the tone of their reviews the next day was somewhat sullen, partially due to the perceived appropriation of Kean's role.  Unable to criticise a good performance outright, The Morning Post grudgingly conceded: 'it was doubtless sufficiently good to be considered very curious'. This was balanced by the many other publications which declared Aldridge: 'a singularly gifted actor'(The Standard), with: 'beauties throughout his performance' (The Globe), who: 'evinced a great deal of feeling and nature in his performance' (The Spectator).",
