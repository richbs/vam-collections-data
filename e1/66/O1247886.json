            "physical_description": "[boat] Tin and plastic 'cruiser' style boat. The hull is made from cream plastic, with a keel running it's length, a red plastic pivoting rudder and polished metal propeller at it's bow. The deck is made from tinplate, printed with a 'wooden deck' design in red and cream. The aft deck is set into the hull, and surrounded by a cream plastic railing, with red detailing in paper glued on, running around the back of the boat. The floor of the deck is again printed in a wooden design, in yellow, with a red rug and metal holders and side compartments also printed on. In addition, a black plastic and silver metal box is also fixed to this aft deck, and acts to hold the cabin in place. A ship-style compass is mounted into the fore deck, sitting within a clear plastic domed cover. The compass face is silver, with lettering indicating eight compass positions and magnetic north printed in black ink. It pivots freely within a brass casing, held in place by a turned brass knob. A small metal cleat is fixed to the deck at the bow and stern, and two lights are positioned immediately in front of the cabin port and starboard. These can be turned to release the cabin section.\n\nThe cabin is moulded in cream, blue and red plastic, with metal railings on either side and metal windscreen towards the stern. Behind the windscreen is a steering wheel and instrument panel, at which a plastic figure sits on one of two white plastic chairs fixed with a piece of wire. The figure is wearing a white suite and shirt, with black tie, black shoes and white cap with black peak. His face and hands are painted flesh-coloured, with facial details picked out in black and red. A white plastic door, which does not open, leads into the cabin between the two seats. Eight windows have been painted on to the sides and front of the cabin, in light blue.\n\nThe cabin section can be removed from the hull, to reveal the electric motor and battery compartment within the hull. The motor is held in place by a metal band, screwed into the plastic moulding. This is attached to the propeller by means of a metal shaft through the bottom of the hull. A black and red wire are attached to the top of the motor. The batteries are held in place by plastic moulding, and brass strips are attached. The motor is operated by a switch which protrudes through a hole in the deck, with a red plastic end. Pulling this up raises a brass strip, thus connecting the batteries.\n\nA radar antenna protrudes vertically from the cabin roof. This has a metal shaft, metal rectangular dish and white plastic body. This attached to a further shaft, connected to a metal wheel on the underside of the cabin, which is rotated by the electric motor, in turn rotating the radar dish. \n[box] Rectangular cardboard box, covered in parts in coloured or printed paper. The base is formed from a rectangular sheet of thick card, covered in blue paper and attached to a slightly smaller shallow box, made from light grey card, the outside of which is covered in a light pink paper with a slight sheen, the inside of which is uncovered. A folded cardboard insert, in light grey card (untreated on one side), sits inside the base. This has the shape of the boat cut into it, as well as a hole in one corner to hold the detachable radar mast. The box lid is also made from light grey card, folded, stapled and glued in place and covered on the outside by red paper. A printed sheet of paper has been stuck across the two longest sides and the top of the box. This has images of the boat on each face (one showing a side view with instructions on how to turn it on and off, one showing the cabin compartment removed and the installation of batteries, and the top showing the boat moving through water), against a blue and yellow background. The Schuco trade name is repeated in yellow on a black background in a strip that runs along all three faces. Also, the 'Schuco' name also appears in black on all three faces, as does the name of the model, 'Elektro Nautico 5550'.",

            "public_access_description": "This battery-powered electric boat, the 'Elektro Nautico 5550' was manufactured by the well-known German manufacturer Schuco, probably in the 1960s. It is made from plastic, with a lithographed tinplate deck and metal detailing, and has an electric motor in the hull. This is attached to a propeller, moving the boat through the water, and also rotates a radar mast on the roof of the cabin. The cabin can be removed to allow access to the electric motor and battery compartment. This particular boxed example is in very good condition.\n\nSchuco is a very well-known manufacturer of mechanical tinplate toys. They initially produced ranges of clockwork figures and animals, and are best known for their toy cars. But they also produced toy motorcycles and aircraft, and a number of toy boats, of which this is a good example. Schuco started to replace clockwork mechanisms with electric motors in the 1950s, when they also started to use more plastic in their models. Schuco have a reputation for quality. Their models are extremely durable and well-made, and the designs, particularly those of the toy cars, can be extremely realistic. Their range of boats have a reputation for being beautifully shaped. Although based in Nuremberg, Schuco exported around the world, and was particularly popular in North America.",
