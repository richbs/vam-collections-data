No 11, Pall Mall East.</i>\nLithograph coloured by hand.\n17.7 X 23.5cm\nE.481-1903\nC=Atherton Curtis, <i>Catalogue de L'Oeuvre Lithographi\u00e9 et Grav\u00e9 de R.P. Bonington</i>, Paris, 1939. \n\nThis print first appeared in an uncoloured form as a vignette at the end of one chapter of A. Pichot <i>Vues Pittoresques de L'\u00c9cosse</i>, Paris 1826, a volume of Scottish views accompanied by a text containing extracts from the works of Sir Walter Scott.  It is one example of what has been dubbed 'the picture industry' that grew up in France in the first half of the nineteenth century, depicting scenes from Scott's novels.<sup>1</sup>  Most of the illustrations depicted in the volume were drawn by F. A. Pernot and then lithographed by a team of more than ten different artists of whom Bonington was one.  The thirteen prints Bonington contributed to this project had a second lease of life when they were republished separately by Colnaghi in 1829.  According to Curtis this particular image was drawn as well as lithographed by Bonington.  It illustrates closely a passage in Scott's <i>A Legend of Montrose</i>, 1819, describing the departure of Dugald Dalgetty and Ranald from Inverary.  The prints Curtis describes are not hand-coloured and there are uncoloured impressions from this set in the V&amp;A's collection.\nThis print comes from a complete set of thirteen, all hand-coloured, which survive in their 1829 paper wrapper, which is partly lettered <i>Scotch Sketches DRAWN ON STONE, BY THE LATE R. P. BONINGTON, London 1829</i>.  Colnaghi's print publishing records do not survive from this date but it is possible that the colouring is contemporary with publication; its quality would certainly suggest a date before the middle of the nineteenth century. \nGum, probably gum arabic, has been used in the dark parts of the foreground figures to model form and enhance the already dramatic subject matter.  Tartan and other especially colourful subjects such as night fires seem to have been amongst the most popular for hand-colouring.\n\n1.
