He was the Father of Queen Victoria and died in 1820.  \n\nLittle has been discovered to date about G. Heppenstall and this is his only surviving work. \n\nWax portraits had become popular during the 18th century in Britain, but some artists continued the tradition in this material during the early 19th century, especially before the invention of photography. They were often modelled from the life; a mould could be made from this initial model, from which further copies could be cast. The waxes were small and portable, and the nature of the material meant that they were extremely naturalistic. Sometimes they were coloured, and extra items added, such as textiles, seed pearls or coloured glass, to increase the life-like appearance of the portrayal.",
