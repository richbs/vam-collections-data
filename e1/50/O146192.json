It has a white ground with incomplete and unidentifiable motifs in red and light blue edged with composite band with a yellow ground  and a thin black meander carrying red and white flower heads and red, white and purple flower heads and small green leaves. To the side of these there are some borders:\n[1] wide cream ground containing standing military figures , each carrying a sword over their right shoulder; there are four different colour combinations and the figures are moving in a clockwise direction with their heads towards the remains of the central panel.\nThis is framed by a red band with a white meander with white or white and yellow flower heads.  This is framed either side by a narrow yellow edging.\n[2] wide cream ground containing mounted riders on rocky ground.  There is a camel and kettle drummer at the head and also at the rear of the column; the other riders are on horseback.  This border is edged with a red and white meander band which forms a square in the corner which contains a standing soldier in 18th century European dress holding a flag with light blue and red horizontal bands and black stars.  There are three rosettes by the figure.\nPredominant colours of the costumes: 2 shades of red, light blue, brown-purple and touches of green and yellow.",
