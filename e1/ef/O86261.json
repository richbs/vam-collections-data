Basil Brush appeared in Cinderella at the Oxford New Theatre during Christmas 1969 when he had become a national favourite due to his hit television programme The Basil Brush Show, first screened in 1968. The caricature was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nFoxy, anarchic Basil Brush modelled his debonair British voice on that of  the actor Terry-Thomas although he grudgingly accepted that Ivan Owen (1927-2000) made a great contribution to his voice and movement, and that Peter Firmin created him for the 1963 television show The Three Scampies which originally made his name. Basil made Owen a millionaire and created a Basil Brush industry, but Owen always kept his identity a secret, so this is a rare portrayal of the fox and man together. Boom boom!",
