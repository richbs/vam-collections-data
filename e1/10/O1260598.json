The factory of Enoch Wood &amp; Sons produced fine quality colour printed wares which were more costly to make as they required more firings. The wide variety and combination of patterns available catered to popular trends. English achievement and patriotism was celebrated in a series of views of England, the Railways or as on this plate 'SUSPENSION BRIDGES' (printed on the reverse). Entire dinner services could be ordered with different central views on each piece.",
