This example was produced by Davis of Birmingham, although the name of the artist responsible for the design is unrecorded. The obverse shows busts of Victoria and Albert with an inscription: 'TO COMMEMORATE THE EXHIBITION OF THE INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS - PROPOSED BY HRH PRINCE ALBERT & PATRONISED BY HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis medal was struck in bronze. Struck medals were produced from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. A flat disc was placed between the dies, which were then compressed, so that the design was reproduced on the metal. This technique meant that a high number of medals could be made using the same dies over and over, whereas the technique of casting medals could be more complex, and generally smaller numbers were made.",
