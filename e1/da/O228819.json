The ground is divided into a grid formed by 8-pointed stars, diamonds and diagonal lozenges on a white embroidered ground. The stars contain a 4-armed whirly-gig, the diamonds contain an arrangement of 4 small diamonds in a cross shape, the diagonal lozenges contain an S- or Z-motif. There is an integral inner border in which the diagonal lozenges with S-motifs are linked by a black stem with red leaves.\nInner and outer borders: dark blue satin ground with 5-petalled flowers in profile [carnations?] alternating in direction and linked by a meander of couched metal thread.\nMain border: pieced. Large floral sprays, each rising from a small mound with small pointed leaves and three large prink carnations in profile. Small sprays of three star-like flowers fill the spaces. Interlined with plain weave cotton.\nLines of black silk couched with metal thread in a flame-like pattern separate the borders.",
