The previous owner Mr. Elwood wrote that it is of 'local design & workmanship, and that the slate would be obtained from Charnwood Forest (probably Groby Quarry).'\n\nThe ornament is in the Adam style of the end of the 18th century and the carving itself is peculiar to the Leicester area where there are many tombstones of the same period well worth reproduction for fine ornament and good lettering. The central panel depicts nymphs and putti dancing round an altar.",
