Schongauer's novel use of the technique of engraving, developed from the goldsmith's long-established practice of decorating metal with engraved patterns, was recognized almost immediately and his prints were highly esteemed in his own lifetime.  In this print Schongauer has shown a clear understanding for the artisan's creation and his knowledge of the best of the goldsmiths' craft.",

Jahrhundert</i>, 1925, 5, 105.\n\nThe making of prints (engravings) from engraved metal plates is believed to have derived from the decorative methods of goldsmiths. The gold-smithing origins of the early engravers show not only in their tight decorative technique but also in their subjects, which included almost from the beginning decorative foliage and representations of whole metal objects, presumably intended for use by their fellow goldsmiths. Martin Schongauer was the first German engraver who is known to have been more of a painter than a goldsmith. His father, however, was a goldsmith, and his prints of foliage and metalwork show a good understanding of that medium. The simple and direct treatment of this crozier (unlike his very complex later print of a censer) suggests its use as a goldsmith's model, as does the close clipping of the image, a characteristic of such engravings when found in surviving craftsmens' scrapbooks. Unfortunately no croziers to this design have been recorded, but the design of the stem was adapted for the decoration of a manuscript of 1490-91.\n\nThe revival of interest in early German prints had begun by the 18th century and by 1856, when the crozier design was bought by the Art Libary for the use of design students, such prints were also sufficiently valuable in their own right to be faked. The faker has cleverly avoided copying the signature which would have invited inspection, but his line-work differs in many ways from the original.'",
