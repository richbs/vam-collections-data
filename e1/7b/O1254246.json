Parts of the eyes are drawn as are the eyebrows.\nThe lower part of the oval and the arms and legs are red. The hands are beige with finger indentations. The feet have a later covering of green stockinette. At the join of the beige and red, and running across the back and towards the front, are two bands of added material coloured blue and white. The latter is turned up at the front ends to indicate a collar.",

It originally belonged to the donor's father, Philip Fairfax Mason (b. 1912) who was born in Gorkpur in United Provinces India (now Uttar Pradesh). He lived there with his parents until the age of 8 when he was sent to prep school in England. He may not have had Humpty with him at this time to keep him company but he kept a small brass elephant in his pocket to remind him of India.\nHumpty was later passed on to Philip's daughter Posy (b. 1948). She was born in Nigeria and grew up in Tanzania and always had the toy with her. As a young teenager she mended Humpty's legs with pieces cut from her school gym knickers.",
