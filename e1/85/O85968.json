They were probably made in Isfahan for a Safavid palace or bathhouse.Bathhouses, an important focal point of daily life, were traditionally decorated with luxurious glazed tiles lining the pools and tile panels ornamenting the walls. \n\nEach figure holds a spouted pouring vessel in their hands, which have been coloured orange-red with henna. A paste of powdered henna was applied or painted in designs on hands and often feet and left on overnight to producee a stain, which was highly admired. Dark almost black henna, suggests the evidence of wealth, as it was produced using costly essential perfumes and oil, whereas a paler colour  indicates that water was used a binder. That both hands are stained is further evidence of an elite lifestyle indicating that a skilled henna artist has applied the stain.",
