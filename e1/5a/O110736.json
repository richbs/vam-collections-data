Trevelyan was a painter, and was strongly associated with Surrealism in Britain, with his work often having a childlike quality.  Zika Ascher commissioned designs by artists such as Trevelyan after feeling frustrated by the somewhat dull textiles produced during the Second World War.  Along with Alastair Morton of Edinburgh Weavers, Ascher began the practice of working with artists in 1944 to produce innovative textile designs.  Ascher fabrics were printed in their workshop in London by screen, and occasionally block printing, initially on rayon but later on silk and cotton.  Dress fabrics from Ascher were very popular with French, British and Italian couturiers in the 1940s, including Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaperelli.",
