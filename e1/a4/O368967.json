The scrolling foliage, the central figure of the putto or small boy and the eagles are standard motifs of the period, but the hounds' heads are more unusual.  Such intricate carvings were often made in limewood, which is more finely grained, but here the carver has used oak, which is strong but coarser in its grain.  Limewood carvings were often left in their natural pale colour, against darker panelling.  This carving also seems to have been left unpainted.\n\nIt is one of several hundred carvings given to the Museum in 1921 by Sir Charles Allom and his wife, in memory of their son, who died in the First World War. Sir Charles headed one of the most successful firms of architectural decorators in Britain, specialising in the copying of historic styles. Between 1900 and 1914 he also began to work for clients in the United States and after the First World War he spent time in both countries.  The collection of carvings seems to have been put together as a study collection for his son, perhaps in the expectation that he would follow in his father's footsteps and take over the firm.",
