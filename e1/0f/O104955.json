The name of the chapel to which it was given is not recorded. In his will which was written on 7th January 1721  James Aveline bequeathed 'his soul into the hands of Almighty God my creator trusting and assuredly believing I shall through the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ obtain remission of my sins'. He mentions his wife Ann Aveline, his daughter Elizabeth Ellis, grandson John Ellis and his trustess and executors as John Pendrell & William Wheeler of Storrington, gentlemen. He leaves his gun to Mr. William Wheeler. The witnesses to the will were John Champion, George Haines and Elizabeth Haines.\n\nHistorical significance: Incense burnt in a swinging censer creates billows of sweet-smalling smoke which acts as an expression of prayer. This one, notable for the fine pierced work of the cover, comes from the Bodenham family chapel at Rotherwas, near Hereford.",

Catholics who refused to attend Church of England services were known as recusants and until the late 17th century they had to worship in secret. However, the Dukes of Norfolk and aristocratic families such as the Arundells at Wardour Castle encouraged Catholic communities to use their private chapels and so kept the faith alive.\n\nThe Catholic plate that survives from before the 1660s is mainly limited to chalices, paxes and pyxes. These earlier pieces are rarely marked. After 1688, Catholic plate was more often hallmarked and the range of forms expanded to include sanctuary lamps, cruets and incense boats. \n\nIn London, Catholics could worship openly in foreign embassy chapels. The silver from the Sardinian Embassy chapel can be seen in the case to the right. During the reign of Charles II, Catholic courtiers could also attend the queen's private chapel and that of the Queen Mother, Henrietta Maria.",
