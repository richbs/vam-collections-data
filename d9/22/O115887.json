Giuliano to accompany the necklace bequeathed by their father.\nThe plaque on the obverse on the case has enamelled borders flanked by cherubs, and an inscription describing the manufacture of a necklace made by Carlo Giuliano in London and bequeathed by him to the Museum in 1895. The necklace (except for the pendant, no.2 below) was stolen in 1899. The 157,580 gold grains in the case represent the number of grains used to ornament the necklace. Carlo Giuliano (d. 1895), a Neapolitan by birth, worked for the Castellani firm in Italy and is thought to have been set up in business in London by Alessandro Castellani. His early work in London closely resembles Castellani's productions in the classical manner. He later evolved a distinctive style of his own, using stones and enamel to create rich polychromatic effects.",
