The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday, however, they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.  They represented a wide variety of subjects; those of actors and actresses were especially popular.\n\nAlthough the play Henry V was staged in the early 19th century, by Macready in 1819 and Kean in 1830 and 1839, who both starred as the King, we do not know if this figurine represents any specific actor.  It is modelled however after an engraving which reproduced a painting exhibited at the Westminster Hall in 1847. The engraving was printed in The Illustrated London News on 25 September 1847 and reproduced John Calcott Horsley's painting Henry V, when Prince of Wales, believing the King to be Dead, Takes the Crown from the Cushion.",
