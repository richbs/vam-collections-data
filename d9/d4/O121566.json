In the centre of the shawls is large bird (a phoenix or a peacock) displaying its tail feathers. The rest of the shawl is filled with birds of various kinds perched on the ground or on sprays of peonies, bamboo, roses, prunus blossom and other flowers. The flowers are mainly worked in pinks and whites, with the leaves in yellows, light browns and pale blues. The birds are more richly coloured but the general tonal effect is rather subdued with occasional details standing out, mostly in dark blues or black.\n\nAround the edge is a border of ivy leaves and tendrils arranged on intertwining wavy stems, worked in yellowish browns, pale-blues, light greys and greens and white. The cover, which was intended for decoration, is bordered with a deep knotted stone-coloured silk fringe and lined with stone-coloured satin.",
