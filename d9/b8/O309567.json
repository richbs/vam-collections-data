The lady wears a goffered fillet with a barbette under the chin, the hair on the top of the head and behind the ears is contained in a plain crespine and two tufts of wavy hair are visible at the temples. The head has been broken off in a straight line from the neck so that most of the back of the head is missing. It is badly damaged across the forehead, on the upper lid and eyebrow of the right eye, and on the nose and mouth. There is also a deep hole in the left eye which appears to be the result of vandalism. The fillet is rather worn and has been chipped in several places, and the surface of the whole sculpture appears slightly abraded and pitted. There is no polychromy.",
