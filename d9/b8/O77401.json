The lines on the plate were  filled with ink which was then printed onto paper.\n\nPeople\nThe Dutch Huguenot designer Daniel Marot published themed sets of half a dozen or so of his designs from 1687 onwards. These prints were also brought together in sets of collected works, consisting of more than 100 prints each, in 1703 and 1712. This print comes from a set of chimney-piece designs.\n\nOwnership & Use\nPrints such as these were used by craftsmen and designers as design sources. However, they also had another purpose, which was to further a designer's career by earning new commissions. Marot would have been well aware of this. When  young he had worked as an engraver, making prints for  the influential French designers Jean Le Pautre (1618-1682) and Jean B\u201arain (1637-1711).\n\nPlace\nThe lettering on this print describes the chimney-piece as being in the English style. Corner chimney-pieces like this one can still be seen at Hampton Court Palace and at Ham House, Surrey. Although most closely associated with 17th-century buildings, they are also found in 18th-century buildings.",
