The idea of the commission for the sculpture was to have four groups representing the Continents. Each group was to have four figures, illustrating aspects of relevant countries or peoples, arranged around a representative animal on which is seated a fifth figure, female in every case, which was intended to personify the spirit of the continent. There are sculptural groups representing Africa, Asia, America, and Europe at each corner of the base of the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park, London. \n\nThis is one of three drawings which are his first ones by Bell for the Continent of America in the V&A. It shows a sculptural group consisting of a female figure personifying America, holding a scroll inscribed with the names of the States of America in one hand and a sceptre topped by a star in the other, seated on a bison besides which walks a representation of a Native American brave, wearing a feather headdress and carrying a shield. He personifies the United States.  Behind him walks a female figure, carrying alpaca on her back, who personifies South America.",

The figure appears to have remained female from then onwards until the final execution of the sculpture in marble. \n\n1861 was the date of the outbreak of the American Civil War (1861-1865) when eleven Southern slave states declared their secession from the United States.\n\nThat this design (one of 3) was one of Bell's first is supported by Richard Barnes's comments about them in John Bell. <u>The Sculptor's Life and Works</u>, p. 67.
