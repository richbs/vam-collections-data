Elssler was one of the greatest stars of the Romantic ballet, and Cerrito was the current favourite with London audiences. The result was a sensation. As one contemporary critic wrote: 'such a pas de deux was never witnessed before in the memory of the oldest opera frequenter. Cerrito then appeared in her much acclaimed role as the water nymph in Perrot's ballet Ondine.  Another attraction of the evening was Il Barbiere di Siviglia performed by such outstanding opera singers as Guila Grisi, whom the Queen idolised, Mario, and Lablanche.\n\nThe first reigning English monarch to attend performances in public theatres was Charles II. Queen Victoria was an avid theatregoer who loved opera, ballet and above all, circus.  After the death of Prince Albert in 1861 she ceased going to the theatre but nevertheless ensured that certain performances took place for her privately at the royal palaces.",
