It is one of a set of at least four that came from Harewood House, Yorkshire. Following a sale of some of the contents of Harewood House in 1951, the museum purchased two torch\u00e8res.\n\nIt has been suggested that Thomas Chippendale the Younger, who supplied furniture to Harewood in the 1790s until at least 1804, supplied these torch\u00e8res to Edward Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood (1st Earl of Harewood from 1812). However, it has not been established who made them, or whether they were originally intended for Harewood House.",

Those each stand on an additional plinth base, triangular with chamfered corners, which is porphyrized like the pedestal above the feet. Locating holes in the underside of the paws correspond to marks on the plinth where it may have been plugged and the paint then restored. Dimensions of the Carlton Hobbs torcheres (supplied by Carlton Hobbs in inches): H. with plinth c. 61\u00bd in. (c. 156 cm); H. without plinth c.55\u00bd in. (c. 141 cm). Width across carved feet ('end of toe to end of toe') c. 18\u00be in. (c. 47.5 cm) -- which match the dimensions of this torchere to within 0.5 cm.",
