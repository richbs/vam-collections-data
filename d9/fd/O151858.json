It is executed in boxwood on ebony and represents Christ on the cross.\n\nAlonso Cano (ca. 1601 \u2013 1667) was a Spanish painter, sculptor and architect. He was an artist of rare versatility in 17th-century Spain, although his architectural work was not extensive. While he is also known for his drawings, only about 60 of these are definitely attributable to him, despite the many extant sketches with the name \u2018Cano\u2019 carelessly added by later hands. Unlike most of his Spanish contemporaries, such as Zurbar\u00e1n or Vel\u00e1zquez, whose artistic styles did not outlive them, Cano\u2019s artistic legacy is measured in part by the number of artists who trained in his workshop and went on to become important masters in their own right: the painters Pedro Atanasio Bocanegra, Juan de Sevilla (1643\u201395) and, more distantly, Jos\u00e9 Risue\u00f1o, and the sculptors Pedro de Mena and Jos\u00e9 de Mora, who began by following Cano\u2019s models and then continued to produce polychrome sculpture in a distinctive style typical of Granada.",
