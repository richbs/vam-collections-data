The plaquettes had the same multiple purpose as their Italian predecessors. They were used mainly by goldsmiths and in bronze foundries, but also by cabinetmakers. The models were carved in wood, stone, slate and wax, then reproduced in bronze and lead.\n\nEnderlein was a gem-carver and specialist in pewter. Most of his work is based on pewter decoration by Fran\u00e7ois Briot. He copied it in the soft Solnhofen stone and then made his own plaquettes from these stone models.",
