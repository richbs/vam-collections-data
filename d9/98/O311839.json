Behind and above him the princess (sometimes identified as Sabra, or Cleodolinda) kneels for mercy outside the gates, accompanied by a lamb. The King and Queen look down sorrowfully. Above them is a servant.\n2.) On the bottom right-hand side, St. George rides through a forested valley, littered with skulls and skeletons, and teeming with lizards, snakes and other wild beasts. The princess stands at the head of the ravine on a crest of rock.\n3.) In the right middle register of the carving, St. George attacks the dragon, while the princess kneels in prayer, the lamb close by in front of her. From the hillside a monster peers out of a crevice, and a large toad broods over the combat.\n4.) At the top, St. George leads the way down to the city, followed by the princess and the dragon, whose neck is now bound by the princess's girdle, the other end of which she holds not without trepidation. From the  windows and the housetops, the townsfolk watch the approach of this procession.",
