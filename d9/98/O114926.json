From 1822, he served George IV as private secretary and keeper of the privy purse. A date of 1814 for the medallion is suggested by the inclusion of the attributes of peace (olive) and victory (palm) in the design to mark the successful outcome of the wars against Napoleon.  The portrait head of the Prince of Wales with its laurel wreath is similar to that struck on the obverse of a medal dated 1814 which celebrated the victory.\nJ. Barber, a medallist, was occasionally associated with Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, the Royal Goldsmiths, of Ludgate Hill in the City of London. The head was modelled by Peter Rouw (1771-1852).",
