At either end of the shawl is a deep panel printed with elongated flower-filled cones, the outlines of which are formed by little cones decreasing in size with the width of the large cone. The spaces between are filled with stems of small flowers. These panels are marked off by white borders bearing a meander of large formalised flower heads, between two black stripes with a meander of little cones. The cones are of alternating red, black, pink and blue, contrasting with the deep yellow which covers the overall ground of the shawl. \n\nOutside the two panels and the pattern in between them is a further narrow edging of little cones on yellow ground. Along the inside of this border, where it runs round the plain centre field, is a smaller version of the cone pattern. The two ends of the shawl have a fringe knotted in yellow silk, and the shawl is woven in a simple gauze with a silk warp and woollen weft. Additional bands of silk are wide and far apart at the centre of the shawl, then become narrower and more numerous towards the ends, where they cross additional wilk warp bands, over which the border is printed.",
