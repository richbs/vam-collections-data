At her side is her symbol the wheel.\n\nSaint Catherine of Alexandria, also called St Catherine of the Wheel or the Great Martyr Saint Catherine is a Christian saint and martyr.  Her symbol is a spiked wheel and her feast day is celebrated on the 25th November by most Christian churches. The legend tells that she was to be condemned to death on a wheel, which broke, when she touched it. She was then beheaded instead.\n\nThe figure is made of pipeclay, which is a fine white clay also used to make tobacco pipes and pottery.\nConveniently situated on a major trading route, Siegburg was a centre of ceramic production with well-organised workshops and kilns in which pipe-clay figures were also fired.",
