            "public_access_description": "This is an example of a Kalighat painting, a type that derives its name from the Kalighat Temple in Calcutta, where such images were created by scroll painters who began to migrate there from rural Bengal in about 1830. The themes depicted were mainly stories from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, as well as scenes from the life of Krishna and the incarnations of Vishnu, besides traditional themes of musicians and courtesans. \n\nThis picture, however, depicts the scandalous Tarakeshwar Affair of 1873, which concerned the forbidden relationship between a Brahmin priest and Elokeshi, the young wife of the Bengali government employee Nabin Chandra Banerjee, who took his revenge by severing his wife\u2019s head with a fish knife. Here Elokeshi is shown offering betel leaf (an evergreen leaf that is chewed as a stimulant) to the priest, who is holding a huqqa (a hubble-bubble or smoking pipe) while seated on a chair. The priest has the appearance of a 19th-century Bengali Babu \u2013 a Hindu gentleman who had adopted aspects of European culture \u2013 or an English dandy, while Elokeshi is portrayed as a courtesan.",

            "history_note": "The Tarakeshwar murder case of 1873 was a public scandal in Calcutta based on an affair between Elokeshi the young attractive wife of  Nabinchandra Banerji and the mahant or chief priest of the Shiva temple at Tarakeshwar. Upon discovery of the affair, on 27 May 1873  her jealous husband Nabinchandra Banerji cut Elokeshi's throat with a fish knife. In the trial that followed Nabin was sentenced to life imprisonment and the Mahant was fined and imprisoned for 3 years. Different variations of this affair favouring the various characters occur in several Bengali plays and Kalighat images between 1875-80. See Archer p12.\n\nHistorical significance: Calcutta was the capital of British India from 1833-1912. By the 1830s, artists had arrived from rural villages in Bengal and began to produce paintings that reflected local history, mythology, customs and conflicts of a colonised society. As a popular art form, these artists are recognised for their use of brilliant colour, simplified images and swift brushstrokes that became the hallmark of Kalighat painting in the 19th and early 20th century.",
