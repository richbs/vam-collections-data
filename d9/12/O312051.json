The form and condition of the mortar indicate its probable use. The reddish colour in the bowl points to copper enrichment at the surface (or some form of contamination), and as there is no evidence that the mortar has been heated externally, this suggests that the contents (possibly a gum or resin) caused this effect. There are several other mortars apparently from the same foundry, varying in date from 1480 to 1515, and such a survival rate is rare. None of them is of fine quality. Although at first considered to be a possible forgery, the inscription and evidence of wear cannot be dismissed, and the mortar must, therefore, be accepted as a rare survival of the early 16th century.\nThis mortar is virtually identical with another mortar in the museum's collection, also executed by de' Navi (mus.no. M.685-1910). Both have a lip for pouring, a rare if not exceptional case for bronze mortars.",

The reddish colour in the bowl points to copper enrichment at the surface (or some form of contamination), and as there is no evidence that the mortar has been heated externally, this suggests that the contents (possibly a gum or resin) caused this effect. There are several other mortars apparently from the same foundry, varying in date from 1480 to 1515, and this survival rate is rare. None of them is of fine quality. Although at first considered to be a possible forgery, the inscription and evidence of wear cannot be dismissed, and the mortar must, therefore, be accepted as a rare survival of the early 16th century.",
