The fame of the monument has always drawn visitors from all over the Indian subcontinent, as well as from abroad. Gradually a tourist trade in souvenirs developed. Small, portable items such as this were made of white marble or white alabaster inlaid with designs that drew their inspiration from the decoration of the Taj Mahal.\n\nMaterials & Manufacture\nAlthough the white stone and coloured inlays on this piece are in imitation of the Taj Mahal's decoration, alabaster has been substituted for the more expensive white marble of the royal Mughal tomb. The inlays would have been carefully shaped on bow drills by men or boys for setting into the depressions cut into the alabaster. Some of the craftsmen in the 19th century were said to have been descendants of the original stonecutters and polishers who worked on the Taj Mahal.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe inkwell was made in Agra, the site chosen by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (1592-1666) for the tomb of his wife, Mumtax Mahal, who died in childbirth in 1631. The Taj Mahal, completed in 1647, was constructed largely of white marble and was decorated with pietra dura (hardstone) panels. The inkwell was bought by the Museum of Ornamental Art from the Great Exhibition of 1851 for \u00a319 as an example of modern work from Agra.",
