The clasp is made from three stylised tulips, with a large vertical tulip in the centre, and a smaller horizontal tulip on each side.  The central part is set with a crescent of grey jade, inlaid with an arabesque design of silver and turquoises (some missing).  This is surrounded by a band of garnets and turquoises in closed settings, and an outer band of domes with applied filigree decoration alternating with coral beads.  There is a large filigree dome above this, and in the centre of each of the outer parts, also surrounded with a band of domes and coral beads.  Any spare space on the surface is filled with stylised fruit, coil rings, and hollow stars, domes, rosettes and lozenges.\n\nThe piece on the right, facing the clasp, is soldered to the central piece, and the piece on the left is attached by a pin fastening.  The pin is joined to the clasp by a chain of figure-of-eight links, which is looped across the front of the clasp to a ring at the top of the centre piece and then to a ring at the top of the right-hand piece.  The front of all the parts is made from a sheet of gilded silver which is soldered to a rim of lower standard metal.  There are vertical bars on the back to attach the clasp to a belt.",

            "public_access_description": "Throughout the lands of the former Ottoman Empire, from the north Balkans to the Caucasus, large and elaborate waist clasps were the most important item in a woman\u2019s dowry.  These clasps come in a small number of basic shapes.  This one is shaped like stylised tulips, a favourite Ottoman motif.  It was worn with the pointed part facing upwards, and was fastened by a pin, which attached the left-hand piece to the rest of the clasp.  The two chains, which join the pin to the clasp, hung down decoratively over the front of the clasp when it was fastened.  \n\nThis impressive example was probably made by an Armenian silversmith, either for Armenian or Turkish use.  While filigree decoration is found extensively throughout the region, the use of a jade inset, inlaid with silver arabesques and gems, is unique to Turkey.  The large coral beads are also more characteristic of Turkish clasps than those worn in the Balkans or the Levant.  The Armenians were famous for their silver-work in the 19th century.  They were widely dispersed outside their homeland in the south Caucasus, and produced jewellery, particularly filigree, in traditional styles for many other nationalities and faiths (they were proudly Orthodox Christian themselves).",
