Although the most formal style of dress worn, it was not the most fashionable. By 1800, rich fabrics and embroidery were no longer in style for men\u2019s suits. The standing collar, curving coat fronts and waistcoat style are also old fashioned, representing the cut and shape seen in the 1780s.  \n\nHowever, the requirements of court dress kept alive the textile and embroidery industries of the 18th century.  The embroidery for the coat and waistcoat were done first, in the areas where it was required for the finished garment.  Although made of different fabrics the coat and waistcoat share the same embroidery design.  They would have been sold together by a silk mercer, then taken to the tailor to be made to fit the purchaser.",

A pair of matching velvet breeches would have completed this suit.\nThe suit is associated with the Tweedale family.\n[Coat] High collar and shaped front indicates a date of ca. 1800. Sleeve has been re-set. Waist seam suggests it was embroidered to shape, then made to fit by a tailor.\n\nVarious alterations to the coat have occurred on one or two occasions since the 1820s. The alterations have been made to accommodate a slimmer man. The method employed shows a knowledge of tailoring that only appeared after the 1820s and 1830s. The most significant is the use of underarm seams from armhole to waist combined with a front dart and a tuck in the front waist creating a waist seam. The use of underarm seams first appeared in the late 1820s/early 1830s, waist seams appeared in the 1820s. Before the waist seam, a tuck or dart or 'fish' was employed to ensure a better fit to a coat. The coat has been skillfully broadened at the shoulders and a crescent-shaped piece of matching velvet and corresponding lining have been let-in at the top of each armhole. The sleeves have been re-set, giving a puffed appearance at the head of the sleeves. These gathered and raised sleeves were typical of 1820-1840.\n[Waistcoat] Waistcoat chest size was originally 49 inches in circumference (124.5cm).",
