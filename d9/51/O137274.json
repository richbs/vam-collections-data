The blade is chased and punched with a biblically resonant depiction of two fish and five barley loaves, referencing \"the feeding of the five thousand\". The rich detailing offsets the plain highly polished handle. The inviting contours of the handle contrast the intricacy of the blade, creating a balanced piece that shows artistic skill and a graceful sense of proportion.",
