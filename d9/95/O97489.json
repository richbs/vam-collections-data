The Coronation of the Virgin was the final and culminating scene in the narrative cycle of the life of the Virgin, as told many times in later medieval art. The Virgin is depicted as a medieval queen, as befits the 'Regina Coeli', the 'Queen of Heaven'. The Virgin also embodied the Church itself. \n\nThe subject matter of this sandstone reflects the tremendous popularity the Virgin enjoyed in her own right as a cult figure during the later Middle Ages - her cult grew steadily from the twelfth century, and scenes relating to her life found their way into sculpture, and architectural decoration such as tympana, as well as other forms of media. \n\nThe relief itself is badly damaged, perhaps 'defaced' during the Reformation, but is clearly a work of a competent hand: the carving of the drapery is deep and three-dimensional, and the keenling posture of the angels is sensitively handled. As already said, it may well be the product of a Devon, at least West Country, workshop, since the good-quality sandstone used is similar to that used at Exeter, which probably was quarried near by. Thus ' it was possibly made for a parish church in that area' (P. Williamson asst. by P. Evelyn, 'Northern Gothic Sculpture 1200-1450', V&A publication, London, 1988, p. 82), which is also implied by its fairly modest size. Its shape indictates that it came from a gabled lintel above a narrow doorway in a church.",
