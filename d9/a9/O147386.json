Resist-dyeing involves treating certain areas of the cloth with a \u2018resist\u2019 to prevent them absorbing the dye.  In this example the cloth has been folded to make long narrow pleats which are then sewn together so they receive no dye.  \n\nThe cloth is made up of two lengths of cotton shirting that were sewn together to form a shape that is roughly square so it could be used as a wraparound skirt.  Adire was not a prestigious form of cloth but it was extremely popular during the early 1960s when this example was bought for the museum in the city of Ibadan in south-western Nigeria.",
