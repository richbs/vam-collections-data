            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 266\nThe following is the full text of the catalogue entry:\n\n\"<b>SIMSON, William, RSA</b> (1800-1847) \nBorn Dundee 1800, son of a merchant, studied at the Trustees' Academy from 1818, taught by Andrew Wilson, the 'Scottish Claude', Exhibited at the RSA (founder member 1826, resigned, elected Member 1829) 121 works between 1821 and 1849, and 19 in 1863,1880, and 1887; also 25 at the RA 1830-47,30 at the BI 1833-48, and one at the SBA 1826. Visited Low Countries 1827, Italy 1834-5. Settled in London 1838. Early subjects mainly landscapes and coastal scenes, then portraits, finally scenes from English and Italian history. Died Chelsea, London, 29 August 1847. His two brothers, George (1791-1862) and David (1803-74), were also artists. \n\nLIT:<u> Art Union </u>1847, p353 (obit); M H Grant <u>Old English Landscape Painters</u> vol 8, 1961, pp705-7 \n\n\n<b>William Tell </b>\nFA182 \nPanel, 40.6 X 27.9 cm (16 X 11 ins) \nInscribed on back 'Study of a Head. Willm   Tell. Wm  Simson 1842' \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nStudy for the painting exhibited at the RA in 1845 (523), and again at the RSA in 1846 (270), with the title 'The Arrest of William Tell, for Refusing to Pay Homage to a Cap of Gessler's'. The exhibited picture was sold at Christie's 4 February 1972 (144, panel 129 X 98.9 cm (39 X 51 ins), signed and dated 1845), bought Moore 380 guineas, present whereabouts unknown. The legend of the Swiss hero who defied Austrian oppression was a Romantic theme, most famously told in Schiller's play of 1804; the episode here is described in full in the RA catalogue: \n\nOn the 18th of November, 1307, Hermann Gessler, bailiff of Ari, among other indignities, had the audacity, in the public market of Altorp, to hang his cap upon a pole, and to enjoin the passengers [sic] to salute it, under pain of death. William Tell, of B\u00fcrglen, in the canton of Uri, having disregarded this order, Gessler caused him to be arrested; but knowing his extraordinary skill as an archer, the tyrant, with the most refined cruelty, offered Tell his liberty, provided he would hit an apple on the head of his son at a hundred yards distance. Tell accomplished this feat, and afterwards roused his countrymen to throw off the yoke of Austria, and give freedom to Switzerland. \nThe <u>Art Union</u> obituary of 1847 called the exhibited painting one of the artist's principal later works, but the <u>Athenaeum,</u> was not so impressed in 1845, and particularly disliked the figure of Tell, the subject of the present work: \nOne of the clever pictures in the <i>West Room</i>: though weakest, as might have been feared, where it should have been the strongest, in the figure of the Liberator. So much animation and earnestness has the artist thrown into the aspects of those who are waiting the consequences of Tell's defiance of Austrian tyranny, that it is vexatious to see how completely the spirit has failed him in his central figure: who is nothing nobler than a wax-work hero. We can better excuse Gessler for being a mere bully in armour. His followers, moreover, have found too little grace in Mr Simson's eyes - who has slighted them in favour of the patriot's. Nor is the execution of the work agreeable. It is more careless and more ineffective than a picture by Mr Simson should be (24 May 1845, p521). \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
