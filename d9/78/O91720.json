The design, with the trophies of arms, the masks on the shields and the helmets formed as grotesque animals' heads, is an early example of the Mannerist style, an exaggerated, fantastical taste which was popular in Europe in the second half of the 16th century.\n\nLisbon was an important medieval centre of goldsmiths' work until Spain and Portugal were united under Spanish rule in 1580.",
