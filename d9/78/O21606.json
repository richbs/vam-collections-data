The sheet is softened in an air oven at approximately 165 degrees centigrade. A pneumatic ram with a small rectangular plate is pressed into the sheet, leaving the shape visible in the lowest point of the seat. The re-formed sheet is then hand stretched to fit onto the metal frame and attached with clips. This process leaves the original surface undisturbed, so that no finishing is required (which would be needed in a chair moulded in a former). The compound curves \u2013 forming seat, back and armrests \u2013 produce an exceptionally strong seating membrane. Unlike most plastic chairs the edge is flat and does not curve round the frame. The shell rests on a steel-rod frame which is made of one trapezoid shape for the back, and a rectangle for the seat connected to front legs which extend into a trapezoid form open at the front as base. The individual frame elements are welded together and also clamped along the bottom and top edges of the seat and also along the base where the two frame elements meet. The seat is held to the frame by the three clamps along the seat edges.",

As a consultant for ICI Plastic Division, Colwell designed it to capitalise on the properties of acrylic. The bubble-like seat was produced by firing a pneumatic ram into a heated sheet of acrylic and allowing it to cool. \n\nPlastic helped create the fashionable futuristic space-age interiors of the day, and clear plastic was also used for inflatable furniture. The most famous example was the Blow chair from Italy, which literally used air pressure to support its sitter. The Contour chair was not produced in great numbers but is a good example of Pop design from the late 1960s that celebrated the use of new materials and unusual, sometimes improbable, forms. Furniture was to be fun, mobile and in most cases ultimately disposable.",

Although the chair is meant for relaxed sitting in both domestic and commercial environments, it also functions outdoors, garden or poolside, since it is completely weatherproof.\n\nAs a consultant for ICI Plastic Division, Colwell designed this chair to capitalise on the properties of acrylic. The bubble-like seat was produced by firing a pneumatic ram into a heated sheet of acrylic and allowing it to cool. Plastic helped create the fashionable futuristic space-age interiors of the day and clear plastic was also used for inflatable furniture, most famously the Blow chair from Italy. The Contour chair was not mass-produced in great numbers. \n\nPop design celebrated the use of new materials and unusual, sometimes improbable forms. Furniture was to be fun, mobile and in most cases ultimately disposable.",
