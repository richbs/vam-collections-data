Lisa Monnas says in her article in CIETA (see reference) that the dating is problematic due to the velvet having technical and stylistic affinities with early 15th, rather than late 14th century silks. The ground weave is virutally unique among Italian silks of this period, as it is woven with a six-shaft rather than the more usual five-shaft satin ground. Furthermore, the design is more reminiscent of textiles depicted by Italian painters of the first half of the 15th century.\n\nThe fragment is stuck to a piece of card with watercolour; the design of this tissue has been completed in water-colours by miss Rosa Wallis.",
