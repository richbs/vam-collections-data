            "public_access_description": "Silk and satin theatre playbills and programmes were produced from the 18th century onwards, to commemorate special evenings at the theatre. Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk was produced for Charles Wyndham's company at the Criterion Theatre at Piccadilly Circus, the intimate underground theatre that opened in March 1874 and became known as one of the leading light comedy houses in London. Charles Wyndham (1837-1919) made his name in London in 1866, in a burlesque at the Royalty Theatre, and was in his element in risqu\u00e9 farces such as On Bail, adapted by W.S. Gilbert from the French original Le Reveillon by Meilhac and Halevy. French farce was something of a speciality at the Criterion, including Doe and Roe's version of The Great Divorce Case and James Albery's The Pink Dominos. On Bail wasn't the success that Wyndham had hoped and only ran for five weeks. Gilbert complained that he had to force Wyndham to advertise it as an adaptation and not a new play, and that he did not allow enough time to rehearse the complicated stage business. Dorothy's Stratagem by J. Mortimer originally opened at the Criterion on 23 December 1876.",
