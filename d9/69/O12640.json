It once belonged to General Charles Gordon and was acquired by the V&A when Gordon's estate was sold in 1894.\n\nThe connection dates back to the mid 19th century, when the British and French fought the Chinese for commercial privileges in China. Among stories about these \u2018Opium Wars\u2019 the exploits of Captain (later to become General) Charles Gordon were the most extraordinary. He was a member of the British army who looted and burned the Summer Palace on the outskirts of Beijing in 1860. This show of military power forced the Chinese government to give European countries the right of representation in Beijing. \n\nBut three years later this British aggressor had become an ally of his former victim. The Chinese court had a more dangerous enemy to deal with \u2013 rebels known as the 'Taiping', who had captured Nanjing and other cities along the Yangtze River. Gordon sided with the Qing Government and helped them train the 'Ever Victorious Army' to fight the Taiping. When the rebels were eventually crushed in 1864, Gordon was given numerous imperial gifts including a very prestigious 'yellow riding jacket'. His efforts also earned him the nickname 'Chinese Gordon'.",
