Registered File number 1989/974.\n\nSince 1982 Victoria Brown has explored the potential of hand-rolled and hand-made felts, using traditional techniques to develop dense, strong felted fabrics. Whilst laborious and slow, the process creates strong, deeply coloured, even fabrics allowing her to have a fluidity in pattern and design. She is a member of the Craft Council,  through which her work has been sold since the 1980s. In addition to her hat designs, Brown also makes felted wall-hangings. She is a senior Textiles lecturer at Chichester in Sussex and has contributed to various publications and has also written 2 books and exhibited internationally.",
