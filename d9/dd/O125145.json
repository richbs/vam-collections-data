The plate was perhaps begun by December 1830; it was certainly under way by February 1831, and was published in the third number of <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> in September 1831 (S. : L., pp. 187-8). The earlier progress proofs followed No. 332 [132-1888] closely; then Constable replaced the figure standing in the foreground by a milkmaid and two cows, introduced a plough into the left foreground, and made other modifications (S. 26<i>d et seq</i>.) \nThe scene is drawn from the same viewpoint in the sketch-book No. 121 [317-1888], pp. 39, 51 and 52; also in the oil sketch formerly in the National Gallery, now in the Tate Gallery, No. 2654 (Davies, p. 36). The former are of 1813: the latter is dated 24 August, without a year. Holmes, p. 243, dates No. 332 as c.1815, which is the date he assigns also to the Tate Gallery's painting No. 2654 (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. XVII, 1910, p. 85; <i>Constable, Gainsborough, Lucas</i>, p. 31). It appears, however, that No. 332 [132-1888] was made for the purpose of the engraving and near the date of its execution, and that No. 121 [317-1888], p. 39 and the Tate Gallery's picture were used as sources for its composition. This view is suggested by the resemblance in technique to Nos. 329 [787-1888] and 330 [150-1888], whereas the Tate Gallery's version is, as the date inscribed upon it implies, a sketch from nature. \nOpp\u00e9, who drew attention to the relationship between the sketch-book pages and the oil sketches, also reproduces a large pencil drawing of the same scene by Constable, which is in the Kobberstiksamling, Copenhagen (<i>Old Master Drawings</i>, Vol. XI, 1936-7, p. 55 and Pl. 50). Another oil sketch of the scene from an almost identical viewpoint, dated 13 July 1812, is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (reproduced by Key, p. 39). \nConstable wrote a text for the engraving, which is reprinted by Shirley (S. : L., pp. 260-2). In it he observes that the freshness and cheerfulness of the early morning comes from the dewy vegetation, since its shadows are deeper and cooler and its lights more silvery and sparkling than those of the evening. He describes the scene of the sketch: \"This view of the beautiful Valley of the Stour ... is taken from Langham an elevated spot to the N.W. of Dedham, where the elegance of the tower of Dedham church is seen to much advantage, being opposed to a branch of the sea at Harwich where this meandering river loses itself\". He then goes on to give some account of the history of Dedham. In early contents lists for <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> the plate is entitled 'Summer Morning. The Home-field, Dedham' or 'Summer Morning. Harwich Harbour in the Distance' (S. : L., pp. 230-1).\u201d\nRobert Hoozee, ed. <u> British Vision.
