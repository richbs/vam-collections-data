Each side of the cover has a border of  leaves in pea-pod style enamelled in opaque white.  Undulating bands of transulent green enamel over an engraved ground run diagonally between the borders and are separated at intervals by opaque white enamel peas.\n\nThe book contains a printed Office of the Virgin, dedicated to the queen [Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII], published by Sebastien Hur\u00e9, rue St Jacques, Paris, in 1623.  On the title page it is described as  'Office de Nostre Dame, avec plusieurs devotes oraisons etc, Litanies, dedi\u00e9es a la reyne'.  The dedication to the queen is conventional, but Anne of Austria's piety was both deep and well-known. The Office is bound with other prayers of devotion, including 'ORAISON TRES DEVOTE SVR LA PASSION DE NOSTRE SAVVEUR & Redempteur Iesus Christ', published by Pierre le Faucheur, 'rue Iudas', in 1623.",

The style is a free interpretation of pea pods, sometimes containing peas, sometimes opening to release their peas.  It was pre-eminently the creation  of Paris goldsmiths.
