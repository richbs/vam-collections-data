Graphic designer P. Scott Makela described himself as '100% digital' and was excited and energised by technology and the idea of information overload. This poster depicts an orange brain covered in lines of type, set against a screen of video texture. The brain is being sucked into a vortex along with the text which breaks down into illegible marks. It suggests an hallucination where we are dissolving in information and communication. It is a speculation about the future of technology, made before the arrival of the World Wide Web, and it imagines what total immersion in digital media might be like. The poster advertises an exhibition of experimental graphic design by students of the Cranbrook Art Academy (Michigan, United States).",
