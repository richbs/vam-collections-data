A pencil inscription \u2018Gala' at the bottom of the page suggests that it was designed for an important occasion. The dress is entirely covered with an array of coloured sequins and would have undoubtedly bedazzled fellow guests. The boat line neck is also trimmed with sequins; the sleeves are three-quarter in length and embroidered to the tip of the shoulder. The back has a long detached trail also fully embroidered edged with blue and pink patterned sequins in the shape of pyramids. The Queen is depicted wearing a diamond tiara. This ensemble is further enriched by elaborate pearl necklace and matching earrings. Across the left shoulder the Queen is also shown wearing a royal sash \u2013 supported by a ruby and diamond jewel.",

A pencil inscription \u2018Gala\u2019 at the bottom of the page suggests that it was designed for an important occasion. The dress is entirely covered with an array of coloured sequins and would have undoubtedly bedazzled fellow guests. \n\nThe boat line neck is also trimmed with sequins; the sleeves are three-quarter in length and embroidered to the tip of the shoulder. The back has a long detached trail also fully embroidered edged with blue and pink patterned sequins in the shape of pyramids. The Queen is depicted wearing a diamond tiara. This ensemble is further enriched by elaborate pearl necklace and matching earrings. Across the left shoulder the Queen is also shown wearing a royal sash \u2013 supported by a ruby and diamond jewel. This dress exemplifies Hartnell\u2019 skill in designing dresses with elaborate embroidery.",
