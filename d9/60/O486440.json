The cream based silk indicates that this maniple was intended for use on the feast day of a Saint who was not martyred.\n\nAlthough the Christian religion was not native to China, by the eighteenth century there was some missionary presence there. Embroidered silk vestments and liturgical textiles were made in China, not only to supply the requirements of the churches in China, but also frequently exported to Europe and other new mission posts such as the Philippines.",
