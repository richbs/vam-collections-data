It shows a glamorous female figure holding a book of cigarette papers in one hand, and a lit cigarette in the other. The name of the company appears at the top of the image, as well as on the brooch pinned to her dress, on the pattern in the yellow background, and on the cigarette papers. The woman's long, stylised hair floats in the air behind her; Mucha often used hair as a decorative motif in his posters. The model for this image was the figure of one of the Sibyls painted by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.",
