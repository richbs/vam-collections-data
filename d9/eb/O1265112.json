The photograph was taken for the local press to mark Toby the dog's last performance with Professor Codman on 12th September 1968.  The press cutting seen displayed on the booth entitled 'But the Punch and Judy show goes on' relates to the fact that Toby was retiring, although Professor Codman was not. Bert had bought Toby from St. John's Market, Liverpool for 7/6d in 1949, and Bert died just two days after the death of Toby in 1969.\n\nBert Codman was a third generation Punch Professor who worked at Colwyn Bay and Rhos on Sea. His father was Richard Mortimer Codman II (1870-1951) who in 1888 had taken over the Punch &amp; Judy show outside Liverpool's Lime Street Station that had been established by his father, Richard Codman I (1832-1909).",
