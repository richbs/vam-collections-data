Although they would fit into a modern pocket, it is unlikely that there were carried about.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe attractive swirling appearance of this green glass flask was a by-product of its manufacturing process. A small bubble of unpurified green glass on the blowing iron was dipped once more into the pot of molten glass. It was then quickly placed into an open ribbed mould, blown larger and twisted to form the spiral ribbing. Thus two essential attributes were quickly added to the fragile glass vessel: the body was strengthened and at the same time provided with a good grip for the hand. Such features became second-nature to forest glassmakers working throughout Europe at this period. Therefore, although this flask is said to have been excavated at Oxford,  this does not rule out the possibility that it was imported from the Low Countries, France or Germany.",
