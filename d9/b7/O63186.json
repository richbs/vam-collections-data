It is one of several pearl necklaces or circlets owned by Marie Taglioni in the Cyril Beaumont Collection.  \nA note in Margaret Rolfe's hand has become detached from the relevant object, but could relate to S.264-1979, S.265-1979 or S.266-1979: \"These pearls were bought by Marie Taglioni to temporarily take the place of the pearls worn by La Bayad\u00e8re which had been lost en route with the other theatrical baggage.\"   The bayadere referred to is the role of Zoloe in \"Le Dieu et la Bayadere\".  \nA collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and, after Taglioni's death, from her niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
