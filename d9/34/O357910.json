            "public_access_description": "The Polish sash was developed as a significant feature of national dress for Polish men during the 17th and 18th centuries.  It came to signify a noble class that had no comparable structure anywhere in Europe and was equally regarded as a marker of personal identity.  \n\nDuring the 17th century Persian scarves, woven mainly in the workshops of Kashan, were imported into Poland through the Turkish markets for use as sashes, but the Persian textile trade ended with the Afghan invasion of 1722.  Against the background of almost constant war and upheaval which followed workshops were introduced into Poland, encouraged and supported by the wealthy and influential nobles, to produce items including textiles that had previously been imported.  Armenian exiles in Constantinople began the production of Stanbul Sashes exclusively for the Polish market and subsequently transferred their operations and specialist equipment  to Poland.  The first sashes with gold and silver threads were made around 1740 in S\u0142uck under the direction of Armenian weavers.  \nIn 1758 Jan Madzarski, an Armenian from the Radziw \u2018Persian\u2019 workshops, became the foreman at S\u0142uck where some of the most beautiful and original designs, combining Persian, Chinese and Turkish motifs, were produced.  It was here that four-sided designs, such as this example from Mas\u0142owski\u2019s workshop, were invented.  Sashes were woven double-sided in taquet\u00e9 (weft-faced compound weave) with the warp divided in two along its length by the design.  The sash could be folded to display any of the four possible colour-ways that were produced.  The brightest part, often enhanced by silver, would be worn at weddings and other festive occasions; the parts with a black, or dark, background were worn during funerals and sombre occasions.\n\nThis sash is a comparatively late example of Polish sash manufacture.  Mas\u0142owski learned the art of weaving in Koby\u0142ka, near Warsaw, and was one of several Polish nationals to set up a workshop in or around Krak\u00f3w.  However, he received a royal warrant in 1787, which considerably enhanced his workshop\u2019s reputation.  The sashes produced there are identified by letters woven into the fabric: \u2018FRANCISCUS MAS\u0141OWSKI: CRACOVIAE\u2019 or \u2018ME FECIT CRACOVIAE : FRANCISCUS MAS\u0141OWSKI\u2019 and were made only to order",

His sashes were noted for bright colouring.\n\nThe woven inscription gives the name of the factory, which was founded in 1786. Natalie Rothstein suggested in 1968 that the pattern was copied from a design woven at Sluck (see , for example, 524-1906), but carried out more lavishly. The ends are identical to the sash illustrated by Maria Taszycka, 'Ceinturres de Soie - accessoires du costume de gentilhomme polonais' . <i>CIETA Bulletin</i>, January 1968, p. 85, illus. p. 96 and comment p. 97.",
