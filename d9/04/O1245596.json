Acting as the official photographer for the British Black Panther movement, Kenlock\u2019s photographs record the group\u2019s activism to improve the rights of the black British community. \n\nAs an organised movement lobbying for change, the aims of the British Black Panther movement differed from the American Black Panther Party, which sought to gain political power. There were some parallels between the two groups, such as the style of clothing American Black Panther leaders Huey. P. Newton and Bobby Seale made iconic. British supporters of the Black Panther movement adopted the distinctive monochrome outfits, which included a beret, sunglasses and a badge depicting Newton and Seale.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Kenlock alongside work by his contemporaries Charlie Phillips and Armet Francis as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
