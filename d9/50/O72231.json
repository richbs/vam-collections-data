(Maharaja Sayajirao) University, Baroda, he was inspired by the creativity that surrounded him to make his own prints. His images have a simple and direct quality. They convey the vibrant nature of life in Baroda with a naivety and freshness that make them distinct. This quality was immediately recognised and respected by many distinguished artists, such as K. G. Subramanyan. It earned Parmar many awards during his short life.\n\nThe linocut is executed in a naive style and depicts a violent riot in what looks like an urban environment.",
