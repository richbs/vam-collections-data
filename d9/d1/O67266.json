There is a fringe of loose warp threads, max. 9 inches (21 cms) long.  Upper: as lower end but the fringe is made by grouping 7 warp threads together and securing them with a single knot. Max. length of fringe 42 inches (12cms). \n\nDESIGN: Field: dark red with 2 rows of 9 square compartments.  Each compartment has 2 octagonal guls, one above the other, with two half guls to either side and a quarter gul in each corner.  One gul has a horned cross in dark blue, the other in green, and within each diagonal quarter is a white or yellow triangle.  In most of the quarters there is also a yellow or white flag-like diamond.  Each gul is set within an incomplete lozenge, two sides being red and two being either dark blue or green and all four sides have two rows of yellow or white triangles on stalks.  The exception is the lower two compartments where the components within the gul quarters are various, and the 4th pair up from the lower end where a much bigger gul, within the same size compartment, allows for only small part of the upper gul. There is also a variety of decoration in these two compartments.\n\nMain border: white ground with red stepped lozenges, some of which have a decorated centre. The main border pattern is used to divide the compartments in the field in both directions - with five of the dividing bands having decorated lozenges.\n\nThe main borders along both sides have occasionally lozenges in red and dark blue and green.\n\nInner and outer borders: Running dog pattern mainly in dark red and dark blue outlined in white but with some green outlined in yellow replacing the dark blue and occasionally red replacing dark red.  The inner border extends to become the inner frame of each compartment.\n\nNote: From the beginning of the lower inner border and extending for 2 inches (5 cms) there is a distortion of the border pattern at each junction.",
