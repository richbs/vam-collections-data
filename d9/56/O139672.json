It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nWith more covered automobiles and the new vogue for sun-tanned skin, the 1920s were the parasol's swansong. Elaborate and novel designs flooded the market in an attempt to win back interest. Novelty handles, such as this horn example carved in the shape of an owl, first became popular in the 1880s and saw a revived fervour in the 1910s and 20s. Characteristically for this period the parasol is short in length, approximately half what was typical in the previous decade.",
