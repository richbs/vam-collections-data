This reflects the publisher Lund Humphries and manufacturer Charnaux's policies of employing designers and artists of note such as Edward McKnight Kauffer and Man Ray, Hans Schleger and Frank Dobson - the latter was even commissioned to produce a display figure torso in 1933. In 1932 McKnight Kauffer began a close collaboration with publisher Lund Humphries, who, besides commissioning design work, were also able to provide studio and exhibition space in their new Bedford Square building. McKnight Kauffer evidently collaborated with a number of photographers on Charnaux catalogues. Lund Humphries' first exhibition was a show of work by McKnight Kauffer and the photographer Francis Braguiere in 1933, and included in the show was some of their collaborative work for Charnaux. In 1934 Lund Humphries gave photographer Man Ray his first London exhibition and in 1935 the photographer was working in their building, sharing a studio and darkroom facilities with McKnight Kauffer. The only known collaborative work that they produced was a Charnaux brochure, with Man Ray's photograph of a Venus de Milo cast, in 1935.",
