Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nA well-dressed woman from Sk\u00e5ne wore multiple pairs of silver clasps along the front edges of her outer clothes.  Some of these were functional, and hooked into each other.  Others were purely ornamental.  This pair of appliqu\u00e9s is now only decorative, but their design, with a change in pattern along the inside edge, shows that they are derived from a pair of bodice clasps.  In the late Middle Ages, the oval break in the pattern would have carried an image of the Virgin and Child, but over time this has degenerated into the meaningless pattern which survives today. \n\nThey have the marks of Hans Jacob Vogt, a silversmith who worked in Kristianstad from 1795 to 1823.  This kind of jewellery made from stamped sheet silver is typical of Kristianstad, which was one of the main centres for traditional jewellery in Sk\u00e5ne in the 18th and 19th centuries.",
