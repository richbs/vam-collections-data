He is facing to the left with his right elbows leaning on a small round table. He is smoking a pipe and has a jug next to him on the table. The painting is of a dark palate and the setting could be the interior of a public house. The panting is skillfully executed and was probably done by a professional artist rather than an amateur, but would not have been completed as a part of the dolls' house as a whole.",
