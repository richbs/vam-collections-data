This one depicts scenes from the Janaka Jataka.\n\nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Most of the 30 or so paintings he completed were displayed at the Crystal Palace in Sydenham, south London. Unfortunately they were destroyed in a fire there in 1866. This painting is one of only four surviving examples in the V&A.",

The main part of this painting depicts scenes from the Janaka Jataka. The narratives continues from IS.55-1885.\n\nNarrative:\nKing Janaka of Videha is seen sitting in his palace with his wife. He announces to her that he intends to renounce his worldly life. Scene depicted in the centre of IS.55-1885.\n\nIn order to persuade him against this course she organises a music and dance performance. Scene depicted in left hand side of  IS.53-1885. \n\nDespite the pleasure of viewing the dancers, the king confirms his decision to live alone. According to Schlingloff, he is persuaded to do this by the sight of women  preparing cotton as the two bangles that one of them is wearing  clash together and resound, whereas the single bangle of the other women remains silent.

            "historical_context_note": "The cave paintings of Ajanta are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They depict scenes from the lives of the Buddha and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Of the 30 or so paintings he completed most  were displayed at the Crystal Palace in Sydenham. Unfortunately those that were displayed were destroyed in a fire there in 1866. This painting is one of only 4 surviving examples in the museum collection.",
