The clothes were decidedly modern. \u2018I want relaxed clothes,\u2019 said Quant, \u2018suited to the actions of normal life\u2019. \n\nSome of Mary Quant\u2019s early designs combined historical garments and traditional men\u2019s suitings, such as pin stripes and grey flannel, in playful and subversive ways. In this design she re-works knickerbockers taken from Victorian underwear into a quirky daytime ensemble.",
