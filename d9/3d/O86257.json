ISBN 1851773088.\nFrom the 1860s when J. C. Robinson made several visits to Spain and Portugal, an interest in the fine and applied arts of the Hispanic peninsula was reflected in the Museum's acquisitions and publications. This interest was continued by later curators, most notably Charles Oman, who wrote an authoritative catalogue of the silver collection and was responsible for acquiring this dish for the Museum. Embossed with scenes from the siege of Troy, it shows the Trojan commander Hector and the Greek hero Achilles in combat, with the city to the left. Dateable to between 1500 and 1520, it is attributed to Oporto on the basis of the central medallion with the arms of the Pintos da Cunha family, added in the seventeenth century.\n\tAlthough the Museum did not formally acquire it until 1938, the dish had long been recognised as a masterpiece of early Renaissance silver. It first appeared in the Museum's 1881 \"Special Loan Exhibition of Spanish and Portuguese Ornamental Art,\" where it was catalogued as \"Gothic work.\" In 1927 the dish appeared on the London art market. A note from C. M. Koop, then curator of metalwork, reveals the Museum's aspirations: \"Dr Hildburgh succeeded in acquiring . . . two pieces of silversmithing work which I was anxious for him to get. . . . [T]he Portuguese dish is a particularly fine and outstanding specimen.\" The dish was duly deposited on loan, and the Museum clearly hoped that Hildburgh would, as usual, turn the loan into a gift. However, due to unspecified financial difficulties, he was forced to sell it in 1938. There was no question of letting the dish go. In a note of 18 January 1938 (in the Bryan papers) metalwork curator Oman described the embossing as approaching that of Christian van Vianen, calling it \"superior to any piece of its sort in the Lisbon Museum . . . and naturally to anything we have here.\"\n\nLit.
