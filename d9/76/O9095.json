The panel comes from a window dedicated to St Benedict at the abbey church of Saint-Denis, near Paris. The window was perhaps in the crypt, and dismantled in the 1790s.\n\nLord Stuart de Rothesay acquired the panel and installed it with other panels from Saint-Denis in his newly built house at Highcliffe in Hampshire about 1820. (The house itself was constructed with some older architectural features.) After a fire in 1967 the glass was removed to the workshops of Dennis King in Norwich. The Museum acquired it in 1989.",
