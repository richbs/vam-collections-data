The work was attributed to Bacon when it was acquired by the Museum in 1868.\n\nJohn Bacon the Elder (1740-1799), a highly prolific and successful sculptor, one of his most celebrated works being the monument to Lord Chatham (Pitt the Elder) in Westminster Abbey. Bacon also designed sculpture to be made in Coadestone, an artificial stone which was widely used for garden and architectural sculpture in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. His son, John Bacon the Younger (1777-1859) was also a sculptor, and specialised in tombs using coloured marbles.",
