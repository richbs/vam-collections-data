There is a background stitch called 'cat's stitch', with the legend that it was called after Queen Catherine of Aragon who brought it from Spain. In early 20th century, three ladies, Mrs Martin, Mrs Clarke and Mrs Read, worked in Downton. In about 1905, as a child, the donor was taught to make lace by Mrs Martin. The donor was given, by Mrs Martin,  the old prickings of Downton lace, which were mostly on old pieces of parchment. From these early beginnings, the industry began to be formed in ca. 1907. A class was held on Saturday mornings at Redlynch House. Orders were received. The work was paid for by Mrs Robinson, the donor's mother. Torchon was also made and types of lace were made for Mrs Newall's industry at Mere. \n\nThe lace makers met in each other's houses and sat around a small table with a candle in the centre and a flask of water.",
