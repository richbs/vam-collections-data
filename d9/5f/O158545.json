Four large pointed corner units echo the central net, and 2 of these corners have each 6 silver-gilt stars.  Four footed lozenges break up as the remaining sides again with pulled thread net.  The remaining ground is densely packed with straight stitch forming repeating small 4-petalled rosettes with a square in between them. The centre of each petal and rosette is decorated with a lozenge of metal strip.\nA wide composite border frames the central area:\n[a] needlewoven with silver-gilt stars\n[b] a wide band of open net of pulled thread lozenges interspersed with basket-weave straight stitch, both decorated with silver-gilt stars\n[c] as [a].\nThe raw edges have been turned and hemmed.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; floss [untwisted]\nMetal Thread: silver-gilt strip [also known as plate]",
