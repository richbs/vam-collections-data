            "physical_description": "Cover, plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in running, straight and split stitch, padded and quilted through a backing of plain weave cotton.\nA wide border surrounds all 4 sides of the central area, the latter being patterned with a large central lobed octagonal medallion outlined in blue [originally dark green but faded] outlined in blue silk with red 'beads'.  This frames a star formation of 4 oval blossoms alternating with 4 5-petalled bud forms, again in red with blue leaves, the stems of which join to form an 8-pointed star in blue, in turn forming a red rosette with 4 radiating blue bars.  The rest of the central space, save the 4 corner units, is decorated with offset rows of a simple tri-stemmed flowering plant in red with blue details, with the exception of one whole and 3 partial plants which are rendered in white silk - the reverse shows this has faded from pink.  All point to the lateral axis. \nThe 4 corner units are contained in a trilobed frame of blue with white, except for three red, 'beads'.  Within this frame is 1 5-petalled bud and two and a half oval blossoms in red with blue leaves; except one corner unit which is mainly in white [the reverse shows pink and yellow] silk with blue.\nThe wide border is edged either side with a narrow band of a green/blue meander bearing red trefoil buds, the meander and outline bands being in split stitch.  Along the top and partially down the sides the outline is in two shades of a faded green.  In between these 2 bands is a row of repeating flowering plants framed with a curving stem in red, save for 3 and for 4 in the outer band which are white [faded pink] with blue details, all pointing inwards.\nAll, except where mentioned, are worked in straight stitches. The background is quilted with small irregular lozenge forms in white silk in running stitch.\nSome underdrawing in brown ink is clearly visible especially in the narrow borders.\nThreads: 2S silk, red, green/blue, white, yellow, pink.",
