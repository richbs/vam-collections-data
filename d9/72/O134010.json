These were typically decorated with bold, linear designs of hunting scenes, figures and heraldic animals. Although the design on this tile appears simplistic, it has been composed with a surprising amount of detail and shows the typical German knightly attire of the mid to late 13th-century.\nThe knight wears a \u2018great helm\u2019, a barrel shaped helmet with eye-slits and vents for air. The hands are shown covered in mitten-like gloves, from which it is possible to deduce that he is wearing a full suit of mail - the sleeve and glove would be made of one piece. The mail shirt (a hawberk) would also have had a hood. The rendering of the legs and feet, with no join or line, shows that he wears mail hose, in the manner of a pair of tights. He is armed with a lance and carries a shield of the 'heater' variety. His warhorse wears no armour, but has an heraldic coat on which the knights arms would have been emblazoned.",

            "historical_context_note": "Line impressed floor tiles became popular in the Rhineland during the second half of the 13th century. These were typically decorated with bold, linear designs of hunting scenes, figures  and heraldic animals, as well as foliated roundels. Such tiles have been found over a wide area; though principally in the Rhineland cities of Konstanz, Strasbourg, Mainz, Frankfurt, Cologne and Dusseldorf.\nThe apparent simplicity of the impressed design belies the detail with which the image has actually been composed and conveys a great deal concerning the equipment of a German knight of this period. The knight wears a \u2018great helm\u2019, a barrel shaped helmet with eye-slits and vents for air - a type of helmet which remained popular in Germany longer than elsewhere. The hands are shown covered in mitten-like gloves, from which it is possible to deduce that he is wearing a full suit of mail - the sleeve and glove would be made of one piece. The mail shirt (a hawberk) would also have had a hood.\nThe horizontal line across the leg just below the knee may have been intended to suggest knee armour, consisting of a plate covering the knee. This is known as a \u2018Poleyn\u2019 and would have a date no earlier than about 1245. In their earliest incarnation the poelyn would have been made of metal or boiled leather. The rendering of the legs and feet, with no join or line, shows that he wears mail hose, in the manner of a pair of tights. \nHe is armed with a lance and carries a shield of the 'heater' variety. His warhorse wears no armour, but has an heraldic coat on which the knights arms would have been emblazoned. The back-rest of the high war saddle is visible behind the knight. The tile depicts typical German knightly attire of the mid to late 13th-century.",
