Individual apostle spoons were sometimes given as Christening gifts but intended for use. Groups depicting all 12 apostles were more likely to be owned by wealthier members of society (noblemen were more likely to have several dozen spoons in various shapes;  a tradesman would have about six to 12).  Few complete sets have survived. During the Reformation many religious images were destroyed, and silver was melted down and re-used.\n\nThis spoon depicts St James the Great, one of the original 12 apostles whom Jesus sent to preach his gospel to the world. His brother was St John the Evangelist who appears on another apostle spoon in the Museum\u2019s collection (M.71-1921). St James is often shown with a pilgrim\u2019s staff and wallet. Despite having been killed in Jerusalem in 44, St James became associated in medieval legend with Compostela in Spain,  which became a centre for pilgrimage through association with the saint.",
