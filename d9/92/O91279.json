Hopkins took the series during a two-week assignment with the writer Fyfe Robinson for the illustrated magazine Picture Post. The image is carefully composed, lit and titled, so the everyday action of the woman raising her hands to wash her face can also be read as a gesture of despair. Perhaps because of its raw, emotive power and its potentially damaging political message, the series was never published. The municipal authorities pressured the publishers and the story was withdrawn.",
