This model after Le Corbusier's design was made in 1987 by Andrew Jackson, and the landscape was made by Sasha Bhavan, David Linford, and Noresh Des Gupta, all of Edward Cullinan Architects.  This model was made for the exhibition 'Le Corbusier: Architect of the Century' held at the Hayward Gallery, London, 5 March to 7 June, 1987. It was a centenary exhibition organised by the Arts Council of Great Britain in collaboration with the Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris. The model is made to the scale of 1:200.\n\nAlthough never built, Le Corbusier's design for the Governor's Palace (Raj Bhavan) was part of his concept for the Capitol Complex in Chandigarh, India. His masterplan for the Capitol included the High Court of Justice (1956), the Secretariat (1958), the Palace of Assembly (1964), and the Governor's Palace (1952-54). Le Corbusier grouped the buildings in a composition of monumental scale symbolizing confidence in progress and the creation of harmony out of the violence of religious conflict and the partition riots.\n\nLe Corbusier was one of the most original and influential architects of the twentieth century.",
