His studio, with a focus on the creation of 'artistic' wares and the tireless experiments of De Morgan himself to reproduce various colours and glazes, was regarded as the antithesis of the large impersonal and industrialised factories. De Morgan was greatly influenced by Italian renaissance and Iznik ceramics, and aimed to perfect the vibrant lustres of such wares, as demonstrated on this vase. \n\nDe Morgan moved his pottery several times during his career, to meet the changing demands of his life and work, first at Chelsea (1872-82), then at Merton Abbey (1882-88) and finally at Fulham (1888-1898) after which De Morgan played an increasingly detached role in the company. This vase, although unmarked and undated, was probably made during the Fulham period when De Morgan produced some of his most exciting designs.\n\nDe Morgan was also associated with the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain producing ceramics for William Morris",
