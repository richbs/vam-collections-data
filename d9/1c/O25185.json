This design by Herbert Budd (a painter of portraits and domestic life) enticingly depicts a bustling shopping scene, mainly peopled by women and children, and set outside the old entrance to Knightsbridge Underground Station (near Harrods). A toy vendor in the foreground, and a newspaper seller on the right add local colour. In the windows of the shopping arcade are displayed fabrics, some of which appear to be in the popular Art Deco style.\n\n[Margaret Timmers, 'British Design at Home', p.115]",
