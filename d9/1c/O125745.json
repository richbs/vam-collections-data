Similar in general composition to the rock crystal Judgement of Paris (A.23-1942), Hercules here substitutes for the figure of Paris, although his seated figure owes more to images of Hercules at the crossroads (see A.479-1910), the source for which has been suggested to be Michelangelo's slaves on the Sistine chapel ceiling, than to the leaning figure of Paris.",
