            "public_access_description": "Earthenware flatbacks and figurines for mantelpiece decoration were first produced in  Staffordshire in the late 1830s. The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837. Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s Staffordshire pottery firms issued countless other royal figures. Although some appeared after Victoria's death in 1901, few were made after 1905. During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family, they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nDavid Garrick (1717-1779) was recognised during his lifetime as one of the greatest actors ever in both comedy and tragedy. He was born in Hereford and came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but he made his London debut as an actor in 1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre as Richard III. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted during his lifetime in many of his most famous roles, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810). Richard III was a role with which he was especially associated, both from his London debut and his first appearance as Richard at Drury Lane Theatre on 11 May 1742.",
