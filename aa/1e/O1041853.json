No. 342 [1258-1888] was made in connection with the same commission, which was obtained by Constable through the recommendation of Samuel Lane, the deaf-and-dumb painter. The first mention of it is in Constable's journal for 2 June 1824 (Beckett, H, p. 323); as the note on the back of No. 340 shows, he did not start on the picture until he left for Englefield House in the company of his sponsor Lane on 22 August 1832. He took with him the sketch-book which he had used at Epsom in 1831 and again in East Bergholt in this year (see note following No. 350 [347-1888]), since it is on a page of this book that No. 340 [345-1888] is drawn. Nos. 343 and 344 [1258a-1888 and 1258b-1888], being studies of architectural detail, must have been made on the spot: and it is probable that Nos. 341 and 342 [255-1888 and 1258-1888] were also made there. The man walking with a dog in No. 341 [255-1888] is introduced into the finished picture; and No. 342 [1258-1888] shows the house further away and from an angle not found in any of the other drawings, which are the only recorded ones for this work. \n\nOn 27 March 1833, Constable wrote to his son Charles (original letter in the Victoria and Albert Museum Library): \"I have almost done the large picture of the house, and Mr. Binyon de Bouvoir is much pleased I believe with it. It is called Inglefield House-from a great Battlefield there of the Danes-it is near Reading in Berkshire it looks very bright and cheerful-and all like it who see it\". On 3 April 1833, he reported to Leslie that Lady Morley had said of the picture\" 'How fresh, how dewy, how exhilarating!' I told her half of this, if I could think I deserved it, was worth all the talk and cant about pictures in the world\" (L. ed. S., p. 299). There was a dispute about the hanging of it at the Royal Academy and Constable wrote to Lane \"S[hee] told me it was 'only a <i>picture of a house</i>, and ought to have been put into the Architectural Room'. I told him it was' a picture of a summer morning, <i>including a house</i>' \" (L. ed. S., p. 302). It is interesting to note that this is borne out by Constable's inscription on No. 340 [345-1888]. A disagreement with Mr. Benyon de Beauvoir followed, details of which are given in Lane's letter of 21 March 1834 to Constable, printed by Shirley (loc. cit.). (See also Beckett, IV, pp. 107-17) \n\nThe painting now belongs to Mr. H. A. Benyon of Englefield House, and was lent by him to the exhibition 'The First Hundred Years of the Royal Academy', Burlington House, 1951-2 (No. 231). <i>Pentiment</i> in the foreground whereby cows had been painted out and replaced by deer shows that Constable had met his patron's objection that it \"looked as if he had his farmyard before his Drawing Room windows\". The painting of Englefield House by Milbourne referred to in the note on No. 342 [1258-1888] formerly belonged to the late Mr. Eustace Hoare\n\nNote on Nos. 336-340 and 346-350 [304-1888, 236-1888, 221-1888, 232-1888, 345-1888, 229-1888, 237-1888, 189-1888, 233-1888, 347-1888]\n\nAs the measurements and, where they exist, the watermarks show, Nos. 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 346, 347, 348, 349 and 350 [see above] all come from the same sketch-book, which measures approximately 115 x 190 mm. and consists of Whatman paper of 1831.  The book was first used by Constable, as far as is known, on his visit to Mr. Digby Neave at Epsom in 1831 (Nos. 336 and 337 [304-1888 and 236-1888]). He used it again on his summer visit to East Bergholt in July 1832 (Nos. 338 and 339 [221-1888 and 232-1888]). A drawing in the British Museum (No. L.B. 19a, 112 x 188 mm.) is also dated from East Bergholt on 31 July 1832 and comes from the same sketch-book. He then took it to Englefield House (No. 340 [345-1888]) and the drawing of Theal, Berkshire, made on 25 August 1832, in the British Museum (No. L.B. 25a, 113 x 188 mm.), was made on this visit in the same book. Constable again took it with him to East Bergholt when he attended the funeral there of his friend John Dunthorne on 9 November 1832 (Beckett, I, p. 270) (No. 346 [229-1888]). The undated sheets from the book may be assumed to have been drawn whilst he was on one or other of these expeditions, or made near them in date. In particular, No. 347 [237-1888] may be taken to have been drawn on one of the two visits to East Bergholt, since the subject is so exactly in line with Constable's other studies and paintings of barges on the Stour. It may be presumed that Nos. 348 and 349 [189-1888 and 233-1888] represent scenes in the same vicinity. No. 350 [347-1888] is exceptional in the group, in being carried out in pencil and water-colour. Three undated drawings in the British Museum which appear from their style, subject matter and measurements to be from the same book are: \n\nL.B. 14 Men with a cart. (111 x 181 mm.) \nL.B. 25b House among trees. (112 x 188 mm.) \nL.B. 28a Landscape with trees and cattle. (111 x 187 mm.)\u201d",
