His extensive and varied collection was bought by the South Kensington Museum in 1874 and 1875.\n\nCombination weapons were both objects of curiosity and showcases for the ingenuity of the maker. Many combination weapons combined the growing popularity of firearms with an already proven and familiar design, in this case a curved knife blade.  \n\nIn Europe and Asia from the 1500s there was an explosion of innovative and unusual designs produced to incorporate this new technology, often sponsored by heads of state, but their popularity seems to have been universal. This is a far simpler weapon than many made for princes and nobles. The weapon has to be reversed to turn the blade into a handle for a simple, matchlock activated by a rudimentary touchhole.",
