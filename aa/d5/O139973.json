A screen by the tomb is draped with a length of purple cloth, and an oil burner sits on top of one of three blocks to the right of the steps. Two laurel wreaths decorate the screens either side of the urns. Titled by the artist.

Their work incuded Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, plays by Shaw, Synge, Chekhov, Moliere, Fry, Milton's masque Comus, and exciting versions of Chaucer's  The Pardoner's Tale, and Jonah and the Whale - both adapted by John Crockett, the company's artistic director as well as a dancer and an accomplished artist. This design shows the tomb setting where the young widow Dynamene has incarcerated herself after the death of her husband.\n\nThe Compass Players were based in John Crockett's home, an old house and estate in Gloucestershire, and played wherever they could - in village halls, miners' Institutes and schools across the country, with everything carried in a recycled laundry van called Bertha. It had seats for nine and space behind them for the sets, props, costumes, lighting and sound equipment for the three or four productions for each tour. The entire company acted, stage-managed, lit the show, maintained the costumes and props and put up and struck the set.  A school matinee and an evening show daily was normal.  Hospitality was offered in many places, and gratefully accepted since everyone in the company existed on 15/- per week plus their keep. Company members might find themselves guests in a miner's cottage one night and in a mansion the next, and Compass players never ever forgot the training they gained or the impact their visits had on the many small communities that welcomed them",
