            "public_access_description": "The most important French porcelain factory was founded in 1740 in the royal chateau of Vincennes. In 1756 it was transferred to S\u00e8vres, the other side of Paris, and shortly after was bought by Louis XV. The support and protection of the king and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, enabled it to secure the best artists, sculptors, designers and chemists. S\u00e8vres porcelain soon became the most sought after in Europe. The royal manufactory at S\u00e8vres specialised in luxury porcelains, many of which were destined for the French court.  Each year it displayed its newest models in the king's apartments at Versailles. The factory was very responsive to changes in fashion and introduced many innovations in design and decoration. Its products were admired throughout Europe and its style was widely imitated. During the French Revolution, which brought about a disastrous drop in sales of luxury porcelain, the factory was Nationalised and began producing patriotic wares.\n\nDuring the Consulate and Empire period (1802-15) Napoleon I continued the French royal patronage of the S\u00e8vres manufactory and commissioned large numbers of very expensive works from it for himself, and as presents to further his reputation and diplomacy. This was a revived and lucrative period for the arts industries in France, although the export trade was reduced, due to political conflict, a wealthy French bourgeoisie society emerged which expanded the domestic market for manufacturers like S\u00e8vres. Luxury was once again acceptable and Napoleon commissioned works of art and complete interiors for his Imperial palaces. \n\nThe imagery of the Imperial regime was characterised by strong Neo-classical styles, drawing parallels with Napoleon\u2019s rule and the power of ancient Rome.  Military imagery such as the classical laurel wreathes (honour and victory), are combined on this cup and saucer with the opulence of cornucopia or horns of plenty. The butterfly (here a Marsh Fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia) symbolises both Psyche and the soul and was a recurrent motif on Imperial commissioned decorative arts. The S\u00e8vres factory had produced tablewares with similar butterfly motifs from c.1803. An earlier vase design with butterflies, executed in a similar manner, has been attributed to Alexandre-Th\u00e9odore Brongniart (1739-1813), architect and father of Alexandre Brongniart (1770-1847) Director of the S\u00e8vres factory who was a devoted naturalist, studying fossils and insects. It is possible that the Director encouraged the use of such motifs in the designs. In 1809 S\u00e8vres delivered a large dessert service, the \u2018Marly Rouge\u2019 service, again with central butterfly motifs, to the Chateau Fontainebleau for Napoleon\u2019s use.",
