The complete outfit consisted of a purple/orange two-tone crushed velvet jacket with gold braid trim, black/red two-tone crushed velvet trousers (both by Against All Oz) and these shoes.\n\n\u2018Ragga\u2019 derives from the word \u2018Raggamuffin\u2019, originally a derogatory term for delinquent Jamaican youths. Ragga began in the mid-1980s in Jamaican dancehalls before spreading throughout the African Diaspora. It marked a stark contrast with Rastafarianism through its flamboyant dress and celebration of individual wealth and success. Ragga outfits frequently use layered textures and colour to make a strong visual impact. \n\n\u201cI made [a suit] for myself and then everyone kept asking about it and I ended up making ten more.
