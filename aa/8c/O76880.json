The lid is pierced with a small stake which acts as a simple handle. It is decorated with a guilloche that terminates in scrolls. The rectangular plaque at the end is engraved with a short epigraphic section.   \n\nThe chamfered foot rises from a flat octagonal rim, supporting a low, slanting base.  Each facet of the foot is engraved with triangular panels enclosing foliate scrolls and roundels enclosing palmettes.  A guilloche runs around the slanting, incurving base, topped with an incised, scalloped fillet.\n\nThe well is engraved with epigraphic sections seperated by four animated scrolls and foliate catouches at the rear, either side of the now missing handle. The spout sides are engraved with foliate cartouches and seperated from the well by a band of guilloche on one side and a zig-zag design on the other.",
