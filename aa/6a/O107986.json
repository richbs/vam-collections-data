Instead they were attached to a tape and tied around the waist as separate garments. Worn under the hoops and petticoats, they were accessed through openings in the gown and petticoat seams.\nThis pair of silk satin pockets is somewhat of a mystery, as the lack of decoration makes it very hard to assign a date. The pockets were acquired with a quilted white satin petticoat, and it is assumed they were worn with it. Completely plain, they illustrate an equally attractive alternative to the embroidered examples. Although the tie has been broken and retied, there are few other signs of wear. \nFrom letters, diaries and novels of the 18th century it is clear that pockets often held a wide variety of objects both personal and practical, including letters, money, jewellery, handkerchiefs, sewing kits, mirrors and keys, among other things.",
