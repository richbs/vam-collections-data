Scratched on the back in a nineteenth-century hand: <i>Lord / Maynard</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an unrecorded source by George Salting, (1) and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Foster 1911, pp. 548-9 ('Lawrence Crosse ... is well represented by a <i>Viscount Maynard</i>'); Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 89, no. 82 (as 'undescribed'); Long 1929, p. 108 (as <i>Baron Maynard</i>); Long 1930, p. 16 (as <i>One of the Barons Maynard</i>) ; Reynolds 1959, pl. XI, no. 18 (as 'supposed to be <i>One of the Barons Maynard</i> c. 1690 '); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 13. \n\nThe portrait is difficult to date. On costume it could be as early as the later 1670s, though this is unlikely by the criterion of Cross's stylistic development; and it could be as late as the 1690s. The best dating, on both costume and style, would be in the 1680s when Cross's monogram and the extreme soft stippled manner were well established. \n\nIn the Salting Collection, the sitter was called <i>Viscount Maynard</i>, an impossible identification as Foster was probably the first to realise. Charles, 6th Baron Maynard and 1st Viscount (created 28 October 1766) was not born until about 1690. Foster, followed by Long, therefore altered the identification to <i>Baron Maynard</i> or <i>One of the Barons Maynard</i>, since, depending on the date of the portrait any of the 3rd, 4th or 5th Barons could by their ages have been the sitter. Banastre, 3rd Baron, was born 1642; Henry, 4th Baron, who succeeded in March 1717/18, was born about 1673; his brother Grey, 5th Baron, who succeeded in December 1742, was born about 1680. However, Henry's elder brother William was born about 1666, and he, as the heir apparent of Banastre until his death on 8 March 1716/17, could appropriately have been painted by Cross; his age would accord with the optimum dating for the portrait. But, in the absence 'of a supportive provenance and of any other information to link the miniature with the Maynards, it is probably better to let speculation rest. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4621.\" ",
