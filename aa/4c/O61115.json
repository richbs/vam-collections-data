The moment shown is possible the last dance of the evening, with Misses Purzini and Annie Clarke with Messrs R. Vallis and Victor Andre in the Quadrille Eccentrique.  \nThis was the first painting purchased by Cyril Beaumont, who admired Allinson's sense of colour.  Beaumont describes the scene as 'Vauxhall Gardens', which may be an assumption, but the subject is certainly an evocation of the London pleasure gardens of the early 19th century.  \nThe painting came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
