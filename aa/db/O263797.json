Similar gold flowers are in rows on the red ground.\n\nThe border is of pale blue cream silk. Irregularly shaped linked cartouches contain a 'wheel' of eight spokes around eight points of a start, containing a large rosette with a small gold rosette as centre. The five pieces between the cartouches are filled with flowers and leaves. To either side is a guard stripe with a flat continuous 'cloud band' in yellow, on a red ground, with a floral motif in gold thread. This stripe is flanked by very narrow stripes in green and cream.\n\nAt the lower end is sewn a long, plain gold fringe, bound at the top in pale blue and yellow silk.",
