It shows both sides of a steep cobbled street with a commanding view over the centre of Bristol. It is made by the calotype process, a paper negative process invented by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1839.\nCalvert Jones, who took this photograph, was introduced to photography by a cousin of Talbot and by close friends, who lived near to Jones in South Wales. \n\nJones' work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his new skill in photography with his experience as a watercolorist. Jones' artistic eye is evident in the composition: the geometric pattern of the railings, which cross diagonally and provide a strong foreground element to the sloping street and distant spires and towers of the city centre.",

Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produce a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist. \n\nThis photograph is one a two-part panorama showing both sides of a steep cobbled street with a commanding view over Bristol. Jones' artistic eye is evident in the composition; the geometric pattern of the railings, which cross diagonally, provides a strong  foreground element to the steeply sloping street and the rising spires and towers of the distant city centre.",
