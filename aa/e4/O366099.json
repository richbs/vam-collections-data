The mantle is knee-length cut in four panels, and the sides are angled to accommodate a wide side hoop. There are arm slits bound with black ribbon and headed by a small bow. The hood is large, pleated in at the crown and pleated in rather random fashion in to the high neckband through which is threaded a ribbon tye.\n\nThe lining is of fine black silk and traces of interlining composed of compressed sheep's wool were found around the hem, around the neck and armhole slits, but not round the front or on any other seams, suggesting that it was used to give slight additional weight where needed. This is considered to have been narrow because such small traces were found. The lining hangs unequally at the centre back.",
