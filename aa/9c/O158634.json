In the centre is a rosette with four pairs of leaves and a fine 4-lobed medallion around it; beyond this is a frame of 2 cone motifs and 2 flowers in profile linked by 4 leaves and finally a line forming a lobed lozenge.  At the top and bottom of this lozenge there is a trefoil or acorn motif leading into a larger and more elaborate version.  A pair of curving stems emerge and sweep into the corners and down the sides, meeting in a rosette on either side of the central lozenge.  These stems bear many leaves and a large flower and there is a bird towards each corner.  Each stem leads into a curving stem in silver and dark blue bearing small blue and pink flowers.  In some oft he leaves lines of pink silk are worked among the metal thread. Some of the metal thread stems have been worked over padding.",
