It wears the elaborate costume of the late 19th century Konbaung court, with its shaped, tailored and sumptuously decorated garments. Worn layer upon layer the resulting costume, when seen from a distance, created the image of a legendary heavenly apsaras, or celestial nymph.\n\nString puppetry, with figures similar to this, has been popular in Burma (now Myanmar) since the latter part of the 17th century. Despite of its comparatively late development in Burmese cultural history, puppetry (yok-thei) preceded drama and has not only influenced it, but has probably proven to be more popular than staged productions with actors. Puppet shows were patronized by the Burmese kings, who had a Court official who was in charge of performances. The themes of the plays were taken from the Jataka stories, which recount the Buddha's previous incarnations, as well as incidents in Burmese history. In addition to providing entertainment, the puppet shows had a moral element, such as the triumph of virtue over vice, and acted as an outlet for popular comment on current affairs.",
