As can be ascertained from the registered files, the bequest entered the museum in that year. In his introduction to <i> A Descriptive Catalogue of the Historical Collection of Water-colour Paintings in the South Kensington Museum </i> (London: Chapman na d Hall, 1876) Samuel Redgrave also gives the date of the bequest as 1868 as does Kauffman in; Kauffmann, C.M.<i>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, II. 1800-1900</i> (Victoria and Albert Museum, London: 1973). However in more recent publications the date has been given as 1869, which is the year in which the objects were catalogued.\n\nThis is one of three portraits of members of the family of Chauncy Hare Townshend which he bequeathed to the South Kensington Museums as part of his collection in 1869. These portraits include a portrait by Thompson of his sister, made when she had married and was Mrs. Elrington (Inventory number 1425-1869), a portrait of Chauncy Hare Townshend and his sister as Children (Inventory 1413-1869) and this portrait of his father Henry Hare Townsend (Inventory number 1414-1869)., both by Samuel Woodhouse.\n\nHistorical significance: Samuel Woodhouse exhibited at the RA from 1784-1815. He worked in London producing portraits and landscapes. He is documented in Dublin from 1809-15.\n\nThis portrait is of Henry Hare Townsend (1765-1827) of Busbridge Hall, Godalming and Walpole, Norfolk. His maternal grandfather was Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine; his Father was the politician and Lord Mayor of London (1772-3), James Townsend. He was one of the founding members of Godalming School in 1812. His son was the poet and collector Chauncy Hare Townshend (1798-1868). His son changed the spelling of his surname by adding an 'h' when he inherited his father's estates in 1827.\n\nHenry Hare Townsend sits in front of a tree which creates a dark backdrop. To the left this foliage opens up to a distant view of hills and fields. He is accompanied by his dog. The dog is a pointer, a breed used for hunting. The pointer is shown on the right of the composition, jumping up and placing its front paws on its master's lap while Henry Hare Townsend caresses the dog with his left hand. In his right hand Henry Hare Townsend holds a rifle. \n\nThe setting combined with the rifle and dog convey Townsend's role as a landowner. This composition follows earlier examples such as Gainsborough's portraits Mr. and Mrs. Andrews from 1750 and John Plampin from 1757. Townsend's status is also emphasized in the country dress that he wears.  His cream waistcoat and black jacket are cut to the waist and his long breeches date the painting to circa 1810.\n\nThere is also a painting by Woodhouse of Chauncy Hare Townshend and his Sister Charlotte as children (Inventory number 1413-1869) dating from circa 1810, which acquired by the V&amp;A as part of the Townshend bequest. In this portrait, brother and sister are shown outside whilst Chauncy appears to survey the family estate. It is possible that these portraits were commissioned at the same time, showing Henry Hare Townsend as owner of Busbridge Hall and Chauncy in the second portrait as his heir.",
