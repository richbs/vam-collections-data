The legs share with other Salisbury chairs and tables a distinctive square section despite the fact that the side stretchers are jointed to them at an awkward angle. Likewise the arms on Salisbury chairs are always tenoned into the front face of the rear uprights, rather than the side or bridging the corner. Other Salisbury characteristics are: the prominent lunette crest, the arm supports fitted to the arms with a turned tenon housed in a drilled mortice-hole, the form of the arms, which do not curve inwards to enclose the sitter (unlike Scottish chairs). A convincing example of a Salisbury chair, see Victor Chinnery (Oak Furniture, 1979) pp. 448-454\n\n\u2018Mr. Harold Peto\u2019s Collection\u2019 by \u2018M.J.\u2019 in Country Life, April 10th, 1926 (vol.
