These wallets are all personalised with gold and silver embroidery which states the owner's name and the date and place of purchase.\n\nTime & Place\nConstantinople, situated on the Bosphorus Straights, was the capital  of the Byzantine empire for 1,100 years.  After the Ottoman Turks captured the city in 1453 they renamed it Istanbul.  However, Europeans usually referred to the metropolis by its former name. It was a shopper's paradise, crammed with boutiques that sold sophisticated luxuries, such as this leather wallet.\n\nPeople\nWe do not know anything about Robert St Leger. The early date of 1705 makes it unlikely that he was a tourist.  However, many English merchants were active in the Ottoman empire at this time.  For example, in Aleppo, Syria, the English had the largest khan (warehouse) of all the European traders. 'Factors' or representatives of the English trading houses tended to be younger sons of wealthy families, looking to make a fortune in exchanging such commodities as English wool for Iranian silk.  Perhaps this was Robert St Leger's occupation.  He may have commissioned the wallet as a memento of his stay abroad on returning home to Britain via Constantinople.",
