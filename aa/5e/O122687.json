The S\u00e8vres chemists' achievements in developing new porcelain and colours in the 1880s were closely followed by the development of crystalline glazes as used to decorate this vase. The first successful experiments were made by Royal Copenhagen but S\u00e8vres, which had made the initial discovery, quickly caught up and exhibited crystal glazes at Paris in 1900 on some of the largest stoneware vases ever made in one piece by the factory.",
