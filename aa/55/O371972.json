            "public_access_description": "During the Tudor period heraldic motifs and mottoes were often incorporated  into the interior and exterior decoration of a building.  Craftsmen exploited the  motifs for their intrinsic decorative qualities, though it was the information that  they conveyed about the status and wealth of the owner that was most  important.  This panel would have originally formed part of a richly painted and  gilded scheme of carved wall decoration.\n\nThe panel is one of a set of four which are said to have come from Windsor  Castle. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547)  encouraged the use of heraldry in the  decoration of his residences, as well as in the dress of his subjects and  servants.  At Hampton Court Palace  the principal decorative motifs were the  coats of arms and badges of the King and Queen.  Set in windows, moulded on  ceilings, embroidered on hangings and upholstery and carved in stone above  gate and doorways, they had to be changed each time Henry remarried.\n\nDuring Henry VIII's reign legislation was passed relating to the use of armorial  devices.  To ensure that they used the correct forms, carvers and painters  owned and consulted pattern books.  Unfortunately, none of these books  survives.  However, there are surviving royal records of arms and heraldic  beasts, for example, those by Sir Thomas Wriothesley (died 1534), Henry VIII's  Garter King of Arms.  These records would have been used to give advice to  painters involved in the decoration of the royal palaces.",
