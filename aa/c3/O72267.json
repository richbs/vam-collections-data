Robinson was Curator of Sculpture at the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) and acquired many important works for the collection in the 1850s and 1860s. On the reverse of the actual medal the artist has used as inspiration the hands from the carved figures in the Annunciation by Arnolfo di Cambio of about 1300 in a relief style inspired by the Donatello marble relief Ascension with Christ giving keys to St Peter (7629-1861). Robinson bought this work for the Museum in 1861 (see inv.no.7563-1861). During the design process the artist explores and reworks various ideas. This is a model from which Powell made trial versions in plaster before the design was finalised.",
