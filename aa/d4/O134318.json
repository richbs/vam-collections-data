His uncle, a painter himself, took him frequently to the atelier of his close friend Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's (1791-1824), whose subject-matters, especially the horses, would have a long lasting influence on him. He later studied with L\u00e9on Cogniet (1794-1880). He received medals from the Salons of 1834, 1844 and 1848, the Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1857, and commissions from the Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans, Queen Victoria and Napoleon III.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Dedreux' mature style. It shows a young Scottish girl with a hound set in a Romantic landscape. Dedreux' art was influenced by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricualt but also British artists as John Constable and Joshua Reynolds. His oeuvre responds somehow to the realist movement but borrows also some components from the Romanticists.",

It shows a young Scottish girl standing against a fence and holding a basket while a hound stands at her feet. The lone figure starring in the distance and the mountainous landscape are reminiscent of the Romantic paintings which associate the human feelings to the changing atmospheric conditions. \nThis painting belongs to a series of similar subject matters involving young ladies and hounds set in a Romantic landscape. It was probably executed during one of Dedreux stays in England, between 1844 and 1859. The artist became soon praised by Queen Victoria and the aristocracy and received important commissions from the Ellesmere, Egerton, Seymour and Wallace\u2026 \nThis painting illustrates one of Dedreux' two favourite subjects: hounds and horses. The museum also owns an example of an equestrian portrait by Dedreux (see 745-1902). \nDedreux was a successful painter and his art was deeply influenced by the work of such British artist as George Stubbs (1724-1806), George Morland (1763-1804), John Constable (1776-1837) and Landseer (1795-1880) while his Parisian friends included Gustave Moreau (1826-1898), Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1819-1856) and Rosa Bonheur (1822-1899) among others. His style even influenced to some extent Edgar Degas (1834-1917), who kept a series of his horses and horsemen studies as models for his own compositions.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
