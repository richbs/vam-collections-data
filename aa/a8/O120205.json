From the mid-1830s until the early 1900s several Staffordshire factories specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This represents the actor Charles Kean (1811-1868) as Rolla in the melodrama Pizarro carrying to safety the infant son of the Spaniard Alonzo and his Inca wife. It was modelled on a print published by the toy theatre publisher A. Park.\n\nA great success when first staged at London's Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1799, Pizarro was often revived in the 19th century. Adapted by Richard Brinsley Sheridan from the play The Spaniard in Peru by the German Augustus von Kotzebue, it concerned  the Spaniard Francisco Pizarro waging a war of conquest against the Inca Empire of Peru.  Audiences loved the exotic sets and costumes, and actors found the role of the Inca Rolla, who dies saving the child, a suitably heroic part. Charles Kean played Rolla at the Princess's Theatre in 1856, repeating the success his father Edmund Kean had with the role at Drury Lane in 1819.",
