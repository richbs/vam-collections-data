Bannister Hall, near Preston, Lancashire, where this fabric was printed, was the leading works for woodblock furniture chintzes and set the fashion for other factories. Printing was carried out for London linen-drapers, such as Richard Ovey of Covent Garden, who from 1790 to 1831 was the leading London merchant for 'furniture prints'. He commissioned designs from skilled artists and sent them to Lancashire or to Carlisle in Cumbria to be printed.\n\nThis printed cotton bears part of Ovey's stamp. The original design for it is inscribed with its name, \"The One Stripe Needlework Flower Pot Chintz Border\", and \"R.Ovey, 26th June 1805\".",
