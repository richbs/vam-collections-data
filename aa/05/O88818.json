The cross is placed on a rectangular ground and has a triple moulded border. Christ is shown with the legs together resting on a suppedaneum and arms rigidly outstretched, with his long hair falling on his left shoulder. He was once bearded and has a cruciform nimbus. He wears loin cloth. To the left and right are Longinus and Stephaton, both nimbed, stand holding the lance and sponge. Above the arms of the cross are two angels bearing wreaths and flying towards the cross. Above the head of Christ is the Hand of God (Dextera Dei).\nNineteen holes pierced in the corners and in the background of the cross seem to indicate that the ivory has been attached to a book-cover or a reliquary; a larger hole pierced diagonally at the top suggests that at some time it may have been used as a pectoral cross.\nThe eyes were formerly inlaid with jet beads, one of which remains in the left eye of Longinius.",

            "public_access_description": "This panel representing the Crucifixion was probably made in the late 10th century or early 11th century in England. The representation of the Crucifixion with Longinus and Stephaton alone, without the Virgin and St. John, as on this panel, is not common on ivories of the tenth or twelfth centuries. The composition of this panel is characteristic of the representations in Celtic art. A unique feature would be that the nimbi are given to Longinus and Stephaton.\nNineteen holes pierced in the corners and in the background of the cross seem to indicate that the ivory has been attached to a book-cover or a reliquary. A larger hole pierced diagonally at the top - for a chain or cord - suggests that subsequently it may have been used as a pectoral cross.",
