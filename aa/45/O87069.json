            "physical_description": "The painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, shows a lady standing in profile facing left holding a golden wine flask in her left hand tipping it towards a small golden cup held between her hennaed thumb and forefinger of her right hand.  She stands on a dark green grassy ground made up of gentle curving mounds highlighted in a lighter green on top of which are growing small clumps of white and red flowering plants.  The figure stands out against a duck-egg blue background which rises up to a notional greenish sky with orange and purple streaks picked out with light brush strokes in gold in a looping fashion below a lighter band of  green  overlaid with a whitish pigment.\n\nThe lady is dressed in a  white transparent gauze <i>peshwaz</i> with long tight sleeves.  Its skirt is paned with gold bands. A pink gauzy <i>odhani</i> with a gold edging is draped over her head and round the upper part of her body which is painted a brownish colour. Gold-tipped lappets fall from her left shoulder down her bodice, but on the right hand side they are depicted hanging loosely over the <i>odhani</i>. She is wearing silvery grey <i>paijama</i> with a polka dot pattern of  green leafy sprigs. On her feet she is wearing a pair of red slippers with gold spotty decoration. She is bejewelled with strings of pearls and a gemstone pendant round her neck, of which two rows hang down below her waistband, pearl nose studs, pearl earrings in her ear-lobe and along the outer edge of her ear, a pendant pearl hair ornament hanging on her forehead, a row of pearl anklets on each foot, an upper armband of pearls and red gemstone,  pearl and gold bracelets on her wrists, and gold finger and thumb rings. \n\nThe painting is framed with two inner borders: the inner one of a buff-coloured paper with a stylised foliate scroll (of a similar design seen in the frame of the page opposite, (IS.48:31/B-1956) in gold edged in gold and black margins and the outer one of dark blue paper with a gold stylised floral pattern also edged in gold and black lines with a blue outer outline on the ivory-coloured ground  of the outer border.  This main border is decorated with alternate red poppies and pink lilies. Strips of buff-coloured paper are stuck on the outer edges of the page with a white inner outline with a beige paper strip of the same colour paper as the opposite page, as a gutter for the binding which has been pasted over the buff-coloured margin, the top half of which has largely been abraded.",
