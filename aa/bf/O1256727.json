Rupert  took up photography in the 1860s when it was still a relatively new art form and was elected to the  Photographic Society of London in 1869. An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he later contributed to  photographic exhibitions.  Rupert's favourite subject was Beatrix herself.  Photography was an expensive and  laborious process yet she appears to have endured patiently the elaborate choreography and the camera\u2019s  uncomfortably long exposure. Rupert's prolific legacy of several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial  account of Beatrix\u2019s life from infancy to marriage.\n\nPrior to her marriage to William Heelis (1871-1945) in 1913, Beatrix was expected to accompany her parents and brother on extended summer holidays to Scotland and the Lake District.  In 1909 the family rented Broad  Leys, a house near Bowness on Windermere.  While there Beatrix worked on her new story, The Tale of Ginger and Pickles, and regularly sent parcels of drawings to her publisher, Harold Warne. Beatrix was also in the process of buying a new farm in Sawrey, Castle Farm, and took the advice from her local solicitor, William Heelis, whom she later married.",
