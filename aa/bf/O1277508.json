For this pantomime, opening as usual at Drury Lane Theatre on Boxing Night, the scenery designed by William Beverley and his assistants Messrs Pitt, McLauchlan and Yarnold included The Retreat of Romance (by Sunset), Willow Island of the Drachenfels on the Rhine (by Moonlight), a Farm and Romantic Landscape in Silesia with Distant View of the Valley of the Riesen-ge-burge, the Palace of Number Nip in the centre of the Earth, the Interior of a Shoemaker's Cottage (by Flat Candlelight), the Trysting Place of the Water Fairies, and the Giant Mountain.  The scenes in the Harlequinade after the Transformation Scene included Old Street, New Street, Clown's Chambers, a Fairy Fair and Foresters' Fete, and Bird's Stone and Marble Gallery, Euston Road.\n\nThe play starred the dwarf Percy Roselle as the Gnome King Number Nip, and featured a hundred dancers as the Nixes, or sprites in German mythology who were half human and half fish, who also danced as fairies and dolls.   Despite its length, the pantomime was not the only item on the bill which opened at 7pm with the 'laughable farce' The Day after the Wedding.  The poster and playbills for this production both advertise the 'morning performances' or 'matinees' at 2pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays during January.",
