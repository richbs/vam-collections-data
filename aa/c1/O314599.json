This is an example, where the terracotta was cast in a mould which had been created to reproduce the statuette a number of times. However, as frequently with Carrier-Belleuse's work, the clay was then worked on while it was wet, before firing, to give it the appearance of having been freshly modelled. Assistants were used in his studio to carry out some of the work, notably Rodin at the start of his career. Small statuettes such as these would have been intended for the steadily growing middle-class market and their reproduction was commercially successful in this context. \n\nBy depicting Night as an allegorical female figure, Carrier-Belleuse was following a long tradition. But most earlier examples are modestly covered in drapery. The implicit eroticism of this particular work would have been acceptable in a private context.",
