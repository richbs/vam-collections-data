London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Camille Silvy   French, born 1835 (active 1858-68)\nProclamation for the Army for Italy   1859\nPhototype (Joubert's process)\nImage size 139 X 112 mm   Mus. no. Ph. 230-1982   Purchase\nMount Lettered: 'Phototype Process/Photographed from Nature by C.Silvy / This print in Permanent Ink / is presented by Mr F. Joubert / to the \nSubscribers of the Photographic Journal / London 15th January 1860'</i>\n\nThis print did not, in the event, appear until June 1860.  The reason appears to have been that a certain amount of light was required to make the prints by Joubert's process and a total of 3,000 was required.  Joubert was a French engraver working in London.  Like many other inventors at this period he sought a method of accurate and rapid photographic reproduction.  He also patented a method of making glass pictures which made the production of photographic stained glass windows seem to be a possibility.  His Phototype process was much admired but no-one came forward to reward the inventor, as he had reasonable hopes would occur, and the process remained - and remains - secret.  It appears to have much in common with the collotype.  A relatively rapid photo-mechanical process like Phototype could have been used in the publication of topical photographs.  Joubert chose to reproduce a photograph by his associate Camille Silvy - who was strongly interested in multiple-production - which has all the characteristics of a news photograph.  Parisian workmen are shown - apparently posed by Silvy - looking at a proclamation about the sending of the French Imperial army to Italy in the interest of the Northern Italian states against Austria.  Louis Napoleon's invasion received liberal and radical approval and conservative opposition and could be regarded as a turning point in the internal politics of the Second Empire.\"",
