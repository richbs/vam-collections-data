The brass wire used to delineate and contain the enamels is thick, and the enamels are heavily applied and semi-matt. The background decoration is of stylised clouds and abstract floral motifs. On the exterior there are four Chinese philosophers. On the interior there is a dragon. Curiously, the interior of the bowl is very rough and appears to have been only partially polished.\n \nA label on the base of the bowl reads \u2018Bowes Collection, Enamels No.1\u2019. James Lord Bowes (1834-1899) acquired a large collection of Japanese art, including numerous pieces of cloisonn\u00e9 enamels. He was one of the earliest of collectors in the West to write in detail on the subject. His extremely adamant views about the history and development of Japanese cloisonn\u00e9 were almost all totally wrong. Bowes classified Japanese enamels into groups which, under his scheme, placed many objects in the period 1700-1800 or even 1600-1700. His views were criticised by many of his contemporaries for being totally out of keeping with what was already known at the time. Nevertheless, many of his ideas persisted right up to the late 20th century.",
