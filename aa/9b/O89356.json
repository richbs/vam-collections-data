The form can be dated from the Zhou dynasty (1030-256 BC). An upturned toe with a cloud head shape became a fashion during the Sui and Tang dynasties and remained a feature of men's shoes until the twentieth century. The platform sole made of layers of felt or cotton cloth increased the stature of the wearer and raised the foot off cold tile floors.\" (Huang Hengfu and Chen Juanjuan, 1994)\n\nThe relatively flat soles may suggest the shoes were for Han men.\n\nThe uncertainty over the material of the piping is according to Wrigglessworth (1991).",
