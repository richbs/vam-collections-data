Aglaia was Constantine's sister, Marie Spartali (Mrs W J Stillman), whom the artist considered the most beautiful of the Greek community surrounding the Ionides, and was also his 'model' for the painting 'Dance' (1870), and Mary Zambaco, the grand-daughter of Constantine, whose exotic looks and her misfortune caused Bume-Jones to fall in love with her. He embodied his distress caused by this attachment in the painting 'Phyllis and Demophoon' (1870), to which he gave the epigraph 'Dic mihi quod feci? Nisi non sapienter amavi' (Tell me, what have I done? Except that I have not loved wisely).\n \n'The Mill' however, which he took twelve years to complete has that calm, dreamlike quality characteristic of many of the artist's works. The <i>Times</i>' critic commented when it was first exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1882, ' ... it reflects its truth only from certain mental states'. Bume-Jones admitted that the painting made a deliberate reference, to be understood by 'the few people I care for' to his Italian masters, to the 'Primavera' and to the bathing figures in Piero's 'Baptism'. The mill pool, as <i>Ion</i> suggests, may be a recollection of the mill race at Alberga, or of the three mills near Oxford within a mile of each other at Milton, Steventon and Sutton Courtney.\n \nDavid Cecil, comparing Bume-Jones and Samuel Palmer in his <i>Visionary and Dreamer</i>, London, 1969, writes that '\"The Mill\" lacks both the strangeness and immediacy of a vision. Rather it seems to depict a pensive daydream deliberately evoked ... For his life is an illustration of ... the predicament in which an imaginative painter found himself if he had the bad luck to be born in the 19th century'. \n\nA wall tapestry after the painting, illustrated in the <i>Art Journal</i>, 1910, worked on linen in crewels by the Royal School of Art Needlework, omits the bathing figures in the background.\n\nJean Hamilton\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill. (chiefly col.) ; 30 cm.\nThe following excerpt is from the Scolar Press, 'Henry James: Essays on Art and Drama', edited by Peter Rawlings (Aldershot, 1996): \"Mr Burne Jones's other large picture, which he has called, simply, we suppose, to give it a label of some kind, At the Mill, is in the opposite key. It represents - But such a beginning is rash, for it would be by no means easy to say what it represents. Suffice it being that three very pretty young women, in old Italian dresses, are slowly dancing together in a little green garden, on the edge of a mill-pond, on the further side of which several men, very diminutive figures, are about to enter, or about to quit, the bath. To the right, beneath a quaint loggia, a fourth young woman, the least successful of the group, is making music for her sisters. The color is deep, rich, glowing, exceedingly harmonious, and both in this respect and in its being, in feeling and expression, an echo of early Italianism, the picture has an extraordinary sweetness. It is very true that I have heard it called idiotic; but there is a sad want of good-humour in that. it is equally true that I have not the least idea who the young women are, nor what period of history, what time and place, the painter has had in his mind. His dancing maidens are exceedingly graceful, innocent, maidenly : they belong to the land of fancy, and to the hour of reverie! When one considers them, one really feels that there is a want of discretion and of taste in attempting to talk about Mr Burne Jones's pictures at all, much more in arguing and wrangling about them. They are there to care for if one will, and to leave to others if one cannot. The great charm of the work I have just mentioned is, perhaps, that to many persons it will seem impregnated with the love of Italy. If you have certain impressions, certain memories of that inestimable land, you will find it full of entertainment. I speak with no intention of irreverence when I say that I think it is delightfully amusing. It amuses me that it should be just as it is, - just as pointless as a twilight reminiscence, as irresponsible as a happy smile. The quaintly-robed maidens, moving together in measure, and yet seeming to stand still on the grass; the young men taking a bath just near them, and yet the oddity being no oddity at all ; the charming composition of the background, the picturesque feeling, the innocence, the art, the color, the mixture of originality and imitation, - all these things lift us out of the common. Sweet young girls of long ago, - no-one paints them like Mr Burne Jones. The only complaint I have to make of him is one cannot express one's appreciation of him without seeming to talk in the air\".",
