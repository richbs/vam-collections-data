            "physical_description": "Short-sleeved jacket, woven silk satin and metal thread, trimmed with tablet woven silk and metal thread braid, lined with resist dyed and block- printed plain weave cotton.\nMulti-pieced, and badly sewn in places, satin with side inserts and folded sleeves showing the pattern inverted. The jacket has a long V-shaped front opening with 2 non-original pink silk thread buttons on the left hand side [no loops on the right]. The fabric has two slight colour variations.  The garment is formed on one back panel seamed at the shoulders with many variously shaped inserts back and front in a very similar fabric but with light colour variations. The sleeves are elbow length left open under the arm.  The edges [front, hem, sleeve ends etc.] are trimmed with a black silk braid with details in metal thread around a yellow silk core, this was probably added later with the printed cotton lining, as careless work/sewing.\nMai n Fabric: crimson/madder red satin patterned with composite botehs facing in alternate direction in off-set rows.  Each boteh is outlined in metal thread, silver strip around a yellow silk core and contains a light blue flowering stem outlined in grey.  In between each boteh is a curving leafy stem echoing the boteh curve in the same metal thread.  Twill binding.\nWarp: crimson red silk, Z-twist\nWeft: crimson red, light blue, light grey, silk and silver strip open S-wound on deep yellow silk core which may originally have been orange.\nThe pieces of silk with colour variations have a black outlined in the inner boteh spray.\nBraid: black silk with small arrowheads in metal thread, silver strip close S-wound on yellow silk core. The outer edge of the braid has loops caught with silver strip wound around an orange silk core.\nLining: plain weave cotton with a resist-dyed mustard yellow ground patterned with a block printed oval floral design repeated in offset rows.  The motif has green leaves and a single stem holding a carnation in white and two reds with a smaller red blossom either side underneath, and surmounted by a purple iris.",
