Originally designed and made for the Green Dining Room in the Victoria and Albert Museum, it was one of the first public refreshment rooms in any museum. The buffet was not functional but was designed as a piece of decorative furniture, with a May Day theme, echoing the painted panels showing the months of the year, which decorated the walls of the Dining Room. These were painted by a female student in the porcelain class of the South Kensington Art School, now the Royal College of Art, and incorporated into the buffet, made by Gillow &amp; Co., a prominent firm of cabinet-makers.",
