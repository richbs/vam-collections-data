The Stem of Jesse issues from his chest. To his left stands a saint or prophet, encircled by a branch of the Tree of Jesse. He wears a gown and a robe draped from the left shoulder and carries a closed book with a prominent clasp in his left hand and an unidentifiable emblem in his right.\n\nThe whole of the top of the panel is missing. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Jesse's garment is lined with red and edged with gold, as is the garment of the standing figure. Jesse's shoes are red. The tree is gilded. The back of the panel at the bottom has been cut away. There is one lead plug in the fragment with a latten wire attached.",
