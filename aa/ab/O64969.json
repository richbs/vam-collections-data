            "historical_context_note": "This tankard bears the arms of Henry St John, MP (1652-1742) of Battersea, Surrey, before he was created Viscount St John in 1716. In 1684, the young St John along with a Colonel Webb, was found guilty of murdering Sir William Elscott in the Globe Tavern in Fleet Street at a public supper. They were tried on three statutes of murder, stabbing and manslaughter on the 11 December 1684. As St John's family was rich and not well connected at court, he was pardoned in exchange for the large fine of \u00a316,000, half of which was paid to Charles II and the other half divided between \"two ladies that were in great favour\". \nJacob Bodendick was born in Limburg-an-Lahn, and, after his arrival in London in 1660, was one of a small number of alien goldsmiths working under direct royal patronage (see Philippa Glanville: 'The Bowes Cup: A Stuart Race Prize?' in The Burlington Magazine, June 1995).  Others in this elite group included Christian Van Vianen, the Utrecht-trained goldsmith who was brought to London specifically by Charles I and returned after the Restoration, and Wolfgang Howzer, a Zurich craftsman and skilled chaser.  Indeed, the goldsmith-banker Thomas Fowle employed both Bodendick and Howzer as chasers in the mid-1660s.  Their presence in the capital was an indication of the value, which sophisticated, wealthy patrons set on highly-wrought, costly and stylish silver, and that this clientele was looking across the Channel for supreme achievement in the craft.  The Goldsmiths' Company found this influx of foreigners most alarming, and tried to prevent them from registering their marks so that they could not work legally.  However, they were forced to accept Bodendick's mark in 1664 by order of Charles II.\nThe design has been identified as two scenes from the Punic Wars, taken from the 1672 publication of <font -i>Silicus Italicus</font>, translated by Thomas Ross.",
