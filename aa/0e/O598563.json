An engraver by that name is recorded as an engraver and copperplate printer based on Castle Street in Liverpool in John Pendred's <u>The London and country printers, booksellers and stationers vade mecum</u>, published in 1785.\n\nThe following year an engraver called Thomas Wheatcroft, \"formerly of Liverpool\", is recorded in the Lancashire Online Parish Records as having died at the age of 29 in Lancashire, where he was buried in the church of St Mary, Walton on the Hill, on 11 July 1786. It is possible that this may be a different Thomas Wheatcroft, because an earlier record, also on the Lancashire Online Parish Records shows that Thomas Wheatcroft, engraver, and his wife Ellen had a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1783 (born 23 October and baptised 19 November 1783), and their address is given as Queen Street rather than Castle Street. This does not preclude the possibility that the Wheatcrofts moved in the next couple of years.\n\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam (January 2012)",
