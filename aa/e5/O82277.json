But in her book Hilliard and Oliver (1983, pp. 182-3), Mary Edmond argues that although the inscription is by Norgate this does not mean that he was the painter of the miniature. The style of the painting indicates that the miniature is probably by Peter Oliver. He was a friend and possibly a cousin of Norgate. The inscription identifies the sitter as Judith Norgate (born Lanier).",

(1)  A close copy, attributed on the basis of the present miniature to Norgate, was in the collection of Miss M Lawson-Tancred (2) and is reproduced in colour in Foskett 1972, vol.I, pl. V, together with two other examples of portrait miniatures and an example of an illuminated coat of arms.  The hand in the latter limnings is not necessarily the same as in this <i>Judith Lanier</i>, and though clearly competent, it is not that of as deft and deeply accustomed a practitioner as Peter Oliver.  Sharing a flat blue background with the coats of arms, they suggest, however, that Norgate may have painted miniatures at least for recreation or amusement as his words in the opening paragraphs of <i>Miniatura</i> indicate. (3) \n \nIt was Mary Edmond, working on the ramifications of the Harding and Lanier families during the 1970s, who realised that the inscription on the back of this miniature did not mean that the portrait was by Norgate.  She advanced the suggestion that it was by Peter Oliver, a friend and possibly cousin of the Laniers (4) and close associate of Norgate, and the obvious artist for the family to commission.  Her suggestion is certainly right, for the technique - especially in the flesh-painting and the red-curtain background - is unmistakably the of the Oliver and the only possible question comes from the fact that at this date, which is c.1616, distinction between the hands of Isaac and Petter Oliver is difficult if not impossible.  Comparison with the earlier (perhaps c.1610) portrait of Elizabeth Harding, Mrs Isaac Oliver, at Welbeck Abbey, shows how similar to Isaac's work, in respect of both iconography and execution, this portrait is.  Goulding (5) incidentally recalls that the identification of <i>Mrs Oliver</i> depends on an inscription in the hand of Bernard Lens, and that it was challenged by Walpole in the <i>Anecdotes</i> who considered <i>Mrs Oliver</i> to be the finest work of Peter Oliver, and to represent Peter's wife Anne.  Peter Oliver's wife was the sister of his father's wife, so they probably resembled one another; they may even have looked quite like Judith Lanier, for the relationships between the Hardings and Laniers were also close. (6) \n \nJudith Lanier, baptised at Holy Trinity, Minories, in December 1590, was the sister of Nicholas Lanier, a flautist at Court, who produced a distinguished musical family including his namesake, his grandson Nicholas, subsequently Master of the King's Music to Charles I.  The date of her marriage to Norgate is not known.  She died and was buried at St.Martin-in-the-Fields on 16 February 1617/18.  It is interesting that her husband thought she was two years younger than in fact she was. \n \n1 See Norgate, <i>Miniatura</i>. \n2 Sold Sotheby's 5 July 1984, now Huntington Library and Art Gallery, California. \n3 See Edmond 1983, p.183. \n4 Ibid., p.184. \n5 Goulding 1914-15, p.67, no.22, pl.VI. \n6 Edmond 1983.\"",
