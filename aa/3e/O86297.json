It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAcrobats performed in early 20th century variety as regularly as they appeared in circus. Comedy acrobatic acts were obviously popular in Hanley. Morris & Morris, a similar act also sketched by George Cooke, had been on the bill the previous week. The Five Olracs, described as \u2018comedy acrobats\u2019, were on the same bill.",
