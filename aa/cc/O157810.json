A loyal supporter of his step-father, he took part in a number of notable battles. He was married in 1806 to Augusta Amelia, daughter of the Elector Maximilien III, whom Napoleon elevated to royal status as the first king of Bavaria. For much of his career, Eug\u00e8ne was viceroy of Italy but following the overthrow of Napoleon, he took refuge in Munich where he died at the age of 43.\n\nThe cameo was carved by Giovanni Beltrami (1779-1854), trained as a stone-cutter under the renowned Giovanni Pichler. He was famed for feats such as cutting twenty figures on a single stone and producing a miniature version of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper on a topaz. He worked for a number of European monarchs, including the empress of Austria. Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais commissioned several portraits from him, one of which is set in this box. Charles Truman has identified the goldsmith as being Nicolas Lecoufle.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
