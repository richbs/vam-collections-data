It was made at a time when vases were enormously popular. The Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) and his competitors exploited and promoted this fashion, Wedgwood boasting in 1769 of his intention of becoming 'Vase Maker General to the Universe'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe glaze imitates the surface of porphyry or another similar hardstone. The effect was achieved by blowing the glaze pigment through a straw onto the porous surface of the pot. Both the design of the vase and its porphyry and applied decoration were inspired by vases made by Wedgwood in the early 1770s. From Wedgwood's letters we know that connoisseurs criticized the 'offensive' gilding on his porphyry vases. The gilding was painted in a mixture of ground gold leaf and a mordant (which holds the ground leaf fast) onto the surface of the pot, and then fired onto it at a low temperature in a small kiln.\n\nPeople\nThe Staffordshire factory that made this pot was founded by Humphrey Palmer (active 1760-1778) and continued by his London agent and brother-in-law James Neale after Palmer's financial difficulties in 1778.",
