The base is a square block, covered with black plastic laminate. There is a square plate under each cube. The one under the upper cube is black and supported by four legs, projecting from the base. The plate under the middle cube is green, under the lower cube yellow. It is supported by four pink cylindrical poles standing on small rectangular boxes projecting from the base.

After reading one of Ettore Sottsass\u2019s articles he wrote a letter to Sottsass who invited him to Milan. Sowden became a core, and the only British member of Memphis. \nThe \u2018Metropole\u2019 clock is one of his best known designs for the group. Influenced by his early architectural training, Sowden was interested in classical proportions at the time. As a result the clock is unusually harmonious for a postmodern object. Sowden used the \u2018golden section\u2019 \u2013 derived ratios and squares as compositional elements. However, the small clock movement is in an unnecessarily huge box. As Sowden himself described, its anti-functionalism makes the \u2018Metropole\u2019 clock a postmodern object. The clock was designed \u2018on the kitchen table\u2019, without the use of computer. Sowden chose particular patterns of plastic laminate to decorate the form. Like many other early Memphis objects, the \u2018Metropole\u2019 clock was named after a luxury hotel.",

            "history_note": "The 'Metropole' clock is George J. Sowden's best known design for Memphis. It was featured in Andrea Branzi's book ('Hot House') on Italian radical design. Sowden used squares as compositional elements and classical 'golden section' ratios. The clock is unusually harmonious for a postmodern object. Influenced by his early architectural training he was interested in classical proportions when he designed the clock (as he recalled in an interview by Glenn Adamson, 22 February 2010). The object was first drawn 'on the kitchen table'. He chose particular patterns of plastic laminate to decorate the form. The plastic laminates were made by Abet Laminati, a laminate factory which worked often with Memphis.\nLike other early Memphis-objects, the clock is named for a luxury hotel.\n\nHistorical significance: The clock is postmodernist in its ant-functionalism. The upper box of the clock is unnecessarily large for the small mechanism inside. It was the departure from the modernist principles that Sowden had studied.",
