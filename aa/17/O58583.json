The original mirror was held in with a tiny backboard turned out of one piece of wood now held in with pins.\n\nFinish: Partial gilt with oil gilding. Certain details of the carving have been emphasised with careful application of gold leaf which has been neatly applied and does not overlap onto adjacent areas. A small worn area shows the wood to be a paler colour indicating wood has been stained a darker colour.",

O Brackett (25/2/1921) accepted that the four pieces were Italian 16th century, and singled out the small mirror W.102-1921 as 'particularly...a fine piece of work and a type unrepresented in the Museum'. The ceramics, manuscripts and certain bronzes were highly regarded by the Museum, while the Metalwork curator noted that 'a large number of pieces of doubtful if not fraudulent character' as well as fine quality works were being offered, but that they should be accepted nonetheless. No other significant information relating to FWK objects found on acquisition papers (3/2008). Currie was described in a newspaper obituary as 'a familiar figure in Continental sale rooms and at Christie's'.",
