The hanger of narrow D-section, bifurcating at the back into two small loops and then into tapering spirals of five turns.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an unrecorded source by the Hon. F H A Wallop before 1927; lent to the Museum 1927-49; given to Alan Evans, June 1933 by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery. 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929. p. 124; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 15. \n\nThe miniature is much restored but is nevertheless probably the remains of a Des Granges work. The initials <i>DDG</i>, in tentative wobbly letters over a background that has been much interfered with, perhaps reproduce a former genuine signature.\"",
