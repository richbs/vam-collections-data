Western pilgrims to the Holy Land frequently passed through Cyprus, and the Cypriot goldsmiths absorbed influences from Western Europe as well as Ottoman Turkey.  Their work is similar to jewellery from elsewhere in the region, but the quality is often higher.  They were famous for their filigree, often enriched with blue and green enamels.\n\nThis case was described as a purse when it was acquired in 1903.  Cases of this kind were worn by men in Cyprus to hold a variety of objects, and were probably intended to look like watch-cases.  An expensive pocket watch was an essential accessory for wealthy men throughout the Ottoman Empire.",
