Minton had been given plaster casts from original S\u0160vres moulds by the  French factory's artistic director, Alexandre Brogniart. The cup shape, with its twisted handle of two interlaced scrolls,  is closest to the S\u0160vres form 'H\u201abert', which was in production from 1752. Unlike S\u0160vres, however, it is painted in monochrome blue, rather than in several colours.\n\nSocial Class\nAlthough gilded and clearly of good quality, this cup and saucer were less expensive to make than the French S\u0160vres porcelain they copy because the painted decoration is in only one colour and  would therefore have needed fewer firings.  At a lower price, and in simple, unshowy taste, this cup and saucer would have had much wider appeal.  Customers will have ranged from the wealthy, for everyday use, to the comfortably-off professional classes, for special occasions.",
