Front opening, with a seam down the centre back and no shoulder seams. The collar band extends to the bottom of the jacket at the front. The back seam is left unsewn for a length of 42 cm to form a vertical slit from waist level to hem. This slit, plus the hem and the cuff-ends of the sleeves, are bound with a narrow edging of brown silk and flat gold strips. There is a button and buttonhole on stiffened tabs sewn inside at chest level. These tabs are bound in the same edging as the rest of the jacket.\nThere are three applied crests (<i>mon</i>) on the upper back of the jacket, one on each of the sleeves and one across the centre back seam. They are also of <i>kuzu</i> fibre edged in brown silk cord. The same cord is decoratively applied to the inside of the collar band at waist level.",

It is made from fibre taken from the inner bark of the kuzu plant which requires a great deal of processing to make it pliable enough to weave. This kajibanten would have been worn in the summer, the openwork nature of the kuzu cloth being very suitable for humid weather. At other times of the year a cotton version would have been worn. Such a delicate garment was only used for ceremonial purposes, however. When actually fighting a fire a much more robust jacket, often of leather, would have been worn.",

He thinks that by mid-Edo only the weft was of <i>kuzu</i>, the warp being cotton or silk. There does not, however, seem any sure way to date these garments.",
