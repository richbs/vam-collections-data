The manufacture of some categories of goods was also regulated with the Utility Scheme to avoid waste, and promote good and efficient design.\n\nIt might be thought that wicker furniture like this would be considered too flimsy to be worthwhile making, under the circumstances.  But wood was one of the scarcest of all materials, and furniture therefore one of the most tightly controlled classes of goods.  Solutions to the question of furniture supply which used a minimum of wood, or none at all, as here, were particularly welcome.",
