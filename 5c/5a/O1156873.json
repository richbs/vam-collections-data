It is part of a collection made by Arthur Astill, who kept posters, handbills and advertisements from theatres where he appeared in variety. The twice-nightly performances at Exeter in February 1910 included the 'Expensive Engagement of London's Favourite', the American 'black-face' performer Eugene Stratton, an item of cinema ('every picture tells a story') and, at the bottom of the bill, Arthur Astill 'Mimetic and Whistler'.\n\nArthur Astill (1887-1962) started his career in a Pierrot Troupe known as the Olympic Serenaders. He went on to appear as a solo 'mimetic' and in 1912 was billed as 'the Whistling Ploughboy'. He later formed a double act with Gwen Fontaine (1891-1978) who he married in 1911. One of their acts: 'Impressions of Country Life', used Arthur's whistling skills in impersonations of birds, and also included impressions of animals and children. It was billed as 'Mirth, Mimicry and Ventriloquism'.",
