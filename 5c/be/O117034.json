Following his death in 1870, Hogarth gave it to the novelist and dramatist Edmund Hodgson Yates (1831-1894).\n\nSuch was the interest generated by this writing slope when it was sold at the auction of Yate's library on January 21, 1895, that The Times reported the following day: 'This was put up at 50 guineas, and, after brisk bidding, some of it on American account, was knocked down at \u00a3105 to Mr. Bancroft amidst cheers.'
