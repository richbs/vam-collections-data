            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nBy the early 18th century the British had developed a taste for milk in their tea, rather than weak tea drunk in the Chinese style. The silver milk jug, uncommon before the turn of the century, became a more familiar part of the tea service. However, the silversmith and retailer George Wickes only sold two 'milk boats' and six cream ewers in ten years. Milk jugs were sometimes supplied in a boxed tea service along with canisters, sugar box, sugar nippers, strainer spoon, tea spoons and tea knives. Silver jugs to match teapots were a later development, although matching ceramic jugs were more common.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis jug is an example of the fashion for milk jugs based on the scaled-down ewer form and decorated with applied Rococo scrollwork, introduced in the 1730s. It is cast and chased with elaborate and expensive Rococo foliated strapwork, shellwork and panels of flowers and landscapes. The handle, cast as a dragon or sea creature, is particularly striking.\n\nSocial Class\nTea began to be imported in the 17th century and was both fashionable and expensive. As a beverage which was mainly enjoyed by the upper classes, objects associated with tea are often made of precious metals or costly ceramics. The family's wealth and status could thus be displayed when offering tea at social gatherings.",
