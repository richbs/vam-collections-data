The legs are formed by intersecting planks of oak which taper gently outwards at the bottom. A circular top and four lower shelves have been joined to the legs providing surfaces for refreshments and playing games. \n\nPlaces\nThe design was originally executed for the Argyle Street Tea Rooms. This particular example, however, came from the Ingram Street Tea Rooms. It is not known whether Mackintosh revived the design, probably around 1911, or whether in fact some of the tables were taken there when the Argyle Street rooms closed in 1920.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe top surface of the table was used for playing dominoes, a popular Glasgow pastime. The lower shelves held cups and plates and the unused dominoes of the four players.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMackintosh often made use of the details of construction for decorative purposes. For example on this table, the exposed square tenons which attach the legs to the top form a simple geometric pattern adding interest to an otherwise plain surface.",
