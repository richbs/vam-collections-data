Influenced by Henry Fuseli at the Royal Academy school, Baxter specialised in figures but could turn his talents to any subject. \n\nUnlike most ceramic decorators who attempted portraits of famous people, Baxter had first-hand knowledge of his subject through Admiral Lord Nelson's personal patronage and through visits to the home of Nelson and Lady Hamilton at Merton in Surrey. Recent research has identified one of Baxter's drawings of Lady Hamilton as the model for 'Britannia' unveiling the bust of Nelson on this Coalport plate.\n\nThe Baxter enamelling studio was undoubtedly the leading establishment of its day, the quality of painting coming close to that achieved by Continental factories during the early 19th century. It also played an important part in training the next generation of decorators.",
