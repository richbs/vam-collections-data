Made from interlocking angular links, they were known as \u2018snakes\u2019 or \u2018gas-pipes\u2019, depending on how they were constructed. Gold remained fashionable for gem-set jewellery. It had returned to prominence because of the wartime requisitioning of platinum for the armaments industry. In 1947, when this necklace was made, the purchase tax on new jewellery was set at 125 per cent. The Utility Standard for home use was 9-carat gold. The 18-carat gold of this necklace was possible only because it was commissioned by a client in Alexandria in Egypt.",
