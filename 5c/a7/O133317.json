Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \n\nA Market Boat on the Scheldt \nFA189 Neg Z2223 \nPanel, 82.9 X 124.4 cm (32  5/8 X 49 ins) \nSigned and dated 'C STANFIELD 1826' on barrel at l \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the BI in 1826, and the artist's first exhibited painting to receive critical acclaim. The Times critic noted: 'Mr Stanfield, whose scenery at Drury Lane Theatre it has often been our pleasing task to praise, shows by his picture ... that he is no less worthy of commendation for his paintings in oil'. \nThe subject was presumably inspired by a trip to the Netherlands and Germany in June and July 1823; the river Scheldt runs from northern France, through Belgium, to Holland and the North Sea. Stanfield was to later exhibit two other pictures of similar scenes, 'On the Scheld, near Leiskenshoeck - squally day' (RA 1837) and 'Oude Scheld, Texel Island' (RA 1863). Another 'On the Scheldt' was engraved by R Wallis for Charles Heath's Picturesque Annual 1833, p226 (impr in V&A collections, E881918). \nThe accompanying text to the engraving in the 1871 Art Journal .presumably written by Dafforne, as it is repeated in his book) explains the subject and admires the effect: \n... a locality which painters of 'sea-scapes' have loved to frequent for more than two centuries ... Judging from the breadth of water, Stanfield must have sketched this view no very considerable distance from the mouth of the river: the near boat is preparing to cross over with its freight of passengers, fruit, vegetables, &c, for one of the boatmen is unloosing the craft from the buoy, while another close to him hails a similar boat approaching from the other side. Behind is a Dutch schooner tacking up the river; and, moored off the opposite coast, is a large vessel which, so far as the flag at her stem can be made out, is a British ship. The market boat in front, with its contents, is a picturesque bit of composition, and shows much rich and varied colouring, which is partially repeated in the water, the artist skilfully treating the grouped objects so as to let a gleam of bright sunshine fall upon this part of the work; and as the clouds roll away for a few minutes - there is rain coming on in the distance - gleams of sunlight are repeated on the opposite land and water. A fresh breeze is blowing, just enough to keep the masses of clouds in tolerably rapid motion, and to cause a surf on the dwarfish waves as they roll onward to their near shore. The action of the water shows the artist's close study of the elements, while his judicious treatment of light and shade keeps everything in its proper place, and subordinate to a general brilliant result. \nSeventeen years later, Ward was less enthusiastic. He wrote of this work and a later painting as: \nModels of careful, precise, and at the same time spirited art; the boats and ships are admirably drawn, the lines of the waves have been followed with the most exact admiration. How it is, then, that they leave one cold? that in comparison with Turner on the one hand, and Henry Moore on the other, these marine-pictures of Stanfield appear inadequate? The truth is that to Stanfield the sea has denied the understanding of her innermost secrets. He cannot attain to the glory of her colours, and her never-resting movement demands a subtler brush than his. \nThe panel, which is mahogany, is stamped 'R DAVY/16 WARDOUR ST.' A pencil and watercolour drawing, identical in composition, was recorded in an English private collection in 1983. \nPROV: \tSir Francis Freeling; his sale, Christie's 15 April 1837 (91), bought Smith \u00a3178 10s; John Sheepshanks \nEXH: \tBI 1826 (102, size given in catalogue as '49 by 65 inches' including frame); Clarkson Stanfield Sunderland Museum and Art Gallery 1979 (131) \nENGR:\tJP Quilley  for Art Journal 1857, p137; J C Armytage for Art Journal 1871, facing p20a, and J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873], facing p23 \nLIT: \tThe Times 2 February 1826; G Waagen Treasures of Art in Great Britain II, p302; Art Journal 1857, p137-9; Art Journal 1871, p2aa; Dafforne, pp23-4; T H Ward English Art in the Public Galleries of London nd [1888] II, p172\n \nRonald Parkinson\"\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
