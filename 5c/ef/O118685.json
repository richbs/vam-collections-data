            "public_access_description": "Although altar crosses could  be used in processions, the large size of this cross indicates that it was probably principally used in processions around the town and church of Locatello, Italy. These took place before Mass on special feast and saints' days. Crosses of this type were raised high upon a tall staff, so that it could be seen by a crowd of people. Processional crosses were often decorated with gold and silver, and this example displays the standard iconography of the Evangelists, Mary and St John with the crucified Christ in the centre. This example was commissioned for the town of Locatello, near Bergamo. The owl depicted upon the knop of the stem is the symbol of the town. The coat of arms upon the piece has been connected with the Locatelli family of Alzano.\n\nThis cross can be compared to another example in a church not far away, in San Vincenzo Church, Bergamo, in northern Italy. The close stylistic similarities suggest that they were made by the same goldsmith, Lorenzino Ughetto.",

Fornoni records on the authority of a certain Villa (whose statement he had been unable to verify) that it was the work of Ughetto Lorenzoni of Vertova, a Bergamesque goldsmith, who was commissioned in 1386 to make a cross for the former cathedral of S. Alessandro, now preserved in the cathedral of S. Vicenzo, at Bergamo. The Cathedral cross was heavily restored in the 17th and 18th centuries, but the original parts bear a very strong resemblance to the Museum cross and seem to confirm the attribution to the same master.'\n\nHistorical significance: This object belonged to the community of Locatello. The decoration of the owl upon the knop of the cross is a symbol of the town. The coat of arms upon the stem has been linked to the Locatelli family of Alzano.",

Processional crosses were usually decorated in silver and gold. From around 800 processional and altar crosses included a figure of the crucified Christ and became known as Crucifixes. The iconography upon crosses became standard from around 1100. The four evangelists, Mary and St John are popular figures for depiction. This cross also includes the figure of the Paschal Lamb, a symbol of Christ.",
