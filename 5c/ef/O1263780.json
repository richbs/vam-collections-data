It is a satirical reference to the traditional marital friction between Punch and Judy, illlustrated here by Judy beating Punch with his stick, with which he regularly beats all the rest of the characters in the show.\n\nPunch and Judy shows are a feature of British seaside  entertainment  whose history in Great Britain stretches back to the puppet show that Samuel Pepys noted  seeing in Covent Garden on 9 May 1662 performed by the Italian puppeteer Signor  Bologna.  This included a marionette, or string puppet as Pulcinello or Punch, but by the 19th century  Punch was more usually a glove puppet, performed in a portable booth by one performer who  had a character on each hand.\n\nPunch became a popular character in Britain by the 19th century, when images of Punch and  Judy were used as decorative motifs on a range of household items. In 1841 the magazine  Punch, or the London Charivari was established, named after the comic and anarchic character  of Mr. Punch whose image appeared on its cover.",
