Smaller vases of flowers are at right and left, supported on plinths on the top of complicated scrolling ornament. Birds perch on the branches and two green parrots' heads are concealed in the scrolling patterns beneath the largest vase.  The frame of the design consists of a flowering scroll and cartouche pattern on a deep salmon ground, with half-columns (split vertically) in gold at the edge of the design (that on the right damaged; the paper may have been cut down on this side).",

Sir Casper Purdon Clarke (1846-1911) was a trained architect who entered HM Office of Works and in 1867 transferred to the Works Department of the South Kensington Museum. He designed the Indian Section of the 1877 Paris Exhibition, and arranged the Indian collections at South Kensington in 1880.The notation in the hand of his son, Caspar Stanley Clarke, seems to show that the group of drawings were bought for his personal collection. Purdon Clarke became the first Keeper of the Indian Section in 1883, and went on to become Director of the V&A and then of the Metropolitan Museum in New York.",
