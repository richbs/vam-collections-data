They show a crowned lion passant regardant set in a foliage circle, a unicorn set in a different foliage circle, a crowned thistle with a scroll to either side, and VR surmounted by a crown and with a rose above and a thistle and a shamrock to either side. The background of the panels is blue, with outer borders of red on a white ground. The pencil sketches show a lion rampant and a floral and foliage panel. These designs are part of a group of ten sheets of preliminary designs and working drawings for the ceiling of the House of Lords Chamber within the V&A collections.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
