            "public_access_description": "The plate from which this image was taken was etched between 1500 and 1510. Daniel Hopfer was possibly the earliest to experiment with etching in Europe, using iron or steel plates. This was a natural development from his usual employment as an armourer - etching developed in the Middle East for applying decoration to armour. \n\nThe technique involves coating a metal plate with an acid resistant substance and drawing through it using a needle to expose the metal. Acid is used to eat into the exposed lines. This allows for greater freedom with the lines than in engraving. Etching, for instance, allowed the black tonal area on the devil in this image to be made without using hatching. Later, in 1520, Lucas van Leyden experimented with combining etching with engraving, using copper plates instead of iron because the latter was too hard for engraving. Copper also proved a more satisfactory metal for etching, giving softer results. \n\nThe size of this print suggests that it might have been intended for display on a wall and the visual arrangement can be understood and read from a distance. However, the addition of descriptive text with biblical references also encourages a closer reading. The inclusion of text suggests a highly literate audience. \n\nThis print conflates the story of the Passion of Christ and the Resurrection into a single image in an imaginative and efficient way that both encourages meditation and aids memory. Some of the symbols of the Passion are held by angels above Christ. Images focussing on individual objects from the Passion story developed around the mid 15th century to encourage the viewer to meditate internally on the suffering and torture inflicted on Christ. This image however moves beyond Christ's suffering to his triumph over Death. He stands holding the Resurrection banner over the snake (the Devil?) and Death. The chains attaching Heaven to the snake have been broken - perhaps an alternative visual representation of the Descent into Limbo (see Mantegna), in which Christ breaks the doors to Hell and releases the good souls trapped within.",
