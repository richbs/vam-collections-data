It is only possible to discern certain parts of it. In the top right hand corner are four flying genies. Around the Bodhisattva  is a rocky and leafy landscape. In the top left hand corner is a flying couple and below them are more figures although only one face is fully visible.",

The white patches cover fragile areas that require conservation work.\n\nThe cave paintings of Ajanta are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas). \n\nHere you see a Bodhisattva, a spiritual being on the path to becoming a Buddha. The setting is a beautiful mountainous green landscape. The image of the Bodhisattva is largely missing except for parts of the incredibly detailed crown. The flying genies (top right) represent \u2018gandharvas\u2019 (heavenly musicians). The flying couple (top left) are \u2018vidyadharas\u2019 (charm-bearers). \n\n\nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves. This is one of the approximately 300 paintings they produced.",

Here the image of the Bodhisattva is largely missing except for parts of the incredibly detailed crown. \n\nThe flying genies in the top right hand corner represent heavenly musicians, the Gandharvas. The three women are beating cymbals and the man in the middle is also carrying something which is not properly identifiable but is though to be a vina.\n\nThe flying couple in the top left hand corner can be identified as Vidyadharas (charm-bearers) because of the sword carried by the man. \n\nThe two small figures on the right of the Bodhisattva king are identified as the Kinnara, half human/half bird. Both are meant to be playing musical instruments.",

They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the jatakas) and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is an example.",
