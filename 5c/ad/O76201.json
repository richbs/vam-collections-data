These were taken by the photographer Lewis Morley in 1963 (see Museum no. E.15-1999). Keeler had been involved in affairs with John Profumo, a Conservative Cabinet minister, and a Soviet diplomat. The scandal resulted in Profumo's resignation.\n\nAt first glance this famous seat looks exactly like an Arne Jacobsen 3107 chair. This was made from moulded plywood and manufactured by the Danish firm Fritz Hansens in the mid 1950s (see Museum no. Circ.371-1970). Although made in Denmark, Keeler's chair is in fact an early 'rip-off' of Jacobsen's design. Morley bought the chair at a Heal's sale in 1962 for \u00a32 10s. He has also photographed the playwright Joe Orton and the comedian Barry Humphries sitting on it.",
