Gamble.\n\nThis medal is almost identical to one produced the previous year for the Exhibition. It was presented to every exhibitor in the catalogue, and also for services rendered. This particular medal was awarded to a Miss Cole of Thurloe Square, who exhibited two bound books in Class XII (Bookbinding).\n\nThe building in the foreground, opened by the Prince Consort in 1861, no longer exist. They were built on land leased to the Horticultural Society by the Commissioners for the 1851 Exhibition. The conservatory was designed by Captain Fowke and alter formed the southern entrance to the Albert Hall. The arcades were designed by Sydney Smirke, brother of Sir Robert.\n\nThe original owner of these medals, Captain Fowke of the Royal Engineers, became a distinguished official architect in the middle of the Victorian era, and published a number of related papers. In 1857 he became an inspector in the Science and Art Department in London; in 1860 was added the office of architect and engineer; while in 1862 he was appointed Superintendent of the construction of the South Kensington (now Victoria and Albert) Museum. He designed the new Museum of Science and Art (now the Royal Scottish Museum) Edinburgh, as well as extensions at the National Gallery, Dublin. He planned the buildings for the International Exhibition of 1862. Shortly before his death he designed the Royal Albert Hall.",
