The figures are carved in high relief and each stands within a deep niche below trefoil ogee arches with foliate crockets .  The two parts are held together by two small hinges.

The gilded decoration of the hair, beard, borders of draperies, and small rosettes of the frame is not original but overlays a similar scheme, thus giving an accurate impression of the original appearance.",

Thicker than any existing French ivory relief - each leaf measures 2.6cm in depth - the style of the figures of Christ and of the Virgin and Child has traditionally been associated with late 13th and early 14th century work at Westminster and with the Eleanor Crosses erected in the early 1290s to commemorate the death of Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I. There are also parallels with slightly later sculptures, such as the Percy tomb at Beverley (about 1330-1340).\n\nThe use of the ogee arch and the unusual, monumental form of the individual figures - as opposed to the smaller and more crowded scenes from the Gospels found on French ivories - reinforce the idea that this was produced in England, probably in a court workshop. In effect, the figures have the appearance of small free-standing statues enclosed within niches, or of three-dimensional Northern versions of the full-length figures found in Italian 14th-century painted predella panels.",

When closed, the diptych forms a compact - if solid -shape and would fit neatly into a leather carrying case for safe travel.",
