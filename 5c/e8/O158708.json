His firm, Casson & Conder, designed the Ismaili Centre directly across the street from the V&A.\n\nWhile generally conventional in his dress, Conder favoured unusual neckties. He was often seen around South Kensington wearing what he called his \"architect ties\". These formed part of his otherwise normal wardrobe, and acted as an outlet for his originality and artistic thinking. In this instance, he chose a woven cotton and wool strap originally intended for a guitar or similar instrument. It was probably woven in South America, as the colours and stylized birds are typical of the region's traditional weaving.",
