Metal thread: silver strip open S-wound on light yellow silk.\n\nThree pieces of the same fabric. Metal thread ground  with a dense pattern formed of two designs in alternate rows: 8-petalled rosettes edged with serrated white leaves, each petal containing a flower head in either white, red and brown or in blue, white and faded red.  At the centre is a 12-petalled rosette in faded red with a blue centre, edged in white. This main rosette forms a lobed lozenge shape with a central 12-petalled rosette in red and blue, framed by an 8-petalled star in white whose point terminates in either a small red flower or a larger blue and faded red flower head. The four junction points of these lozenges are marked with a red flower with a blue centre.",
