The shape was inspired by Chinese chairs, and consequently they were also called \u2018Indian\u2019 or \u2018India-back\u2019 chairs \u2013 India being commonly used to refer to all of South and South East Asia. The first recorded chairs of this type were made in 1717, and by the 1720s they were highly fashionable. This example comes from a set that was probably made for Thomas Wentworth (later Marquess of Rockingham), soon after he inherited Wentworth Woodhouse, Yorkshire, in 1723. His monogram \u2018TW\u2019 is drawn in marquetry in the back.\n\nVery similar marquetry appears on a number of other chairs, which all appear to come from one workshop. These pieces also share certain distinctive technical features, including the use of screws in the construction, which most furniture makers in the 18th century used very sparingly, as they were expensive to manufacture. The maker of this group of pieces has not been firmly identified, but was possibly Henry Williams, who became chairmaker to the Royal Household in 1729.",

Among the distinctive characeristics (though not all occur in every piece in the group) are the style of the marquetry, with strapwork and monograms; the use of screws in the original construction (both features found in this chair); the use of facings applied over the stuffed seat rails, to create the appearance of a drop-in seat, and evidence that the seats were originally upholstered with a foundation fixed to the underside of the rails. (Evidence for either of the last two features on W.38-1929 has been lost, as this chair has been re-railed). There is some evidence that the maker was Henry Williams, who worked for Sir Jacob de Bouverie, the probable original owner of two chairs in this group at Longford Castle (which do not have marquetry). Williams was also employed by James Dutton at Sherborne, Gloucestershire, the origin of two stools that seem to belong to this group, which are now at Lodge Park (part of the same estate).",
