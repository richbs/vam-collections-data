He topped the bill at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 24 April 1905 as \u2018The Popular London Patter Comedian. The first to be offered the late lamented Mr Dan Leno\u2019s part at Drury Lane last Christmas\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre in Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums. Cooke drew a smaller version of this when Ray appeared at the Grand in 1903, but reworked it in a larger format in 1905.\n\nMusic hall performers liked to cultivate \u2018specialities\u2019. Phil Ray was known for wearing Eton collars and hats with feathers, and for singing songs that included abbreviations such as:\n\nI weren\u2019t feeling right so I went down to Bright; to spend a few mins by the sea. On Victoria plat I patiently sat with my little portmant on my knee.

I said \u2018Thanks for the kind informaysh\u2019.\n\nRay was popular up to about 1914, despite being censured by some for his rather \u2018blue\u2019 humour.",

Ray topped the bill at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley during the week commencing 24th April 1905, but had appeared at Hanley in 1903 when Cooke first drew him (S.392:49-2002). Roy's pseudonym relates to the way he sang songs with abbreviated words such as: 'On Victoria plat/ I patiently sat/ with my little portmanteau oin my knee.  Then in from the junc/ came the 3.30 punc'. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
