In 1709 he became a master and in 1746 he gave his workshop to his son George Philipp. He was one of a group working in this period executing commissions from all over Germany. These were mainly for tableware and travelling sets.  Mentzel collaberated on a large travelling service made between 1740 and 1760 for Louise of Saxony-Hildburghausen, daughter of Christian VI of Denmark. The roman numeral VIII shows that this piece was once part of a set, probably one of a pair of such caskets in a toilet service.",

In 1709 he became a master and in 1746 he gave his workshop to his son George Philipp.  He was one of a group working in this period executing commissions from all over Germany.  These were mainly for tableware and travelling sets.  For example, Mentzel collaberated on a large travelling service made between 1740 and 1760 for Louise of Saxony-Hildburghausen, daughter of Christian VI of Denmark. The numerals VIII show this piece was once part of a set, probably one of a pair of such caskets in a toilet service.",
