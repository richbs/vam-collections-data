The wardrobe is painted in oils on canvas to look like a stone archway. The painting wraps around the wardrobe forming a continuous image; the side panels, the front, and the roof are all painted. The back of the wardrobe is not painted. There are two identical circular metal door knocker style handles, one on each door. Two-thirds of the wardrobe opens, excluding the roof part. The two hinged doors are not identical but follow the motifs of the painting, and open outwards to reveal two cupboards. On one side there is a tiered-system of shelves and on the other a rail to hand larger garments. Above is a moon shaped (tympanum-like) shelf which can also be used for storage. The inside of the doors are painted blue; the inside of the cupboard is painted black. The wardrobe is simple in craftsmanship and design and although functional it is clear that the painting was meant to be the focus of the wardrobe.",

Although simple in form, it is monumental in scale. Its impact is heightened by the illusionism of the painting. The fantastical scene has a surreal and ominous nature and reflects Berman's interest in architecture as well as decay and destruction. Eug\u00e8ne Berman (1899-1972) worked principally as a painter, printmaker and stage designer, especially for ballet and opera. Furniture was not a major part of his work, and he did not attempt to engage with the functional complexities of furniture design itself. Instead, it was a means through which he could extend the illusionism of his painting into three dimensions.",

            "history_note": "Berman was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1889. He received training with an architect who worked in the Palladian tradition before going to study in Paris. \u201cFrom the 1920s he was closely identified with a group of Parisian artists, mainly former fellow students, dubbed the \u2018Neo-Romantic\u2019 painters.\u201d (Wilk, p. 230)\n\u201cThe architectural form and and subject matter of this cabinet relates directly to Berman\u2019s training as well as to his intense study of buildings through travel and drawing, and his collecting of architectural books and prints. Berman clearly designed this cabinet specially for its decoration. Berman\u2019s imagery suggests decay, destruction and the passing of time and may well have been related to when it was painted \u2013 on the eve of World War II. (Wilk, p. 230.)\nCalloway describes how Berman became fascinated with the forms of \u201cdecayed statuary\u201d and goes on to suggest that the cabinet is \u201cone of the greatest achievments of the Neo-Romantic impulse\u201d. (Calloway, p. 115.)\nThe wardrobe was most likely created for the exhibition at Galerie Drouin in 1939. \u201cThe gallery was the first commercial venture of a giant of the post-war American art world, Leo Castelli, and his partner, the designer Rene Drouin.\u201d (Wood, p. 41)\n\u201cHowever, the exhibition was soon overshadowed by the war and quickly forgotten. The Galerie Drouin exhibition marked the height of a symbiotic relationship between fashion and surrealism. The event revealed a little-studied world of Surrealist artists designing objects, and emphasised the importance that personal relationships played in the creation of a wider surrealist aesthetic. The social scene of Paris itself promoted the swift transmission of ideas.\u201d (Wood, p. 42)\n \u201cTromp l\u2019oeil in particular occupied an increasingly important role in Berman\u2019s ouvre\u201d (Callowayp. 116.)",
