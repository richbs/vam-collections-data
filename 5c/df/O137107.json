This essence of ritual is captured through the rich complexity of the handle and the sleek simplicity of the blade, the juxtaposition of function and ceremony. Farrell shows flair through the original split blade design. The minor handle-part is plain metal, beautifully offsetting the rich abstract scene of the major handle-part. It depicts a Floridian beach scene, the sand is copper with black shakudo palm-tree trunks and shibuichi fronds. The water is made from nickel silver and the sun is of 18 carat gold. The elegant curve of the split divides the otherwise sombre plane of the blade and balances its asymmetry. This innovative design is refreshing, an effortlessly stylish piece.",
