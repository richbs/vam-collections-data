Mr Allen had at that time already made a will bequeathing a number of items to the museum after his & his wife's deaths.  In 1931 Mr Allen died and Mrs Allen sold \"Avalon\"  to move into a service flat.  She decided to dispose of certain items on the bequest list for which she had no further use (evidently they had no children).\n\nIt seems that Mr Allen built up his collection of antiques earlier in his life.  There are no details of provenance and no indication as to whether any were inherited family pieces although the absence of such indication rather implies that they were not inherited.  (one of the items given by Mrs Allen during her lifetime was a garment described as having been with an ancestor of hers. Possibly therefore if other items had been inherited the Allens might have mentioned this).\n\nMrs Allen died in 1938.",
