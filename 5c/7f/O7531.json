He was succeeded by his second son Andrew de Bures (c. 1302-1360).\nSir Andrew de Bures, the second son, succeeded to all the landed estates which his father and step-mother had to leave. \nHe married Alice, daughter and heiress of Sir John de Reydon (or Roydon), of Overbury Hall, Leyham, Suffolk. \nThis lady brought to him in dower the Manor of Bowthorp, in Norfolk, Leyham, Whersted and Reydon (Roydon), in Suffolk. \nIt is recorded by Cotman (\"Suffolk Brasses\") that Sir Andrew, when a boy between the years 1301-1312, was granted a pension of 40 shillings by Thomas, Abbot of St. Edmundsbury, in consideration of services done and to be done by his father, Sir Robert. \nSir Andrew de Bures died 12 Apr. 1360 and was buried in the chancel of Acton church, as was also his son, Sir Robert .\nWeever saw the inscriptions over their graves and recorded them. \nAt the present time both have disappeared, but their former situs is probably a nameless tomb in the chancel over which is a double floriated early English arch.\n\nNote in Register: Copy of a label attached to the panel:\nThis shield bears the arms of the De Bures family of Acton near Sudbury. I met with the fragments at a shop in Bury St. Edmunds. The label on grisaille panel in libray window seems to refer to and to correspond with inscription with that upon the brass of Robert de Bures in Acton church, engraved in Mr. Walter's book on brasses. It would be desirable to offer the glass medallion to the Museum at Colchester where are deposited the antique objects found in the County of Suffolk.\n\nA Sir Robert de Bures is listed as a leader of men from Essex on the Calais Campaign (1346/7) in the so-called Calais Roll.",
