It was written off in 1937, and rediscovered and re-evaluated in the 1990s. See Dewan p.433 for listings of other copies elsewhere.\nThis photograph was published as plate X of fifteen in the album <u>Photographs of Madura: Part III</u> 1858, by 'Captain L. Tripe, Government Photographer', published in 1860. It was taken as part of Tripe's remit as the government photographer, which he himself defined broadly, as recording, \u2018before they disappear\u2019 buildings, sculptures and inscriptions\u2026' including the picturesque. This was a model for an extensive survey, including tuition of others and experimentation in his own practice. He was funded by the Madras government, but intended selling additional copies of some prints so that his practice could be self-funding.\n\nThis photograph was published with the following text:\n'The architectural arrangement of this Prakarum is very striking, the small shrine at the lower end breaks the uniformity in a very pleasing manner. Along these cloisters at stated periods every day the idols are carried in procession heralded by the Brahmins chaunting [sic] their praises to the beat of tom-tom.'\n\nHistorical significance: Tripe's photographs of South India are an important body of work within Tripe's oeuvre, and are recognised as being some of the most aesthetically and technically competent images of India made in the 19th century.\nTripe entered his Madura series as part of total of 50 photographs from his 1857\u20138 tour of South India in the 1859 annual exhibition of the Madras Photographic Society. The jury dubbed his photographs \u2018the best in the Exhibition\u2019 but as Tripe could not be classed an amateur, he could not win the gold medal. Tripe declined the silver medal amicably, since he considered that as an official photographer he had an unfair advantage over the other entrants. \nTripe\u2019s photographs were valued for their informational value and their technical quality. The adjudicating committee stated that Tripe\u2019s photographs \u2018illustrate admirably the architecture of the Hindoo Temples and Places of Southern India, and in particular the Madura and Tanjore series comprise in this respect all that is most worthy of record in those cities.\u2019 (See Dewan, p.16). Forty-six of Tripe\u2019s 50 exhibited images were made from paper (calotype) negatives, which the committee didn't feel were as successful as dry collodion-on-glass negatives, however, declaring that \u2018the superiority of definition given by Collodion [-on-glass] is very visible when placed side by side with them.\u2019 It is thought that Tripe prefered paper to glass negatives due to paper being easier and safer to work with. This photograph was unusually for Tripe, made from a glass negative.",

            "historical_context_note": "<b>The southern districts tour and Madras presidency photographs, 1857-58</b>\nThe Madras government appointed Tripe as photographer following the 1855 directive from the Court of Directors in London, who discouraged illustration in favour of 'photography as a means by which representations may be obtained of scenes and buildings, with the advantages of perfect accuracy, small expenditure of time, and moderate cash', and asked that photography be the main means of recording architecture and antiquities (Dewan, p.6).  \n\nAs official photographer to the Madras Government, Tripe set off from Bangalore on 14 December 1857 after delays due to waiting for modifications to his new English camera, and his recovery after falling from a horse. He ended his tour in Madras on 30 April 1858 after travelling via Srirangam, Tiruchchirappalli, Madurai, then Pudukkottai, Tanjore, and Tiruchchirappalli again (then called Seeringham, Trichinopoly, Madura, Poodoocottah and Tanjore). \n\nAll of these areas had been forcefully taken under British rule in the previous one hundred years, but Tripe looked for scenes or subjects with architectural or antiquarian interest rather than political significance. He had wanted to ensure his images were practical too: before he had set out he had asked the chief engineer for guidance on what would be most useful from an engineering perspective, and incorporated this input into his work.",
