Of mid-calf length and has a high stiffened stand-up collar, short cap sleeves and side slits (ca. 30 cm). The front panel of the dress is decorated with asymmetric silver flowers curling from the left shoulder across the skirt. The foliage was machine embroidered straight onto the satin. The flower heads were made separately from satin off cuts and silver thread, and the petals seem to be stiffened with thin wire and only partially sewn to the dress to give a three dimensional effect. There is no embroidery at the back of the dress. \n\nThe dress is edged with matching, narrow white satin piping and is closed with press-studs across the collarbone to the right and down under the arm where there is then a zip-fastener in the side stream. There are bust darts at the front and waist darts at back and front. The dress is lined throughout with lightweight plain white silk.",

The cheongsam was popularised in the mid- to late-1920s when women in China began to play a greater role in public life. One of the main features of this type of dress is the intricate knot and loop fastenings.",
