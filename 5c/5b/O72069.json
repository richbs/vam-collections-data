The bridge itself was characteristic of the design adapted by the Turks from the Romans, and which for centuries was copied throughout the Turkish empire. Today very few survive; the most famous one, at Mostar, was destroyed by shellfire in 1993. Gibbings heightens the tragic atmosphere of the scene by a subtle colouring of the mountains, and by intensifying the contrast between black bridge, figures and sky with the snowy road and freezing river.",

London, V&A Publications, 2001.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Robert John Gibbings (1889-1958)</b> \n\n<i>The Retreat from Serbia</i>, 1916 \n\nThis print is based on a remarkable photograph taken by a war correspondent, published in <i>The Illustrated London News</i> on 15 January 1916.  The Serbian commander-in-chief, Marshall Putnik, was heading the retreat from the Germans through Albania.  His soldiers carried him in a sedan chair over the Bridge of the Visiers, which crossed a river, the White Drin.  The artist's eye of Gibbings was caught by the stark but beautiful lines of the stonework of the sixteenth-century Ottoman bridge  Its distinctive parabola form, without any parapet, was characteristic of many bridges adapted from Roman architecture by Ottoman military engineers throughout the Turkish Empire.  (There are now few such bridges left after the ravages of time, conflict and modernization of the twentieth century, and the most famous example, a favourite subject for artists and printmakers was the bridge at Mostar in Bosnia-Herzegovina, deliberately destroyed by shellfire in 1993.) \nA subject matter for his early prints, Gibbings often used the silhouetted forms of architecture, as they were peculiarly suited to the hard-edged patterns rendered by the woodcut block.  The subtle hand-colouring enhances the melancholy nature of the subject.  The image in the newspaper was striking enough, but the printmaker has made something even more haunting from this tragic episode of the First World War.  Gibbings himself served in the army and was wounded at Gallipoli, but although he produced several prints of the buildings he had seen while abroad, he did not otherwise make images of the war.\"",
