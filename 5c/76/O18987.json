Personal reliquaries were popular in the Middle Ages and were worn by clerics and lay people alike.

According to Lightbown, this is too early for the technique of transluscent enamel on silver to be used on such an object. He considers a date later in the fourteenth century to be more likely.\n\nHistorical significance: Lightbown (see bibiliography) noted that there is no saint or holy man of the name of Leonard from Cremona. In this case the the relic held within the pendant may have been those of St Leonard of Limousin, a 6th century hermit whose popularity spread to Italy. However the cult of Saint Leonard of Noblat is known to have been celebrated in Cremona, where there is a church dedicated to him. It isthus more probably that the pendant refers to a relic from the Church of Saint Leonard in Cremona.",

In the Middle Ages they were generally believed to have miraculous powers and were greatly venerated. Relics were kept in containers called reliquaries.\n\nThis object is an example of a pendant reliquary. Personal reliquaries were popular in the Middle Ages and were worn by clerics and lay people alike. Relics were believed to have prophylactic (protective) powers, and were usually worn close to the body to ensure the most efficient use of that power. Some personal reliquaries enabled relics to be removed, possibly for the purpose of touching or kissing the relic.",
