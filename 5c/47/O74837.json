These rounded shapes were difficult to achieve and maintain. A woman who sat down risked deflating her skirt, although this danger was avoided at cocktail parties where guests usually stood. Madame Gr\u00e8s created this cocktail dress by gathering the fine silk taffeta into a dropped waist. She then attached the taffeta at the hemline to a narrow, straight petticoat in matching fabric. The bodice has a long line, short sleeves and is tightly fitted. It provides a contrast to the rounded curves of the skirt. The top is supported and lined with silk organza. The organza extends into an inner roll underneath the gathers to give shape and support. Two tailored bows mark the corners of the low, square neckline. The dress fastens with a zip.",
