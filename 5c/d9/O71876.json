Although he was British, Harwood's exact place of birth is unknown, and little is known of his early career. He was, however, noted as being 'acquainted with Joseph Wilton, who was then working in Florence'.\n\nJ. Ingamells, in A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy 1701-1800 (1997), states that 'after Wilton returned to England in 1755 Harwood appears to have worked in a studio near SS. Annunziata with Giovanni Battista Piamontini.' Harwood's work was wide-ranging; as well as producing busts and copies after the Antique, he also executed vases, chimneypieces and figures. The present relief was formerly at Gordon Castle, Banffshire, Scotland.",
