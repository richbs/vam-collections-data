The group includes Christ on the Cross and the Virgin (Museum nos 714 and 714A-1895 respectively). The figures of the Virgin and St John stand on a decorative console that was made separately. The backs of the figures are flat and uncarved. They have holes that show that dowels once held the figures in place against a background support. Crucifixion groups of this type were usually placed on a beam that supported the rood or cross in a church. They were also placed on top of a screen dividing the nave from the choir of the church. More rarely, they were placed against the wall above the chancel arch. In the 1400s, every church in Northern Europe had a so-called Calvary group. Most have been lost through fire, natural decay or architectural change. Some were destroyed during periods of religious unrest.",
