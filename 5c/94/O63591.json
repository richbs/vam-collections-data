This relief  depicts a remarkable vista of Sammeta-Sikhara, the Peak of Wisdom, the most holy of pilgrimage places for Jains. Jains of all sects believe that 20 of the 24 tirthankaras attained nirvana (ie, death) on the twenty peaks of this mountain. Sammeta-sikhara is situated near Madhuvan, in the Girdih District of Bihar. A winding path leads the pilgrims some six miles from the town of Madhuvan to the hill-shrines of the salvation-teachers. Tents, carriages, wagons and palanquins indicate the presence of pilgrims at the site, and hostels for pilgrims (dharamshalas) are visible in the foreground. A number of temples are to be seen in the lower left of the panel. These were built under the patronage of Svetambara sect and some date from the period of the Mughal emperor Akbar (r1556-1605). This tirtha continues to attract Jain pilgrims, and representations of this holiest of sites (be they relief panels of this kind or, as is more common, paintings on cloth or photographs) are often to be found in Jain households today.",
