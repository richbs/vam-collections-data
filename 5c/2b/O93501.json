Known as a shurjar, it may have been made for an Armenian church in Isfahan, which had a large Armenian population. \n\nArmenian priests wore this vestment to celebrate Mass. Its semi-circular form is similar to the western cope. The Crucifixion would have been at the priest\u2019s back, and the figures of Mary and the Archangel Gabriel formed an Annunciation scene on his chest. \n\nThis shurjar was woven as a carpet with a very fine silk pile. It is now fragmentary as a previous owner began to cut it up, probably to provide carpet samples.",
