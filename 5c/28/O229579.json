The edge down the left hand side is straight; the edge along the top is straight but a small triangular section has been cut from the top right hand corner.  The right hand edge curves down to meet the lower left hand corner, forming a point. This might have been part of a woman's chador. Dark blue-purple ground with off-set rows in a half-drop repeat with an upright stylised floral motif.  It has a diamond shaped base with small decorative extensions.  The stem has a pair of roundels near the base each containing a tiny flower.  The main flower is cone-shaped.  To either side of its lower petals is a butterfly.  All worked in metal thread [silver strip close s-wound on a white silk core] with details in pink, green and mauve silk. \nThe fabric is very faded but the original colours can be glimpsed along the right hand side where they have been protected by a seam.\nDark blue silk has been attached to parts of the upper area through which some conservation stitching has been worked.",
