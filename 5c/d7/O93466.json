It is likely to be a reworking of the painting, rather than a direct drawing from nature. The drawing, though, gives the scene a strikingly different character. Whereas the painting is bathed with sunlight and depicts busy water traffic, the drawing's dramatic use of tone creates an atmosphere of brooding melancholy. Line is hardly evident at all. Nearly all the forms are created with solid blocks of dark sepia ink, with few mid-tones. The tower of Dedham church can be seen in the distance, apparently threatened by the ominous and overhanging forms of the trees.",

C. A. Brooks has pointed out, the tower of Dedham Church is seen over the gate of Dedham Lock from a viewpoint close to that in No. 184 [FA 34]. This circumstance combined with the similar relationship which appears to exist between No. 411 [250-1888] and No. 347 [237-1888] suggests that both No. 410 [249-1888] and No. 411 [250-1888] are reworkings of earlier ideas rather than sketches after nature. No. 410 [249-1888] is probably a studio composition based upon the central portion of No. 184 [FA 34] \"Dedham Lock and Mill\" or one of the other versions listed in that entry. For a fuller discussion see \"Constable at Work\" by Graham Reynolds, <i>Apollo</i>, Vol. XCVI, July 1972, pp. 12-19.\n(See note following No. 411 [250-1888]).\u201d",
