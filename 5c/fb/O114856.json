She knows they were bought in Italy as Cellini's works, and that another set of 3 was acquired by Mrs. Bonar. \n \nChristie's sale, March 1898, lot 521\n'521. Two gold mounts chased and chiselled as cherubs' heads, richly enamelled in translucent colours; and a group of fruit and flowers, of similar workmanship.\nThese 3 pieces of goldsmith's work were formerly part of the decoration of a chalice said to be by Cellini (see correspondance)\nFrom the Poniatowski collection'\n\nBequeathed by Mr. F. Leverton Harris (1864-1926) on 25/06/1927 per her widow. They were in Mrs. Gurney's father's collection.",
