Collection purchased for 2400 francs including four additional fragments, one piece Hispano-Moresque and the other from the mantle of Don Felipe, called The Wise.\n\nWilliam Morris writes to recommend the purchase, 14 July 1893: 'This collection includes a great number of pieces of various dates and countries, ranging from the 10th to the 16th centuries, but the greater number of the 13th and 14th probably woven in Syria, Sicily and some few at Lucca. They are all of high excellence as works of art; the designs being very inventive, and of great beauty and thoroughly adapted to the material in which they are executed'.\n\nCollection registered no. 759 to 798-1893.\n\nPurchase price \u00a325.
