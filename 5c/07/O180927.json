            "public_access_description": "This is one of four plaster models for two stone friezes for Covent Garden Theatre (now the Royal Opera House), which were commissioned from Flaxman in 1809 by the architect Robert Smirke (1780-1867). The friezes represent the Ancient and Modern Drama. They were probably the first examples of the direct influence of the Parthenon marbles, which Flaxman had seen in 1807 when they were brought to England by Lord Elgin (and which are now in the British Museum). This one illustrates one half of  'Modern Drama' (as opposed to 'Ancient Drama'), and shows Shakespeare seated on the right, with figures from 'The Tempest' (Caiban, Prospero, Ferdinand and Miranda), Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and two figures in a chariot pulled by two oxen. It complements the relief showing Milton (A.11-1968).\n\nJohn Flaxman (1755-1826) was an English sculptor, designer and teacher. He was the most famous English Neo-classical sculptor of the late 18th century and the early 19th. He focused on monumental sculpture and church monuments and portrait busts. A large collection of his plaster models is held in the Strang Print Room, University College, London. He also made outline illustrations of Homer, Aeschylus and Dante. Many of those in his sketchbooks (now in the V&amp;A) were drawn from the antique while he was in Italy. Furthermore he produced models for pottery and silver supplying the pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood among others. He thus can be considered as an important pioneer in the development of Industrial Design.",

The friezes represent the Ancient and Modern Drama. They were probably the first examples of the direct influence of the Parthenon marbles, which Flaxman had seen in 1807 when they were brought to England by Lord Elgin (and which are now in the British Museum).\nGiven by Mr Barrs-Davies in 1968. Formerly in the possession of the donor's great-grandfather, the sculptor Henry Westmacott and by descent to his son the sculptor James Sherwood Westmacott. By descent to Mr H. Barrs-Davies and given by him to the Museum in 1968.",
