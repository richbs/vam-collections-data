It has a particular resonance with its depiction of an artist or designer's drawing equipment.\n\nNiczewski's jewellery is made from fine layers of natural and dyed wood veneer. At the beginning of the 1980s there was much experimentation in the use of non-precious materials for jewellery, and there was great interest internationally in Niczewski's application of this furniture-making technique to jewellery. His designs are exquisitely drawn and the pieces beautifully made, with careful consideration of the texture and grain of the wood as well as its colour.",
