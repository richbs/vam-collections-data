Each player chooses to be either Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin, Jeremy Fisher or Jemima Puddleduck. With the use of a dice the players take turns to 'race' round the path on the board. There are four different coloured paths, one for each character, which must be followed and the directions for forfeits and rewards indicated on some squares obeyed.  The players are subject to the adventures met on each of their respective paths.  The rest of the playing surface  is covered by illustrations related to the Beatrix Potter books and these characters.  The coloured paths are as follows:-  blue Peter Rabbit, pink, Jemima Puddle Duck, brown Squirrel Nutkin, green Jeremy Fisher.",
