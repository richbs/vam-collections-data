The role of the Favourite Slave was created by Vaslav Nijinsky, Zobeide by Ida Rubinstein and Barbier's print evokes their performances.  It was one of a series of prints illustrating Nijinsky's roles, published as  \"Vingt Dessins sur Vaslav Nijinsky\" with a foreword by Francis de Miomandre, published by La Belle Edition and subsequently by C.
