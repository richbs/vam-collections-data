'The Blindings' is the generic title for a group of works made between spring 1993 and winter 1994 comprising short and durational performances and sculptural installations held in various venues worldwide. The dramatic title is a reference to some lines from the 'Diamond Sutra' that strongly influenced the artist, in which the narrator's mental vision is awakened by blinding flashes of lightning, and by natural light striking waterdrops, bubbles or clouds. The gallery itself became the subject of the exhibition at the Serpentine, the artist finding inspiration in its physical space and atmosphere. A text written by Catling was spoken by him for nine consecutive days, eight hours a day. At moments the artist would move among a series of sculptural installations made predominantly of glass and perspex in each room of the gallery, engaging with them as part of his long dialogue, as well as venturing outside the building and into the park beyond. 'Moon book' is emblematic of the sculptural objects in the exhibition which were created in response to the gallery's physical elements of glass, concrete and other materials. An opaque perspex half moon emitting shards of glass and a transparent cylinder are mounted onto a platform of perspex. This in turn is mounted onto a sheet of safety glass crosshatched with strengthening wire, with a single sheet of unmarked white paper entrapped between the layers to create a luminary effect.",
