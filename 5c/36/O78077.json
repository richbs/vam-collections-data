This richly decorated chalice is in the Gothic style promoted by the architect A.W.N. Pugin and the Cambridge Camden Society ( later the Ecclesiological Society ). The architect, William Butterfield who designed the chalice, was often quite original in his interpretation of the Gothic style, as the elaborate patterning of  the coloured stones shows.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Butterfield (1814-1900), the designer of this chalice, trained as an architect and was appointed to supervise the Cambridge Camden Society's new scheme for the manufacture of church plate and furnishings in 1843. This chalice was made under the scheme by the official silversmith to the society, John Keith & Son. Henry Woodyer, the architect of the convent for which the chalice was commissioned, was a pupil of  William Butterfield.\n\nPlaces\nThe chalice was made for use at the House of Mercy convent ( now called the Convent of St John the Baptist ) at Clewer in Berkshire. It was presented by  Sister Elisabeth Morton, in the year after she took her vows as a nun, to be used in the new chapel that she had funded. The designer and architectural historian, Nicholas Pevsner, described the architectural style of the convent as 'joyless Gothic'.",

This was the first Anglican convent, and the subject of much controversy. The design of this chalice was something of a standard: in  1856, the Society published designs by Butterfield for chalices, which closely resemble this one. The Society's pronouncements on chalices were very specific - \"every part is wrought, casting not being allowable. The knop is generally pierced. This, and every other part, may be, and have been, elaborately jewelled and decorated with enamels\".",
