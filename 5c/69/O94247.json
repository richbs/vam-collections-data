The emperor is in armour and his wife is wearing gathered dress; both are crowned and wearing the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nLudwig Neufahrer was a medallist, goldsmith and diecutter, active in Austria, Germany and Bohemia. He was almost certainly trained in South Germany, later lived in Augsburg, Nuremberg and Linz, until he resided in Vienna in 1548. Probszt listed 111 medals by Neufahrer with portraits of royalty and members of the nobility, as well as leading citizens of the imperial cities of Augsburg and Nuremberg; there are also 10 medals with scenes from Classical mythology and the Bible. Neufahrer is regarded as the most important medallist working in Austria in his day.",
