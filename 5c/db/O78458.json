Most casters have a pierced top, as here, for sprinkling the condiments. On the grandest tables,  the sets of casters would be grouped around an epergne (an ornamental table piece, often with several bowls) displaying fruit, so that the guests could help themselves to the condiments.\n\nDesign\nCasters were made in a variety of styles reflecting the fashionable taste of the time. Most have an upright, vertical form, such as a cylinder, vase or pear shape, which can be easily held. The cover is generally in the form of a dome. The plain or octagonal pear-shaped casters, from which this caster derives, first made their appearance in 1700-1710.\n\nTrading\nCasters could be bought singly, as a set of  three or six, or as part of a centrepiece set. In 1750 the goldsmith George Wickes supplied a set of  silver casters to a Mr Mead for \u00a313 9s 2d, but he also made a silver vase caster for the Hon.  Arthur Hill for \u00a314 11s 6d. The high cost of the vase caster must reflect elaborate and expensive decoration.",
