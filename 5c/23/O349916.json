Vasari records that Sansovino designed a temporary facade in front of the Cathedral, and that scenes from the Old Testament were incorporated in it.\nSansovino (1486-1570) was an important Italian sculptor and architect, most notably known for his works related to the Piazza San Marco in Venice. The Biblioteca Marciana was according to Andrea Palladio the best building erected since antiquity and is undoubtedly his masterpiece. Other buildings are: the Zecca (public mint), the Loggetta, the sculptures adjoining the Campanile and a few reliefs and statues for the Basilica San Marco.",
