It depicts a scene set in the clouds, with the god Indra in the centre. He can be identified by his third eye and crown. The green demonic figure is meant to be playing a kettledrum and is probably a personification of the tempestuous storm. \n\nThese cave paintings date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas).\n\nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves. This is one of the approximately 300 paintings they produced.",

The figure to his left is probably his wife. The green demonic figure is meant to be playing a kettledrum and is likely to be a personification of the tempestuous storm. The two men above the demon may be representations of Indra\u2019s heaven, the Trayastrima. The two figures dressed as ascetics are Bramakayikas, god\u2019s from Brahama\u2019s heaven.",

They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the jatakas) and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is one.",
