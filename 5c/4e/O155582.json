The roundel and the band have been embroidered with white silk stitches forming tiny lozenge shapes.  On the roundel a small circular eyelet hole in [faded] magenta silk surrounded by a dozen or so rows of metal threads, the outer three rows couched with blue silk forming small triangular motifs.  Around this, a composite motif of a green 4-petalled rosette/cross form and a tear drop form in [faded] magenta chain stitch and 2 others in light green on long curving stems is repeated 4 times.  All are outlined in metal thread. This composite motif is repeated around the band 11 times. Both the roundel and the band edges are emphasized with 3 rows of metal thread couched with black silk in a triangular pattern.  The rim is further decorated between these rows with a row of looped and couched metal thread either side of 8 rows of couched metal thread. At the rim edge is a narrow binding of blue cotton decorated with metal thread.\nMetal Thread: silver-gilt strip close S-wound on a white silk core.",
