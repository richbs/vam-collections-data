It was first performed in the Apollo Theatre, New York before being produced by Arthur Collins at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in March and April of 1923. The story is set in the early 1800s and was inspired by The Life of Hoffman. This adaptation was written by Louis N. Parker, with music composed by E.N Reznicek. The play is set largely in Italy and centres upon the Angelo and his love for a beautiful girl named Giulia. Alongside the flashbacks to their doomed romance the audience learns of Angelo\u2019s latest composition, an opera inspired by his love for Giulia and entitled Undine. Various locations, time periods and characters interweave as Angelo anxiously waits to see his new opera will be received. Much to the dismay of Angelo\u2019s rival, the envious Cipriano, Angelo\u2019s opera is hailed as a masterpiece and the play concludes with Angelo\u2019s vision of the apotheosis of his work.  \n\nThe complexity of the plot and range of locations involved called for at least 18 scene changes, many of which were interspersed with \u2018Pictures\u2019 to develop the story. As a result the designer chose to create a set on which 6 scenes could be displayed on one stage with lighting being used to illuminate the relevant scene. The stage hands also had to dress in elaborate black headdresses and tunics when moving the scenery to prevent them distracting from the action. The scenery used in this production was built by R. Andrews and painted by Bruce Smith and Humphries & Watson. The \u2018electrical effects\u2019 were overseen by H. Mather.\n\nThe costumes were designed by Comelli and were made by B.J. Simmons &Co, Morris Angel & Sons Ltd, Mary E. Fisher Ltd and Mrs. F. Field. The Boots and Shoes were made by A.L. Gamba & Co and the wigs were by Clarkson. Comelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis design comes from a collection of costume designs (some of which are costumier's copies) which were originally part of the Archives of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.",
