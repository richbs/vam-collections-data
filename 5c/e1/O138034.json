In this particular photograph, the thinness of paper and dullness of albumen indicate an early example of that process dating from the 1850s to the 1860s.  It comes from an album of photographs from the Victorian metalworker Francis Skidmore's (1817-1896) firm. It is of ironwork railings which may have been made either at the firm's premises which were located in Coventry firstly at West Orchard from 1853 and secondly at Alma Street from 1859.  The photograph is thus a record of the work done.  Skidmore also produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork of which these railings are an example. There are printed designs for railings in a pattern book lettered 'Skidmore's Art Manufactures Co. Book of Designs' in Coventry Public Library. The firm was given this name in 1865.\n\nA description of Skidmore's factory details the buildings as comprising amongst other facilities 'two drawing offices, with collection of ornamental designs and photographs very ably executed' and a 'Photographic studio'.",
