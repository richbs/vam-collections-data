He lived in Japan. He stated that he is a member of the Japan Society and knows Col. Strange. He formerly had a wall-paper factory in Yokohama, Japan 'Rottmann, Strome & Co.'.\n\nPanels with the similar pattern, but from a 17th-century origin, are in the Deutsches Tapetenmuseum, Kassel, inventory number 91/91; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, inventory number RBK 18255; Gruuthuze Museum, Bruges, inventory number unknown; Museum of Decorative Arts, Prague, inventory number 2.519-2522.
