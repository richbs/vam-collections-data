He won a silver medal for his stained-glass work in his first year. In 1950 he exhibited his work in the galleries of the Royal Society of British Artists. At this time the authorities of Coventry Cathedral were looking for artists to produce works for the new building. Clarke\u2019s tutor, Lawrence Lee, encouraged him and his fellow student Keith New to submit designs for this work. They were given the job and they produced an abstract series of themes broadly based on the progress of Christian man through this life and the world of the life to come.\n\nWhen he completed his studies in 1952 Clarke was chosen by the Arts Council to represent Great Britain at the International Biennale Exhibition in Venice. He was awarded a silver medal.\n\nThe panel here was commissioned for a chapel in a private house in Scotland. It is an abstract scheme of light and colour playing through the variable thickness of the glass.",

In 1950 his work was exhibited in the galleries of the Royal Society of British Artists. At this time the authorities of Coventry Cathedral were looking for artists to produce new works for the cathedral. Clarke's tutor, Lawrence Lee, encouraged him along with his fellow student, Keith New, to submit designs for this new work. They were given the tender and the work produced was an abstract series of themes broadly based on the progress of Christian man through this life and the world of the life to come.\n\nWhen he completed his studies in 1952 Clarke was chosen by the Arts Council to represent Great Britain at the International Triennale Exhibition in Venice. He was awarded a Silver Medal.\n\nThe panel here was commissioned for a chapel in a private house in Scotland. It is an abstract scheme of light and colour playing through the variable thickness of the glass.",
