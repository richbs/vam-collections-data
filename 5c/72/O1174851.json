            "public_access_description": "In art history, a black madonna is a painting or sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary with dark or black skin, created in Europe in the late Medieval period. Some are made of dark or black materials such as ebony, others are said to have become blackened from the soot of candles, although this explanation and the significance of the Virgin's skin colour is contested. There are several hundred black madonnas in Europe and the topic has attracted a considerable literature in recent decades approaching the subject from anthropological, art historical, feminist, psychoanalytical and Afrocentric perspectives .\n\nThe Abbey of Einsiedeln is a Benedictine monastery dedicated to Our Lady of the Hermits and located in the village of Einsiedeln twenty miles southeast of Zurich. According to 9th and 14th century sources, the hermit St Meinrad (d. 861) was especially devoted to the Virgin and was given a miracle working statue of the Virgin and Child by Abbess Hildegard of Zurich around which he built a chapel. Following his murder, a church was built over this chapel. The new church was dedicated but not the chapel. In 948 Conrad of Constance was praying in the chapel when he witnessed Christ and the angels performing the dedication rites. A papal bull of 11th November 966 allowed the celebration of the anniversary of this miracle and granted remission of sins to pilgrims to the shrine. \n\nProbably published for sale as a souvenir of the shrine, this print is \"dressed\" with coloured and foil papers and printed woven textiles just as the carved and polychromed sculpture (likely a 14th century replacement) is dressed with robes woven with gold thread and jewels. The bright colours and foils used on the print suggest it may have been intended to have candles placed before it.",
