            "public_access_description": "Oliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nDer Rosenkavalier, an opera by Richard Strauss (1909-1910), was mounted at Glyndebourne in 1959 in tribute to Carl Ebert, who retired that year after 25 years as the director of Glyndebourne. Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959 and Der Rosenkavalier was his last production for the company. It was not one of his greatest successes. Strauss's bittersweet comedy of young love triumphant is set in the Vienna of the 1740s, during the reign of Empress Maria Theresa. Messel created a lavish rococo fantasy which was criticised for overcrowding the small stage with performers and scenery. The maidservant was one of the production's silent roles.",

The production designed by Oliver Messel was first performed by the Glyndebourne Festival Opera at Glyndebourne on 28 May, 1959.  It was directed by Carl Ebert and featured Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m as Octavian, Regine Crespin as the Marschallin and Anneliese Rothenberger as Sophie.  It was revived at Glyndebourne in 1960 and 1965. This was Messel's last production for Glyndebourne. \n \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.",
