The fragment has been associated with the tomb of Abbot Odo  (D.1151)which was destroyed during the French Revolution, on the strength of the inscription \"Odo\" next to the reading monk. Although there is not as yet sufficient evidence to be sure of the fragment's original function, the style of both the fragment and this capital point to a date around the middle of the twelfth century.\n\nIn the Middle ages the lion was a common symbolic beast, as a symbol of the resurrection because, according to the bestiaries, the cubs when born lay dead for three days until their father brought them to life by breathing in their faces. The lion was the symbol of saints Jerome, Aidan, Euphemia, and Thecla and the animals are linked to eastern monasticism having helped to dig the graves of the desert hermits Antony the Great, Paul the hermit, Onuphrius and Mary of Egypt.\n\nReading played a central part in  medieval monastic life. Lectio Divinia - sacred reading - i.e. the reading of the scriptures and the Church Fathers Origen, Jerome, Augustine and Gregory the Great, was prescribed by the rule of St Benedict as one of the most important occupations of the monastic day. Reading could be conducted as private study as depicted on this capital or publicly with readings given in the chapter house, refectory or monastic church. Customaries reveal which books were issued to monks and how little the titles on the reading list changed between the mid eleventh and mid twelfth centuries. The lists include not only the scriptures and Church Fathers, but Smaragdus on The Rule, the Lives of the Saints, Bede, Alcuin and Rhamanus Marus and histories by Josephus and Eusebius which formed a programme of monastic study.",
