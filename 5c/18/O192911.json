Franke began producing pen plotter drawings in the late 1960s in collaboration with the Siemens research laboratory in Munich.  A pen plotter is a mechanical device that holds a pen or brush and is linked to a computer that controls its movements.  Plotters were one of the few output devices available to artists working with computers in the 1960s and early 1970s.  The limitations of the plotter explain, in part, the linear, geometric appearance of much early computer-generated art, such as this print.\n\nHerbert W. Franke is a pioneering figure in the history of computer art.  In 1971, he produced one of the first accounts of computer art entitled 'Computer Graphics, Computer Art'.  In 1979, he co-founded the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, an annual event that unites art and technology.  Franke is also well known as a successful author of science fiction novels.",
