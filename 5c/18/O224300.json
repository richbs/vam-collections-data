The embroidered gauze means it probably was intended to be worn as a garment for the summer.\n\nThe symbols adopted in this robe (such as the embroidered dragon) and the rock formation suggest an association with the Imperial Court of the Qing Dynasty. The dragon bears five-claws, suggesting that the panel would be used by royalty; however this does not mean necessarily that the intended wearer was necessarily of high rank, and the carelessly embroidered shape of the dragon's mouth is in fact rather awkward.\n\nIn general, a more limited dress-code appeared to have been available for women ranking down from the Empress and Imperial Consorts to wives of officers of the Seventh rank. (Men had a range of court dress for specific occasions). Even the Emperor's wives and concubines did not necessarily always wear robes decorated with dragons.  Women also had sets of clothes made for auspicious celebrations such as weddings or the birthdays of older wearers, and the clothes made for these occasions were worn for future events of importance.",
