Tiny lozenges flavoured with roses, violets, liquorice, mint or cloves would freshen the breath, calm a cough or settle a stomach. The boxes were inspired by porcelain versions from Meissen, Chelsea and the French soft-paste factories but the huge variety of novelty designs for enamelled bonbonni\u00e8res was the result of the competitive imaginations of their West Midlands makers. \n\nThe design of bonbonni\u00e8res often responded to a European taste for the \u2018exotic\u2019. This box sought to satisfy this demand by presenting the scene of a leopard attacking a black man on its lid. The leopard has pinned its victim to his back and closed its jaws around the man\u2019s arm, from which blood pours. A witticism may have been intended as the man holds a bow in his right hand, suggesting that the hunter has become the hunted.",
