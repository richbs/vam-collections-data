It shows the bearded figure of St. John the Baptist on a larger scale than the other figures, wearing a camel-skin and a cloak, half kneeling in prayer facing inwards. A scroll rises from his hands, presumably interceding for the souls about to be judged. A naked figure steps from a tomb, hands held together in prayer. Two small figures, one kneeling, are seen in front of the tomb. Three naked figures stand behind the open tomb.\n\nThe heads of one of the kneeling figures and of the figure stepping from the tomb are missing. The top, left side and bottom of the panel are missing. There are traces of green paint and the usual daisy pattern on the ground. The inscription on the scroll is lost. There are traces of gilding on the hair and beard of St. John the Baptist. There is one lead-plugged hole in the back of the fragment with latten wire attached. The panel has been cut away at the bottom.",

A scroll rises from his hands, presumably interceding for the sould about to be judged. A naked figure steps from a tomb, with hands held together in prayer.",
