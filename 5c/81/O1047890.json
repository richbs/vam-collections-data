Inscription (verso): No  (?) 79 x 142 mm (stereoscopic) PH 457-1968:76 Literature:  Microfilm: 3.19.11 This is the only photograph of sculpture in the V&A Hawarden collection. However, in a private collection there is a photograph which has been attributed to Lady Hawarden of a small bronze of a dancing peasant girl, in the style of J.E. Boehm. The origin of this classical bust, or copy, is unknown, but-\u00adgiven its apparent setting--it may have been one of the remnants of the formal gardens at Dundrum, altered in the 18th century to the picturesque landscape shown in Lady Hawarden's photographs. In 1776, the agriculturalist Arthur Young noted that Dundrum had previously been 'ornamented in the modern stile of improvement: the house was situated in the midst of all the regular exertions of the last age. Parterres, parapets of earth, straight walks, knots and clipt hedges, all of which [have been] thrown down [ \u2022\u2022\u2022 ] '. (Arthur Young, Arthur Young's Tour in Ireland (1778-1779), ed. Arthur Wollaston Hutton. 2 volumes, London 1892. I, 392.) Compare to Roger Fenton's photographs of sculpture in the British Museum.
