He made the etching After Constable's Elm(for which this is the printing plate) around the time of the large exhibition of work by John Constable held in Paris in 2002 (he selected the exhibition, and the small painting Elm (1821) was one of the works included in the show.) The British Council published a book of conversations between Freud and the exhibition curator, critic William Feaver, called Freud on Constable; the print was made especially for this book. The V&A has an impression of the print (E.1063-2003).\n\nThe plate is of added interest because Marc Balakjian, the printer, persuaded Freud to cancel the plate unobtrusively by adding his initials top left, rather than by scoring or punching through the image.",
