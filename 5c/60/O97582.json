            "public_access_description": "These crossbow bolts (also called 'quarrels') are typical of those produced in Germany from around 1450 to 1550. They are fitted with a mixture of leather and wooden flights, in some cases curved slightly to spiral along the shaft causing the bolt to spin in flight increasing its distance and potential for penetrating its target.\n\nThe heads of bolts came in a variety of shapes and sizes and were designed for purpose. The heads of these bolts are warheads of forged steel, their heavy construction and robust four-sided tips designed to pierce armour and fell horses. Others used in hunting had fine chisel-shaped or forked heads for severing the hamstrings of large game, or blunt wooden heads for stunning small animals. Some crossbow bolts, common in Russia, were pierced so that they whistled through the air terrifying enemy horses and slowing their cavalry charges. Other bolts were in the form of socketed arrows whose stems were packed with incendiaries which when fired in unison rained fire down on besieged troops and castles.\n\nCrossbows for war were particularly useful during sieges. They were much slower to re-load than the traditional longbow and suited armies in entrenched positions. Tests on crossbows of the European 15th century type show that, depending on the size of the bow, the bolts can reach a range of between 300 and 350 metres and are most effective up to 100 metres.\n\nCrossbow bolts were produced in huge numbers. In 1411 in the city of Frankfurt ordered \"4000 new bolts trimmed to fit crossbow-nuts\" while in 1420 at Schlochau the bolt room contained 63 chests full, with each chest containing around 200-250 bolts.",
