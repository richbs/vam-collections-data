They are only 12 centimetres high, and may therefore have been made for display in a glazed 'china cabinet'. Such cabinets begin to appear in furniture pattern-books during the 1750s. Alternatively, they may have been intended for a woman's dressing table, or for display on wall brackets or a chimneypiece.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe sphinxes may have been modelled by Nicholas Sprimont (1716-1771), the manager of the Chelsea factory, and were possibly inspired by French bronze firedogs. Sprimont was one of the few British porcelain entrepreneurs with design skills: writing before 1752, a contemporary noted that Sprimont 'supplies or directs the models of everything' made at the Chelsea factory, and surviving drawings show that he was a skilful draughtsman and designer. He was born in Li\u00e8ge and trained on the Continent. As a consequence, he was much more familiar with European Rococo design than his competitors in the British porcelain trade.",
