Givenchy first met Hepburn during the shoot for the film Sabrina in 1953. He subsequently went on to design almost all her outfits in her contemporary films, as well as providing clothes for her off-screen wardrobe.\n\nGivenchy understood perfectly that Audrey Hepburn's clothes should be glamorous without distracting from her good looks. She looked best in crisply cut, elegant garments with superb detailing, such as this evening dress. This simple white crepe gown is encrusted with pale-coloured sequins, artificial flowers and embroidery. The subtle colouring of the embroidery ensured that it did not distract from the wearer's dark-haired beauty.",
