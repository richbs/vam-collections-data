It complemented the simple lines of the high-waisted dresses and created a slender-bodied look.\n\nThe seams on the back are close together on the shoulders and almost meet at the waist, forming a diamond-shape. This gives the appearance of a very small back, emphasised by the oversleeves which are set extremely far in. The construction is similar to that of gowns made in the 1630s when the sleeves were also set very far into the back. \n\nInverted pleats at the centre back give shape and fullness to the skirt. A small roll or pad was often attached under the back of the dress to create a subtle roundness and help the fabric hang in fan-like folds.",
