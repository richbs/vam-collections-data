This example, however, is larger and more elaborate than normal and was probably made specifically for display in the Great Exhibition of 1851.\n\nPeople\nThis shrine was probably made by a member of the small Bhaskara caste of Vaishnavites (followers of the god Vishnu), who were traditionally responsible for manufacturing ivory images of Hindu deities in Bengal.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe art of ivory carving has been practised throughout India for thousands of years. In the mid-19th century, when this shrine was made, elephant ivory (much of it imported from Africa) was readily available; and yet Sir George Watt, writing 50 years later, observed that nowhere in India was ivory carving as common as might have been expected and that a fair amount of imported hippopotamus, walrus and fossilised mammoth ivory from Siberia was also used. By the late 20th century, conservation concerns had largely put a stop to the ivory trade, and nowadays few craftsmen make use of the material.",

Lakshmi and Saraswati are on her right and left, Ganesha and Kartikeya on the outside, accompanied by their vahanas, a rat and a peacock. A semi-circular frieze above the group depicts mythological scenes.\nThis would have been made by members of the Bhaskara caste and was one of their most popular subjects. It is interesting for the way it arranges architectural elements borrowed from 18th century Neo-classicism in a completely un-European manner. The subject occurs in other media in the exhibition, for example on a woodcut no.121 and on pot-lids no.167.\nIllus. (woodcut) Cole [1874] facing p.131\nCf.
