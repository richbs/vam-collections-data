There is one incomplete selvedge. \nColours: red, blue, yellow faded to grey, mauve.\n\nThe central panel with an off-white ground contains a roundel 36 cm in diameter with a multi-petalled red flower head and a 15-pointed blue star leading to alternate motifs consisting of a vase with a flowering plant or a blue cypress tree and a heart-shaped form.  A narrow blue  border frames this composition and in turn is surrounded by blue ogival pendants containing small floral motifs. There are two types of floral meander with a blue stem and exotic blossoms, predominantly red, framed a narrow band edged in blue containing lozenges with small floral motifs.  This leads into a wider band bearing a blue stem meander and large and small flower heads similar to those in the main field.\nIn the corners is a small diagonal vase and floral spray with a cypress tree. This  frame continues with a yellow ground band containing a flower head; there are five versions of this flower head. [referred to as band a].\nThere are two long side panels with a blue and yellow ribbon-like meander containing small floral elements and entrapping large, exotic blossoms.  This pattern goes up one side and down the other.\nAlong the top and bottom are single botehs reserved in white containing a vase and cypress tree framed by two floral sprays.  These alternate with a small cypress and vase motif with a broken link to a feather-like form.  The botehs point to  the centre and those in the top band face the opposite directions to those in the bottom .\nEverything is framed by a series of barrow borders, printed as one block.  These include a repeat of  band [a] edged either side by a small repeating pattern of arch forms and flower heads and cypress trees.",
