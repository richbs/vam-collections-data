Taking the outer appearances of things as the basis of a common vocabulary for communication he shaped his images to create signs for deeper experience: love, jealousy, anxiety and death. \nIn this woodcut Munch returned to a motif that he first begun to explore in paintings, drawings and an etching of 1895.  The etching shows a couple before a window, with the curtains open and lights on in the buildings opposite.  Between 1897, when he cut the first woodblock version of <i>The Kiss</i>, and 1902, when this version was completed, Munch distilled the essence of the kiss from the more circumstantial narrative of the early etching to this iconic abstraction. \nArms encircling each other, the two lovers seem to have become one.  With their features undefined, their faces merge in a single shape.  The contours of the embracing couple mark the edge of one woodblock, which Munch cut out and printed over a background taken from another block - an uncut plank whose grain forms its only design.  In an earlier version Munch printed the whole image from a single block, cutting out the figures in order to ink them in a different colour from the background before reassembling the pieces like a jigsaw to print the image.  The use of two blocks brings mew meaning to the image.  The two colours and two different woodgrains intermingle across the figures so that they seem to hover in and out of the plane of the uncut wood: it is as if they are seen through driving rain or insubstantially, as an idea or in a memory.  In another of Munch's prints, <i>The Lonely Ones</i>, on which a man and a woman are shown looking out to sea, the woman was printed from one block, and the man and beach from another, the different blocks symbolic of their spiritual separation.  In contrast, the overs in <i>The Kiss</i> have been united forever in a single block of wood.  The independence of this black from the background perhaps symbolizes the lovers' oblivion to their surroundings: technique is fused with meaning.\"",
