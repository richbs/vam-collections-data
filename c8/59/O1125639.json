It still has its own security force, the Beadles, originally installed by Lord Cavendish to enforce a code of behaviour which forbade whistling, running, singing, babies' prams, playing musical instruments, carrying large parcels or opening umbrellas.\n\nThat William Dawson also had some form of royal warranty (the supply of goods to the royal household) further emphasises that these shoes would originally have been both expensive and exclusive in origin.",
