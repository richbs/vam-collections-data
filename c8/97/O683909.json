The following is the full text of the entry: school of MARATTA, CARLO 743 Clementia: an allegory on the pontificate of Pope Clement X Pen and ink and wash; rectangular with semicircular ends at bottom and top 23 1/8 x 13 7/8 (587 x 351) 9119 PROVENANCE Bought 1883 As Mr Pouncey has observed, the drawing is connected with the fresco in the Sala della Udienza in the Palazzo Altieri, Rome (painted soon after 1670; Voss, Barock, p. 598; pI. 346). The drawing is hardly by Maratta's hand; but it was possibly made by an assistant at some stage in the preparation of the design, because it is drawn on three separate sheets of paper which are cut out in irregular shapes and fitted together in a way that shows that the artist was making corrections. In the fresco the figure of Abundance is differently posed and holds the cornucopia on her other side. But the drawing corresponds in this and most other respects with the bozzetto in the Palazzo (Amalia Mezzetti, \u2018Contributi a Carlo Maratti\u2019 in Rivista dell\u2019Istituto Nazionale d\u2019 Archeologia e Storia dell\u2019Arte, N.S, 4, 1955, p. 286, pl/ 34 and p. 339). There is a rough design for the composition by Maratta at Dusseldorf (Ann Sutherland Harris and Eckhard Schaar, Die Handzeichnungen von Andrea Sacchi and Carlo Maratta, Dusseldorf, 1967, no. 258; pl. 57, as well as 20 sheets of studies for separate figures: op. cit., nos. 256-57, 258-76)",
