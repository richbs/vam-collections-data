The body of the cross is made from thin sheet gold cylinders, decorated with applied wire, red and green enamel circles, and white enamel beads with a blue dot in the centre.  There is a wire motif in each of the angles.  At the end of each arm is a domed open filigree rosette, with a loop in its centre, encircled by a ring of ribbon wire coils.  The loop at the top is larger than the other three, for suspension. The three lower loops each have a short wire pendant with two tiny pearls either side of a larger garnet bead.  The body of Christ is made from stamped sheet gold.",
