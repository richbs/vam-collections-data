He was \u2018discovered\u2019 by an agent in Ireland who brought him to England to exhibit him in Bristol in 1782, and by about 1785 came to London where he exhibited himself very profitably at 30, St. James Street. \u2018Giants\u2019 bodies were of great interest to anatomists \u2013 something of which O\u2019Brien was hugely fearful, and despite leaving enough money for a lead-lined casket and burial beneath rock, O\u2019Brien\u2019s body was still disinterred in 1972 for medical research.\n\nThe dwarf Joseph Boruwlaski (1739-1837) was born in Poland in 1739, adopted by a local official when he was nine and was later acquired by Countess Humiecka. When he was fifteen she took him to Vienna, and in 1760 to Paris where he started his career as a curiosity and a cultured and talented singer and musician. He came to London in the 1780s where he obtained the patronage of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire and was presented to the future King George lV and the rest of the royal family. The title of Count was probably a marketing ploy to emphasise his cultured reputation, much as Tom Thumb had been given the title of General. Although O'Brien and Boruwlaski both started their careers under management, they eventually left ownership to manage themselves. \u2018",
