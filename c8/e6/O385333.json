These are either for a writing box (suzuribako) or for a cigarette case. In a Japanese book devoted to his drawings and lacquerwork, the range of object types and designs are far more extensive including, for example, sake cups and items of Japanese furniture. They are interesting not only as drawings but as design drawings that give an insight into the workings of Koda Sh\u00fbetsu.\n\nKoda Sh\u00fbetsu was born Koda Kaichiro but adopted the name Sh\u00fbetsu out of admiration and respect for Hon'ami K\u00f4etsu (1558-1637). K\u00f4etsu, a potter, lacquerer and calligrapher, is considered one of the instigators of an art movement and style that later became known as Rinpa. In the field of lacquer, K\u00f4etsu pioneered an innovative style that used relatively simple black and gold lacquer techniques, together with inlaid mother-of-pearl shell and base metals. The influence of Rinpa and K\u00f4etsu in particular can be seen in many of Sh\u00fbetsu's drawings and lacquerwork.",
