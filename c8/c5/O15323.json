The three main square panels of cutwork are surrounded by a zig-zag border of stylised acorns and flowers worked with cream silk in satin and overcast stitches. Between them are lines of embroidery, worked in satin stitch to form geometric patterns.\n\nThe cutwork panels are filled with three bands of reticella and hollie point lace. \n\nThe first band consists of four squares of hollie point: one with heart and crowns motifs, one with acorn and crowns, one with lily, and one of  diamond pattern. In the centre, there is one square of reticella needle lace.\n\nThe second band consists of three large squares: one of hollie point with a parrot and diamond motifs, one of reticella, and one of hollie point with a lamb and floral motifs. Between the squares there are two embroidered plants.\n\nThe third band consists of two hollie point squares with floral motifs, followed by a reticella square and two further hollie point squares with floral motifs. The last one is dated 1739.\n\nBetween the three bands are two rows of cutwork roundels. Those in the upper row are filled with needle lace stitches, and those in the lower row are filled with needle lace and hollie point flowers. There is a large central oval with the name of the maker worked in hollie point.",

This sampler was worked in a needle lace stitch called hollie point, most examples of which date from the second quarter of the 18th century. Hollie point was a practical stitch to learn, used particularly for decorative insertions into baby clothes and occasionally adult garments. Exact counterparts of the patterns worked in hollie-point samplers can be found in surviving clothing.",
