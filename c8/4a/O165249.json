            "public_access_description": "Guan Di, the God of War, is a popular figure in Chinese mythology and culture. His image comes from an historical figure, Guan Yu (about 161-220), a general who helped Liu Bei to establish the Shu Han dynasty in AD 221. After his death, he was venerated as a loyal and righteous figure, until he was given the title of an emperor in AD 1594. With the name Guan Di, he was worshipped in temples and households as the daoist God of War and patron of honest merchants. \n\nIn addition to large statues placed in city's temples, smaller wooden or porcelain images of Guan Di were made for worship. In this example, produced at the Dehua kilns in southern China around 1600-1650, Guan Di is depicted wearing a scholar's gown over a full armour. The figure would have been placed on an altar in a household or in a temple.",
