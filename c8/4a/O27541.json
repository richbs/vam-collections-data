Of these, the favourite Esmeralda occupies twelve, Dorothy nine, Waverley six, Peeping tom four, Maid Marian three and Mr. Pickwick two.\nThe following odds against several horses are therefore mathematically correct:-\nagainst Esmeralda 2 to 1\n     \"      Dorothy     3 to 1\n     \"      Waverley   5 to 1\n     \"      Peeping Tom  8 to 1\n     \"      Maid Marian  11 to 1\n     \"      Mr. Pickwick  17 to 1\n     \"      Bolter        35 to 1\n\nEVEN CHANCES\nThose who prefer playing on Even Chances can do so by backing Esmeralda and Waverley (coupled) against The Field, these two horses together occupying 18 divsions of the 36.  In the same way The Field can be backed against Esmeralda and Waverley coupled.\n\nRULES\n1.  The player taking the bank is called the Bookmaker.  He need not lay the odds against any horse oftener than he chooses, and it is optional with him to refuse to allow any stakes larger than those agreed upon at the commencement of the game.  Bolter cannot be backed at all without his consent.\n2.  A player must pay his stake when he backs a horse.\n3.  The disc must be spun with sufficient force to make it revolve at least six times; failing this it is a False Start and does not count.\n4.  The winning horse is that which occupies that division of which any part is opposite the winning post line when the disc comes to a stop.\n5.  In the rare event of one of the lines of division exactly coinciding with that of the winning post, t is a dead heat and each winner receives half only of what he would have been entitled to as an absolute winner.\n7.  Before commencing play, a judge should be appointed, who decision as to a dead heat must be final.",
