The relevant text is as follows: SCHOOL UNKNOWN: late 16th century 577 Half length figure of a young woman, full face, with folded arms: probably a study for a caryatid; in the lower right corner a study for drapery for the same figure Inscribed on the mount in ink and again in pencil \u2018Pierin del Vaga\u2019; the same name inscribed also on the back with an account of the artist in French Black chalk, slightly heightened with white on pale brown paper 10 1/8 x 7 \u00bc (257 x 183) CAI.1049 PROVENANCE Unidentified mark (on the back) constituting an indistinct coat of arms surmounted by a crown, stamped in blue ink; Ionides Bequest 1901 (Lugt 488) LITERATURE <i>Ionides Catalgoue</i>, p. 10 (attributed to Perino del Vaga) In defence of the old attribution to Perino it might be maintained that the design was a first diea for one of the caryatids in the basamento of the Stanza dell Segnatura, painted by Perino under Paul III. For an illustration see P. P. Montagnani, <i>Illustrazione storico-pittorica\u2026delle pitture nelle stanze vaticane</i>, Rome, 1833, pl. 9. None of these figures corresponds exactly with the drawing, but there is a similarity in the arrangements of the draperies, and one of the female figures has her hair falling over her chest in two plaits, as in the drawing. Netherless the handling of the drawing is too unlike Perino to justify an attribution to him.",
