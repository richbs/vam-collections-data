            "public_access_description": "Sarah Lucas is one of the best known of the so-called 'Young British Artists' who graduated from Goldsmith's in the 1980s, exhibited in the seminal warehouse show, Freeze, curated by fellow artist Damien Hirst, and has work in the Saatchi Collection.\n\nLucas has generally presented herself as laddish lager-swilling androgynous figure, and her work has continually referred to or borrowed from working-class culture, and its verbal and visual languages. This is the invitation for an exhibition of her work in Berlin in 2002 and shows footballer Charlie George; George was an archetypal working-class hero, famous as a key player for Arsenal Football Club in the 1970s. With his ever-changing hairstyles, and fluent foot-balling skills, he was regularly featured in the tabloid newspaper headlines. Lucas brings together this iconic image of George with a collage of imagery and advertising for pizzas. \n\nThis card is a good example of Lucas's characteristic use of motifs from popular culture, and her strategies of assemblage and appropriation. It takes the form of a so-called volvelle menu, in which a circle of card inside the outer sleeve can be turned, showing the various menu options through a cut-out aperture.",
