Catholic silver used in celebrating the mass did not therefore bear the marks of the goldsmith. The inscription on this paten and its associated chalice indicates that they were made to commemorate the marriage of Heugh Mawdesley and his wife Jennet in 1584. It is not known where this couple lived but the idea of commissioning a chalice in celebration of a marriage is particularly associated with Irish Catholic practice and it is therefore possible that the Mawdesleys had Irish connections. The chalice and paten are today associated with the parish of Our Lady of Compassion, Formby, Lancashire. This may indicate that the Mawdesleys were resident in an area which was strongly associated with  the Catholic faith in the 16th century and remains so today.",
