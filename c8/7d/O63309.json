He meditated in a forest so long that vines grew around his legs and birds nested in his hair. \n\nIn 948 AD the Ganga general Chamundaraya commissioned a monumental rock-cut image of Bahubali created at Shravana Belgola in the 10th century. This image inspired small devotional images of Bahubali that are popular in southern India. Such images were for household use and were often bought back by pilgrims to one of the Jain \u2018tirthas\u2019 (pilgrim sites). Others were made at other centres of Jainism.",
