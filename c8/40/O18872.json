The bonnet is made in a traditional style, from three pieces: a central panel which is a slightly tapering rectangle, and an approximately D-shaped piece at each side of it, all edges being covered with a binding of synthetic magenta velour.  The fabric print is clearly of one design, although each of the three pieces shows a different part of it: there is a linking trellis theme, with the true right side showing a pink peony and a piece of trelllis, with a trace of the design from the centre panel; the centre panel shows a climbing plant with five-petalled red/ pink flowers against a pink trellis; the true left side shows a similar part of the deisgn to that on the other side but with the addition of an ochre-coloured butterfly.  The bonnet fastens under the chin with tying strings of velour to match the binding.",
