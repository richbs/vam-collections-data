Pope-Hennessy).\n\nThe figure reproduces a bronze statuette in the Studiolo of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. The subject of the bronze is variously identified as Venus or Galatea.\n\nStoldo Lorenzi (1534-1583) was initially influenced by Pierino da Vinci. He was employed as a bronze sculptor in the Duomo at Pisa (1582) and in the Studiolo of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.",
