A pierced and carved apron hangs below the frieze on the sides and front, that at the front centreing on addorsed scrolls set with flower heads and bound together below a trio of leaves, with bell flower swags running from the flower heads and tied with ribbons at each side to the outer scroll running in from the leg to the apron.",

The S-scrolled, \u2018cabriole\u2019 legs were fashionable from the 1720s to the 1760 but the formal flower heads on the front apron derive from neo-classical ornament that only entered fashionable design after about 1760.  Such black and gold japanned decoration was first developed in the 1680s to imitate imported Asian lacquer. It remained fashionable on and off throughout the 18th century and was in demand again in the Regency period and again in the mid-19th century. \n\nAlthough the table was purchased as English, we now think that it is likely to have been made in one of the German states. The strong contrast between japanning and gilding is much more often seen in German furniture than English.  The construction wood appears to be birch. If this were to be proved by analysis, it would be another indicator of German origin.\n\nOn loan to Cliffe Castle Museum.",
