Jesus and his disciples are on a boat, sailing on the Sea of Galilee, when a tempest arises. The disciples panic and implore Christ to help them. He rebukes them for their lack of faith and then calms the storm. \n\nThis story was often portrayed to show that faith in God will protect us, even in the darkest hour.\n\nThe arms, two arrows in satire, are those of Dr Wernerus Pfeil, parish priest of St Anna in Steinerberg, in the Swiss canton Schwyz.\n\nThe painting is thought to be by Michael Muller IV. who was a glass-painter in Zug in Switzerland. There were numerous glass-painting workshops in Switzerland in the 16th and 17th centuries. The skill of the Swiss painters was famous, and in the 19th and 20th centuries their works were highly collectable.\n\nThe roundel is painted in enamels on clear glass. In the middle of the 16th century, new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass; similar to painting onto a canvas. To produce the colours, metallic oxides were added to a glass frit mixture. The resulting colour range included delicate pinks, reds and purples.",

Jesus Christ and his disciples are on a boat, sailing on the Sea of Galilee. A tempest arises and the disciples panic and beseech Christ for help. He rebukes them for their lack of faith and then calms the storm. \n\nThis story was often portrayed to show that even in the darkest hour, faith in God will protect you.\n\nThe arms, two arrows in satire, are those of Dr. Wernerus Pfeil, parish priest of St. Anna in Steinerberg, in the Swiss canton Schwyz.\n\nThe painting is attributed to Michael Muller IV who was a glass-painter in Zug in Switzerland. Glass-painting workshops were numerous in Switzerland in the 16th and 17th centuries. The skill of the Swiss painters was renowned at the time and their works were highly collectable in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe roundel is painted in enamels on clear glass. In the middle of the sixteenth century, new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass; similar to painting onto a canvas. The colours were produced by adding metallic oxides to a glass frit mixture and the resulting colour range included delicate pinks, reds and purples.",
