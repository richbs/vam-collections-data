He originally made mechanical toys and moved on to model soldiers in the 1890s. It is his son, William Britain Junior (1860-1933) who is credited with inventing the hollow-casting process for which the company became famous.  This type of soldier came on the market in 1893 and was taken on immediately by the famous London toystore, Gamages. The hollow-casting process involved using less material and resulted in a lighter, cheaper product, giving Britains a competitive edge over its rivals, who were in the main, German firms.",
