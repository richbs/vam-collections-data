This gives the illusion of a single three-dimensional image when viewed through a stereoscope designed to hold it. Sometimes these images were coloured by hand in paints or inks to make them more life-like. The colouring here of the carpet, tablecloth, walls and curtains brings out the detail in the heavily-patterned interior typical of the mid-Victorian home.\n\nOwnership & Use\nStereographs were mass produced. Viewing them was a popular amusement carried out in the home from the 1850s until the early 20th century.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn this image, a group is posed taking tea from a silver tea set and china cups and saucers. Domestic scenes of a model family like this - or of the institutions of society such as school, church or marriage - were typical subjects of popular stereographs.",
