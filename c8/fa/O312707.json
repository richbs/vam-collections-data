He was celebrated for his astonishing ability to produce 'living' marble sculpture. Bernini produced a series of dramatic over-life-size sculptures for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, including Pluto and Proserpine, Apollo and Daphne and David. One of Bernini's greatest works is the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome, which houses the famous Ecstacy of St Theresa. Bernini was patronised by a succession of popes and worked extensively at St Peter's Basilica, where he created the baldacchino (canopy), Cathedra Petri and two papal tombs, as well as designing St Peter's Square with its colonnades, and the great ceremonial staircase to the Vatican Palace.",
