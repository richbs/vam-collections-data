Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nStripes; two patterns alternating.\n[1] yellow ground with green silk embroidered meander linking blue rosette flower, green star flower [occasionally blue, dark blue, dark purple] and red [occasionally orange] buds.\n[2] white ground with red [or occasionally orange] curving leaves which form a line of ogival compartments each containing 3 green and blue round flowers above a blue trefoil or 3 blue pointed flowers above a red trefoil.\nThere is a blue trefoil and a red bud off-set to either side of the ogival compartment. Red bands separate the stripes and form a line above and below.\nThe embroidery has been cut across the top.  Probably this was taken from a larger piece.  The facing seems to be of a later date.  Note: this is not bias-cut.\nBorder: dark blue ground with yellow embroidered meander and red or white blossoms. Some of the seams have black woollen thread stitched over them with white or light yellow thread.  The remainder has decayed.\n\nEmbroidery thread: 2S; green, yellow, blue, white, dark brown [used with yellow in left and right hand white ground stripes.\nInserts: dark blue, blue, red, orange, dark pink, green, yellow, white.",
