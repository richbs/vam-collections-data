The whole is cast in two halves down the length and held together with tongue and slot joints. It is lithographed in bright colours to show a reddish brown and black horse with yellow and pale blue trim and a rider in a red jacket; black top hat and boots and white breeches. The clockwork mechanism is housed inside the body and covered with a metal plate cut out to allow the front legs to move. The back legs are a separate cast pinned to the plate with tongue and slot joints. The integral key protrudes from the body at the left flank and when wound; only the front legs move causing the whole to hop along. This is a development from the earlier versions when both sets of legs moved.",
