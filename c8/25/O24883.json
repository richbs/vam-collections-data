This form is particularly revered by the Gelukpa (or dGe lugs pa) order.  Clay was, and still is, widely used for images in Tibet, but the fragility of such images means that they are rarely seen outside the country. The inclusion of human bone ash may suggest that this was a commemorative image made partly as a shrine incorporating the remains of a revered religious figure.\n\nThe anger of Mahakala, shown in the surounding aureole of flames, roaring mouth and bulging eyes, is directed at the enemies of the Buddhist religion. His attributes, including the crown of skulls, garland of severed heads and chopper and skull cup (held by the two inner hands), all represent the means of destroying and transforming inner or outer obstacles to enlightened awareness.",
