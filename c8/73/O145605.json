This is not a dominant central shape; it is  surrounded by four green horizontal S-shapes and pairs of spots.  Mid-way along each side is an elegant circular motif of six swirling leaves coming from a small blue flower.  Below these, along the edhe of the border is a pair of  composite blossoms.  In each corner is a rigid diagonal stem with blue flowers and several pairs of leaves.  Above this is a bird facing to the right.\nThe border is green satin with an irregular flower head in either red/white or blue/white from which emerges a pair of stems with a split-leaf - it creates the impression of an interrupted meander.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: light blue, blue, red, black, white, green.\nMetal thread: silver and silver-gilt strips [also known as plate].  Couched with silk, the strip is bent back and hammered in place forming a zigzag across the line of the design.\nSome of the under-drawing can be seen where the metal thread has worn.\nSome of the leaves have been worked over a slight padding of silk threads.\nBacking: silk with red warp and green weft.\nFacing: blue satin",
