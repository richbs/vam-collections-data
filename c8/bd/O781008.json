This drawing is carried out in Chambers's rapid pen-and-ink sketching style, although it may be drawn by John Yenn. The design is unusual as it contains more Franco-Italian elements than the others here, but is the only tureen to adopt the French idea of four evenly-spaced legs. The tureen, only half of which is drawn in detail, is shown on a yellow background. On the verso is an incomplete sketch of a gateway. Each side has a pair of Ionic columns with a niche between them. The round arch has a pedimented top and a circular panel at each side.",

            "public_access_description": "Elevation of a silver tureen possibly by John Yenn (1750-1821) from the office of leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The design is unusual as it contains more Franco-Italian elements than the others here, but is the only tureen to adopt the French idea of four evenly-spaced legs. The tureen, only half of which is drawn in detail, is shown on a yellow background. On the verso is an incomplete sketch of a gateway. Each side has a pair of Ionic columns with a niche between them. The round arch has a pedimented top and a circular panel at each side. It is clear that this drawing, which has come down to us as finished presentation drawings by the young John Yenn, is Chambers\u2019s conception.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
