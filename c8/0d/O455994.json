The majority of the figures are identified by inscriptions written in standard or cursive Tibetan script.  A large prayer addressed to Padmasambhava arranged in the form of a stupa is written on the back.\nThe mount, which is wider than the painting, is of black cotton, with curtaines of pale yellow-green silk and with two pink ribbons;  the battens are of wood formerly painted red, and with turned ends.",
