Some years later her husband commissioned a marble monument in her memory for the large sum of \u00a31500. It was erected in Wetheral Church, Cumberland in 1803. This terracotta appeared in the sale of Nollekens's studio effects held on 4 July, 1823, and was bought by the sculptor Peter Rouw.\n\nNollekens was a prolific sculptor of portrait busts and operated a thriving workshop in London. He spent eight years in Rome, from 1762 to 1770, where he worked with Bartolomeo Cavaceppi restoring and copying antique marbles. One of these copies, his group of Castor and Pollux, is in the Museum's collection (Museum no. A.59-1940). He probably perfected his modelling of clay while he was in Rome and started to experiment in making small figures or groups. These occasionally became models for large-scale finished marbles, but many, still in his studio at his death, were simply studies in their own right, which he called pensieri (thoughts).",

A seventh figure, a standing man is in the property of Mrs C.A. Cater and has been promised to the Museum as a bequest. Mrs C.H Smith in a memoir called 'Letter to Gordon' and addressed to her grandson, when she was 79, refers to her 'many' terracottas by Nollekens but does not state how they were acquired. The donor in a letter dated 31/03/1944 states 'I can vouch for the fact that Nollekens himself gave them to my Grandmother Mrs C.H. Smith. They were near neighbours- my Grandmother then living at No. 8 Cirencester Place, Fitzroy Square, from about 1813 to 1834.'",
