Although it is a 'vase', it is also a decorative object in its own right and needs no flowers, which might conflict with its sculptural appearance. It was made in a range of colours and sizes.\n\nPlace\nDresser's contract with the Ault Pottery specified that he would travel twice a year to Swadlincote to 'inspect the production of objects', 'instruct the workmen' and 'criticise objects already made'.  At this time Dresser lived at Elm Bank, Barnes, Surrey. Ault agreed to pay 'the said Christopher Dresser upon each visit his travelling expenses to and from Swadlincote, from and to London first class and one guinea a day for a period not exceeding three days on the occasion of each visit for hotel expenses'.\n\nTime\nThis vase was designed between 1892 and 1895.  The Ault Pottery was established in 1887 and Dresser's contract was signed in May 1893. The Ault Pottery was the last of three in the north of England with which Dresser was associated.  By the 1890s the production of 'art pottery' was well-established and commercial.",
