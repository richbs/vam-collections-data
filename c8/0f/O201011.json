            "history_note": "This design is an extremely rare example of the transitional phase of the gothic revival in stained glass. Inspired by fourteenth century English work, it shows a treatment similar to Winchester College Chapel where the medieval glass was replaced by modern copies in 1825-28. This design is at the halfway point between the earlier pictorial windows which had prevailed in Britain since the seventeenth century and the conscious revival of medieval techniques in the late 1840's. Little is known of William Collins, except that he was a glass restorer, but he signed original work at the Old Hall, Little Wenlock in 1820 and an East Window at St. Andrew's, Redbourne c.1840. For an illustration of a very similar window of 1836 by James Henry Nixon see plate 1 and p.15 in Martin Harrison's Victorian Stained Glass, 1980. The Rev. H.M. Wagner was Vicar of Brighton from 1824 to 1870 and encouraged the building of several churches. See Sussex in Sir Nikolaus Pevner's series The Buildings of England. St. Peter's Church, Victoria Gardens, was built 1824-8 by Sir Charles Barry, but the glass was replaced at a much later date.",
