George Henry Davey, who purchased the Third set of British Champion animals and in whose memory it was given to the Museum, was the Paris representative of Knoedler and Co, the art-dealers, for many years. Herbert Haseltine's idea of the series originated in his modelling of King George V's champion Shire stallion Field Marshall V (exhibited 1921). In June 1925 twenty of the British Champion Animals were shown in Paris at the Galerie Georges Petit. In July and August the same exhibition was held at Knoedler's in London; the titles corresponds with the Museum's set.",
