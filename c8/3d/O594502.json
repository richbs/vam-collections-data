Sotheby's, 23 May 1951.  They comprise 48 of the 122 drawings in that collections which may be connected with the names of Wren, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh and their associates. E.399-417-1951, constituting a group associated with the Office of Wren, probably formed part of the collection of architectural drawings which belonged to Christopher Wren, Junior, and was sold by auction in 1749 after his death.  The catalogue entries fro the 1749 sale are quoted by V. Furst on p.229 of The Architecture of Sir Christopher Wren, London, 1956.  According to the 1951 sale catalogue the Bute Collection group was probably Lot 31 in the 1749 sale, but Furst (ibid.) argues that the drawings were divided among Lots 34, 37 and 38.\n\nThe remaining drawings were divided among Lots 34, 37 and 38.\n\nThe remaining drawings, E.418-455-1951, consist of a group by Vanbrugh, Hawksmoor and London related to Castle Howard (E.418-434), nine by Hawksmoor possibly related to a scheme for Whitehall Palace (E.435-443) and two drawings probably copied from designs by Thomas Archer (E.444, 445). All these drawings may have a provenance other than the collection of the younger Wren. It is more likely that they derive from the office of Hawksmoor, as suggested by L.Whistler on pp.40, 41 of <i>The Imagination of Vanbrugh and his fellow artists</i>, London, 1954.  E.398-1951 occupies a somewhat ambiguous position between the two groups as it may be associated with both Wren and the office of Vanbrugh (see the discussion of the problem in the cataloguing of this drawing under Sir C.Wren and N.Hawksmoor, in this list).  6 other drawings from the Bute Collection, E.384-389-1951, by an unidentified hand, which relate to Ham House, Surrey, were also acquired by the Museum.\n\nThe catalogue entries for all the drawings may be found under the following headings or artists' names:\n\nANONYMOUS:Architecture\nANONYMOUS: Architecture and Topography\nARCHER, T.\nHAWKSMOOR, N.\nLONDON, G.\nVANBRUGH, Sir J.\nWISE, H.\nWREN, Sir C.'\n\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1951</u> London: HMSO, 1962.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>BUTE COLLECTION of architectural drawings</b>\n\nE.398-445-1951 were brought for the Museum by the National Art-Collections Fund at the sale of the collection of architectural drawings owned by the Marquess of Bute held at Messrs.
