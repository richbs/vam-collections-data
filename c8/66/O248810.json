A competition was held in 1810 for a monument to Admiral Lord Rodney in St Paul's Cathedral. This is the model which Bacon submitted; in the event the competition was won by John Charles Felix Rossi. The monument to Lord Rodney in Spanish Town, Jamaica, which was executed by John Bacon the Elder (the father of the maker of this plaster model) is discussed in Joan Coutu's 'Persuasion and Propaganda. Monuments and the Eighteenth-Century British Empire', Montreal, 2006, pp. 241-50.\n\nJohn Bacon the Younger (1777-1859) was a sculptor, and specialised in tombs using coloured marbles. The tools descended from the older sculptor to his son, and were then passed through the family until they were presentated as a gift to the Museum in 1998. Son of John Bacon he was his father\u2019s true heir: he had won both silver and gold medals at the Academy by the age of twenty. However, he was never elected ARA, probably because of his unusual business practices. In 1808 he went into partnership with Charles Manning (1776\u20131812) to whom he entrusted the design and execution of the majority of commissions while retaining the family name on the work. Manning\u2019s brother Samuel (1788\u20131842) succeeded him, the business continuing its extensive production of monuments with Bacon as \u2018sleeping partner\u2019 until 1843.",
