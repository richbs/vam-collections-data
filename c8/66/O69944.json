The Virgin, wearing a gown and a cloak over her shoulders, is seated in the centre of the panel, crowned with a triple tiara, her hands held together. Enthroned on a pedestal to the left and turned towards her is God the Son, bearded and wearing a double crown surmounted with a cross resting on the torse. He also wears a cloak which is draped across his knees. His left hand touches the Virgin's crown; the right is raised in blessing. God the Father, wearing a girded gown and a cloak fastened with a brooch and crowned with a triple tiara surmounted with a cross, is seated in a similar position on the right of the panel. His right hand is raised in blessing; his left touches the Virgin's crown. The two persons of the Trinity rest their bare feet on pedestals. A Dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a wavy projection indicating a cloud and/or heaven and holds the finial of the Virgin's crown in its beak.\n\nThere is a diagonal break across the lower part of the panel. The top corners and a piece from the bottom of the panel are missing. Considerable amounts of paint remain. There is the usual green and daisy-patterned ground at the bottom. The upper background is gilt. The torse is green. The crowns, hair and beards of the figures are gilt on a brown primer. The folds of the Virgin's cloak are blue; those of the two figures of the Trinity are red. The Dove is painted a dark brown flecked with black, emerging from a black, red and white cloud. The two pedestals are light brown with dark brown flecks. The Virgin's halo is black with red dots and white lines. The back of the panel bears three lead-plugged holes with latten wires. The bottom has been cut away.",
