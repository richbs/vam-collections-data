Each contains a brighter green meandering stem with pointed 3-petalled flowers in red.  The wider border between these has a ground quilted with white silk in a diamond pattern.  It contains an inward facing floral sprig with a pointed red flower and a stem curving over to the left with small red buds. The sprig in each corner is on the diagonal. The central panel is also quilted in a diamond pattern. In the centre is a pink and red rosette with 8 green lines forming a star.  This is encircled by an 8-pointed star in which the diagonal lines end with a green leaf and the others end with a small cypress tree.  There are 8 birds encircling it; most are light red but some are dark red - the colouring is random.  A section of the encircling star plus 2 birds is in each corner of the central panel.  There are off-set bands of a short vertical stem with 3 light red flowers. These face the central horizontal axis of the panel. There are 3 very small motifs worked with metal thread and green silk: one in the centre of the upper and lower border and one in the middle of one half of the central panel.\nMetal Thread: silver-gilt strip close S-wound on white silk core.\nBacking: brown cotton.\nFringe: green silk on a woven heading. The fringe has been stitched to the back along one of the ends.\nBrown ink under-drawing can be seen in some places beneath the embroidery.",
