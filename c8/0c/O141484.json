Upper: 1cm of plain weave with white cotton weft; the loose warp ends forming an uneven fringe of 13cm; those on the extreme ends are plaited at the bottom.\nDesign: \nField: the light brown ground has a garden scene in which the figures of the King and the lion are seen in combat; from the extreme sides stone lions on tall pillars watch the fight; flowering shrubs rise from the grass; there is a bird (possibly a phoenix) and a lion-like figure (possibly a sphinx) on a plinth. The field arches over the combatants and in the spandrels are pink-flowering shrubs and the mirror-image of a lion killing a goat.\nBorder: blue ground with a yellow meander bearing clusters of red/light blue flowers.",
