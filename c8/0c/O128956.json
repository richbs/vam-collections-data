Pharmacies were, subsequently, a major market for maiolica. The pharmacies and dispensaries of monastic orders, hospitals and noble families required large numbers of jars to store their various herbs, roots, syrups, pills, oinments and sweetmeats. These were sometimes marked with coats of arms or other heraldic devices. The production of drug jars inscribed with their contents began in the middle of the fifteenth century, although, non-inscribed vessels continued to be used enabling their contents to be changed as required.\n\nAlbarelli(drug jars) were produced at Castel Durante from the first half of the sixteenth century and decorative features include military trophies and scroll work with foliate motifs around the shoulder and base of the vessel. Some jars, such as this, are marked with a patriachal or papal cross interlaced with the letter 'S', probably the emblem of the Order of the Celestines, or of the Monastery of Santo Spirito de Sulmona, which belonged to the Order. They also bear the date 1541 and the inscription 'mariotto da gubbio', thought to be the name of a potter originating from Gubbio but working at Castel Durante.",

Some jars, such as this, are marked with a patriachal or papal cross interlaced with the letter 'S', probably the emblem of the Order of the Celestines, or of the Monastery of Santo Spirito de Sulmona, which belonged to the Order. They also bear the date 1541 and the inscription 'mariotto da gubbio', thought to be the name of a potter originating from Gubbio but working at Castel Durante.",

Pharmacies were, subsequently, a major market for maiolica. The pharmacies and dispensaries of monastic orders, hospitals and noble families required large numbers of jars to store their various herbs, roots, syrups, pills, oinments and sweetmeats. These were sometimes marked with coats of arms or other heraldic devices. The production of drug jars inscribed with their contents began in the middle of the fifteenth century, although, non-inscribed vessels continued to be used enabling their contents to be changed as required.",
