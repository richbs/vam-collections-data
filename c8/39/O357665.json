It is edged with linen bobbin lace and demonstrates a more unusual way of gathering at the back. \n\nUntil the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.",
