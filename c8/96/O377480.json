It was originally worn to hide the ugly swelling caused by goitre, a disease of iodine deficiency endemic in the high Alps.  Many women in Austria and Bavaria still wear these distinctive necklaces on special occasions.  \n\nThe decoration on the plaque in the centre, and the quatrefoil links, are both typical of traditional necklaces from the region in the 19th century.  However the shape is unusual.  Kropfketten usually had multiple chains of plain links, not quatrefoil links, and never had a central plaque.  \n\nThis one was bought for \u00a31 10s. 5d. at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
