Using the passion of the British for their gardens as a metaphor, the designers proposed prototype objects that examined the sense of alienation and frustration that lies beneath the surface of our personal relationships. Many of their solutions were witty and ironic, but the humour barely concealed a darker layer of anxiety. These prototypes are not intended to be mass-manufactured, but are intended to allow reflection on our relationships with objects, with nature and with each other. As such they show an interest in the conceptual content of designed objects that has inspired much innovation amongst contemporary designers.\n\nThis is called Moth Light and the designers described at as a game that only moths can play. Moths are hypnotised by light, but the motorised soft blades on this lamp gently brush them away so that the heat does not harm them. In this device nature and technology are, for once, in harmony.",
