The image has been signed by the artist in the bottom left hand corner, A.S.Boyd (1854-1930).\n\nTrilby is a stage play based on the 1895 novel Trilby by George du Maurier. The novel was adapted into a long-running play starring Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Svengali and Dorothea Baird in the title role at the Haymarket Theatre in London in October 1895. The story is set in Paris in the 1850s, and recreates an idyllic bohemian world in which the heroine, Trilby O'Ferrall, is a half-Irish girl working in Paris as an artists' model. It also tells the story of the artists who paint her, and features a villain in the form of Svengali, a masterful musician and hypnotist. All the men in the novel are in love with Trilby and the story centres upon her tragic fate.",
