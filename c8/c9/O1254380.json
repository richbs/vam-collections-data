She appeared as Mistress Page in a 1902 production of The Merry Wives of Windsor and celebrated her 50-year stage jubilee in 1906. A year earlier she created the role of Alice Grey in Alice Sit-By-The-Fire by J.M. Barrie (1860-1937) at the Duke of York's Theatre.\n\nThe original image was drawn by Pamela Colman Smith and her characteristic monogram of an interlaced P, C and S is included in the lower left hand corner. \n\nPamela Coleman Smith (1878-1951) was an artist and illustrator who became closely involved with the Lyceum Theatre Company, and Ellen Terry in particular, from the late 1890s. She was best known for her work as an illustrator but she also worked in the field of stage design and exhibited her paintings.",
