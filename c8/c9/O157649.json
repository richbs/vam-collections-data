The Latin inscription 'Ex dono Regis' (the gift of the king) suggests it was probably a New Year's gift. The tradition in which the King and his courtiers exchanged gifts of plate and money according to their rank was revived at the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.\n\nLarge sculptural objects for display had always been an important feature of aristocratic and princely silver. But Restoration England commented with disapproval upon the extravagance of the latest fashion (imported from France) for massive silver furniture, chandeliers, wine cisterns and other heavy types of plate. Impressive and monumental Baroque silver of this kind had a particular appeal for Arthur Gilbert.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
