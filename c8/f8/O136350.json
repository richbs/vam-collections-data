In 1965, she invited Ossie Clark to join her at Quorum, where he, his girlfriend Celia Birtwell, and Alice Pollock struck up a productive design partnership.Birtwell designed textiles which were used by both designers at first, until Clark claimed exclusive use of her fabric prints. \n\nThey both designed using the same supple and fluid moss crepe, satin and chiffon fabrics. Without a label it can be difficult sometimes to tell whether a dress is by Ossie Clark or Alice Pollock. Her designs tended to be slightly more restrained. This deceptively simple tea-length dress in matte crepe features a dramatic diamond-shaped cutaway panel at the midriff and a row of satin-covered buttons and loops as its main details.",
