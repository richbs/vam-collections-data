It is worn with a wedding gown by Victor Edelstein, who was celebrated for his elaborate couture evening wear and wedding dresses. This gown makes a grand statement in lace with a repeating pattern of rose sprays outlined in glistening gimp threads. The peplum gathered over a sheath skirt sweeps to a slight train, which is given fullness by organza-encased tiers of tulle. Irregularly pleated duchesse satin composes the unusual crossover bodice and culminates in an enormous bow at the waist's center back.",
