He was President of the Society of Arts from 1761 until his death and of the Marine Society from its foundation in 1756. He also had a keen interest in the military and was colonel of the West Kent militia from 1759. 'The Gentleman's Magazine' wrote in Romney's obituary that  \"indefatigable in his endeavours to promote the establishment of a national militia, he served in it 20 years, highly respected and beloved.\" (Schroder, 1988, p. 246)\n\nProvenance: Robert, second Baron Romney.  By descent to the Earl of Romney, sale, Sotheby's, lot 181, February 2nd, 1965.  Judge Irwin Untermeyer.  Purchased from S. J. Phillips, Ltd., London, 1970.  Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert.\n\nHistorical significance: Cake or bread baskets were among de Lamerie's most popular forms: well over fifty are known, dating from between 1724 and 1751. The breadth of variety evident within this group was achieved by the employment of a wide range of cast and pierced decoration. This basket is one of about ten that superseded a variant with dense, heavily cast ornament, the finest examples of which are a pair of baskets of 1737 with pierced ladles at Woburn Abbey. The Gilbert basket is characteristic of the group with its treatment of the feet and its gadrooned decoration around the base, but it is one of the earliest and is corespondingly restrained in taste. Others, such as one of 1742 (sold Sotheby's, New York, June 17, 1981, lot 86), have exuberant details, such as asymmetrical scroll demifigures supporting the handles and applied lion masks on the border, as well as much freer and more varied piercing and engraving.
