Persuaded by his family to enrol at the New Delhi University faculty of medicine, Swaminathan developed a keen interest in politics and art. Having failed his 1943 pre-medical exams, the artist left for Calcutta where he became involved with the Revolutionary Socialist Party. His in-depth knowledge of Marxist literature turned him into one of the strongest members of the party. A year later, Swaminathan returned to New Delhi where he joined the Congress Socialist Party (CSP). \n\nDuring the sixties, the artist became a freelance writer for several magazines, expressing his views on politics as well as art. Unlike his senior contemporaries such as Husain, Souza and Gaitonde who developed a modernist pictorial language, Swaminathan embraced an artistic style more rooted in Indian tradition. \n\nIn his quest to create a new pictorial vocabulary, the artist challenged Western ideas of progress and their reliance on anthropocentric interpretations of the universe. His flat, colourful and childlike landscapes, all devoid of human presence, reflect his innocent visions and desire to return to nature. \n\nSwaminathan often chooses iridescent hues, including bright pinks, mauves, pale greens and lemon yellows, and applies them to the canvas in a flat manner. In this way, his landscapes appear highly geometric and stylized: zigzag patterns represent mountains, free-floating circles the sun, rectangular trunks a tree hung against the sky. In addition, many of the symbols used by Swaminathan are borrowed from Indian folk and tribal cultures, especially those that have mythological and religious connotations such as the OM, the swastika, the lotus, the lingam and the snake. When looking at his work, we are reminded of the rarefied atmosphere of miniature paintings and Pahari ornaments.\n\nIn 1968 Swaminathan won an honour mention in the first Indian Triennale. The following year, he participated in the Sao Paulo Biennale and was awarded the Nehru Fellowship. In 1981, the Government of Madhya Pradesh invited him to set up the art museum Roopanker at Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal. He served as the Director of Roopankar, until 1990. He died in 1994.",
