After set designs were approved,  squared-up drawings were produced from which enlarged versions were painted in the correct proportions.\n\nPeople\nBy 1885 Hawes Craven (1837-1910) was a leading scenic artist whose collaboration with Henry Irving for his grand productions at the Lyceum Theatre resulted in some of the most spectacular and thoroughly researched scenery on the London stage. These included Hamlet in 1878, and Much Ado About Nothing in 1882.\n\nTime\nBy the 1880s, lavish stage design was an increasingly important element of a successful stage production. As one commentator noted: 'In these present days of scenic display, when even no poor ghost can walk undisturbed by scientific satellites, lime-lights, mirrors and the like, the Scene painter is a far more important person in the theatre than the Tragedian'. (Life and Writings of T.W. Robertson, by R. Edgar Pemberton, 1893).\n\nPlaces\nAfter this design for  The Mikado was first seen at London's Savoy Theatre, 1885, one critic noted 'the beautiful pictures of Japan from the brush of Mr Hawes Craven', saying that audiences should be grateful 'for being translated from the terrible land of fogs to the sunny landscapes of Japan'.

Reference in the review in The Observer, 16 March 1885: ' A handsomer and more telling stage picture than that disclosed in the courtyard of Ko-Ko's official residence can hardly be imagined. Everything looks as solid and real as do the highly-finished models by which alone we most of us know what Japanese architecture and Japanese figures are like'",
