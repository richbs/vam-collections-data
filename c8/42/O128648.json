They demonstrated the important status of the building, as well as serving to protect the delicate window glass and ensure that no one could break into the building. The defensive purpose of this window grille is stressed through the prominence of sharp points, both in the form of the spikes interspersed between the fleur-de-lis cresting at the top of the grille and in the curved pointed tails of the salamanders. The choice of the salamander could be linked to its supposed ability to resist fire. According to medieval bestiaries the salamander was believed both to put out fires and to have the ability to survive the blaze without being burnt. This idea, coupled with the notion that the salamander was the strongest of all poisonous creatures meant that the salamander was the perfect choice of animal to protect the building through its inclusion on a window grille.",

During the sixteenth century it was common for ironwork objects to be found on public buildings in Flemish cities. In this example both elements of Gothic and Renaissance styles can be seen. The survival of such Gothic motifs as the fleur-de-lis cresting, and the presence of the salamanders suggest that blacksmiths were often slower to respond than other craftsmen to newer styles. However, the grotesque figures that appear in profile between each vertical baluster show that an attempt has been made to embrace the more classicising influences of the Renaissance.",

Window grilles were often found to adorn public buildings such as Town Halls or Guildhalls. The most likely position for a window grille of this kind was on the windows nearest to the entrance, as it served to demonstrate the strength and importance of the building.\n\nThis style of window grille has been described as typically Flemish and similar examples can be found in situ at Nimeguen Town Hall, dating to 1574, and at Kampen. In addition, an engraving by Henri Caus\u00e9 shows the window grilles of the old Town Hall of Antwerp, before its demolition in 1564.",
