The curtain is seamed down the centre and the pattern matches along this line. There are selvedges at the centre front seam. Roughly made up, the curtain has been altered with hand-stitching in red and white down each side and across the top edge. A green ribbed cotton lining has been set in by hand, again crudely sewn, which is inside out with seam edges and hem visible. The curtain is gathered at the top edge by means of a cotton rufflette tape.",

            "history_note": "Purchased. Registered File number 1990/336.\nMade for Lululaund, a house in Bushey, Hertfordshire. The house was built between 1886 and 1894 by H.H. Richardson, the American architect for Hubert von Herkomer, the artist.\n\nThe curtains were used in the Drawing Room and the Hall, and Herkomer himself wrote of the interior decoration '... I wish the reader first to understand clearly that I alone am responsible for the design of whatever meets his eye throughout the interior of Lululaund'. He goes on to describe the curtains as 'the work of my Uncle Anton, one of the three makers of my house' (See Sir Hubert von Herkomer. <u>The Herkomers</u>. 1911, p. 204, 210). Herkomer names the three makers of his house as his Uncle John, a carver, his Uncle Anton, a weaver, and his father, also a carver. Portraits of the three appear <u>op. cit.</u> p. 231. The same book has two chapters devoted to the architect and decoration of the house (p. 187-230). A photograph of the Drawing Room with curtains also appears (opposite p. 210).",
