The central vignette shows a girl in Empire style dress being taught to dance by a standing young man with a violin while a seated lady watches. The vignette is flanked by panels rendered transparent by the cutting away of the silk so that only the gauze is left. \nAbove each of the panels is a small vignette. The vignette on the left shows a young man playing the violin to dancing cupids and on the right, a girl in a classical dress, garlanding a statue.\nAround the border is a gilt, Greek key pattern and blow this, laurel wreathes and palmette borders on a green ground, enriched with small sequins.\nThe reverse is plain with a green and gold, leafy spray running up each stick.\nThe guards and gorge are of green stained mother of pearl with a gilt classical pattern of tasselled swags around torches. The pin has a brass washer and there is a gilt carrying loop.",

In the early 19th century fan painters copied 18th-century subjects. Here the fan painter has taken a scene from the period 1800 to 1820.  However, the romantic overtones remain and it looks like a moment captured from a Jane Austen novel. The decorative design of the fan remains a pastiche of the Rococo style. There is no hint of the new Art Nouveau style that was influencing the other decorative arts at this time.",
