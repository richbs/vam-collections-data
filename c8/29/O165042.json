It probably dates from much later, however, as it seems to be a response to a particular type of English chair, with caned seat and back, in a style that developed around 1715. English caned chairs were widely exported from London, from about 1670 up to the 1740s, to Europe, Asia and America, and they were also imitated in the centres that imported them. The English prototypes usually had a high arched top, repeated in a carved stretcher between the front legs. Most imitations were quite closely comparable to the originals, but the Portuguese responded in this much more idiosyncratic manner, replacing the carved and caned panels with embossed and incised leather.",
