The neck line is medium low and wide. The sleeves are elbow length, with an epaulet at the top, a gathered puff at the upper arm and expanding widely at the opening, where they have a decorative fastening at the front of black velvet buttons and loops. The bodice is trimmed with a row of red, blue, black and white silk fringing arranged around the neck line dipping to a point at the front. The epaulets and sleeve openings are similarly trimmed. A band of black velvet is stitched around the sleeve opening. The bodice fastens with lacing at the centre back. It is lined with glazed white cotton and boned. There is a tape loop stitched vertically at the centre front bodice (probably either to hold it down or hang it up).\n[Skirt] Skirt of matching material to the bodice. It is arranged at the waist in a series of box pleats, each with a small additional pleat. The skirt is banded at the hem with black velvet and finished with a black brush braid. It is lined with white glzed cotton and the hem is faced back with cotton. The original fastening of the waistband was probably brass hooks.",
