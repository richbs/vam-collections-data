            "public_access_description": "The best of the Viennese tradition of gold box-making is shown in this superbly enamelled object, which forms part of a set. Catering for the necessities of elegant life, it comprises an \u00e9tui or small case with a knife, snuff spoon, toothpick and ear pick, watch and ch\u00e2telaine (from which the watch hung) and a matching snuffbox. Although the hanging ch\u00e2telaine was produced at the same time as the watch, differences in the style of enamelling show that it was not made in Schindler's workshop. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
