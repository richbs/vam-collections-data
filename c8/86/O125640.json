The man's forehead is furrowed and red lines emanate from the area around his head to indicate fear or anxiety. The hat casts a blue shadow (comprised of dots) where the man sits. \n\nBlack printed lines run irregularly across the page. Also on the page there is a small neat doodle in ink, lower left, of a house with smoke coming from the chimney. Upper right is a doodle in red biro which has been crossed out in black biro, of a cat? Besides the artist's signature are two more manuscript notes in pencil and there are some smudges of liquid paper. All of these may have been already present on the page before the artist produced his image?",

He experiments with different textures and media, sometimes using rubber stamps made from his drawings.  Old book covers and paper reappear as canvases, with evidence of their former use deliberately exposed.  He told online magazine Pixelsurgeon, 'I began cutting apart and collaging old tearsheets of mine to create new pictures. There was a spontaneous, raw and tactile reaction I had ... The rawer look of the new pictures was very exciting to me.'",
