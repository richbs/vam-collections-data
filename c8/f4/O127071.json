The complex composition of this group allowed the sculptor to display the female nude from different angles and suggests multiple viewpoints. Nollekens also executed separate lifesize marble figures of the three goddesses shown here, which are now housed in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. This terracotta appeared in the sale of Nollekens' studio effects held on 4 July, 1823, where it was sold for \u00a32 10s.\nNollekens was a prolific sculptor of portrait busts and operated a thriving workshop in London. He spent eight years in Rome from 1762 to 1770, where he worked with Bartolomeo Cavaceppi restoring and copying antique marbles. One of these copies, his group of Castor and Pollux, is in the Museum's collection (Museum no. A.59-1940). He probably perfected his modelling of clay while he was in Rome and started to experiment in making small figures or groups. These occasionally became models for large-scale finished marbles, but many, like this one, still in his studio at his death, were simply studies in their own right, which he called pensieri (thoughts).",

Pott, from 21 July 1939. Given by Reginald H. Pott in 1955. In 1944 Mrs Pott also gave to the Museum a series of five models for hands, perhaps by Roubiliac, which had formerly been in the possession of her father, the Victorian painter and sculptor Edward Henry Corbould; It is possible therefore that the present piece also formed part of his collection.",
