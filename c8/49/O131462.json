Initially they specialised in chairs and other seat furniture with caned seats. By the end of the nineteenth century they were producing a wide variety of furniture forms for domestic and institutional use.  After the Second World War the firm took a conscious decision to move away from its traditional forms of caned and bentwood furniture in favour of more up-to-date styles.  This dining cabinet is from their 'Home-Planned Modern' range of blonde, or pale wood, furniture for the home.  It is of plain, simple design, and was aimed at first-time home owners who were furnishing on a budget.  The firm encouraged buyers to acquire pieces from the range a few at a time, promising them that such was the design of the 'Modern' range that future purchases would blend seamlessly with earlier ones.",
