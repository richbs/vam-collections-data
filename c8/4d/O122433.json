The outside has 10 panels filled with bracketed medallions of small clouds divided into two by a thick black diagonal line. There is a band of thin crossed lines above the base ring, inside of which six spur marks surround the recessed centre. The controlled design creates an impressive and startling decoration.",

Echoes of earlier traditions remained, in particular in the black-under-turquoise colour scheme that dates back in Iran to the end of the 12th century. Towards the end of the 16th century there was a widening of interest that blossomed in the 17th century to a wide range of styles and techniques in which blue and white plays a dominant but not exclusive role.",
