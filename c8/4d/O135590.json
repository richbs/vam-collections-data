            "bibliography": "<i> Catalogue of British Oil Paintings, 1820-1860</i> Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 227-228\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"PICKERSGILL, Frederick Richard, RA (1820-1900) \nBorn 25 September 1820, son of a naval officer and marine and landscape painter Richard Pickersgill. Studied with his maternal uncle W F Witherington RA and at the RA Schools. Exhibited 50 works at the RA between 1839 and 1875, and six at the BI 1841--47. Subjects were mythological, biblical and literary (especially Shakespeare and Spenser), and influenced primarily by Etty. Won prizes in the Westminster Hall competitions 1843 and 1847. Elected ARA 1847 (at a very young age), RA 1857, Keeper 1873. Retired 1888 and moved to Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, where he died 20 December 1900. His cousin Henry Hall Pickersgill (see entry below) and uncle Henry William Pickersgill RA were also artists. \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1850, p108, 1855, pp233-6 \n\nThe Birth of Christianity \n539-1882 Neg 48717 \nPainted photograph laid down on paper, card and panel, 24.1 X 41.9 cm (9\u00bd X 16 \u00bd ins) \nInscribed' ... P RA 1857' in red bl \nJones Bequest 1882 \nThe original painting, titled 'Flight of the Pagan Deities on the Dawn of Christianity', was painted in 1857 and exhibited at the Manchester Art Treasures exhibition (catalogue 496) that year, lent by Thomas Fairbairn and so perhaps commissioned by him; it was lot 135 in the Fairbairn sale at Christie's 2 March 1895 (as dated 1856), bought by Misell for \u00a344 2s, although Redford notes it in a Fairbairn sale of 1866, sold for (or more likely bought in at) \u00a3315. It is not known why Pickersgill should have painted a photograph of his picture in 1857; perhaps it was a quick and easy method of making a copy on commission. A print of the photograph is in the National Art Library; it is by Caldesi and Montecchi, and bears the number 34353. \nThe subject is treated in a generalised way, with no references to specific mythological characters. On the left, the bull on a pedestal represents the object of primitive and pagan worship (perhaps Dionysus), attended by Maenads and Corybantes with cymbals. On the right, nine classically-draped figures flee in fear and dismay across a sea; this group is similar to those in other works by Pickersgill and, for example, Etty and Frost. Between the pagan groups stands the Virgin Mary (presumably) holding the infant Christ. The models for the Madonna and Child are supposedly the daughter of Pickersgill's friend John Tennant and her baby son, although this is very unlikely. The artist painted a series of religious subjects in the 1850s. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
