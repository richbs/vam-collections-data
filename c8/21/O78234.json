It was published in 1794, but is a reprint of an original published in 1751.The techniques of etching and engraving were used to create the print. The printmaker created etched lines by the action of acid on the metal printing plate, but also cut (engraved) lines into the plate with a sharp-pointed tool called a burin.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe print shows St James's Park, with 'The Parade' in the foreground. Although not an official pleasure garden, St James's Park was used by fashionable Londoners in the 18th century as an open-air social venue, a place to be seen in society. The well-dressed figures in the foreground can be seen promenading and chatting to their social acquaintances while their children play and feed the ducks at the water's edge.\n\nThe long, rectangular stretch of water that can be seen was known as the Canal. In 1826 this was replaced by the meandering lake that is in St James's Park today.\n\nPeople\nThis print is based on a design by the artist Canaletto. Born in 1697 in Venice, Canaletto was the foremost topographical painter of the 18th century. Canaletto came to England in 1746, and painted and drew views of London and of various country houses during his stay.",
