Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.  Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nA well-dressed woman from Sk\u00e5ne wore multiple pairs of silver clasps along the front edges of her outer clothes.  Some of these were functional, and hooked into each other.  Others were purely ornamental.  Square appliqu\u00e9s decorated belts and ribbons.  The overall effect was one of great richness.\n\nThese clasps, known as kjortelsilver, were worn at the waist in northeast Sk\u00e5ne, often on a band of cloth.  They were originally functional, joined together with hooks and eyes, but soon became purely decorative.  This pair has the maker\u2019s mark LMH, which shows it was made by Lars Magnus Holm, who worked in Kristianstad, 1811-1836.",
