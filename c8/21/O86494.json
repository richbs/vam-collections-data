By 1550, they were using blue, turquoise, sage green, tones of mauve and purple, and a greenish black. Here, these colours have been used to depict a spray of flowers that rises from a small clump of leaves.\n\nThe town of Iznik was known as a centre of ceramic production. The Ottoman court renewed its patronage of Iznik ceramics during the construction of the S\u00fcleymaniye mosque in Istanbul in 1550-1557. The first Iznik tiles were produced, and potters added a bright red was added to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip (liquid clay) made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, tiles of high quality were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds.",
