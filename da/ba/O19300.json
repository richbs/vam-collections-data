Born in The Sudan in 1931, Siddig followed a two-year period as a calligrapher by enrolling at the School of Art in Khartoum. It was there that he began to specialise in pottery. In 1957 he travelled to London to study ceramics at the Central School of Art. In 1967 he settled permanently in England. Siddig popularised the use of traditional African pottery techniques within British studio ceramics. His pots were handbuilt, their surfaces burnished by polishing with a stone or similar tool, and left unglazed. This vessel was purchased from an exhibition of jugs organised by the Craftsmen Potters Association (now the Craft Potters Association) in 1980. 'Ibreeq' is an Arabic word for jug.",
