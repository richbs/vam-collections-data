On the reverse there is a horse on a rock  beside magic fungus, its head and tail down, its ribs and spine prominent. There are clouds overhead.\nThe fat horse and the hungry horse were a subject used in painting as early as the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) to represent different attitudes to official duty.\nFor Kong Kai (1222-1307) the hungry horse represents the official who suffers for his refusal to serve under the new Mongol dynasty; for Ren Renfa (1255-1328) the hungry horse is the self-sacrificing official who accepts office under the Mongols and works hard, while the fat horse is the prosperous official who uses his position to enrich himself (Cahil, 1976, pp155-6). By the time the theme was used on this snuff bottle the decoration would probably have lost its Yuan period political connotations, and simply illustrate the contrast between corrupt and honest officialdom. While it is difficult to be precise about the significance of artistic and literary themes at different periods, this bottle was probably designed for a buyer who wished to be known as a person of scholarly taste.",
