The pin fastening is rectangular, and made of gilded sheet silver with engraved stylised floral decoration.  The pin is made of a doubled strip of silver which is secured by a bar inside the loop, so that it cannot fall out and be lost.",

They were mainly worn by urban women, rather than tribal people.  They were originally always worn in pairs, one on each wrist, and in some places were regarded as the mark of a married woman.  They were worn by Christian and Jewish women, as well as Muslims.\n\nThe elegant workmanship ensured that they were equally popular with tourists in the 19th century, and similar bracelets are still being made in the region today.",
