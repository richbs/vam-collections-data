Full length female figure, with brown shoulder-length hair, wearing a headress in the form of a gallows, with noose and, from the base, a bat; the base of the gallows extends to meet the high-winged dark glasses.  The arms are raised and outstretched, covered from upper arm in long handless 'gloves' which end in a point over the hand; around the wrists are gold manacles, from which hang long swathes of rope.  Around the neck is a black band, with a gold buckle at centre front, from which is fixed a black panel which passes between the bare breasts, through another gold buckle holding a belt around the waist and flowing down to the floor; from the back emerges a similar panel.  The g-string is formed of a long-eared bat with outstretched wings.",

Its floor-show was written by the club's owner, Helen O'Brien, taking ideas from a wide range of sources, from popular song to Shakespeare; while based on the traditional showgirls, all leg and, at that time, topless, the references and wit of the designs of Ronald Cobb combined into a sophisticated entertainment.\nMany of the scenes involved the singing of a song while the girls paraded in costumes wittily illustrating the words.  This costume accompanied the Cole Porter song \"Miss Otis Regrets\" in which a very correct servant explains to the hostess that Miss Otis has shot the man \u2018who led her so far astray\u2019 and has been lynched, so consequently is \u2018unable to lunch today.\u2019  Cobb\u2019s macabre costume, admirably catches the black sophistication of the lyric, although this costume has none of its understatement.  The use of a neckband and fabric passing between the breasts continues ideas from other costumes in the sequence.  The bat under the front panel is an example of Cobb's 'invisible' g-string, a construction which dispensed with side fasteneings  and was held in place by a stiffened wire curve, which fitted between the legs.",
