This artist will present a wide and varied show. Several items are unique and baffling, particularly the cabinet trick, in which Barrie is placed securely handcuffed, by a committee from the audience, in a box with six glass panels. This is then locked, padlocked, and tied round with rope, the knots of which are sealed. Yet in three seconds Barrie changes places with his lady assistant. He has lost the middle finger of his left hand, but this seems to be no handicap whatever, for he manipulates the accessories allied with his tricks with remarkable skill and dexterity.",
