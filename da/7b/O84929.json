ISBN 1851773088.\nThis full-size copy of a two-handled vase that formed part of the original furnishings for the Alhambra (the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century citadel and palace in Granada, Spain [see cats. 15-16]) was exhibited by J.-T. Deck at the international exhibition held in London in 1862. It was one of many impressive, large-scale works purchased by the Museum from this exhibition with \u00a35,000 provided by the Treasury. Its interest lay in the way it combined the Moorish style, popular since the 1840s, with a variety of sophisticated ceramic techniques derived from earlier periods.\n\tJoseph-Th\u00e9odore Deck, later the director of artistic and technical development at the Manufacture Nationale at S\u00e8vres, was already an accomplished ceramicist with a voracious interest in the techniques and decorative styles of the past and of the Middle and Far East. For this piece he evidently collaborated with the writer on ceramic history, Baron Davillier, who in 1861 had published his Histoire des Fa\u00efences Hispano-Moresques \u00e0 reflets m\u00e9talliques. But the Alhambresque form is here combined with techniques from other sources-painting in enamel colours (instead of Hispano-Moresque lustre glazes) and inlaid decoration based on sixteenth-century French ceramics, known as Henri II ware (cat. 72). When acquired, the vase was described as \"A modification of Henri II ware copied from the original by M. le Baron Davillier.\" J. BWaring gave a fuller account of Deck's work in his lavishly illustrated publication on the 1862 exhibition. Under the heading \"Artistic Earthenware,\" he describes how Deck was awarded a medal for a display in which the\n. . . decorative ware designed after Oriental or Arabic models was exceedingly pleasing and effective. Some of these pieces are executed like Henri Deux ware, that is, by an inlay of various clays, but all are characterised by refinement, good taste, finish and brilliancy of tone.\n\tAccording to Harper's New Monthly Magazine in 1875, the Alhambra Vase was then in the Ceramics Gallery at the V&A, where beneath each \"specimen a card tells when and where it was made and the price paid for it by the museum,\" below a window \"showing the building of the Alhambra and its wonderful vase.\" The report that \"an agent of the museum found it \"'going a-begging'\" and purchased it for far less than its actual value, suggests that the price of \u00a360 was lower than that originally asked at the exhibition three years earlier. By 1884 the Museum owned no fewer than twenty pieces by Deck, whose work was singled out for praise in the volume entitled French Pottery in the series of South Kensington handbooks issued from 1875: \nSince 1859...M. Deck has remained the first ceramic artist of the time and French industry is proud of him as being one of its most justly-honoured representatives....[T]he numerous works by him in the Museum hardly give an idea of...this skilful ceramicist['s]...perfect workmanship and purity of form.... [T]he faience signed by him can compare and be placed on a par with the finest productions of the ceramic art of all times.\nDeck's ceramics were prominently displayed in the Ceramics Gallery until that space was converted to house the Jones collection in 1910. The Alhambra Vase was displayed again only in 1987 when the present gallery dedicated to the nineteenth-century arts of Europe and North America was opened.\n\nLit.
