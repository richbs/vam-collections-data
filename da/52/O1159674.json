            "public_access_description": "Tudor Rose is a British company who were based in Wales. They appear to have specialised in making small dolls, as well as lots of other plastic toys. They sold their dolls at Woolworths, although all their dolls were quite cheap to buy. However very little is know about the company considering how much they made. Tudor rose was a trademark of Rosedale Plastics. The Tudor Rose company was located in Wales from 1948 to 1978. Later the trademark Rosedale Rose was used. Originally Rosedale/ Tudor Rose made novelties such as buttons, combs, plastic jewellery and toys, but by the early 1950s, plastic toys and dolls were their main output. Amongst their toys was a range of hollow hard plastic toys moulded into vehicles, they later went on to make softer, polythene-type playthings, e.g. Noah's Ark. In 1959 Kleeware dolls company sold out to Rosedale plastics.\n\nSpace toys by Tudor Rose are particularly sought after by collectors as they are quite rare, along with trains, cars, money-boxes, and walking novelty animals. the most common type of dolls to find made by Tudor Rose are the small moulded-headed straight-legged babies and toddlers. They were made in Caucasian and black and came in two sizes. The majority were sold naked and could be later dressed by the child at home. Many of the small dolls were dressed as fairies and could be used to put on top of the Christmas tree. The trademark of Tudor Rose dolls is solemn faces, closed mouths and distinctive hands with the palms turned down. They often bore the words 'Tudor Rose' across their backs with the rose logo. The most famous doll sold by the company was a walking girl with a moulded plastic dress. She was called Blondy Blueyes and was 7 inches high. \n\nThey used brightly coloured plastics for their toys as companies in the 1950s were so pleased that plastics could be easily dyed that they took full advantage and had a variety of colours.\n\nIn 1971 the company was taken over and then in 1978 they were bought by Mettoy, who then went on to sell it 5 years later. By this time they had stopped producing toys.",
