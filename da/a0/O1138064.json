The first in the series, Star Wars: A New Hope (1977), became the most successful film in history and grossed over $290 million.  It was not only the film that became a success but also the mechanising that was produced alongside the film. The films captured the public imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis toy was produced by Hasbro Inc in 2005 for the final film Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith.  The design of the toy lightsaber allows the child to play as either a character from the dark side or the good as it has a colour changing blade as well as electronic sounds.",
