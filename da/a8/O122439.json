The woman, who is young, wearing a white blouse with red frills, her dark hair pinned back, and with a made-up face, epitomises attainable and 'safe' glamour.  She looks out to the viewer with a dreamy expression. She holds in her right hand, a fountain pen, and to her left, on the right of the poster is a note, hand-written on yellow paper, it reads 'the home of your own you've always dreamed of.  Of course waiting is hard -- don't I know! -- but you can start building right now, wherever you are, by putting aside money every pay day -- much better than just laying a foundation of star-dust..
