The region\u2019s natural gold resources had made the Asante wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill and technology.\n\nThe form of this silver spoon is similar to smaller brass spoons which were used for measuring gold dust. It has been much repaired and the perforations through the bowl, enabling it to be used for straining, may have been added later.\n\nFollowing Asante efforts to protect a coastal trading outlet, British forces invaded the state capital Kumasi on 4 February 1874. The Asantehene, Kofi Karikari, fled leaving behind much precious regalia which was captured and later sold at auction at Garrard\u2019s, the London crown jewellers. The Museum\u2019s accession registers record the purchase of this and twelve other items of Asante gold and silverware from Garrard\u2019s on 5 June 1874.",
