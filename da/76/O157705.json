It is an unusual example of the Italian use of malachite, which was rarely found outside Russia, its country of origin, before the early 19th century. The micromosaics may derive from Greek and Roman mythology, in which the butterfly symbolised the soul leaving the body at the moment of death.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Giacomo Raffaelli's work was evidently valued in Russia as he was asked by the Tsar to found a Russian school of mosaics, and although he declined to do so, was given the title of 'Counsellor to the Emperor of Russia' after Napoleon's fall. The micromosaics may have been set in a malachite block in Russia.\n\nThere is a similar block of lapis lazuli set with a micromosaic in a private Roman collection.",
