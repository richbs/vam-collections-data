Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThis green silk parasol is typical of the 1820s in both its size and colour, green being particularly popular for morning visiting and seaside trips. The mother-of-pearl trimmings and carved handle are often a feature of walking parasols of this time. The dome-shaped cover displays a geometric woven pattern and is held closed when not in use by a bone ring attached to a cord, enabling the shade to be held cover-down. The supportive ribs are made of whalebone a lightweight pre-cursor to the steel rib introduced by Henry Holland in 1843. The parasol is shown here with a 'pelisse robe' of around 1820, museum number T.383-1960.",
