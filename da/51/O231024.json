Twill ground. Spaced, offset rows with an identical flower: pale yellow leaves outlined in green; metal thread petals [tarnished silver strip open Z-wound on a yellow silk core NOTE Z is not common in Iran], outlined in red.  Upright iris-like flower with a base of leaves curving to the right. This fabric has been cut into three pieces to form the front and back of the bag and the curved base.  This is a European shape and it is possible that the bag was constructed in Europe.  The lining is very fine white striped silk. It probably ought to have had a metal frame at the top with a clasp and handle.",
