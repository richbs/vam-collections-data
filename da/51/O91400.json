Sweden had grown prosperous from trading amber, furs, timber and grain around the Baltic Sea and by the 18th century was a major power in northern Europe. Foreign travellers frequently noted that silver ownership was more widespread than they had expected. Even small landowners might own a few silver spoons or beakers.\n\nEdwardian collectors in England, including the V&A, acquired these beakers as examples of traditional Scandinavian craftsmanship and regarded Sweden as an isolated culture. However the wrigglework decoration on this example (pricked onto the surface with a fine steel tool) is inspired by French rococo flowers and scrolls. Collectors underestimated the rich and long history of immigrant goldsmiths settling in Sweden from other northern European countries.",
