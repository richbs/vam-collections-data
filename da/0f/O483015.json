It has pleats and is made in a wraparound style.\nThe skirt consists of two main sections which overlap. Each section is made from two vertically-seamed pieces of cloth and this is divided into two plain panels with a pleated panel in between. There are twenty pleats on each end of the pleated panels, ten going one way and ten going the other so that the blocks of ten face each other.\nThe skirt sections are secured into a wide waistband of blue and white cotton which has a loop of bright blue plain cotton at each end. Knotted through each loop is a fringed flat braid of red and white cotton.\nThe two main sections fasten together at waist level with black knot buttons and loops. There are three loops and knots sewn in a vertical line on the outside and two similarly placed on the inside.\nThe edges of the skirt are finished with a double row of black bias cotton binding and a row of bright pink and white scalloped silk braid. The pink braid is sewn into a curve at the corners.\nThe cotton of the skirt has a mauve tinge which may be accounted for by the addition of methyl violet due used along with indigo. The cotton is stamped in two places with an indistinct factory/ workshop mark in gold which looks like two interlocking globes with \nChinese characters either side.\nThere are traces of sewing lines in a zig-zag pattern across the whole width of the skirt near the top indicating a previous applied decoration.",
