Techniques passed down to the Egyptians and then to the Romans. There were major revivals of interest in engraved gems in Europe during the Byantine era, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries. At each stage cameos and intaglios, these skillful carvings on a minute scale, were much prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment. This cameo takes an unusual viewpoint from slightly above what appears to be a child's head. It is unlikely to be a portrait, as other examples of similar heads exist in other collections. They are thought to date from between 200 BC and 50 BC.",
