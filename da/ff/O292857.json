The main repeating motif is a group comprising a large rose, a smaller flower, similar to a violet, and foliage. This group is created by the warp. The scallop edge is created from the metal threads woven into the ribbon and binds the backing, a plain white silk, in place. This backing seems to be integral to the original weave rather than attached later as a lining. Six colours are used in the pattern: two shades of green, one of blue, lilac, brown, pink and coral. XRF analysis confirms that the two types of silver thread, now tarnished, contain pure silver.",

Diderot\u2019s Encyclopaedia in 1772 described these uses succinctly in its definition of ribbon: \u2018a flat, narrow and thin fabric, used to tie, edge or ornament, for garments as well as furnishings\u2019. Ribbons were subject to changes in fashion, just as wide silks were. \n\nRibbons could be bought at fairs, from travelling pedlars or from the high class retailers of major cities such as Paris (e.g. the marchands merciers of the Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 which is still the city's luxury quarter today). These retailers stocked large quantities of ribbons of all sorts - from the simplest to the most elaborate - to sell to their customers, French ribbons being complemented by Dutch, Flemish, German and Swiss goods.",

Thought to be 18th-century French (Lyon) at that time. Of the collection, Wyatt wrote that it was important because of 'the number, variety and beauty of the bulk of the specimens. It will form a most excellent sequel to the early textiles obtained from Dr Bock' (Art referee report, 47257, 8 December 1870).",

Saint-Chamond and Saint-Etienne in the St\u00e9phanois, some 40-50 kilometres south of Lyon, gradually became the main centres of the production of the most fashionable and complex silk ribbons, such as this. \n\nIn France, ribbons were generally between 3 and 22 cm wide, guild regulations stipulating they had to be less than 40cm in width, in other words at least 10cm narrower than a dress silk. The engine loom (<i>m\u00e9tier \u00e0 la barre</i>), first used in 1604 in Leiden, was only adopted in France from 1736 and officially promoted by the French government from 1769.  It allowed the production of eight or more ribbons at the same time on the same loom, but was only suited to the weaving of simpler ribbons initially. It began to be used in Saint-Chamond and Saint-Etienne from 1750.",
