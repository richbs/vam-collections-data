Sadler experimented with transfer-printing on white glazed delftware tiles, transferring images from engraved copper plates to tiles, using enamel colours fixed in low-temperature firing.\n\nActors and actresses could become big stars in the 18th century, when theatres, concert halls and pleasure gardens were the major forms of public entertainment.  Engravers regularly produced images of paintings of the most popular performers, so the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear on the tiles in reverse.\n\nBorn in London, King made his first stage appearance at Yarmouth.  Garrick engaged him for the Drury Lane season of 1748 to 1749 after which he spent some time in Dublin and the provinces before returning to London in 1759 and taking comic parts at Drury Lane.  He became well known as a comic actor and played clowns and harlequins at Sadler's Wells Theatre as well as a large repertoire of comic roles at Drury Lane including Lissardo which he first played in the 1769 season at the Lane.",
