The belt consists of eight silver plaques each made from a gilded openwork trellis nailed to a plain silver base with a small four-leafed motif in the centre, and 3 holes at each end.  At each end of the belt there is a clasp made from two plaques of the same shape and size as the rest, but with a hook added at one side of one, and a corresponding hole on the other.  There is a flower over the hook on one part, and an additional small hole next to the fastening hole on the other part.  In the centre of the belt, between the fourth and fifth plaques, is a larger similar circular plaque, with a scalloped edge and a pattern of six sprays of gilded leaves overlying the plain silver back.  All these elements are each separated from their neighbours by three short lengths of silver chain made from rings of grooved wire.  At the end of the belt there is another plaque, identical to those which comprise the belt and with three short chains hanging from its lower edge, attached by a ring to the small hole next to the fastening hole.\n[Chain with crucifix] Silver-gilt crucifix hanging from a length of heavy decorative chain.  The cross is shaped like raw wood, with sawn-off branches.  On one side is the body of Christ, with the title 'INRI' above.  On the other is the Virgin, standing on a crescent moon, with the child Jesus in her arms, and a crown above.  The crucifix hangs from a double length of chain, made from alternating links of twisted and grooved wire.  The two lengths are linked twice along their length by small rings of grooved wire.  At the top is a silver split ring joining them finally together.",

These belts were usually based on the kind worn by the upper classes in late medieval and renaissance times.  \n\nThis belt was described as 16th century German when it was acquired by the Museum in 1891.  The circular plaque in the centre is very similar to those used on belts worn with traditional costume in southern Germany, but the belt as a whole is also similar in construction to Swiss marriage belts of the 17th and 18th centuries.  It may therefore be a little later in date than was originally thought.",
