The great hall was the usual setting for such displays, since it was here that the medieval lord feasted with his household and guests. These eye-catching decorations not only advertised his wealth, but also proclaimed his lineage and social alliances.\n\nPeople\nThis shield depicts the arms of Sir Robert Bell. The date, 1577, commemorates his sudden death from a 'pestilential vapour at Oxford Assizes'. Bell was a prominent figure and is recorded in 1563 as Speaker of the House of Commons. He later went on to hold the elevated position of Chief Baron of the Exchequer. \n\nPlace\nThis is one of a series of coats of arms relating the history of the Beaupr\u00e9 family. It is thought to have been commissioned by Sir Robert Bell for Beaupr\u00e9 Hall, the family's ancestral home near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Bell married Dorothy, the sole heiress of the Beaupr\u00e9 line, in 1559 and succeeded to the Beaupr\u00e9 estate following the death of Dorothy's father, Edmund, in 1567. While the original windows seem to date from the completion of a new great hall which Bell commissioned in around 1570, this panel was evidently a subsequent addition. All of the windows were eventually moved from their original location and cut down to fit narrower lights. Photographic evidence suggests that the border of this particular shield was also altered at some point after the 1920s.",
