The first official  party conference in January 1990 affirmed its policy in favour of reunification and voted to re-establish itself as the social-democratic party of germany [SPD], which had been the party's name before its enforced merger with the Communists in 1946, and was a name identical with its West German counterpart. Although the SPD joined the original Alliance 90, this association was short-lived and it campaigned alone for the election. Having been at one stage the most popular party with 53% of the vote in a poll conducted in February 1990, it suffered badly from the Alliance for Germany's smear campaign [see E.2061, 2092, 3064,  3069-1990] and achieved only 22% of the vote in the  election, compared with the CDU's 41%. After an initial  reluctance, it finally agreed to participate in a \"grand coalition\" government with the DSU and the League of Free Democrats parties.",
