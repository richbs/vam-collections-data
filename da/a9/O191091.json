The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe Alliance for Germany was an opposition coalition formed on the 5th of February 1990 in then West-Berlin to stand for the 'Volkskammer' (People's Chamber) election. It got the majority of the seats and thus formed the interim-government until reunification, with Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as Minister President.\n\nThe CDU (Christian Democratic Union), DSU (German Social Union) and DA (Democratic Awakening) were part of the Alliance. The political aims (reunification of Germany and reconstitution of the federal states) were mainly determined from the West German side of the CDU. The then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared at many election campaign activities for the East German CDU.\n\nThis was one of the posters designed to show the general political aims of the Alliance. At first the aims of the Alliance had to be communicated in joint appeals and statements. This was mainly done through advertisements in the big newspapers and those messages were then repeated on posters. The central slogan was: 'Nie wieder Sozialismus' - 'Never again Socialism'. Alongside this slogan are the words: 'Freiheit und Wohlstand', meaning 'Freedom and Prosperity'.",
