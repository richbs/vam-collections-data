In it he defines the restrictive world we live in, and he also celebrates the ever-present and, we hope, unquenchable human response.\n\nA band of naked figures stands rooted to the spot, each indistinguishable from his neighbour, all hemmed in by a barrier and trapped on a confining platform. Seven of the figures face forward, but the eighth, at the back and unseen by his companions, has turned his head.",
