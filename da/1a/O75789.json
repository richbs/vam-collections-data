In 1949 he set up the Festival Pattern Group to develop designs on the theme of crystal structures, based on the work being done by Dr Helen Megaw at Cambridge. In all, twenty-six manufacturers contributed to the project. It was a conscious attempt to devise contemporary patterns for wallpapers and textiles which had traditionally been dominated by floral and pictorial motifs. Hartland Thomas wrote of the crystal structure diagrams: 'they were essentially modern because the technique which constructed them was quite recent, and yet like all successful decoration of the past, they derived from nature - although it was nature at a submicroscopic level not previously revealed.' [Quoted in Lambert, S., <i>Pattern and Design: Design for the Decorative Arts 1480-1980</i> (V&A, 1983), p.37]. The furnishings devised by the FPG were used on the Festival site.'",
