In the Buddhist and Jain context, both of which utilised <i>stupas</i>, these gateways would mark the four cardinal points of a <i>stupa</i>.  Gateways of this kind resemble those of secular urban architecture of the period, except that they were not designed to be fortified.\n\nNo provenance is available, but it may be assumed that this lintel was excavated in one of the many mounds that mark ancient sites at the city of Mathura, known in early sources as the 'city of gods'.",
