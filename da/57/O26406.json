Horse racing, and in particular steeplechasing, gave rise to a new design of playing board. This is often folded in three rather than two. The playing surface is long and oval-shaped, and the playing spaces are narrow and angled. The basic rules of race games are still used, however, with turns missed and players moving backwards and forwards as directed. This particular game is played anticlockwise.",
