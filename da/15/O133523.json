This, however, was no bar to Messel's imagination - he had always used materials creatively, knowing that, in the theatre, the real on stage often looks strangely artificial, whereas artifice looks 'real'.  Thus instead of lace for the ruff, he used wired crin (a rigid synthetic mesh) edged with pipe cleaners formed into picots (decorative loops).  The embroidery was done with coloured tinsels to mimic silks.   \n\nThe colour of the costume sets Ferdinand apart from the other couriers, who are dressed in darker shades, befitting their age and station.  The cool blue sets him apart - a symbol of his youth and lack of corruption, a calming colour linking him to elemental forces of sky and sea.   However, a completely blue costume might be a little  fey, so Messel has teamed the doublet with maroon breeches, which 'anchor' the costume.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",
