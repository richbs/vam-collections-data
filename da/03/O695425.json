E.859-1966 \n\nGiven by Miss Mary Peerless \n\n<i>Note:</i> The panel, designed by Arthur Silver and executed by Harry Napper (died 1930), was No.477 in the 4th Exhibition held by the Arts & Crafts Exhibition Society at the New Gallery, London, 1893.  It is reproduced as part of a chimney-piece and alone as a detail (the block upside down) in Aymer Vallance's review of the exhibition in <i>The Studio</i>, Vol.2, 1894, p.24, and is mentioned on p.17. \nThe original panel and a description, written by the artist and dated \"30.9.93\", are in the possession of the Silver family.  The artist describes the panel as \"of Hungarian ash which possesses a weird grain and is stained green.  The work is in Gesso and the subject is a decorative suggestion of the 7 days symbolised by seven discs on a winged spiral implying infinite progression.  The whole of the Gesso work is overlaid with white metal and decorated with coloured lacquers.  The spiral is quiet in tone to sympathise with the ground of the panel and to give contrast with the discs which increase in brilliancy of colour as they approach the climax on 7th day.  The effect of the latter is of brilliant silver illuminated by prismatic rays.  The order of the discs which commence at the right hand bottom corner and proceed in a spiral progression to centre is thus - 1st Light.  2. Division of Waters.  3. Dry Land & vegetation.  4. Sun.  Moon.  Stars.  5. Fowls & Fish (animal kingdom).  6. Man  7. Rest.\"",
