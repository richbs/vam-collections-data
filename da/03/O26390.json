You will see that a Gibbs fairy helps and an Imp hinders you.\nGiant Decay tries to handicap you at the beginning of the game and the Archer helps you = when you lands on a big A, which stands for Archer, if at your next turn you throw a number which brings you on to anything bad, you can take no notice of it and go straight on.\nIf your throw lands you on 23, you have tea at the farm, and take the short cut through the field afterwards - that it, at your next turn, you jump to 37.\nAt 41, the boatman gives you a lift - which means you jump to 44.  The same with 45 (motor car) and 48 (aeroplane).\nAt 47 the Imp mis-directs you and you find yourself in the bog, and must stay there till you throw a 6.\nAt. 54 another Imp sends you astray, and you are lost in Caries Wood for one turn, and them go back to 34.\nTo win you must either land on number 57 which allows you to jump to 63; or throw the exact number which brings you on to 63.\n\nYour Teeth are Ivory Castles - defend them with Gibbs Dentifrice.\n\nRules placement: on the reverse side",
