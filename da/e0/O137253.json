            "public_access_description": "This white silk evening dress comes from Tom Ford's final womenswear collection for Gucci, autumn/winter 2004-5. Tom Ford served as the head designer for Gucci from 1990 to 2004 and was instrumental in bringing a commercial sexiness to Gucci fashions for men and women. \n\nIn this collection Ford wowed fans with fox-pelt collars adorning understated robe coats, cocktail dresses with delicate beading, and evening gowns with flared and feathered hemlines. The palette was typical Gucci: graphic black and white in the main with shocks of vibrant colour. In this collection, according to fashion journalist Cathy Horyn, Ford ignored daytime clothes. ('Tom Ford Goes Out With a Roar,' New York Times, 26 February, 2004). Horyn wrote that 'the night-time world is what Mr Ford understands best...so implicit in necklines plunging to the navel.' This dress, which has just such a deep plunging v-shaped neckline, appeared in the catwalk presentation\u2019s finale grouping with  several other white silk jersey gowns with sexy side slits and enticing jewelled clasps, reminiscent of the gowns that had catapulted Ford to fashion fame in the early 1990s. The gold leather shoes which accompanied this dress add a glamorous finishing touch.",
