In 1759 the statues of Schwerin and Winterfeldt were commissioned from Fran\u00e7ois-Gaspard Adam. However, he left Berlin before executing the statues. They were carved instead respectively by Sigisbert-Fran\u00e7ois Michel (nephew of Adam) and the Brothers R\u00e4ntz. Further statues were commissioned from other sculptors.\n\nFrancois-Gaspard Adam (1710-61), who made this terracotta model, was one of three sculptor brothers. Their nephew, the son of their sister, was the much better-known sculptor Clodion. F-G Adam's best works are probably his garden statues for Frederick the Great of Prussia at Sanssouci, Potsdam. \n\nIn features, A.91-1970 resembles the statue of the Prussian field marshall Schwerin more closely than others, and it is thought that it represents F-G Adam's original proposal. However, the statue as executed by Sigisbert Michel is markedly different and full of agitated movement. It is inscribed: 'Commenc\u00e9 par ADAM et fini par SIGISBERG 1769'. The statues were removed from the Wilhelmplatz in the mid 19th century and are now in the Bode Museum in (East) Berlin.",
