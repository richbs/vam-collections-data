It appears to have been one of his favourites however since he can be seen playing it on several recordings. He last used it on 16 December 1960 on The Friday Show, his last television show.  Since it wasn't one of the instruments in the sale of his effects in June 1961 he may have given it away after the show and before his death on 6 March 1961. \n\nGeorge Formby, born in Wigan, has been called 'the popular singer who symbolised the 1930s'.  With his toothy grin and irrepressible high spirits, his stage character was the cheerful 'urban little man', a gormless but loveable innocent who overcame misfortune effortlessly. He became hugely popular in the north of England in the 1930s, and known nationally though his films. After appearing in No Limit,1935, he made two films a year, and twenty-two by the end of 1940.  He appeared at the London Palladium and was awarded an OBE in 1946.  He is best remembered as the little man with the ukulele, which he used to accompany songs including 'Chinese Laundry Blues', 'Mr. Wu', and 'When I'm Cleaning Windows'.",

Other ukuleles of his, including 5 Gibsons, were sold at the sale of his effects, after his death, at his house in Lytham St. Annes, in June 1961, but this was not one of them.  This appears to have been one of his favourite ukuleles because he is playing it on several recordings. The last time he used it was on 16 December 1960 on his last television show called 'The Friday Show', and since it wasn't in the sale he probably gave it away after the show and before his death on 6 March 1961.  Formby used fishing line for his strings.",

Prince $10.00\nStyle UB-2 and STYLE UB-2 De Luxe Generally finished in a light (or dark mahogany), which was an excellent instrument - often called the 'Baby' Gibson. Prince $17.50.\nStyle UB-3  Either with or without a flange resonator\nStyle UB-4  \nStyle UB-5 The gold plated version of the UB-4 - only $55 in 1930 - now valued at $5000.",
