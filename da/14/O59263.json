The catalogue of the manufacturer William Hutton & Sons published in about 1880 refers to these utensils as 'walnut peelers'.\n\nDining Etiquette\nThe dining etiquette of the period encouraged the development of specific utensils for eating and serving particular foods such as nuts.  Dining etiquette was an important part of the Victorian code of polite society.  The Manners and Tone of Good Society, first published in 1879, outlined the correct conduct of the dinner party but focused on the complicated and changing use of cutlery. With a few exceptions (such as for eating bread and some fruit), touching food with the fingers was frowned upon, and diners were presented with an alarming and growing range of specialist utensils for eating particular foods. It was important to be able to recognise items such as nut picks, sardine tongs and grape scissors, and to know how to use them correctly.\n\nRetailing\nIn the 1890s nut picks could be bought individually, for between 3s (15p) and  5s (25p), or by the dozen, for between 20s (\u00a31) with ivory handles and 35s (\u00a31.75) with pearl handles, according to some manufacturers' catalogues. The boxed sets made ideal gifts and with the inclusion of nutcrackers and grape scissors enabled diners to eat the fruit and nuts of  the dessert course more elegantly.",
