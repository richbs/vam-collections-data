It was first seen in Paris in 1843.  Later that year, Eug\u00e8ne Coralli revived it in London, again with Grisi in the title role.\n\nLa P\u00e9ri of the title is a fairy who assumes human form to test a man who has fallen in love with her after she appears to him in a dream. In Persian mythology, a p\u00e9ri was a superhuman being endowed with grace and beauty.  In ballet of the 1840s, she was, like the sylphs and nymphs, an unattainable spirit, a symbol of escape from the prosaic and mundane world. The costume, with its short sleeves, jewelled chains and belts, looks more like a balleticised version of Indian costume than Persian, but the intention was to evoke exotic, far-away places, rather than a realistic recreation.  \n\nTheophile Gautier wrote La P\u00e9ri for the great ballerina Carlotta Grisi whom he adored. Like Giselle, which he also wrote for her, the role of the P\u00e9ri encapsulated the two aspects of the Romantic ballet, the human girl and the unattainable spirit.  Unattainable spirits were very popular in the Romantic era, the ultimate putting of a woman on a pedestal.",

Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched. The lithographs produced in London are notable for capturing the personality and style of individual performers in a theatrical setting.  They are a fitting tribute to one of ballet's richest periods. \n\nBefore the development of colour printing, the basic black and white prints were hand coloured.  There is often considerable variation from one print to another, both in colour and quality of the work.  The most important souvenir prints, such as this one, would only have been sent out to the best colourists, and it is often very difficult to tell the best hand colouring from early colour printing.  In the days before photography, such lithographs were expensive souvenirs, bought by the individual dancer's admirers.",
