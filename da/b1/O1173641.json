In 1956 she moved to Canada and thence to the United States, where she directed and managed a number of theatres. She returned to England in 1987. The letters are from her theatrical contacts and cover her career from the 1930s to the 1990s. Associated production: Susannah and the Elders. Recipient and actor: Joan White. Actor: Alastair Sim. Critic, author and manager: Sidney W. Carroll. Manager: C. B. Cochran. Duke of York's Theatre, London, 31.10.1937. Performance category: Drama. The play was given three performances at the Duke of York's on 31 October, 7 November and 14 November 1937. Bridie hoped to arrange another production. E.P. Clift, Alec L. Rea, Alastair Sim, Sydney W. Carroll and C. B. Cochran are mentioned in the letter.",
