The pierced screen is known as a \"jali\" and they were used to great visual effect in Mughal architecture. They had the practical purpose of providing privacy, especially to the women of the court, and shade from sunlight while allowing for the passage of cool air. They usually have geometric decorative schemes which, while based on simple combinations of basic forms such as the square, circle and hexagon, set up a visual counterpoint in which rhythmically organised patterns baffle the eye. This example was probably copied in the 19th century from original screens in Agra or Delhi.",
