Drawings of antique furniture to show to potential customers were certainly made by the young architectural draughtsmen in Pugin Senior's School. It is possible, therefore, that this may have been drawn by a student at A.C. Pugin's school and A.W.N. Pugin showed it to Mrs Gough as an example of a chair she could buy or as an example of an antique that Pugin could copy or adapt in his own work.\n\nThis is one of a number of designs for Perry Hall, Handsworth, Birmingham, for Mrs John Perry Gough. The volume is valuable for providing details of the young Pugin's attempt at a business venture.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
