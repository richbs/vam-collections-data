The following is the full text of the entry: ROSA, SALVATOR (1615-1673) 800 A female nude, standing with her right arm raised among a group of animals, including an ox, a goat, a hog and an ass Pen and ink and wash 8 1/8 x 6 1/4 (206 x 158) Dyce 348 PROVENANCE ? Francesco Algarotti (according to the Dyce Catalogue); J. Thane (Lugt 1544); Dyce Bequest, 1869 LITERATURE Dyce Catalogue no. 348 (as by Rosa); I. Moskowitz, Great drawings of all time, New York, 1962, I, pl. 284 (as by Rosa); Mahoney, 57.1; Exhibition Catalogue, Salvator Rosa, London, Hayward Gallery, 1973, no. 68 and pI. 34. (Mahoney wrote the catalogue of the drawings) Mahoney connects the drawing with a painting representing an Allegory of Fortune, in the J. Paul Getty Museum, California. (L. Salerno, Salvator Rosa, Florence, 1963, p. 122, no. 36; pl. 36). In this picture, he says, 'reward is heaped on senseless beasts who trample underfoot attributes of painting and learning.' He considers that the figure in our drawing, with the arc of the zodiac above, possibly signifying Destiny, is an early idea for Fortune in the painting, who distributes her gifts from a cornucopia. The picture, he adds, was exhibited in 1659 at the exhibition of S. Giovanni Decollato. Rosa's enemies criticized it as a satire on papal patronage.",
