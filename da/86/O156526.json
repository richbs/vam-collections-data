Whilst this subject may seem somewhat amusing, and even innocent to modern viewers, it would have been shocking to Georgian eyes.\n\nThe flowers in the vase behind the woman demonstrate the great skill of the enameller.  The wonderful detail of the flowers suggest that the artist may have been a Hueguenot, or an immigrant from France, Holland or Germany, where there was a great flower painting tradition.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
