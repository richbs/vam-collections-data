In the top centre is a partly obliterated angel. To the left is a flag which might have been part of an 'Agnus Dei' (a depiction of Christ as the 'Lamb of God' with a banner). To the right one can make out the rays of a halo, and below is a scroll bearing a text, now effaced.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIn contrast to traditional 'stained glass' which was coloured, when molten, with metallic oxides, these fragments were made using a method introduced to England only  in the 14th century. The design was painted onto white glass in dark-brown iron oxide. The coloured areas were filled in with a silver-based stain which, on firing, turned yellow. This technique permitted greater freedom in composition. Details such as the angel's yellow hair and white face, instead of being made up from separate pieces of glass, could now be painted onto just one piece.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe damage to the angel's face is probably the result of deliberate vandalism in the 16th century. When Edward VI (ruled 1547-1553) succeeded to the English throne in 1547, his government adopted more Protestant views. There was a radical change in their attitude towards traditional ecclesiastical imagery. Protestant iconoclasts sought to remove 'distracting' images from all places of worship. Because the medium of stained glass was not in itself offensive, however, windows were not usually destroyed, but religious figures often had their faces scrubbed out.",
