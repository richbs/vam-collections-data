There is a border along the bottom: small circular blossoms with large metal thread blossoms in pairs.  There is a narrow border with a fine pattern of small green and red or green and purple motifs, almost like a small green bowl with fruit.  This border goes part way up both sides.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left. These are of green and yellow silk with metal thread embroidered over the top in a pattern of triangles.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a purple blossom with metal thread swirl in the centre and outlined with metal thread; smallish metal thread flower on a stem with several small, round buds in metal thread, or pink outlined in dark green.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] small pink vase outlined with light blue containing 2 sprays of small white flowers, a central pink flower, an arrangement of 5 small white flowers and small leaves and buds in metal thread alternating with the same type of vase with pink flowers, metal thread flowers and a line of 4 triangular white flowers down two sides.\n[b] large metal thread flowers alternating with a circular arrangement of small white flowers.\nThreads: Silk, 2S: white, dark blue, light blue, dark green, purple, light purple, green, red, pink.\nMetal Thread: silver strip close S-wound on yellow silk core; couched with pink silk.",
