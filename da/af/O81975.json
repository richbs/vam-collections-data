They were used in large numbers in place of  more cumbersome conventional artillery. As the Persian name suggests they were intended to harrass and annoy, disrupting enemy formations in preparation for the decisive cavalry charges that dominated the tactics of Central and South Asian cultures. However, like many other more mundane arms produced in large quantities, few survive to this day. Unlike other examples which resemble large muskets, this piece has a bronze barrel like a small cannon. It illustrates one possible line of development from ship-mounted swivels introduced into India by the Portuguese in 1498.",
