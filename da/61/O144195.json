All parts are decorated with floral motifs.  There is a lobed pendant attached top and bottom.  This central composition appears to have been printed first and then three and a half blue meandering stems with exotic blossoms have been printed to fill the rest of the central panel.  This is framed by two narrow borders containing white or yellow lozenges between which is a wider band [band a] with fat botehs containing floral motifs on a white ground.  There are three different motifs. The botehs are surrounded by a red design of fan-like motifs. In each of the four corners there is a diagonal tear-drop medallion  with flowers. There is a wide red border with a darker red pattern and white lobed cartouches containing black nastaliq inscriptions.  There are four different inscriptions, repeated.\nAlong the top and bottom is a wider version of band [a] with the addition of a pair of small tear drops between the botehs.  The botehs point towards the centre are those in the top row face the opposite direction to those in the bottom row.\nThe whole is framed by a series of narrow borders, the predominant one has an off-white ground with a blue meander and flower heads and leaves.  This pattern is used as a band to separate the cartouche border from the outer boteh band.\nColours: two shades of red, blue, yellow, black.\nThere are two selvedges.\nThere are red registration pin marks in the central field.",
