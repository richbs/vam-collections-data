The carved crest with crossed S-scrolls and symmetrical outer scrolls and acanthus is set onto the turned rear uprights and the plain inner uprights which enclose an arched caned panel. The lower back rail is tenoned into the rear uprights and is carved on its lower edge with scrolls and leaves. Below the seat the rear uprights rake gently backwards adn the back feet have been built up at the back with a triangular shaped block. The front legs, set at 45 degrees, are carved in the form of an extended S-scroll and are joined by a simple, moulded stretcher of arched form with small carved 'leaves' at either end, creating larger tenons into the front legs. The plain seat frame (the side rails tenoned into the front rail) is set onto the front legs and tenoned directly into the rear uprights. A reinforcing batten has been added inside the seat frame, screwed behind (and into) the back rail.\n\nWith heavy stain overall. This chair appears to be in essentially original condition, apart probably from replaced caning.",
