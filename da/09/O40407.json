He is sitting in the lotus or meditating position. His mouth is closed and his head tilts downwards. He is deep in his own world and makes no attempt to engage with the viewer. His shaven head suggests that he has renounced the material world, and expresses his devotion to spiritual life. Long earlobes are said to represent wisdom and spiritualism but also, in east Asia, long life.",
