In the course the Second World War, it became the NSDAP official section for national welfare, overseeing the evacuation of children from cities (where they were at risk from bombing raids) to the countryside, and providing childcare for women employed in war-work.  This poster presents photographic images of kindergartens, and of women, free to work because of the NSV.  One caption reads, 'her child is well cared for in the work's cr\u00e8che. With a glad heart she is now able to make superior weapons for our soldiers' campaign.'",
