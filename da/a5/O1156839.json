The soft floral print is a rare instance of Vionnet using a patterned fabric. \n\nThis Vionnet design formed part of the wardrobe of Lady Minoru Foley (around 1888-1968). Lady Foley was among the women of privilege who could afford the finest quality textiles, meticulously crafted gowns and highly personal attention offered by couture houses such as Vionnet's.",

The other dresses are held in the collections of The Bowes Museum and The Fashion Museum, Bath. \n\nLady Foley was born Minoru Greenstone, the daughter of mine owner Harry Greenstone of Johannesburg, South Africa. She married the seventh Baron Foley (1895-1927), a former flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force who became Baron in 1918. Lord Foley died in 1927.\n\nMinoru Foley\u2019s marriage introduced her to British society. During the early to mid-1920s, the couple is listed in the Times Social Register as attending events of the London season and travelling to Paris on several occasions. Lord and Lady Foley\u2019s son was born in 1923. Photographs of the couple taken by Bassano Ltd are held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Lady Foley was among the women of privilege who could afford the finest quality textiles, meticulously crafted designs and highly personal attention offered by couture houses such as Vionnet\u2019s. \n\nThe nine dresses together comprise a remarkable record of a decade of designs for a single client by one of the 20th century\u2019s most important couturiers. In addition, the objects date from the last decade of Vionnet\u2019s career, and represent Vionnet at her most sophisticated and complex, at the height of her design powers.",
