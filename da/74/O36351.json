The structure is rather like a car shape. \n1. base; plain wood with four wheels on the sides rather than underneath. Protruding from the centre is a post on which fit the other three parts. \n2. L shape; painted red; there is a hole drilled through the base so it may be stacked on the post. \n3. L shape; painted yellow; it is similar to the red one but slightly smaller. 4. Dragon's head; plain wood carved with an open mouth and two ridges on the top of the head. It has a hole drilled through the head to represent the eyes; and a second one underneath so it may be stacked. \n*The wood has been turned and carved then painted and smoothed. It has not been polished or varnished and there remain some roughened\nparts. The toy would not be considered suitable for very young children.",
