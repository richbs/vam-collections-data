The round tapering rod handle is novel in its orientation-curving back towards the blade. It is completely chased with beautiful scalework and terminates in a ball drop. It attaches underneath the rear of the blade, which is raised in a hemispherical cone shape to receive the handle, which is flattened underside into the plane of the blade. Despite its weight, the server is excellently balanced and surprisingly light in the hand.",

            "public_access_description": "This server is of a novel flat-iron construction that is simple, functional, and elegant in its conception. It mingles the antique and the modern. The regimented ranks of the shoal of fish with which the trowel-like blade has been pierced are held together by engraved serpentine curves that suggest their watery environment, and reflect the overall shape of the blade. The scrolling is echoed in the arch of the scaled handle, which unites the flat plane of the blade with the three-dimensional writhe of the tail, integrating the form and ornament. This server is visually and physically satisfying in its balance, proportion and unity. Although undeniably contemporary, it incorporates references to late 18th Century serpent handles, to the traditional trowel blade, and to the early 18th Century love of the Rococo scroll.",
