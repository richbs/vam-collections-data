            "public_access_description": "This is a campaign poster issued by the 'B\u00fcndnis 90' (Alliance 90) / 'Neues Forum (New Forum) for the first and only free parliamentary elections ('Volkskammerwahl') in East Germany (GDR-German Democratic Republic) on the 18th of March 1990. The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThis black lithograph on a yellow background shows a man with nails driven into his head. The nails bear the initials of the various oppositional political parties. The text states: 'Wir machen N\u00e4gel mit K\u00f6pfen!!! (SPD, CDU, PDS, DA, FDP, DSU, LDP,\u2026.) - So Nicht'. This means: 'to do it thoroughly (or to cross the t's and dot the i's) - not in that way' [referring to the opposition parties].\n\nAlliance 90 came together for the People\u2019s Chamber elections. It consisted of different groups emerging out of the Citizen's Movement. These were: 'Neues Forum' ('New Forum'), 'Initiative f\u00fcr Frieden und Menschenrechte' ('Initiative for Peace and Human Rights') and 'Demokratie Jetzt' ('Democracy Now'). Later on B\u00fcndnis 90 became a political party. On the 14th of May 1993 it aligned with the party 'Die Gr\u00fcnen' ('The Greens) to become 'B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen' ('Alliance 90/The Greens').\n\nThe Alliance did not do well at the elections for the People's Chamber, although it had been representatives from these groups who managed to provide the moral and intellectual basis for the 'Wende' ('turnaround), often by overcoming state repressions. They were the negotiators at the 'round tables' and provided the basis which led to overthrow of the GDR-system and ultimately the GDR itself. There was, nevertheless, no great trust in Alliance 90 to manage the desired reunification because the groups within the Alliance were initially formed to reform the GDR, rather than join West Germany.",
