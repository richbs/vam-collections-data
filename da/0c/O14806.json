Pope-Hennessy describes it as being \"clearly of Venetian origin\" and dates the object to the last quarter of the twelfth-century. \nWilliamson notes similarities to a capital, said to have come from Venice, with a more stylised acanthus strip at the bottom (now in the Bode museum) in Berlin, but suggests that the capital is closest in style to one in the cathedral cloister at Pistoia. He suggests that the present capital is later than both these examples on the basis of the finer detail and more delicate carving and proposes a date of the first quarter of the thirteenth century.",
