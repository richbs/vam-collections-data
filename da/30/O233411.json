Weavers in many Italian cities manufactured silks, while Italian merchants imported silks from Central Asia, Turkestan and Iran, and other silks were received as gifts from the Mongol territories which stretched from China into eastern Europe. \n\nThe silk imports were woven with asymmetrical designs featuring lotus flowers on scrolling stems or exotic creatures, such as dragons and phoenixes. The patterns flowed and their colours were often bright and shimmered with gold. They contrasted with the western European symmetrical designs of roundels containing paired animals or with striped or geometric patterns.\n\nThis Italian-made silk combines European and oriental motifs. It demonstrates how Italian merchants adapted some of the motifs from imported silks into their own products. Weavers in both Lucca and Venice made silks in this style.",

New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2008, p. 14, fig. 13.\nLisa Monnas discusses this piece in the context of the response of Italian silk manufacturers to the success of imported oriental silks. Silks from Lucca and Venice came to be woven in an eastern style incorporating western motifs (such as hunting, courtly love; dogs, falcons, castles and ladies are juxtaposed with scrolls bearing pseudo-Arabic script, fantastic creatures or orientalising scrolling flowers). Predominantly produced in lampas weave, the texture of the ground was created by main warps and ground wefts, contrasted with the pattern which was created by pattern or brocading wefts held in place by separate binding warps. Italian lampas silks were given orientalising names, such as <i>baldacchino</i> which is thought to derive from <i>Baldacco</i>, the Italian name for Bagdad (p. 14).",
