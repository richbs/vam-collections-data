It was Stravinsky's second ballet for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and used a story of traditional street puppets, the Russian equivalent of Punch and Judy, who are brought to life by a showman. The first performance was given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, in 1911, when the Showman was danced by Enrico Cecchetti. \n\nPetrushka was designer Alexandre Benois' most important production. The ballet was frequently revived and between 1911 and 1957 Benois redrew the sets and costumes for 14 different productions. He would often inscribe later designs with the names of the dancers who created the roles, and as his designs are similar in style they can be difficult to date. The majority of the original drawings were annotated and signed in Russian.\n\nThis design is dated 1936 and was made for the 1936 staging by the Ballet de Monte Carlo, first seen at the Alhambra Theatre in London, with Nicolas Zverev as the Showman. It shows him in his stage costume and in the everyday clothes which he wears in the final scene.",
