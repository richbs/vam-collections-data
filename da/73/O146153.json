The 8-pointed motif is edged with isolated leaf or fan-like flowers with black details, while each of the 4 points of the large star terminates in a composite pendant form based on a small cypress tree motif.\nIn each of the four corners is a large composite boteh form [max. length 62 cm] pointing into the centre, infilled with thin and thick green stems, botehs, paired leaves in various shapes and a 9-pointed star in blue. The ground is red with predominantly mid-blue and leaf green, with white highlights. This main motif is surmounted by a smaller boteh edged in blue and black with an orange infill, and is flanked around the base by a series of botehs with associated leaf pendants.  Again mid-blue, red, green predominate. In between each of these corner motifs a large lobed triangular form edged with red stems with white/black 'beads', again densely packed with 2 addorsed botehs and a cypress tree - the predominate colours are green, red, blue and some yellow with thin red stems. The lobed form carries isolated flower or leaf forms.  Around all four sides, a 7 cm band in mainly red carrying two small green botehs, between a small cypress tree motif or a lobed triangular form in blue. A narrow green stripe carrying alternately small green or blue botehs forms the inner edge of this band, while the outermost border is formed of a red meander on a green ground framing 5-petalled rosettes in two shades of red.  Both sides are edged with a red stem with white/black 'beads'. at both ends, a 5 cm section of unwoven warp threads followed by 1 cm of twill weave terminating in a short fringe.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied wool: black, white, pink, purple, orange, green, two shades of red, blue.\nOn this piece it is possible to see how the embroiderer started [or finished?] using a length of thread: there is no knot but the stitching begins outside the motif being worked.",
