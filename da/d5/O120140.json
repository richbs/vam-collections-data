The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.  They represented a wide variety of subjects but those of actors and actresses were especially popular.\n\nThis spill vase figure represents Little Red Riding Hood, who appeared in a French collection of fairy tales published by Charles Perrault in 1697 and translated into English in 1729.  Little Red Riding Hood is shown meeting the wolf in the woods.  The wolf subsequently eats Red Riding Hood's grandmother, impersonating the grandmother in bed and consuming Red Riding Hood. This spill vase may have been produced because the tale was generally popular at the time, or because there was a burlesque dramatisation of the story at the Adelphi Theatre in about 1850.",
