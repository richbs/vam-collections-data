Although ivory, wood and stone are relatively easy to carve, other materials such as gemstones are much more demanding. Most of these carvings were made for wealthy patrons and collectors, who delighted in the rarity of the material and quality of the carving. This small figure is remarkable for its closely observed detail. It was clearly intended for a cultivated patron, who would have placed it in his study or cabinet. Samson was one of the Old Testament judges. By killing a lion with his bare hands, he foreshadowed Christ\u2019s  victory over evil.",
