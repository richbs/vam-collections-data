Series of silver plaques often with a related theme, such as scenes from the life of Christ, were commonly used by goldsmiths to decorate the surfaces of larger church objects. \n\nThe plaque is one of three from the same source. The others depict St John and the descent of Christ into hell after his death. They were possibly made by Enrique de Arfe, one of the most successful Renaissance goldsmiths in Spain, or by a goldsmith associated with his workshop. De Arfe trained in Cologne in Germany but spent much of his career on commissions for monumental church silver in Spanish cathedrals.\n\nFor the other two plaques in this series, see M.510:21-1956 and M.510:23-1956.",

Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
