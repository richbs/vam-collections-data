Her head is covered with a veil of which one end was held in her lost left hand. \nThe figure is wormeaten. A circular hole on the underside of the base, and another on top of the head indicate where the block of wood was fixed during the carving process. Some cracks occur on the back of the head. The veil, face, cloak, and  left hand have been abraded. The lost left hand originally held the veil gathered over the right arm. The tip of the shoe and the small finger of the right hand are missing. The blue colour on the the cloak and the red on the gown are later overpaint. Traces of gesso remain on the neck and face.",

Sch\u00e4dler suggested verbally in 1972 an origin in Swabia, and a date of about 1510  (Departmental records). The stylistic features and the scheme of the drapery can indeed be associated with sculptures from the workshop of Niklaus Weckmann (active in Ulm about 1490 to about 1530), for instance the Virgin from a Crucifixion group, of about 1510/20 in the church St Michael at Ulm  (Exh. Stuttgart 1992, p. 470, no. 79), and another Mourning Virgin in the W\u00fcrttembergisches in Landesmuseum Stuttgart (Exh. Stuttgart 1992, p. 119, ill. 149).",
