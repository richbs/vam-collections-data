It is sufficiently close in style and subject to No. 103 [135-1888] to warrant its being listed here in conjunction with that work.\n\nNotes on Nos. 100-104 [326-1888, 128-1888, 583-1888, 135-1888, 325-1888]\n\nNos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888] are the earliest dated oil sketches in the Museum's collections to show the full originality of Constable's mature style, its vivid naturalism of colouring and boldness of handling.  The earliest dated sketch in which these characteristics are applied to Suffolk scenery is probably the 'Country road near East Berghold' inscribed <i>October 13th, 1809 E[ast] B[erghold].</i>  This was Lot 116 <i>recto</i> (on the <i>verso</i> is a sketch of a country house) in the Gregory sale at Messrs.  Sotheby's, 20 July 1949.  This sketch was reproduced in monochrome in the sale catalogue and in colour as the frontispiece to the Arts Council's catalogue <i>An Exhibition of Sketches & Drawings by John Constable from the collection of Dr. H. A. C. Gregory, M.C., </i> 1949.  In 'Fresh Light on John Constable' (<i>Apollo</i>, Vol. LXXXVII, 1968, pp. 227-30) Charles Rhyne draws attention to oil sketches dated 27 September 1810 and 30 September 1810 in the John G. Johnson collection, Philadelphia, and a landscape with houses dated 8 October 1810 in the collection of Mrs. Woodman.  The style may be seen in embryo in some of the oil sketches Constable made of Lake District scenery in 1806: for instance in 'Keswick Lake' formerly in the possession of Sir Michael Sadler (L. ed. S., Pl. 32).  The reasons for grouping Nos. 102 [583-1888], 103 [135-1888], and 104 [325-1888] with these two dated oil sketches have not been explained; they do not amount to a conclusive dating.  Sketching in oils from nature was in fact prominent in Constable's practice in 1811, for he called on nature, and on 17 December Farington called on Constable to see the painted studies of landscapes from nature which he had made during the autumn (Greig, Vol. VI, p. 279; VII, p. 70).  Another set of studies conveniently, though more loosely, grouped here with the appearance of Constable's completely matured naturalism is to be found in Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888].\"",
