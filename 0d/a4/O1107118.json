In 1607-8 he was chosen to head an embassy to Britain, seeking support in a crusade against the Turks and to encourage commercial relations between the two countries. He was noted for his practice of always wearing Persian costume. In 1628 he was dismissed by the Shah, who accused him of frivolity. This greatly distressed Shirley and may have led to his death, which occurred only six weeks later.",
