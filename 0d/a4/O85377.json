They were made of very fine fritware which had been cut away in places to form a pattern that was then filled by the glaze.\n\nFritware was also known as stone paste or quartz paste. It was developed by Middle Eastern potters as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain. The main ingredient was fine quartz powder made by grinding sand or pebbles. Small quantities of white clay and a glassy substance known as frit were added. The clay gave plasticity. The frit helped to bind the body after firing.",
