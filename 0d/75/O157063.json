He studied at Hornsey and the Royal College of Art; at the latter he was a fellow student of David Hockney, R.B. Kitaj, Derek Boshier and Peter Phillips who were to become some of the most important British artists of their generation and with whom he shares certain qualities of picture-making. This piece is a relatively early work, made before he had fully developed his characteristic focus on the erotic and fetishism associated with  female sexuality. However, this image does suggest a romantic encounter. \n\nIn 1963, the year he made this print, Jones was awarded the  Prix des Jeunes Artistes at the Paris Biennale.",
