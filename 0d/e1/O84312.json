The short sleeves have bold cuffs beneath which are layers of frills in white and cream lace, the underfrills set onto net.  The full skirt is pleated into the waistband and the skirt opens at the centre front revealing layers of deep off white lace petticoat overlaid with off white lace frills set onto underskirts of off white and white cotton. The bodice panel, cuffs and open skirt front are edged with olive green velvet ribbon and a gold braid threaded with narrow orange velvet ribbon.  On the underskirt of the lace panel are sets of large press studs probably to attach to a pannier.  Across the centre bust in the bodice is a padded bar and two foam bust forms.  The costume fastens at the back with hooks and eyes, press studs and a large hook and bar at the waist.",

It was designed by the German designer Jurgen Rose for the 1974 production of Verdi's opera Un Ballo in Maschera (A Masked Ball) at the Royal Opera House.  In fact, it is for a member of the chorus at the ball, and, in isolation, looks more outstanding than it would have done on stage, amid dozens of other extravagant costumes and under stage lights.  Sometimes, if there are many colourful and highly patterned such costumes in a chorus, the only way to highlight the principals is to dress them in simple, solid colours.  \nComplete authenticity is rarely the aim of a designer, especially in opera, which usually means large stages and auditoria.   The fabric, with its rich coral colour and bold pattern of birds, flowers and foliage, has a suggestion of Chinosierie, which is in keeping with the 18th century, but if the designer had selected more authentic, delicate patterns in the Oriental style, the dress would have made little impact.",
