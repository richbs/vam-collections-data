Huge rejas (screens) from this period still adorn many Spanish churches and cathedrals, serving to divide the liturgical spaces, most particularly the altar, choir and side chapels. Though often large in scale, some as much as 9 metres high, their makers used difficult and physically demanding techniques, often having to work the metal when cold. The common appearance of the maker's name included in the scheme suggests that these rejas were considered as masterpieces of the craft. They showed the latest ornamental vocabulary, and were topped with bold arabesque figures, scrolls and coats of arms, heightened with gilding and colour.\n\nThe portions of screen from Avila Cathedral displayed here and in Gallery 29A were made by Juan Frances, whose proud inscription adorns one of the crestings. Frances was working at Toledo Cathedral as early as 1482. He also made the screen for the choir at the Church of Alcala de Henares.
