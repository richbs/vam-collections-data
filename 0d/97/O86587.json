It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nMax Miller, with his trademark flower-patterned suit, was one of Britain\u2019s most popular stand-up comics from the 1930s to the 1950s. He entertained fellow soldiers during the war, beginning his career with a concert party in his home town Brighton, and was famous for his mastery of a live audience. His risqu\u00e9 humour earned him the nickname \u2018The Cheeky Chappie\u2019 and a 5-year ban from BBC radio.",
