Alexander Dyce, 1869.  \nReference to Dyce : Science and Art Department of the Committee of Council on Education, South Kensington Museum.<u>A Catalogue of the Paintings, Miniatures, Drawings... Bequeathed by The Reverend Alexander Dyce</u>.  London, 1874.  A 'Note' on p.v. comments, 'This catalogue refers to the Art portion of the Collection bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum by the Reverend Alexander Dyce, the well-known Shakespearian scholar, who died May 15, 1869'.  The <u>Catalogue. Paintings, Miniatures, &c.</u> by Samuel Redgrave notes of the 'Oil Paintings', 'The strength of Mr. Dyce's valuable bequest to Department of Science and Art does not lie in [this] portion ... which is in its nature of a very miscellaneous character.  The collection was made apparently as objects offered themselves, and without any special design.'\n\nDyce owned 3 oils by Stothard (Dyce. 27, 28, 29), which reflected his interest in Shakespeare and other literary subjects.  A further oil painting (Dyce.49) has now been attributed to Stothard, while a sketch on paper in oil (Dyce.884) was originally catalogued as a 'drawing', along with other sketches and designs by Stothard (Dyce. 825 to 910).\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Stothard (1755-1834) was a highly prolific painter, book illustrator and designer.  After his father's death in 1770 he began his working life apprenticed to a Huguenot silk weaver. At the completion of his apprenticeship in 1777 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, and there struck up life-long friendships with the sculptor John Flaxman and with William Blake.  He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1778 until his death in 1834, and from 1778 also began to produce illustrations for various publishers and magazines such as the <u>Ladies' Magazine</u>.  He sometimes exhibited the original designs for such illustrations at the Royal Academy exhibitions.  In his day he was highly respected as a history painter in oil, but the V&A collections of drawings and watercolours reflect his reputation during the 19th century predominantly as an illustrator, as well as a designer of a multitude of objects such as silver salvers to funerary monuments.  As the <u>Dictionary of National Biography</u> notes, Stothard took 'advantage of the opportunities afforded by publishing and the industrial arts, while maintaining a reputation in the more respectable reaches of high art'.  For example Stothard exhibited works on a grander scale than was his norm for Bowyer's 'Historic Gallery' (1790-1806).  But many of the oils now in the V&A are on a modest scale and are perhaps designs for printed illustrations, rather than 'finished' history paintings.  Stothard played a respected part in the art world of his day, and from 1812 until his death at the age of seventy-nine he held the post of librarian of the Royal Academy.\n\nIn 18th century Britain William Shakespeare's plays underwent something of a renaissance in popularity.  A number of significant new editions of his work were published and the theatrical revival from the mid 18th century relied heavily on productions of his plays.  Shakespeare had become associated with a rising British nationalism, which led also to a growing interest in British history.  This tendency was exploited by both John Boydell's <i>Shakespeare Gallery</i>, and by Robert Bowyer's <i>Historic Gallery</i>.  Boydell was an engraver and publisher who commissioned oil paintings for exhibition, with the intention of generating interest in printed versions.  He began the project in 1786, which led to an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays, and a folio of prints.  It is not clear whether Stothard exhibited finished oil paintings in Boydell's gallery, but he contributed designs to both the <u>Folio</u> and the <u>Illustrated edition</u>; unfortunately the subject matter of the V&A's paintings of Shakespeare by Stothard do not match any of these works.  Bowyer originally commissioned images for an illustrated edition of David Hume's <u>History of England</u>, but following Boydell's example, he placed original paintings on display in his <i>Historic Gallery</i>.  Stothard had produced illustration's to an earlier edition of Hume, published by Thomas Cadell, and for Bowyer's gallery he painted a exceptionally large version in oil of his printed headpiece of the murdered princes in the tower.  \n\nIt remains unclear as to whether this small oil painting is a sketch for a printed illustration or is a finished oil intended primarily for display and sale.  On the one hand it has not been possible to match this image to a finished print or illustration and modesty of scale is no indication of function as large scale oils were rare  in his oeuvre.  On the other, Stothard was so prolific as an illustrator and designer that it may yet prove to be a design for an illustration. The subject is the murder of Prince Edward (1453-71), the only son of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou, which - according to Tudor sources - reputedly occurred after the Battle of Tewkesbury, and is taken from Shakespeare's <u>Henry VI</u>, Part iii, Act 5, sc.5 :\n<i>Queen Margaret</i> 'O Ned, sweet Ned! Speak to thy mother, boy! / Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers! ... How sweet a plant have you untimely cropped!'",
