It is fully painted and both the facial features are indicated by two pink cheek dots; black eyes and brows (eyes are dots with small lines above) and red mouths. The figures and bench are one unit and the bottom edge spreads out and forms the attachment to the base which is painted green. The whole is varnished. The woman is painted with light brown hair; an ochre yellow dress and head dress. The dress is decorated with dark green and red flowers and dark green dots around the neck representing a necklace. The man is painted with a dark\ngreen jacket and orange trousers; it has dark brown hair and an ochre yellow head dress. Both head dresses are decorated with red dots. The bench is painted a light brown with green lines and red dots. \n*This is both a toy and a symbol; the theme is expressed in other mediums such as wood. The symbolic message is probbly representing happiness and good marriage. \nA N Varganov is a well known and internationally known maker of these toys. His work is represented in other museums in the USA; Australia; Japan and Germany. He comes from a traditional craft family making these types of toys; both wooden and papier mach\u00e9; from before 1900. The base is also marked TB which is the signature of TA Varganova; the wife or daughter of the maker.",
