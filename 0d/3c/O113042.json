Dry brown residue inside bottle.\n[Bottle] Octagonal glass bottle with silver-gilt cap over a glass stopper.  Contains brown liquid.\n[Box] Silver-gilt box decorated with relief compositions of silver and silver- gilt shell, foliage, and fountains.  On the lid the ornament is enclosed within cartouches of shell, scroll and foliage.  The relief compositions on the lid and base are identical in design; the two short sides are similar to each other; the two long sides are similar to each other.  Each pair has probably been made by pressing the metal into a mould.  All six panels are  inlaid with mother of pearl.  On the lid and on the base the mother of pearl is tinted green within the cartouche, probably by painting on the reverse.  The green colour is fugitive, but there are patches where the colour is stronger.  Outside the cartouches on the lid and the base the mother of pearl is pink, the colour stronger on the base which has been exposed to light.  \n\nThe lid is mounted on the inside with  a mirror.  The body contains four empty compartments covered by hinged silver-gilt lids each with a flower inside a scroll and shell cartouche, the ground of the area within the cartoche inlaid with shell laid over a ground decorated with a herring-bone pattern partly missing.  Three of the lids have similar cartouches and flowers, probably made by pressing the metal into a mould.  One plane curved lid with a catch covers two compartments which are lined in red velvet.  Each contains an octagonal glass  bottle with a gilt-metal screw-cap over a glass stopper.",

Probably one contained beauty patches, made of black material, which, when applied to the face, would have been put in place using the mirror mounted inside the lid.  \n\nThe asymmetric ornament on the box - shell, fountains, foliage, scrolls - is characteristic of the high rococo in France, first found in the late 1720s and popular until displaced by neo-classicism from about 1760.  \n\nMade of silver and silver-gilt, the box is an example of a box which was highly fashionable, but not as expensive as the boxes made of gold.  The silver and silver-gilt ornament has been made by pressing the metal into a mould (probably copper alloy), a labour-saving method which would have saved time in comparison with chasing by hand.  By this means two each of three different designs have been made for the three pairs of plaques: top and bottom, two short sides, and two long sides.",

Although described by Grandjean as having an illegible mark and as probably a foreign production dating from the 19th century, imitating a Paris box of the second half of the 18th century, the mark appears to be the shell mark of 1756-62.  Although both the Louvre and the V&A boxes are of the same, relatively modest type, it is suggested here that they are 18th century Paris productions.\nLos Llanos, Jos\u00e9 de and Christiane Gr\u00e9goire. <i>Mus\u00e9e Cognacq-Jay: Les Collections.
