The moulds are hollow and have been painted a pink flesh colour, but as the materials have deteriorated parts have discoloured to a red / brown colour.. The head has moulded face detail but no hair. The torso is a strange shape as the stomachs area protrudes as if pregnant but the there are no breasts. similarly the lower body and legs are a strange shape wide and flat. the two pieces of body do not comfortably fit together. the feet of the doll face in different directions the left hand foot fans out to the left and the right foot is straight. The unusual appearance of the doll suggests a moulding experiment which does not appear to have been wholly successful.",
