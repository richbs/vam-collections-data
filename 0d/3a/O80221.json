This vase is typical in shape to examples produced by several firms. It could have been used for dried or fresh flowers as the oiled and oven baked papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was waterproof.\n\nPeople\nJennens & Bettridge, the firm run by Theodore Hyla Jennens and John Bettridge between 1816 and 1864, were famous for the range of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 goods manufactured in their factory at 99, Constitution Hill, Birmingham. They also had premises at 6 Halkin Street West, Belgrave Square, London. The firm produced a range of products including writing boxes, trays, fans, and larger pieces of furniture such as chairs, tables and sofas. This vase is stamped on the bottom with the firm's name.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPapier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 \u201a was made by pasting layers of paper over moulds of the required shape. The mould for this vase was cut horizontally and the two halves pasted together with more layers of paper. After oiling and baking at very high temperatures, the vase would have been varnished and painted before the gilded decoration was added. A final coat of varnish was then applied before the vase was stove-dried and polished.",
