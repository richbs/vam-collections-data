The back piece consists of crest rail, bottom rail and two inner stiles each carved with a crown between matching S-scrolls, with a single central muntin chip-carved with scrolling leaves and two narrow panels of caning. The arms with scrolls handles are deeply moulded and meet the back uprights in an up-sweep. The four seat rails (replacements) are rectangular in profile and scratch-carved with a diamone repeat pattern on their upper and outer surfaces.\n\nThe front legs are carved in a gentle S-scroll with leaf work on the front face, and are spiral turned above the seat. A mid-height front stretcher is carved with a crown between two S-scrolls. Between the legs runs an H-form stretcher with spiral turning (single bine in the centre, double bine on the sides) which meets the legs at squared blocks. A back stretcher of double bine spiral turning runs at mid-height. \n\nModifications\nSeat and seat frame completely replaced.  New caning to back. Large patches to scroll tips of arms.",

            "public_access_description": "Caned chairs appeared in England soon after the Restoration of King Charles II, and quickly became popular, being cheaper, lighter and less prone to dust and pest than their upholstered equivalents. They were widely recorded in middle-class as well as noble house inventories well into the first half of the eighteenth century. Both the technique and the material (rattan cane or calamus rotang split into long narrow strips) came from Asia. The canes were imported in large quantities by the East India Company to London, where the production of caned furniture was concentrated. Caned chairs were also exported from London in large quantities, so much so that in France they were known as chaises d'anglaise, and in the German states as englische St\u00fchle. They were often used with a light seat cushion. Unlike upholstered chairs, caned chairs seem to have been produced through a subdivision of piece-work labour by journeymen joiners, turners, caners and carvers, who seem often to have stamped their work with initials.\n\nThis example has had substantial restoration to the seat, and replacement caning.",
