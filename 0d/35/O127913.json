His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1944, Messel was released from his war duties as a Camouflage Officer in Norwich to work on the Gabriel Pascal (1894-1954)  film Caesar and Cleopatra, reputedly the most expensive film made in Britain at the time.  Despite war time rationing and scarcity of materials, he successfully combined knowledge of Egyptian and Classical style with the liberty that a 1940s audience would understand. \n\nMessel designed numerous props in pastiche of Egyptian style, including this design for a stool in the music room of Cleopatra\u2019s opulent palace in Alexandria.  His notes specify that the chair should have the appearance of ivory inlaid with ebony and gold.",
