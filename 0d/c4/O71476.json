For much of the 20th century, photography was transmitted not in the form of silver or platinum-based prints but in ink, and although Evans was a masterly printer of platinum photographs, this is a photogravure. It is one of a group by the Swan Electric Engraving Co., produced in 1900 from a photograph taken in 1895.",
