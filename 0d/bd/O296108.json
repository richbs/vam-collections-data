            "public_access_description": "Men throughout Europe wore silver buttons with their traditional costume in the 19th century.  Although filigree buttons were the most typical, many countries used buttons made of sheet metal as well.  Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats.\n\nButtons were rarely sewn directly on to the clothing.  In the north of Europe people fastened them to their costume with a strip of leather, which ran through the button loops inside the garment.  In the south, they used T-shaped toggles permanently attached to the button.\n\nThis button comes from Salamanca.  The men of Salamanca wore large flat buttons, like this, in rows on their waistcoats.  They could be round or octagonal in shape, and were decorated with chased or engraved flowers.  Some were made of silver, but many, like this one, were brass or nickel.  This button was bought for six shillings (for six) at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
