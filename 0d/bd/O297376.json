She was born Jane Anne Gordon Lethbridge in 1866 and married Clifford Cory (of Cory Brothers & Co., colliery owners and oil refiners) in 1893. They had no children, and her extensive jewellery collection which included diamond jewellery from the Russian crown jewels was left to the V&A at her death in 1947 (museum numbers M.58to157-1951).\n\nThe portrait belonged to the nephew of Lady Cory's companion Georgina Sibbald, who as a child and young man often visited Lady Cory. He remembered her room full of musical automata that she would set in motion for him, and that on each visit she would give him a large white five pound note. He recalled that in her concern for animal welfare she made him promise never to go to a circus, a promise he kept throughout his life.\n\nThe artist Athelstane (or Athelstone) Bas\u00e9b\u00e9 is recorded as exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1882 (living at 199 Brompton Road) and 1899 (living in Watford).",
