            "public_access_description": "The Ratepayers' Iolanthe was a satirical adaptation by Ned Sherrin and Alistair Beaton of the light opera by Gilbert and Sullivan. It was performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in 1984, just a few hundred metres from the Greater London Council offices in County Hall, at a time when Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government had started to argue for the abolition of the GLC. It has been suggested that this decision was in part due to the left-leaning Ken Livingstone-governed council being in direct conflict with the ideologies of Thatcher's government at the time. \n\nThe poster features caricatures of Thatcher and Livingstone in the tabloid newspaper style, giving some indication of the irreverent nature of the show. The character of Strephon (renamed Red Strephon) was played as Livingstone, with the Queen of the Fairies as Thatcher. Phyllis, whom Red Strephon is in love with, is being wooed by the Chancellor because she is the heiress of the Greater London Estate.",
