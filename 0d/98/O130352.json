            "public_access_description": "This is one of 28 anonymous panels, painted around 1490-1500, which originally decorated the ceiling of a Lombard palace. They represent profile heads and coats of arms, enclosed within decorative borders. The heads repeat three generalised types with minor variations: seven of young women with Lombard hair styles facing left, six of young men wearing bonnets facing right, as in this panel, six Roman emperors within roundels facing left, and four facing right. Such decorative panels decorated the leading edges of the wooden joists which supported the flat, grid-like ceilings in the principal rooms of fifteenth century Lombard palaces.  \n\nThe identifiable arms are those of the North Italian noble families of Vimercati and Malatesta. It is likely that these panels were commissioned to commemorate the wedding of Francesco Vimercati of Crema to a lady of the Malatesta family , which probably occurred sometime after 1487. Vimecati had a distinguished career as a Podesta, or principal magistrate, in several major North Italian cities, including Mantua, Reggio Emilia, Lucca and Florence. The location of his residence is unknown, but as two palaces of other members of Vimercati family in Crema have similar ceilings, it is likely that it was also in his native city of Crema, near Milan.", 
            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "Kauffmann, C.M., <i>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, I. Before 1800</i>. London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 172-74, cat. no. 213.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\t\n\nLOMBARD School, c. 1490-1500 \n\n213 \n29 PAINTED PANELS: 23 WITH PROFILE BUSTS, 6 WITH ARMORIAL SHIELDS\nTempera on spruce \nAverage size 18 x 16 (46 x 41) \n1325/53-1901 \n\nThese panels originally formed a frieze immediately beneath a coffered ceiling of a type common in Lombard palaces of the later 15th century (for an example of such a decorative scheme still in situ see W. Terni di Gregory, <i>Pittura artigiana lombarda del Rinascimento</i>, 1958, fig. 41). The same few heads are reproduced several times with only slight variations: (1) a young man wearing a headdress of about 1490-1500 (seven); (2) a woman with a headdress of about 1490-1500 (seven); (3) Roman emperors and heroes wearing crowns (three); laurel wreaths (four) or ribbons (two). It is not clear whether the youthful contemporary figures are intended to represent illustrious men and women or members of the family, but in view of their interspersal with Roman emperors, the former seems the more likely alternative. \nThe six panels with armorial shields held by putti contain altogether three different coats of arms. Two of these can be identified; (1) the arms of the Vimercati (or three bends gules on a chief azure two mulletts or) appearing on three panels, one of which - 1353-1901 - seems, from the 16th century form of the shield, to be a later addition; (2) those of the Malatesta (quarterly (1 and 4) bendy of six, 1,3 & 5 cheeky or and gules, 2, 4 & 6 argent; (2 and 3) vert, three men's heads couped, crined and bearded the upper two addorsed proper, within a bordure or and sable indented, appearing on two panels (the 1st and 2nd quarters have been transposed). As we know that Francesco Vimercati married a member of the Malatesta family at about the time when these panels were painted, these arms can be taken as evidence that the series originally decorated Francesco's palace. Little is known of Francesco, the son of Luigi Vimercati (d. 1452), except that he came from Crema and was, at various times Podesta (magistrate) at Mantua, Reggio Emilia, Lucca and Florence. He married the Malatesta princess during his second term of office in Mantua, which was presumably the one beginning in 1487. This fits well with the date of the paintings, which can be placed ca. 1490-1500 on grounds of style and costume. Such richly decorated ceilings were often erected in connection with a marriage alliance, and where three coats of arms are shown they are usually those of the owner, his wife and his mother (Terni di Gregory, p. 153, n. 20). The third coat of arms, therefore, which appears on 1349-1901 (quarterly (1 and 4) argent, two bars chancetty gules (2 and 3), azure, three mullets argent), and which has remained unidentified, is presumably that of the mother of Francesco, one of the two wives of Luigi Vimercati, about whom nothing has come to light. \nNor do we know the whereabouts of Francesco's main residence. \nNeither of the two well-known Vimercati palaces in Crema (both, incidentally, have similarly decorated ceilings) belonged to Francesco, but, as he definitely came from Crema and as he was treated as a Cremasco by the local historians (Terni di Gregory; Alemanio Fino, 1581), it seems most likely that his palace was in the vicinity of that city. \nThe undistinguished quality of the paintings suggests that they are the work of a local artisan and not of any known artist. For examples from a similar series of better quality, see under School of Mantua, ca. 1480 (66368-1904; no. 219). \n\nCondition. Most of the panels are damaged. \nProv.
