In the centre of the sheet, No. 33, is an illustration showing 5 boys seated around a table playing this game with a teetotum.\n\nThe pictorial label on the slip case shows a King, Bishop, sailor, soldier and a beggar and his dog.\n\nVILLAGE PORTRAITS, LONDON, EDWARD WALLIS, 42 SKINNER STREET, ISLINGTON - game held by the Essex  Institute Salem, Mass.\nThere is another similar game which closely resembles Every Man to His Station both in layout and subject matter called VILLAGE PORTRAITS.  It is also without rules.\nThe game would be played with a teetotum, markers and counters.  An agreed number of counters would be held by each player and placed in the central kitty.  The squares with a plus value -  either  a counter from each player or the kitty, or an extra turn - would probably by 1, 9, 10, 23, 27, 29, 31, 32, 34 and 35 with 36 taking the kitty if landed on cleanly.  The minus squares - giving a counter to each player or the kitty -  would probably be 2, 3, 6, 19, 20, 22, 26 and 33.  Action squares (read a poem, sing, dance, extra) with another turn or advancing one or more squares are probably 4, 7, 12, 14, 24, and 28.  Staying squares (miss a turn or two) are probably 5, 11, 13, 15, 18, 25 and 30.  The penalty for over-reaching 36 will be either missing a turn and staying where you are, moving backwards by the extra number or going back to the beginning.\n\nEdward Wallis did not use lithographs; so Village Portraits should be an engraving.  William Spooner from about 1835 was a great exponent of lithographs.\n\n*Rules were devised by C Goodfellow using various other like moral games, 1994.\n\nRules placement: none",
