It represents a type of poster that was designed in a 'before text' version by professional artists and then made available to district electoral offices by the party headquarters.  \n\nThe idea for the composition of the poster, which depicts a landscape, was triggered by the SZDSZ logo, consisting of three birds in the national colours. Gy\u00f6rgy Kara, the designer of the logo is also the author of the poster. Kara, joined later by his colleague P\u00e9ter Nagy, created a well functioning and clearly identifiable system of printed materials for the party. They had to consider the poor financial environment and improvisations were often unavoidable.  The design was therefore kept extremely simple. The schematic landscape with the soaring birds, however, does not fail to achieve an effect of clarity, freedom and cheerfulness.\n\nAt the bottom of the poster we can see another logo 'de' standing for 'demokratikus ellenz\u00e9k' (democratic opposition). The particle 'de' also has its own meaning that can be roughly translated as 'yes, indeed', 'for all that,' 'you bet'.\n\nThe poster serves as an invitation to two electoral assemblies held by Dr. Hack (7 and 14 of March) and to 'informal conversations each Monday in the restaurant Kisrabl\u00f3'. These were the first free election in Hungary following the collapse of communism.",
