Krohn-Hansen (Trondhjems Gullsmedkunst 1550-1850, Oslo and Bergen, 1963) illustrates 3 examples of the general type but with sppirally fluted sides made in late 17th-century or early 18th-century Trondheim, recording that no examples are known to him from elsewhere in Norway, even from Bergen, and that the design is uncommon in Denmark. These three pieces are directly imitated from a group made in Hamburg. The relation is much closer between the Museum's bowl and a bowl of 1658 by Anders Andersen Heins of Trondheim (Krohn-Hansen, Trondhjems Gullsmedkunst 1550-1850) with feet added later in the Rococo style ... No other Bergen example of this design appears to be recorded and the bowl is therefore of considerable rarity ... The initials J.F.M./E.H.D. are those of Johan Clausen Frimann (b. 1630 - d. 1706), manager and owner of great landed estates in Western Norway, and his second wife Else Henningsdatter Smith. The date of ther marriage is unrecorded, but their first child was born in 1681.\nThe initials Hr.O.F./D.F.M. are those of Otto Finde, parson in Volda from 1687 to 1741 and his second wife Drude Frimann, daughter of Johan Clausen Frimann by his first wife Maria Fuiren. Their date of marriage is not recorded, but their first child was born in 1698. The inscribed names M: F: Finde / Salig: Hr: Niels Legangers are those of Maria Fuiren Finde (b. 1700 - d. 1777), daughter of Otto Finde and Drude Frimann, who married in 1728 Niels Leganger (1682-1747), parson in Os by Bergen from 1704 to 1747.'",
