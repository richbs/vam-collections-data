(It is possible that these mouldings have been added to conceal shrinkage across the panels.) With a deep, slightly convex, top rail carved in low relief with scrolling foliage, and with punchwork. The stiles  are carved in low-relief with a panel of scrolling foliage and berries. The lower front rail is carved in low-relief with alternating leaf and dart, with two scrolled shaped brackets below. The two flanking inlaid panels show stylized flowers, and the central panel shows a goose-like creature (possibly replacement inlays) that morphs into floral scrolls, above a swan. \n\nThe lid is formed from two butted planks with replaced moulded cleats at each end, held on two ring hinges, with evidence of earlier hinges visible. The chest is fitted with a lock.\n\nThe sides and back are plain panelled with large, single panels at the sides and thee, plain, chamfered. panels at the back. The left end panel has a replaced vertical section at the front (and in fact the whole panel may have been replaced, which would have required the removal of the back. The back rails may have been repegged, and the rear left stile is heavily split and repaired). There are two dovetail battens added below the base boards. The bottom is formed with 4 boards (replacements) running front to back, fitted into rebates in the bottom rails.",

The furniture (along with china and metalwork) had been collected by her late husband Mr C.E.Allan, FSA, formerly of 7, Vale Avenue, Chelsea, who sent a photograph of his dining room ('constructed almost wholly from designs in the Museum to suit my old oak furniture') to the Museum in 1914.  This chest appears to be the piece referred to by Mrs Allan as 'Oak inlaid chest (Seymour Lucas)' possibly meaning that the painter and set designer of that name (1849-1923), known particularly for his depictions of Tudor and Stuart subjects, had owned it.\n\nRalph Edwards noted that this chest was recorded in the Library of Mrs Allan's house, but  'at A.R.Gibbons, Grange Street, [St Albans]' (Cabinet and chair makers, Upholsterers, Mattress makers, French Polishers) - who were presumably carrying out some work on it at that time.\nMinute paper 31/4310 H.Clifford Smith examined the furniture offered by Mrs Allan with Mr Arthur Stair ('one of the best judges existing of English oak furniture'), and excluded three items on the grounds that they were compromised by recent workmanship. The chest was identified as suitable for Circulation Dept.\n\nOn loan to ValenceHouse, Dagenham, 1963-2008",
