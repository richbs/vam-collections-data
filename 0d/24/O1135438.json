The doll is produced by Mattel, Inc and invented by Ruth Handler, whose own daughter was called Barbara. In recent years, however, Barbie has faced increasing competition from the Bratz range of dolls. This doll was produced in 2005 in China by Mattel. \n\nThis object was acquired in 2007, donated to the Museum from the BBC, who made a programme on Barbie for their Money Week special. This Barbie doll is part of the trendy Barbie Fashion Fever range. The range includes Barbie and all her friends modelling the latest outfits and accessories; each look has its own unique style. Fashion Fever Dolls were first introduced into Europe around the end of 2004 and since then many new waves have been released. This particular doll is called Courtney and comes with a belt and a bag as her accessories.",
