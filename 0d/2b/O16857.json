This painting depicts two land crabs (probably Cardisoma hirtipes). It comes from an album of 19 natural-history pictures from the collection of Lord Clive, 1st Earl of Powis. He was Governor of Madras between 1798 and 1803. Four of the paintings are in the V&A. The remaining 15 are in the British Library.",
