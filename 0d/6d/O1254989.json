Cheaply made, in pressed glass, such sets were often elaborate and  became widely available. Here the design by the firm Percival, Vickers &amp; Co. emulates cut glass with a striking parallel mitre patternand is stylistically quite early.\nMaterials &amp; Making \nThe technique of press-moulding glass with the aid of a hand-operated machine was first perfected in the  United States of America in the early 1820s. It took only two people to shape a measured quantity of hot  glass in a heated metal mould. By simply depressing a lever, a metal plunger was lowered into the glass,  forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Europe and Britain, giving rise to  stylistic changes and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid-to late 19th  century the first period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses  improved quality while cutting costs even further.",
