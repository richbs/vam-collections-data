He went on stage as a child but worked briefly as a civil servant in his teens: a result of his brother's trying to discourage him from a theatrical career.  He returned to the stage however  in 1794 aged seventeen, when he made his London debut at Drury Lane Theatre as Malcolm in Macbeth produced by John Philip Kemble. \n\nNever a great tragedian, like Sarah and John Philip, Charles Kemble made his name in lighter roles such as Orlando, Young Absolute, Charles Surface, Benedick and Romeo. He took over the management of Covent Garden from John Philip in 1817 and was rescued from bankruptcy in 1829 when his daughter Frances Anne, or Fanny, performed there.  In 1832 they both went to America where they performed to appreciative audiences and where he was perceived as a typical English gentleman. Kemble had the characteristic family Roman profile, which can be seen in this bust.",
