The paintings all came from Mortimer's sitting room at 6, Endsleigh Place, London WC1, where they had formed part of the room's decoration since their execution in 1925 by Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell (Mortimer had moved out of the flat in 1952 to a house in Islington, prompting the gift). In asking Grant and Bell to decorate his flat, Mortimer was inspired by the decorative paintings which they had done in the flat belonging to his friend Clive Bell (Vanessa's estranged husband) at 50 Gordon Square. \n\nGrant and Bell were co-directors of the Omega workshops which was founded by Roger Fry in 1913. With the Omega firm they sought to break down what they saw as the false distinction between the fine and decorative arts, bringing to their designs the visual language of Post Impressionism: bright colours and bold, simplified forms. \n\nIn 1944 Raymond Mortimer contributed a volume on Duncan Grant to the influential Penguin Modern Painters series.",
