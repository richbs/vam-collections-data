The stencilled pictures are positioned towards the top of each panel and are surrounded by rich light brown silk. The panels are edged with a binding of dark blue fabric.\nThere are metal corner reinforcements on the first and last panels.",

            "public_access_description": "This six-panel screen depicts stages in the manufacture of traditional Japanese paper at the village of Ogawa in Saitama Prefecture, where Serizawa taught in the mid-1930s. The six stages shown are: boiling the branches of the paper mulberry tree; washing the boiled mulberry fibres in running water; softening the fibres by beating them with mallets; moulding the paper in a frame; removing excess water in a press; and drying the sheets of paper on boards in the sun. Handmade paper created in this way is used to back the screen.\n\nSerizawa was one of Japan\u2019s foremost textile artists. He became an active member of the Japanese Folk Craft (Mingei) Movement after meeting its founder, Yanagi Soetsu (1889-1961), in 1927. He decided to become a textile artist after seeing a group of wrapping cloths from Okinawa at an exhibition in Tokyo the following year. These cloths had been dyed by the bingata method, historically practised in Okinawa using stencil resist and bright mineral pigments. Although Serizawa did not travel to Okinawa until 1939, the vibrant colours and bold designs of bingata textiles inspired his work from the outset.",
