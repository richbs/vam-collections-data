Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>. The Beatles. Des: M. C. Productions & The Apple staged by Peter Blake (b.1932) & Jann Haworth. Photo: Michael Cooper. Offset lithography. Parlophone EMI. \nPr. & manufactured: Garrod & Lofthouse Ltd., 1967. E.577-1985. \nNow the most celebrated \u2018underground\u2019 record and sleeve design ever issued, <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> was originally mixed for mono release and was nearly sold (at Epstein\u2019s suggestion), in a plain cover to avoid any possible litigation. The design was conceived as a montage celebration of the celebrity, calling upon the pop art-fine art talents of Blake and Howarth to inject a certain monumentality into what may otherwise have been a work of lesser moment. \nThe record is not strictly a concept album like those with strong lyrical or narrative content which followed in the 1970s, yet the special unity and self-importance achieved through track linkage, carefully chosen popular and counter-cultural iconography does impart an operatic air of consistent thematic treatment. \nIncluded in the package was a separate coloured \u2018cut-out\u2019 sheet of moustache and sergeant stripes, an idea first aired in <i>Ark</i>, The Royal College of Art magazine. \n<i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>. The Rolling Stones. Des: & Photo: Michael Cooper. (Back cover illus: Tony Meeviwiffen). Offset lithography. Decca. Pr: Robert Stare, England. 1967. E.576-1985. \nThe central image is printed on a faceted sheet of plastic to create a pseudo three-dimensional effect. The set was built by the Rolling Stones, Michael Cooper and Archie at Pictorial Productions, Mount Vernon, NY. It is a direct ripost to the Peter Blake <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> sleeve for the Beatles, released in the same year. This design, together with the music within illustrates how even a group of such a well-defined self-image as the Stones could not resist experimenting with the ubiquitous psychedelic and eastern influences of the time\u2019",
