In court paintings of the Mughal period they are usually depicted as princes and ladies in palace settings. Here in late Victorian Calcutta they make a last appearance in the form of a courtesan and her well-to-do bourgeois client, sitting sedately on European chairs while a massive flower arrangement rears between them. For another work by Madhav Chandra Das of Shobhabazar, see M. Archer [1977] p.166. The obtrusive screw-head impressions in the background indicate that the impression was made from an electrotype after an original woodcut. The engravers of the Chitpore district eventually resorted to this process as the copper blocks so produced gave a much longer print run (see R.P. Gupta, 'Bangla Chhabir Bai' in 'Dusha Bachharer Bangla Bai', ed. C. Bandopadhaya, Calcutta 1979; we are indebted to Dr Partha Mitter for this reference).\nPublished: Welch [1978] p.74",
