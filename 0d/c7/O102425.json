This costume is the 'ruined' version of the smart sailor suit which Sarah wears when she sets out to sea (S.287-1989). When the ship is wrecked her outfit suffers badly: there are holes and tears in the sleeves and tights (all neatly covered with flesh-coloured net), her jacket and skirt are hung with seaweed, her hair has uncurled, and clinging to the costume are various sea creatures.  That the 'tears' in the edges of the collar, skirt  and the spotted bloomers (S.290-1989) are so formal only adds to the fun, as do the delicate positioning of the lobster and crab and the now sagging striped tights.  It is the perfect 'gag' costume.\n\nBilly Dainty was one of the last dames to have his own costumes - today most costumes are provided by the production management.",
