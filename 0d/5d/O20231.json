In this painting, a splendid interior and its contents are shown in meticulous detail. Human interest is catered for by showing the cultured mother playing a samisen (a three-stringed Japanese guitar). The child is asking silently but politely if the feathery shuttlecock could be retrieved from the tatami mat just inside the door.\n\nThe painting presents a very picturesque British image of the East, as objects would not be displayed together like this in a real Japanese room.\n\nPeople\nFrank Dillon was a painter in oils and watercolours, predominantly of landscape subjects, but also of domestic Islamic architecture. He was actively concerned with efforts to preserve the Islamic monuments of Cairo. In his desire to preserve domestic Egyptian architecture, particularly the interiors, he had painted accurate pictures of them as a kind of benign propaganda exercise. He peopled them with their inhabitants in appropriate costume, to give scale and to make them more appealing. He treated his later pictures of Japanese interiors, such as this scene, in the same way.",
