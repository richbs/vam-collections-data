            "public_access_description": "Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles (born Rotterdam 1871, died Hastings 1956) was a pioneering photographic journalist who published his work in the new illustrated magazines of the late 19th and early 20th century. From the turn of the century he travelled around Europe, living in Berlin, Brussels, Paris and Jersey. With his eye for detail, timing and geometry, he accurately captured the leisure activities, sports and customs of the period. Besides their documentary value, his photographs have a quirky and almost surreal quality. \n \u2018Riposo\u2019 (Italian for \u2018rest\u2019 or \u2018repose\u2019) was a Health Hydro & Dietetic Sanatorium in St. Helen\u2019s Park, Hastings, Sussex. It was founded by Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles in 1913, as one of the first health resorts in the United Kingdom which employed Nature Cure. Nature Cure, or \u2018Naturopathy\u2019 as it s sometimes called, is a particular approach in itself but is also the basis of most alternative therapies. One of the fundamental principles of  the cure is that illness results from the accumulation of toxins or waste in the body, as a result of an unnatural way of living. Pitcairn-Knowles promoted a variety of treatments: Hydropathy (water and steam applications), Heliotheraphy (sun, air and light treatment), Dietetics, Physical Culture (exercises, manual therapy and massage), the Guelpa Cure and the Schroth Cure. In Riposo many diseases were treated (among others obesity, mental depression, hysteria, insomnia, liver and kidney troubles, rheumatism and skin diseases) but was also open to healthy people.\t\n\tOf all the cures Pitcairn-Knowles seems to have been most interested in the \u2018Schroth Cure.\u2019 It was invented by Johann Schroth around 1718. He prescribed patients to sleep in wet sheets ( called \u2018wet packs\u2019) and follow a \u2018dry diet\u2019. This diet consisted of four meals a week (only rice, sago, porridge or potatoes) and stale bread in addition. Because Schroth believed copious drinking would weaken the patients, the only fluid they were allowed to drink was wine, on four days a week. This helped them to overcome the weariness that the \u2018dry diet\u2019 caused.\n\tPhotography was an important tool for Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles during the time he ran \u2018Riposo\u2019. He documented treatments, produced educational material and traced the history and methods of the \u2018Schroth\u2019 Cure. During a visit to Schroth\u2019s hometown Lindewiese in Austria (now Czech Republic), Pitcairn-Knowles asked villagers to demonstrate the experiments with \u2018wet packs\u2019 that Schroth had applied to animals. Pitcairn-Knowles added photographs such as these to his \u2018pictorial description of the great healer\u2019s methods.\u2019 Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles, and later his son Gordon Pitcairn-Knowles, used lantern slides to illustrate their lectures on cures. Some photo\u2019s may also have been displayed at an exhibition at Riposo, to inform visitors about the cures employed at the estabablishment. \u2018Riposo\u2019 closed in 1962.",

            "historical_context_note": "Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles (born Rotterdam 1871, died Hastings 1956) was a pioneering photographic journalist who published his work in the new illustrated magazines of the late 19th and early 20th century. From the turn of the century he travelled around Europe, living in Berlin, Brussels, Paris and Jersey. With his eye for detail, timing and geometry, he accurately captured the leisure activities, sports and customs of the period. Besides their documentary value, his photographs have a quirky and almost surreal quality. \n \u2018Riposo\u2019 (Italian for \u2018rest\u2019 or \u2018repose\u2019) was a Health Hydro & Dietetic Sanatorium in St. Helen\u2019s Park, Hastings, Sussex. It was founded by Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles in 1913, as one of the first health resorts in the United Kingdom which employed Nature Cure. Nature Cure, or \u2018Naturopathy\u2019 as it s sometimes called, is a particular approach in itself but is also the basis of most alternative therapies. One of the fundamental principles of  the cure is that illness results from the accumulation of toxins or waste in the body, as a result of an unnatural way of living.
