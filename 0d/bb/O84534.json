The cabaret was conceived as a meeting place for the Viennese avant-garde, and this chair model was supplied in both white with black balls and vice versa for the public rooms.\n\nCritics of Hoffmann and the advanced school of Viennese design, also known as the Secessionist style,  pointed out how uncomfortable the chair was to sit in. However, the design was popular and remained in production at Jacob & Josef Kohn until at least 1916.",

The Kabarett Fledermaus was opened in 1907 and conceived as a meeting place for the Viennese avant-garde and as a manifesto for the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte a group pf designers working in the advanced style of the time. The latter issued a pamphlet on the project. Some writers pointed out that the Fledermaus chairs were particularly uncomfortable.
