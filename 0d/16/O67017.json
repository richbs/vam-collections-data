            "history_note": "This costume design by Maise Meiklejohn is part of an extensive collection of designs by the artist purchased by the Theatre Museum in 1990.  The design was executed for a production of William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\" performed at the Arts Theatre, October 10th 1945.  The production was directed by Judith Furse, and the scenery was designed by Michael Warre.  The cast included Alec Clunes as Hamlet, Dorothy Primrose as Ophelia, Olga Lindo as Gertrude, and Mark Dignam as Claudius.  The production was included in the Arts Theatre Continental tour during the winter of 1946-7\n\nHistorical significance: This design was executed for a production by the actor/producer Alec Clunes, whose greatest achievement was his direction of eight seasons of plays at the Arts Theatre during a period when money and actors were scarce and scenery hard to get.  He introduced an ambitious and intellectually demanding repertory of unearthed English classics and promoted the staging of foreign plays, as an alternative to the usual West End fare of \"leg shows\" and average drawing room pieces, which earned him the status, according to one critic of \"pocket national theatre\". \nLeela Meinertas, 1990.",
