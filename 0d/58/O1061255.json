The dance begins in a peaceful environment. The next scene is popularly known as \"Keris Dance\". The Rangda character appears and wreaks havoc. She casts black magic upon the male dancers, who represent Airlangga's soldiers, and she orders them to commit suicide. Caught in a trance, the men stab themselves in the chest with their own kris (sword). Meanwhile Barong and the priest cast protective magic on these men, making them immune to sharp objects. The dance ends with the final battle between Barong and Rangda, concluding with the victory of Barong. Rangda runs away, the evil is defeated, and celestial order is restored.",
