Much of the information on the subject offered by the Japanese themselves was blindly accepted and many outright fakes were thought to be of great antiquity. \n\nWhen the V&A bought this sword in 1888 it was described as a \u2018Fine old carved ivory Japanese Royal State Sword (early 18th century) for sale at \u00a395\u2019 (equivalent to about \u00a37,000 today). The Museum accepted the sword on the grounds that \u2018This is so important an example of Japanese art both in design and execution of the ivory carving that it is most desirable for the Museum collection. The price asked is very reasonable.\u2019 \n\nThe ivory scabbard of the sword is of extremely good quality in comparison to many later swords and daggers that are terribly poor by comparison and are mounted in ivory scabbards that are even worse. The scabbard obviously dates from about 1860 and the sword blade is signed \u2018Kubota Minamoto Muneaki\u2019, a well-documented 19th-century swordsmith, and is even dated 1857.",
