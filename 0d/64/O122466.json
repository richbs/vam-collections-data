The frame, composed of curved, chromed steel strips forms a dodecahedral sphere. Successive layers of copper leaves, each a trapezoid shape with rounded corners are attached to slots in the frame by wire. The wire is secured to the leaf by means of the inner edge being folded over. The leaves are feathered so that they follow the curve of the frame. The external surface is of copper; the internal surface has been painted a matt white. The armature is anchored at the top by a large circular plate with a hole through the centre. The internal rim has three bayonet fittings which hook on to three brass pegs at the top of the internal sleeve. The internal sleeve is a plain chromed cylinder, which serves as the lamp housing. The lamp is supported by a chain that passes through the centre of the ceiling boss which is a flared, plastic cone.",

This example is one of the first issues of the artichoke design.\n\nThe design has retained the quality of the associated PH  family of lamps, (see M.26-1992) designed and made by the same designer and manufacturer. The construction is based on the multiple shade principle, enabling the shades to spread an indirect light, illuminating the room and its contents without permitting the light to produce glare.\n\nThe artichoke lamp was originally designed as a large opulent lamp for the Langelinie Pavilion, a Copenhagen restaurant. It has since been specified for interiors throughout the world. The quality of the design is confirmed by the fact that the lamp makes a handsome contribution to almost any setting, making a highly visible contribution to the architecture of the room in which it hangs.",
