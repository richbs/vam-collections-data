The face and drum are of lithographed tin plate, in blue, yellow, red, green, white and black. The drum is marked to show cartoon characters imitating Disney figures such as Mickey Mouse. On the sides of the drum are four green plastic uprights, one of which is broken.  The arms of the monkey are of coiled wire with wooden knobs for hands.  Both the monkey and the drum sit on a brown plastic base which is poorly cast. When wound up, the monkey moves from side to side and beats the drum.",
