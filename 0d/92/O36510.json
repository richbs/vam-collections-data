One layer is fixed and painted black apart from a central picture of a man holding an umbrella over a group of people. The other layer is cut to allow a side to side movement and is held in place by a small piece of metal and a screw. It is clear apart from two small and one very small areas painted black. The slide first shows the man under his umbrella and when the slide is moved, he is joined by a crowd. \n\nDYER may refer to a member of the Dyer Family, known publishers of Juvenile Theatres during the 19th century.",
