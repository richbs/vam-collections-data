There is a row of stitching holes around the outside of the roundel.\n\nSamite (twill woven silk) was  thought to originate from Persia  under Sassanian rule (AD224- 651). It was commonly  decorated with pairs of animals  and birds and set in pearled  lotus roundels. It is often found  in Western burials, within church  possessions and along the Silk  Road. Byzantine weaving  workshops took on the samite  technique to make it an  essential weave of the period.   It was a luxury textile of the  Middle Ages brought to Europe  when the Crusades opened up  direct contact with the East. It  was forbidden to the middle  classes of France under the  sumptuary rules c. 1470.",
