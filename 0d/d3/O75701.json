It is a cast after the posthumous marble bust of the Prince Consort by William Theed III (1804-1891) at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, one of two memorial busts of Queen Victoria's deceased consort, Prince Albert (1819-1861), that were commissioned by her and completed by Theed in 1862. In the same year Theed exhibited one of the busts at the Royal Academy of Arts in London (no. 992). A  version of the present bust in Parian ware (a granular white porcelain that resembles marble), together with a companion bust of Queen Victoria, was produced by W. T. Copeland for the Art Union in 1865.\n\nWilliam Theed III (1804-1891) initially trained under his father, William Theed II (1764-1817). He attended the Royal Academy Schools, and trained for five years under the supervision of Edward Hodges Baily. He travelled to Rome in 1826, studying under Bertel Thorvaldesn, John Gibson, and Richard James Wyatt. Theed, like Baron Carlo Marochetti, was a favoured sculptor of Queen Victoria. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1824 and 1885.",
