It was commissioned by William Fremlin who served in India as an official of the East India Company from 1626-44, and who ended his career there as President of the Council of Surat. It is likely that the carpet was made towards the end of his career, probably in Lahore (today in Pakistan), which was a known centre of carpet production at the time.\nThe Fremlin coat of arms includes an elephant as its crest, but this does not appear to be connected with William's career in India, as the arms were first granted to the family in 1567.",
