Beneath this motif is an orange with leaves and above the semi-circular top of the motif is a diagonal pile of oranges. This design is dated May 23rd 1710.\n\nJames Leman was born in 1688 into a weaving family of Huguenot descent. In 1702 he was apprenticed to his father, Peter, and lived with his family in Stewart Street, Spitalfields in London. Leman's inscription on the design reveals that it was commissioned by Mr Wittington, a mercer who bought 33 of Leman's designs between 1708 and 1721.\n\nThis design is from an album that contains 97 designs for fine silk cloth. A constant supply of fashionable new designs from which to create new lines was required, so patternmakers and master weavers like Leman supplied a wide range of designs for different weavers. The album contains some of his work from the period 1706-1716.  There is a silk woven from this design in the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide.",

The designs have been subsequently numbered by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department, however, a concordance exists.\n\nThis design was taken out of the album and mounted for exhibition.  It is shown back in its original position in the album with E.1861.79-1991 (VS.70) on the opposite page.\n\nHistorical significance: The designs collected in the album are, with the exception of some fragmentary medieval examples in Italian collections, the earliest silk designs known to exist.",
