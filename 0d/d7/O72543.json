            "public_access_description": "This is one of the series of ivory plaques of the crucifixion produced in the second half of the ninth century, with certain unususal iconographic elements in common. These Crucifixion panels all seem to present an elaborate symbolic image. The serpent wound around the base of the Cross symbolises sin overcome by Christ; Ecclesia catching the blood of Christ refers to the Eucharist, while the resurrection of the dead symbolises the conquest of death and the material world through the Crucifixion. The iconography of these plaques is perhaps derived from the cover of the Pericopes of Henry II in Munich, produced ca. 830-40, a work of the so-called 'Liuthard' ivory group, which takes its name from the scribe who worked on the manuscripts on which some of these ivories were attached.\n\nThe style of the Crucifixion group -thick set figures swathed in heavy rounded loops of drapery, with square jaws and straight blunt noses - is that of ivories produced at Metz in the second half of the ninth century and the early tenth century. \n\nDuring the ninth century, Metz, in the north-east of the empire, the seat of a bishop, became a very important centre for the production of manuscripts and ivories and enjoyed royal and imperial patronage. It was, together with Tours, Corbie and St Denis in the west, Corvey, St Gall and Fulda in the east, and Milan in the south, the most productive area, particularly in the craft of ivory carving, of the Carolingian empire.\nThe ivories sometimes used classical motifs, such as the personifications of Water and Earth at the bottom of the composition. This luxurious panel was ornamented with gold studs.",

These Crucifixion panels all seem to present an elaborate symbolic image. The serpent wound around the base of the Cross symbolises sin overcome by Christ; Ecclesia catching the blood of Christ refers to the Eucharist, while the resurrection of the dead symbolises the conquest of death and the material world through the Crucifixion. The iconography of these plaques is perhaps derived from the cover of the Pericopes of Henry II in Munich, produced ca. 830-40, a work of the so-called 'Liuthard' ivory group, which takes its name from the scribe who worked on the manuscripts on which some of these ivories were attached.\n\nThe style of the Crucifixion group -thick set figures swathed in heavy rounded loops of drapery, with square jaws and straight blunt noses - is that of ivories produced at Metz in the second half of the ninth century and the early tenth century. \n\nDuring the ninth century, Metz, in the north-east of the empire, the seat of a bishop, became a very important centre and enjoyed royal and imperial patronage. It was, together with Tours, Corbie and St Denis in the west, Corvey, St Gall and Fulda in the east, and Milan in the south, the most productive area, particularly in the craft of ivory carving, of the Carolingian empire.",
