He was billed as \u2018The Great Wieland. America\u2019s Foremost Comedy Juggler\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nA review of his performance that week gives a flavour of his act,\n\nWieland is adroit and original in his manipulation of everything he takes in his hand, and there is an element of absurdity in his performance which keeps one on a titter. When he makes a slip, which is generally intentional, he punishes himself by means of a mechanism turning a handle which causes a pair of hands to box his own ears.",

Wieland had appeared there previously, during the week of 23 April 1906 when he was described as 'America's Foremost Comedy Juggler'. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century. This sheet was loose in the album, and although in the numerical sequence of the list accompanying the albums, it is earlier than others in a similar position in the album.",
