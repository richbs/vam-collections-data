It is situated in the Palni Hills, at an elevation of 7,300 (2,225m)  The town was created in 1845 by U.S. missionaries and British Civil Servants as a hill station to which administrative offices were located during the summer months.  The immense detail of the photograph, with its' flattened perspective, emphasises the fusion of secular and religious buildings in India architecture.",
