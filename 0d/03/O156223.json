The field is olive brown and is decorated with lines of interlocking incomplete ovoids forming a highly ornate 'chain' with pendant fruits and leaves in predominantly blue-green, yellow, pink, orange and grey. All the outlines of this pattern and the borders have been embellished with metal thread embroidered in chain stitch or tambour. In one corner there is part of a different pattern: it has a white ground with an incomplete floral pattern in pinks, yellow and light blue. \nThe ties are striped silk with red alternating with a wide band of metal thread 0- tarnished silver wound around yellow silk.  The weft is red silk.  The stripes are separated by a narrow stripe of white and blue in a twill pattern.\nMetal Thread: silver strip close Z-wound on white silk core; along the edges of the border the metal thread is close Z-wound on a yellow silk core.\n\nBacking: pieced; purple ground with a small tri-sprigged stem in green, white and red arranged in offset rows.\nFacing: bias cut; orange/yellow silk",
