She created a wallpaper with a simple repeat pattern of a chain link fence - the urban counterpoint to the ivy-covered trellis pattern so popular in 19th-century wallpaper design. This was for an installation called 'Space Contains No Threats', first exhibited in 2000. Chain-link fences are conventionally used for demarcating boundaries and defining spaces, to contain or to exclude. The title seems ironic - the viewer in a room lined with this paper is contained - imprisoned - behind the wire, with a view of nothing but blank blue sky, and in the original installation, with strategically placed ladders that lead nowhere, simultaneously offering but frustrating any attempt at escape. The idea that wallpaper should offer the illusion of a seductive view - as the 19th-century French panoramic papers did - with their scenes of the elegant streets of Paris or Rome, or exotic tropical landscapes - is subverted here. The view is one of blank anonymity, and wallpaper is no longer a decorative background but a confining screen which the artist herself has described as 'camouflage'.",
