This is surrounded by an irregular 8-pointed star bearing a stylised trefoil motif in every point.  This in turn is framed by a curved frame [partly missing] bearing small leaves with coloured silk details and alternately a silver-gilt 8-petalled flower with a chevron filling or a white and pink rosette. From the former emerges a long curving stem bearing a stylised tulip form, mainly in silver-gilt but with coloured silk details, while from 2 of the small rosettes along the lateral axis springs a composite floral motif with two small curving stems.  The central panel may have been cut from a larger piece and the continuing composition in one corner could indicate this. An added border of plain weave red silk [pink warp, red weft] with a stilted silver meander carrying small leaves and 5-petalled bud forms in silver and silver-gilt, with larger, more complex blossoms decorating each corner, coloured silks are used for details - again the border may have been cut from an existing piece.  The border seam and edge is marked by a line of 2 x 2 black silk cords held in place by silver metal thread.\nEmbroidery threads: silk: white, two shades of faded pink, yellow, light green, dark green, light blue, blue, dark blue. Silk chenille: two shades of beige, dark green, light blue.\nMetal thread: mainly silver-gilt close S-wound on light beige silk; silver strip close S-wound on a white silk core.  Some spangles.\nThere is an interlining of plain weave, coarse cotton which is white with large patches of dark blue cotton.",
