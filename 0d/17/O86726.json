She stands on a swathe of green grass on the zig-zag indented bank beside a grey stretch of water along the lower edge of the picture against a blue ground. The background rises up to a  darker band of blue towards the top.\n\nShe wears a white transparent <i>peshwaz</i> with long tight sleeves with a paned skirt bordered in gold with a full-length golden <i>patka</i> decorated in a scroll of red flower buds with purple irises at the end falling from her waist.  Beneath this dress can be seen her green <i>paijama</i> decorated with a pattern of golden trefoils.  Over the top half of her body and her  head a red transparent <i>odhani</i> dotted with gold-bordered green motifs and a gold edging is draped.  She is wearing pearl necklaces and bracelets over jewelled wrist bands. Further pearls can be seen in her ear and surrounding a jewel on her forehead.  She is wearing purple slippers patterned in gold.\n\nThe painting is framed with a pinky-brown inner border ornamented with a golden stylised floral scroll outlined in white, gold and black with an outer outline in blue.  This is set against the outer ivory-ground border with an alternate pattern of red poppies and pink lilies outlined in gold. The outer margins of the page are collaged in strips of buff-coloured paper with a white inner outline. An additional strip of pale-brown paper has been added over the margin strip to act as a gutter for the album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
