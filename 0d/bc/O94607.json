Dawson left in 1903 when the Guild was taken over by Montague Fordham, a former director of the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft.  The premises were first in Maddox Street W1 and later, Conduit Street.  The business closed in 1938.  Spencer was a versatile draughtsman; he often combined different materials such as ivory and shagreen with silver.  Softly planished silver and delicate chasing were characteristic aspects of his work.",
