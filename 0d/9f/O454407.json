The figure is seated with the top of his left thigh splayed outwards, Despite the absence of the right leg it may be surmised that the figure was seated at royal ease (<i>lalitasana</i>) as there is no indication of his right foot resting on the left thigh.\n      The torso appears to be nude save for some ornamentation of his upper body comprising a torque round his throat. A rounded depression indicates his navel above the gentle swelling of his stomach.\n      His face is partly damaged by the loss of his nose and part of his right-hand earring or ear-lobe.  He has a spirited expression with a smiling crescent-shaped mouth and almond-shaped eyes.  A looped tress of hair escapes on his right temple from below a headband which encircles his head at the hairline and disappears behind his ears.  His hair is tied back in matted locks by another band above which the locks splay outwards and upwards in a rounded mound of a bun. The ends of locks of hair are also visible hanging down over his shoulders.",
