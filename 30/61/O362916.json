Across the straight side runs a narrow edging printed with a leaf meander which curves inwards slightly as it approaches the centre of the side.\n\nThe edges of the shawl are hemmed by hand at an even distance all round the printed pattern except where this curve in the printed edging occurs, where there are two points, one sharper than the other. The ground is a plain weave finely spun worsted in a creamy-white.\n\nThe pattern of the cones, fronds and flowers has been carefully planned with deeper patterning projecting along the straight edge from the curved border. The design on the curved edge ends in 'labels' of different coloured ground in imitation of woven shawls, and the printing is shaded with diagonal lines in black, also imitating weaving. Printing is in at least eleven colours, bright and jewel-like, prominently with jade, turquoise, lapis, ruby, vermilion, orange, maroon and pink.",
