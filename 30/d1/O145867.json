The boy holding the reins wears a brown floppy hat and brown shorts with a pale green shirt and red and white necktie. The other boy wears brown shorts with a blue sailor shirt and blue Noddy-style hat.  The girl pretending to be a horse wears red with her straw hat slipped down her back. The other girl wears a blue dress with white polka dots and a white pinafore.  A brown dog runs alongside the children in the foreground.  In the background a house is partly hidden behind trees and a white gate leads to a yellow field beyond.  Mounted on card.",

In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick.",
