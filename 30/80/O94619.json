The most notable pieces were bowls, dishes and decanters. Ashbee chose to work with a few simple elements, such as plain hammered silver that was occasionally enhanced by simple embossed details.\n\nAshbee and his fellow guildsmen sought to promote a natural and ethical approach to craftwork. They adopted the aesthetic principles of the Arts and Crafts Movement, in which art was believed to have a transforming influence on daily life. In their social principles they aimed for equality and cooperation beyond the workshop. This was seen, for instance, in profit sharing and communal activities, such as sport and music making.\n\nAshbee and his Guild reacted against the mechanical, highly finished silver products that were manufactured on production lines in large-scale factories. The Guild attempted to reassert the role of the individual craft workers, who could trace the progress of an item from creation to finish. Hammer marks are clearly visible on the surface of this tray. This is a deliberate finish to emphasise that the item was hand-made.",
