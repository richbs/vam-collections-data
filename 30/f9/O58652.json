            "public_access_description": "This sideboard was part of the first collection of furniture by the Italian Memphis design group.  Ettore Sottsass designed it to combine storage and display while also serving as a room divider. The angled arms are intended to hold wine bottles. Its garish colour, pattern and strange winged shape went against the Modernist belief that form should follow function. The brash decoration, which opposed the purity of much undecorated minimalist furniture designed in the 1970s, was inspired by the everyday products of  the 1950s. American 'diner' interiors and the wipe-clean furniture of the kitchenette influenced the use of laminated plastic. Although the patterns and materials of Memphis designs were drawn from popular taste, the furniture was too expensive for the average customer. However, by drawing on so-called 'low taste', the Memphis group introduced a new spirit of fun and fantasy into design.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nIn 1981 the design group and manufacturer Memphis, led by Ettore Sottsass, launched its first collection, in which the designers explicitly challenged preconceptions of good taste. Sottsass believed that contemporary design had become sterile under the influence of modernism and wished to reintroduce wit, colour, and iconography. The improbable form of the Casablanca Sideboard (part of Memphis's first collection) and its bold laminated decoration, inspired by popular taste of the 1950s, identified the design as postmodern. The wit and iconoclasm of Memphis influenced many 1980s designers, particularly in the field of product design, and its contribution has been recognised as a defining moment in the history of late-twentieth-\ncentury industrial design.\n\nLit.
