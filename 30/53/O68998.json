As distinct from dishes or knives which were often shared, spoons were treasured individual possessions.This silver spoon is entirely covered with enamel in distinctive stripes of colour, inset with the repeated  letters M and O in silver. Both may indicate the original identity of the owner, now unknown. The quality and material of this spoon suggest that it must have been the property of a person of rank and not intended for daily use.",

As opposed to dishes or knives which were shared, spoons were treasured individual possessions. The quality and material of this spoon suggest that it must have been the property of a person of rank and not intended for daily use.\nA nearly identical spoon, executed in translucent green and purple enamel, is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Rogers Fund, 48.153.\nThe decoration of these two spoons is closely related to the so-called 'Regensburger Schatzk\u00e4stchen' and comparable objects. Renate Eikelmann therefore suggested in 1992 that the three objects probably originated from the same workshop. Eikelmann favours a date around 1410/1420 and considers the entire group to be of Franco-Flemish origin.",
