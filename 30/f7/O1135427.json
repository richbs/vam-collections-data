Action Man was relaunched in 1993 by Hasbro, which is the era that this particular Action Man object falls under. \n\nAction figures are particularly popular with boys because they represent traditional masculine traits and are closely associated with the public sphere which is represented by items such as tools, transportation, garages, machines, and military equipment. The Street Racer is part of the vehicles series. A number of vehicles were offered for the 12\" figure line, with bold graphics and the signature orange background coloration. Included were the Super Bike, Mission Raft, 4x4 Jeep, Silver Speeder, Racing Car and others.",
