The bowl's interior is decorated with a silver-inlaid inscription, the apices of the script terminating in human faces seen three-quarters looking left.  The inscription is set against a ground of inter-laced, scrolling foliage. \n\nThe central boss is inlaid with silver in the design of inter-laced, scrolling bi-lobed half-palmettes.   Rising from the boss is an elaborate finial, comprising, from the base upwards, a central compressed knop, then another knop moulded with  the figures of six birds projecting outwards.  Above this is a thick moulding on which rests a cock, clearly moulded with an upwards curving tail and flapping wings. The centre of the central stem is hollow.\n\nPatina: Mostly red oxide with touches of green sulphurous copper.",
