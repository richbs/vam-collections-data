Jerry Lee Lewis may have been the first rock artist to destroy pianos on stage, but Pete Townshend was the first guitar-smashing rock artist. Rolling Stone magazine included his guitar smashing at the Railway Hotel in September of 1964 in their list of 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock & Roll.\n\nTownshend's career with The Whospanned more than 40 years, during which time the band grew to be considered one of the greatest and most influential rock bands of all time. Townshend is the primary songwriter for the group, writing over 100 songs on the band's eleven studio albums, including the rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia, plus dozens of additional songs that appeared as non-album track singles, bonus tracks on re-issues, and tracks on rarities compilations such as Odds and Sods.",
