It is known as a 'steeple' cup because of the pyramidal steeple on the cover. These steeples served to add height and thus increase the dramatic impact of the cup. In practical terms, however,  they also added a great deal of weight, making the cup unwieldy and  prone to damage. Steeple cups were made only in England.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe cup was commissioned by the Town Council of Romney, Kent, and presented to Richard Godfrey in recognition of his service to the town. The cup, cover and foot are richly decorated with dolphins, waves, mussels and oysters, marine motifs appropriate for one of England's Cinque Ports. These five ports remain part of an ancient jurisdiction originally set up as a defence against invaders along the southern coast of England. Obliged to assist the royal fleet, the towns received in return a great many privileges and became immensely wealthy. Two of the town's seals are depicted on the cup.",

Made in London by an unknown craftsman, signed 'F' in a beaded oval\n\nThe donor was the town of Romney, one of the Cinque Ports, whose commonalty and mayoral seals seals appear engraved in the plaques on the bowl; the recipient, Richard Godfrey, had close formal and family associations with Romney having served in three Parliaments as MP for the town (1623-4, 1625, 1626). Hence also the choice of dolphins. The town's right to the bearings in its seals had been reaffirmed by a heraldic visitation by Rouge Dragon in 1619. The Godfrey family had long associations with the Kent coastal towns, serving as jurats (burgesses) and as MPs; Thomas, Richard's father was one of the Earl of Northampton's clients and a member of his household. He sat as MP for Winchelsea in the Addled Parliament (1614).\n\nHistorical significance: While the quality of the silversmith's work is mediocre, there is considerable interest in the chasing, whose marine theme was clearly dictated by the nature of the commission.",
