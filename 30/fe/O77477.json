It is decorated with classical motifs and would have been regarded as a novelty when first installed.\n\nTime\nThe decoration of the panel is similar to that of surviving panelled rooms from Boughton Malherbe, Kent, and Waltham Abbey, Essex, which date from about 1520 until 1540. Profiled heads, derived from classical medallions and coins, and classical candelabra were  widely used as decoration in Britain from about 1520. These motifs were frequently carved by German or Netherlandish craftsmen, who often found employment in Britain at this time.",
