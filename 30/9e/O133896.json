After school in Yorkshire, worked in turn for a fishmonger, attorney, housepainter, and bookseller. Trained first as a miniature painter; acquaintance with John Bell (see FA253, p31) and his nephew Edward Bell led him to produce mezzotints; also made coloured copies from prints after George Morland and others. First oil painting was a portrait of his wife, which resulted in an introduction to Sir William Beechey RA. Exhibited 99 works at the RA between 1802 and 1845, nine at the BI 1815-42, and 15 at the SBA 1831-47. Almost all were portraits, and after 1816 many were of actors and theatrical scenes in the tradition of Zoffany and Samuel de Wilde. His studio in Gower Street became a rendezvous for the leading actors and actresses of the day. Elected ARA 1821; repeated failure to be elected RA resulted in his resignation 1836. Died Kensington, London, 10 May 1854.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss) \n\n<b>Scene from 'The Honeymoon'</b> \nFA23 Neg V1938 \nCanvas, 54.6 x 71.1 cm (21\u00bd x 28 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857\n \nExhibited at the RA in 1835, with the following title and quotation in the catalogue:\n \nA scene from the comedy of 'The Honeymoon' \n<i>Volante</i>: Confess that I love him! - Now there is only his picture, I'll see it I can't play the confessor a little better than he did. \nAct 2 Scene 3 \n\n<i>The Honeymoon</i>, a romantic comedy in five acts, was written in 1804 by John Tobin (1770-1804), published posthumously in 1805, and first performed 31 January 1805 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. It was a great success, and remained popular for over ten years. In the play, set in Spain in the early 17th century (judging from the costumes in the painting), the scene depicted is the painter Balthazar's studio. Count Montalbon conceals himself behind his portrait, while his beloved, the painter's daughter Volante, looks at the portrait, and Balthazar watches behind the door. The Count reveals himself, and in the last scene of the play Volante accepts his proposal of marriage. The play was revived at Drury Lane on 30 June 1827 (the playbill stating that it had not been played for ten years); it was republished in the <i>Cumberland's British Theatre</i> series in 1829. \n\nPrevious museum catalogues have given the following extract from the same scene: \n\nConfess that I love the Count! A woman may do a more foolish thing than fall in love with such a man, and a wiser one than to tell him of it. (Looks at the picture). 'Tis very like him. \n\nThese lines are from Volante's opening speech; those quoted in the 1835 RA catalogue are from half-way through the speech. \n\nFor another painting of the play, see under Michael W Sharp, D36 p263. \n\nEXH: RA 1835 (326); <i>Victorian Narrative Paintings</i> V&A circulating exhibition 1961\"",
