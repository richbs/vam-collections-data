On the outside of which is a row of small reciprocal trefoil shapes in straight stitches and three 6-petalled flowering stems on each side with the occasional fan sprays of 4 petals.\nThese are 4 corner units repeating the pulled thread grid pattern, each with an additional triangle form breaking into the central area, and one also top and bottom, the latter being infilled with straight stitched leaf forms.\nAround all four sides, a narrow band [a] of needleweaving edges on both sides a wider band of pulled thread work and straight stitched diagonal stripes converging into the centre of each side.  The narrow band [a] finishes this composite band.\nCotton thread: not able to determine spin.\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk, floss and also 2S",
