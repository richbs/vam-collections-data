He executed jewellery, metal and shagreen work for John Paul Cooper at Westerham during 1911-12.  He was invited to work with Emil Lettr\u00e9 in Berlin, and returned in 1913 to Birmingham where he assisted in the teaching at the Vittoria Street School, before his career was interrupted by war service. He founded the Langstone silver works in 1920.  He was a fertile designer and a vigorous champion of his own firm and the contemporary trade.  He was President of the Birmingham Jewellers Association in 1937 and active in the preparation of the British Art in Industry Exhibition at Burlington House in 1935.  He is said to have employed over forty people at the peak of his commercial success, and to have sold his work to Liberty's and Sybil Dunlop.",
