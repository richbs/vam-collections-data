Florence, 1916\n\nJohn Syer was a nineteenth century painter in oil and watercolour who was predominantly known for his landscapes of British subjects. Syer was born on 17th May 1815 at Atherstone, Warwickshire. Although he did not live in London until 1872 Syer exhibited there, in such institutions as the Royal Academy and the British Institution, from 1832. Prior to 1872 he lived in Bristol where he was a pupil of the miniature-painter John Fisher. During this period he worked predominantly in Bristol and Bath. His style was after the manner of David Cox and he was also influenced by the work of William M\u00fcller. Around 1850 Messrs. Rowney & Co published selections of sketches by Syer such as \u2018Rustic Scenes,\u2019 and \u2018Marine and River Views.\u20191 Syer exhibited nineteen paintings at the Royal Academy between 1846 and 1875. He was a member of the Society of British Artists between 1856 and 1875 and was also a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. He is known to have had at least two painter sons, John C. Syer and Percy Syer, who were pupils of their father and specialised in landscapes and marine subjects. John Syer was on a sketching tour when he died in July 1885 after an illness of a few days\u2019 duration.\n\n<i>A Welsh Waterfall</i> depicts a North Wales landscape. North Wales was a favoured subject for Syer due to the wildness of the scenery which offered the opportunity for broad handling and bold representation. He exhibited scenes from North Wales numerous times at the Royal Academy.\n\nCitations\n1.
