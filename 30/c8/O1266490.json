By the fifth generation, during the mid 19th century, highly decorated cloisonn\u00e9 pieces had been introduced to the array of wares produced at the Kinkozan studio. These elaborate and extravagant wares had little appeal on the domestic market but were specifically designed for export. Many Kinkozan pieces were exhibited in international exhibitions such as Chicago in 1873, Paris in 1900, London in 1910 and the 5th National Exhibition in Tokyo in 1925. \n\nDating to around 1880, this vase illustrates the application of cloisonn\u00e9 enamels to a ceramic body. This was a relatively short-lived innovation and was not very popular possibly because the enamels appeared dull (compared with cloisonn\u00e9 on a copper body) and were liable to cracking or crazing.",
