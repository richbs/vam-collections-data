Although this kind of jacket had been worn for many years by men in India, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964) made it familiar to Europeans. As a European fashion it lasted only a short time, from 1966 to 1968.  \n\nFor everyday wear, Nehru suits were made of flannel or worsted in greys or brown. Summer suits were often made of lighter colours and fabrics. The use of highly coloured silks and velvets transformed the suit for evening wear.",
