In common with many of his peers, he not only designed buildings, but also their contents and interiors. He worked in a range of styles, often combining several in one object. Here, the form is Neo-classical, but the figures of a teutonic knight, burgher and peasant are Gothic, perhaps a reference to German nationalism. Egyptian influence can be seen in the palmate scrolls on the feet and handles.\n\nSchinkel originally designed a tureen of this form in 1821, to be executed in ceramic; a silver version appeared in 1837. This example was made by George Hossauer after Schinkel's death--probably as a presentation piece for an aristocratic person. Hossauer, who frequently worked to Schinkel's designs, embellished the original scheme with features adapted from other silver designs by Schinkel. The tureen reflects Schinkel's elegant, sophisticated and refined approach to the Neo-classical style.",

Hossauer one of leading Berlin goldsmiths of his day.\nLabel: Schinkel originally designed a tureen of this form in 1821, to be executed in ceramic; a silver version appeared in 1837.  This example was made by George Hossauer after Schinkel's death probably as a presentation piece for an aristocratic person.  Hossauer, who frequently worked to Schinkel's designs embellished the original scheme with features adapted from other silver designs by Schinkel.  The tureen reflects Schinkel's elegant, sophisticated and refined approach to the neo-classical style.\nThis tureen, by one of Germany's leading manufacturers, was designed by the architect and painter K.F. Schinkel. In common with many of his peers, he not only designed buildings, but also their contents and interiors. He worked in a range of styles, often combining several in one object. Here, the form is Neo-classical, but the figures of a teutonic knight, burgher and peasant are Gothic, perhaps a reference to German nationalism. Egyptian influence can be seen in the palmate scrolls on the feet and handles. The design was originally for a porcelain tureen, and was adapted by Hossauer. \"\n\n\nNeg._No: jb 2082\njb 2085\njb 2086\njc 103 crest\njc 104 marks\nCT: 28806",
