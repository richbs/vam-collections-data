A raised rib encircles the top of the rim and together with a similar rib left in relief to the inside of it creates a border surrounding a hexagonal panel in the centre.\nWithin the panel is carved a scene with a pavilion with steps leading down to fenced terrace surrounding by garden rocks and trees; within the pavilion two sages are seated in conversation at a table laid for meal and a servant makes preparations in a passage to the left, while another carring a lute case walks out across the terrace; an aged pine tree rises behind the pavilion on a ground of wave and air diaper patterns with two clouds above. The border contains a leafy scroll of flowering peach carved dowm to the yellow ground. Encircling the outside of the dish is a border of 'classic scroll' pattern in so-called 'guri' style, deeply channelled into the red lacquer and with a smoothly rounded profile. The base is lacquered black.",
