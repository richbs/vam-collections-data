Both were once richly painted, and traces of yellow, red, and brown iron-oxides are still clearly visible. They are made of stucco, a plaster largely composed of lime and sand. \n\nThe male figure is dressed in princely attire. His robes are draped in a Hellenistic manner and he wears an elaborate diadem or crown over long flowing hair. He gestures to his left, perhaps in the direction of central subject of the composition, presumably a figure of the Buddha. \n\nThe female figure is similarly clad in a diaphanous robe, although here only her lower body is covered. She is bare-breasted and wears arm and wrist ornaments. Her long hair is secured with an undecorated headband. Curiously, she appears to have two small fangs protruding from her upper jaw. This suggests that she represents some demonic creature converted by the Buddha\u2019s teachings.\n\nThe rapid expansion of Buddhist monasteries demanded quicker and less expensive methods of decoration. Stucco satisfied this need and was widely used in the later Gandharan period. Section moulds were also frequently employed.",

The rapid expansion of Buddhist monasteries demanded quicker and less expensive methods of decoration.  Stucco satisfied this need. These two figures show evidence of being richly painted, with traces of yellow, red, and brown iron-oxides  still visible. The male figure is dressed in princely attire; the female is clad in a diaphanous robe and has fangs protruding from her upper jaw, suggesting that she represents some demonic force. These figures probably formed part of a relief decorating a Buddhist monument.",
