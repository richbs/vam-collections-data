A small carnelian cabochon is hidden under a round, fluted flower;  a black pearl is centred on a flower element and a quartz crystal with a pyrite inclusion is almost hidden in a folded copper leaf.  Bronze elements include a collar around a cast silver piece, and a flower or cone.  The surfaces have been chased, textured and oxidised.  The hollow conical boss is the constriction through which the stream emerges and flows over a chased and repouss\u00e9 stony surface made from 14 gauge sheet;  a reversed triangular blade shape is thereby created and broadens as the flow spreads out.",
