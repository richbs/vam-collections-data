            "public_access_description": "This plate is an example of faience patriotique, a type of French tin-glazed earthenware decorated with images and mottos of the French Revolution (1789-99). Jugs, plates, bottles and other items with this type of decoration were made at pottery centres such as Rouen, Beauvais and Paris, but the vast majority, including this plate, were made at Nevers. \nFaience manufacture was begun in Nevers by Domenique Conrade, from Savona, Italy, who founded his pottery around 1578. Originally inspired by Italian maiolica the potters at Nevers turned to Chinese and Persian ceramics for inspiration by the 17th century. In the 18th century Nevers also produced less expensive, brightly coloured wares which reflected contemporary society and culture known today as faience parlante and faience patriotique. This faience patriotique plate reflects the popular political allegiances of those who bought and displayed such wares in their homes. The motto \u2018Vive La nation la loi et le Roy' (Long Live The nation the law the King) was used in the early days of the French Revolution when the aims were towards a constitutional monarchy. Prior to the Revolution the 'King' was saluted first, after 1789 the 'Nation' took precedent. The symbols on this plate include a laurel (wreath) representing victory, sword - the nobility, crozier - the clergy, three flaming hearts - the three united orders, military drum and draped flags - these occupied a central role in the civil festivals.",
