Williams also drew inspiration from the stories and symbols of the indigenous peoples of Guyana although his artistic practice defies simple classification as either \u2018Caribbean\u2019 or \u2018British\u2019. \n\n\u2018Apparition\u2019, a gouache on paper, is typical of Williams\u2019 work in its energy and colour. Painted in 1987, it follows a body of work entitled the Olmec-Maya series which sought to uncover the elemental forces lying behind pre-Columbian iconography. One critic observed how \u2018the Sun Disc and other symbols and hieroglyphics of this lost cosmology became alive as poignant elements in a most powerfully expressed phase of work\u2019 (Denis Bowen, 1989). It might also be noted, in respect of the imagery of this work, that after coming to live in Britain (in the early 1950s) Williams became interested in the ancient henge monuments of these islands.",
