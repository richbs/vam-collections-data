The design consists of an elongated tree with central trunk with a series of roughly symmetrical pairs of branches with leaves and fruits, reaching out to the side borders all the way up. Near the top the trunk divides into two. Three birds, possibly two-headed, perch in the top most branches. The tree grows from a rocky mound, flanked by two similar mounds on either side, and two pairs of long horned quadrupeds (buffalo?), two of whom are tethered to the tree trunk. Two little men are also present, one of whom appears to be leading one of the untethered animals by the nose, and carrying a stick (?) in his other hand. An object, possibly a noose, dangles from the same arm. A series of borders runs round the edges, the main one of repeating quartered circle, with a small circle in each quarter. Guard borders of continuous squiggly bomb\u00e9, circles, ovals, etc. A triangular motif runs across each end of the cloth above a border of stepped geometrical ornament. The design is carried out in subtle colours, dark grey and reddish brown, on a creamy ground.",
