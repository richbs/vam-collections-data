They are probably Joseph of Arimathea, on the left, and Nicodemus, standing on the ladder to the right.  Originally a third figure also helped. Only the sleeve and left hand of  this figure now survive. You can see them behind Christ's head and above his back.\nThe relief would have originally formed part of a Passion altarpiece, such as the altarpiece in Botkyrka, Sweden, made in Antwerp around 1520-1530. The style of this piece is similar to the work of Pieter Coecke van Aelst  and his workshop in Antwerp. This workshop  was becoming increasingly influential by the late 1530s.",
