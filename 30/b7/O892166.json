Scavizzi, Luca Giordano, 1966, 1, p. 195 and fig. 671; Exhibition Catalogue, Le Cabinet d'un grand amateur P. J. Mariette, Louvre, Paris, 1967, p. 67, no. 65 Francesco Superchi, mentioned in the inscription, was Abbot of S. Giorgio Maggiore from 1667 to 1671, and he was still alive in 1686 (for these and other facts concerning him see Cigogna, Delle Inscrizioni Veneziane, 3, 1830, p. 462; 4, 1834, p. 275 etc; see also Giambattista Fabri, La Conchiglia Celeste, Venice, 1690, 3 ingresso, pp. 20, 21). It is possible, therefore, that he may have contemplated commissioning Luca Giordano to paint an altarpiece for the church, even after his retirement from the post of abbot. But the commission was evidently not carried out. There is no painting by Giordano in S. Giorgio Maggiore, nor does any other recorded picture by him in Venice bear any relation to the drawing. On the other hand, the Bollani Chapel in S. Giorgio Maggiore contains a well known altarpiece by Sebastiano Ricci which, like Giordano's drawing, represents the Virgin and Child adored by St Peter and St Paul and other saints. It is dated 1708, and according to Cigogna, lac. cit. vo!. 4, p. 351, it replaced another painting by Cervelli, executed about 1690. This may have been the altarpiece for which Father Superchi invited Giordano to submit a design. The drawing is listed under Luca Giordano as no. 442 in the sale catalogue of Mariette's collection by Basan, 1775, and a note in the Museum's copy states that it was sold for 63 livres. Sir Thomas Lawrence's mark is not on the sheet, but the description of lot 1228 at the Woodburn sale, mentioned above, must almost certainly refer to this drawing. It reads as follows: 'Giordano (L) - The Virgin and Child, with St Peter and St Paul, and other saints - sketch for his picture in the church of St George, at Venice, bistre wash. From the collections of Crozat and Mariette.' A note in the Museum's Register of Drawings also states that the drawing was in Crozat's collection, but it is not mentioned in Mariette's catalogue of the Crozat collection, and the statement doubtless derives ultimately from the Woodburn sale catalogue. The notes on this drawing in the two exhibition catalogues quoted are partly based on this catalogue entry, which was written before they were printed and shown to the authors.",
