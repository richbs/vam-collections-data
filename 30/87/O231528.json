            "public_access_description": "This is the original artwork for a full page advert in the 'Melody Maker' music newspaper, for the Sex Pistols single Something Else, designed by Jamie Reid (b. 1947). This was the second single released in order to promote the Sex Pistols movie, The Great Rock n Roll Swindle in 1979, and was released just two weeks after bassist Sid Vicious's death. Sid Vicious had by this point become the front man of the outfit, as Johnny Rotten, the previous singer, had split up the band in January 1978. McLaren, the band's manager, wanted to carry on with Vicious as singer. Vicious recorded two covers of songs by 1950s rock 'n' roll star Eddie Cochran, one of which was Something Else. Following this Vicious would have nothing more to do with McLaren. The b-side of the record featured another out-take from previous sessions, with guitarist Steve Jones singing Friggin' in the Riggin'.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this record cover, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols. This particular cover also demonstrates his skill at graphic illustration.",
