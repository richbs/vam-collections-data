            "public_access_description": "Claire Barclay (born Paisley, Scotland, 1968) is a sculptor and installation artist. A graduate of Glasgow School of Art, Barclay represented Scotland at the 2003 Venice Biennale and her work has also been included in several other high-profile national and international exhibitions. She is a leading figure in a generation of young artists who have re-engaged with craft techniques and the symbolic resonance of materials. Her installations have been described as \"abstract compositions in space, drawings animated in three dimensions by material, colour and form.\" [Andrea Tarsia, Claire Barclay (Camden Arts Centre, 2008)]\n\nThis screenprint was created to coincide with her installation Shadow Spans,  a Bloomberg Commission at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 2010. The print, which was produced at the renowned Glasgow Print Studio, echoes some of the motifs and strategies used in her installation. In its use of layering and transparency the print mirrors Barclay's use of fabrics, plastics and reflective surfaces as well as architectural elements, and her practice of playing off hand-made or organic objects and materials against machine-made or industrial materials. The hard-edged motifs in the screenprint are contrasted with the sensuous hand-made quality of the print. The print also demonstrates the way in which Barclay explores and achieves tension and balance through these contrasts and oppositions.",
