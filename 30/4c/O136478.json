During the Tang dynasty (618-906) funerary statues played an extremely important role in burial, featuring in funerary processions and acting as tomb sculpture. Such objects also functioned as clear indicators of the status of the deceased. So great was the desire to demonstrate status that social restrictions had to be imposed on the numbers of figures permitted in any one funeral procession. The figures were placed on a cart which formed part of the funeral procession. After reaching the tomb they were lined up, according to strict historical traditions, in front of the tomb and once the deceased had been placed inside the burial chamber the figures would be moved inside the tomb and positioned very carefully in the appropriate spot within the burial chamber.",
