Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nCircular and heart-shaped ring brooches are medieval in origin and found throughout northern Europe.  They differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  In this brooch, the pin has been bent back so that it lies on the back of the ring, so that now it is not functional.  \n\nThis ring brooch is a plain circle decorated with filigree coil rings, each topped with a small lozenge alternating with a granule.  This kind of decoration is typical of Sk\u00e5ne work in the first half of the 19th century, as is the little ring holding the pin.  The brooch was made to hold a woman's shirt closed at the collar.  It is marked with the maker's mark OL.  Olaus Liander was a silversmith who worked in Ystad from 1823-1853.  Ystad was the main centre for the production of traditional jewellery of all kinds in Sk\u00e5ne in the 19th century.",
