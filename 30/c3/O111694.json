            "physical_description": "Carved and inlaid walnut cabinet with twin front doors and hinged lid, enclosing 10 drawers; the doors and lid with low relief carved busts over textile.\n\nDesign\nCabinet of rectangular chest form with twin hinged doors, and hinged lid on a low walnut plinth (19c in date), with carving in walnut and boxwood(?) applied over red silk. The front and sides of the lid are formed by applied, mitred edges carved with integral mouldings (egg and dart, dentil and layered leaf). \n\nEach door exterior is carved with a series of applied mouldings: leaf (walnut), leafy scrolls (box), leaf and dart (walnut), guilloche (box), ogee with leaf and dart (walnut). These surround a central panel with an applied boxwood(?) profile classical head (facing inwards) pegged into a granular surface ground punched into the solid. On the sides which are both fitted with a wrought iron bail handle (with traces of gilding) on quatrefoil backplates, a plain central panel is surrounded by the same outer mouldings. The lid and back exteriors are inlaid in a pale wood with a regular geometrical pattern of interlacing X and + forms. The underside is plain. The plinth has been created by the addition of four nailed sections of moulding with integral leaf-carved moulding, adding 5cm to the height of the cabinet.\n\nThe interior face of each door is carved with a series of mouldings: leaf (walnut), leafy scrolls (boxwood(?) over red silk). Applied centrally is an openwork boxwood panel over red silk, with a roundel with helmeted male profile head, facing inwards. Most of the silk on the right door is a pale brown colour, and the darker colour of the carved roundel (carved in two sections not one as is the left door) suggests that the right door carving and silk is replaced, the silk presumably red originally but now faded, possibly as a result of fugitive dye.\n\nOpening the doors reveals a C-shaped shallow tray with moulded and carved edges, above 10 drawers arranged in 4 tiers (from top: x4 (two recessed behind a dustboard with geometrical inlay), x3, x2, x 1).  The front edges of the dustboards and drawer dividers are decorated with an applied boxwood(?) reel ornament. The fronts of the drawers are decorated with applied boxwood(?) arabesque carving over red silk and applied, mitred mouldings with carved acanthus (walnut), with a vase-shaped, cast brassy handle. \n\nThe inside of the lid is decorated with a large rectangular panel surrounded by a guilloche moulding (boxwood, a darker section top left apparently replaced), within a leaf and dart moulding (walnut). The panel shows a triple arcade of three flattened arches enriched with leafy ornament (applied boxwood), each arch enclosing a male bearded bust (applied boxwood) on a lattice background carved in the solid. The central bust is full-faced, with grapes in his hair (Bacchus), while the two flanking busts are profile (facing inwards) with elaborate helmets, on the back of which is mounted a smaller, bearded mask in profile, giving a Janus-like effect.\n\nConstruction\nThe back and sides consist of solid boards, with the back dovetailed and pegged to the sides. The base is nailed up into the sides and back, and consists of two softwood planks, with a front strip of walnut (replaced) with integral acanthus carving along its front upper face. The internal drawer unit is supported on 4 horizontal battens nailed (or glued) to the inside face of each side, with grooves to receive the 3 full-width walnut dustboards, which stabilise the whole. Drawer dividers are nailed through the dustboards. The lid is a solid walnut board with applied mouldings on the front and sides, held on two ring hinges. Each door is held on two strap hinges of gilded metal, tenoned into the door and cabinet side. The left door is fitted with a nailed metal finger spring, into which a metal fitting (now missing) on the right door engaged. (There is no evidence that a lock was ever fitted. The cabinet would have been opened from the lif, giving access to the door catch.\n\nDrawers\nWalnut fronts, sides and backs with oak bottoms (a single board which is grained side to side for the 3 larger drawers, but front to back for the 7 smaller ones), and a single cast brass(?) pull. The sides dovetailed to the backs and nailed to the fronts at a notched rebate. The bottoms are nailed up on all four sides, which pins the joint between the sides and the fronts. The fronts with  red silk overlaid by a single piece of openwork (boxwood?) carving, apparently glued(?), and applied walnut mouldings.\n\nModifications\nThe plinth consists of four dovetailed sections of walnut with integral carved mouldings (of a visibly different character to the other exterior carving), nailed up into the carcase. The walnut strip along the front of the base may also be replaced.\nMuch of the applied boxwood ornament, and silk on the inside of the right door appears to be replaced, as is a small section of guilloche moulding on the lid interior.\nMissing a door catch on the right door.",

They were among the first pieces of European furniture to be fitted with drawers. From about 1540, they evolved into cabinets and writing desks with a single, fall-front, known as an escritorio. A number of chests similar to this one, with applied carving and profile heads are thought to have been made in Catalonia, Aragon (NW Spain) and the Ballearic islands. The plinth under this cabinet was added, probably c1880-90 along with minor ornamental restorations, but overall this example is in substantially original condition.\n\nThis cabinet once belonged to George Salting (1839\u20131909), whose collections ranging from Italian Renaissance bronzes to Oriental porcelain were bequeathed to the Museum in 1909.",
