The earliest sockets were polygonal in cross-section; by the 15th century they were round. At first, two vertical apertures were cut into the socket to facilitate the extraction of the burnt-out stub. Over time these became smaller and by the 15th century they tended to be horizontally cut. \n\nThe form of the stem and base of candlesticks at this time is the result of a complicated interplay between two typological currents. The first type naturally evolved from the simple European pricket candlestick, where the shaft is supported on three legs. The second type originated in the Near East and had a high cylindrical or slightly conical base surmounted by a flat circular wax pan and a short circular stem. These candlesticks were introduced into Europe by the Muslim community in Venice from the 14th century and account for the high bell-shaped bases that appear on many northern European and Saracenic candlesticks during this period. \n\nBroadly speaking the development of the base can be attributed to Near Eastern influence, while the stem, which gradually became longer, with an increasingly complicated range of knops and balusters, is largely European in origin.",
