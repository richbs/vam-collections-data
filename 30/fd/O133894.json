            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 160-61\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\n\"LESLIE, Charles Robert, RA (1794-1859) \nBorn London 19 October 1794, eldest son of American parents, with whom he went to Philadelphia 1799. Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Sterne. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir Walter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a Handbook for Young Painters (1855). His Life of Reynolds was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of 30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The Athenaeum critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the wit of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1856, pp73-5 and 105-7,1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie Autobiographical Recollections ed T Taylor, 2 vols,'1860; J Dafforne Pictures by C R Leslie nd (1875]; Art Journal 1902 pp144-8; J Constable The Letters of John Constable and C R  Leslie 1931; ed R B Beckett John Constable's Correspondence III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n'Whom Can This be From?' FA112 Neg64831 \nCanvas, 58.3 X 73.6 cm (23 X 29 ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1839, a pendant to 'Who Can This Be?' (see FA111, above), and according to Taylor (Leslie II, p251) painted also for John Sheepshanks. \nThe Examiner saw it as 'a lady eyeing a letter which is presented to her by an attendant, who is humorously and pleasingly conceived. Both, however, in comedy and character, this picture is very inferior to the other' (that is, 'Who Can This Be?'). The Art Union thought it 'a most delightful work, although somewhat cold and \"chalky\": a defect which is the more apparent because it is placed near paintings of very brilliant colour ... The contrast between the aristocratic lady and the homely serving wench, who conveys the epistle, is capitally given'. The Athenaeum critic's comments are given under FA111 above. \nThe two paintings, exactly the same size, are clearly intended to give two episodes of a narrative, and their titles are equally provocative. The story seems to be set in the later 17th century, a period considered in early Victorian years as one of especial debaucherie. The costumes date from the 1670s and 1680s, and the coiffure of the lady is similar to those in portraits by Sir Peter Lely, although the ringlets, if not the curled fringe, were experiencing a revival in late 1830s fashion. The image of the lady receiving a letter (presumably from the young lover seen in the first picture) delivered by her servant was especially popular in 17th-century Dutch painting; the presence of the pet dog in the first episode, and the portrait of the husband (presumably) on the wall in the second, also perhaps relate to the use of such symbolism in Dutch art. \nIt is interesting to note the similarity of the entrance of the servant with that in the portrait of Sheepshanks himself by William Mulready (see FA142 p202). Furthermore the Athenaeum in 1862 criticised a slight change in the painting's title, made by the Museum and since reversed: \n'Accusative' wishes to show cause, in this our Court of Criticism, why the authorities of the South Kensington Museum should be called upon to change the title of Leslie's charming little picture ... A young lady is receiving a letter from a servant, and appears to be in doubt as to the sender. 'Who can it be from?' Now, Mr Accusative would ask the authorities why a preposition, which governs the objective case elsewhere, should have no power in Brompton? The fair creature is neither a housemaid nor a fishwife, but a young and elegant lady. Mrs Squeers [that is, the appalling headmaster's wife in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby] might very properly ask a question in such terms. But that bright young creature of Leslie's imagination - surely she never made a blunder which would have delighted Mistress Squeers? \nEXH: \tRA 1839 (82); Victorian Narrative Painting V&A Circulating exhibition 1961 \nLIT:\tas for 'Who Can This Be?', FA111, p159 \nREPR: \tT H Ward English Art in the Public Galleries of London II, 1888, facing p139 \n\n\nR Parkinson\"",
