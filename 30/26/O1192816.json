            "public_access_description": "This poster was printed in Iran during the 1990's and depicts a black and white portrait photograph of a man, representing Ali, the son in law of  the Prophet Muhammad. The majority of Iran\u2019s population are Shi'ia Muslims, for  whom Ali is an important figure. The years following Muhammad's death were marked  with rival claims to  power. Ali's followers believed that the leader of the Muslim people should come from within Muhammad's family. Others disagreed and this resulted in an  eventual split between the Sunni and Shi'ite sects.\n\nThis poster is part of a genre of religious posters celebrating the Shi'ite faith. They are commonly displayed in  Iranian homes, workplaces and religious buildings.  Although the photograph was probably taken in the early twentieth century, long after Ali's death, the inscription on the poster tells us that this man is meant to represent him. There are also visual indicators; the man's sword suggests the double pointed sword or zul fiqr which is said to have been given to Ali by Muhammad. Although no image of Ali has survived, a common visual language has developed through such popular imagery making Ali easily recognisable in this poster.",
