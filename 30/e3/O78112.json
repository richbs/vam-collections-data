They were often highly coloured, even if the image was intended to be reproduced as a print in black and white.\n\nPeople\nRuskin was one of the most influential writers on art and politics in the 19th century. His early writings, which advocated the work of J.M.W. Turner and Pre-Raphaelitism, and his enthusiasm for Medieval Gothic, had a major impact on painting and architecture.  He was a good artist and draughtsman in his own right, as he had been taught by the watercolour painters Copley Fielding and James Duffield Harding. He wrote a major work of criticism entitled `The Stones of Venice' which was published in three volumes from 1851 to 1853.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn 1845 Ruskin made meticulous sketches of details of Venetian architecture, and many (but not this one) were reproduced as illustrations to his book. Ruskin argued that Venetian Gothic architecture was a good example of a flourishing cultural unity, of a kind that had been almost lost in his own day, and he used the exquisite details found in the buildings of Venice to prove his case.",
