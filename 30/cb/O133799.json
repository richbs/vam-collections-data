Worked as assistant to his father by the age of 15. Exhibited 34 works at the RA between 1843 and 1898, 18 at the BI 1844-67, and 25 at the SBA 1846--94. Early works mainly subjects from English history, and from literature, particularly Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites in the 1850s, in both technique and subject matter; painted several scenes of modem life, notably 'Omnibus Life in London' (1859, Tate Gallery). Later works are mostly 18th-century costume subjects. Designed one of the first Christmas cards, an etched greeting dated 1848. Friend of W P Frith, for whom he painted backgrounds on occasion. Died Chiswick, London, 20 February 1916. \n\nLIT: W M Egley <i>Catalogue of Pictures</i>. . .

It is listed as 'the <i>second</i> sketch for No 786/the finished picture, exhibited at the RA 18791, but differs from the first sketch, No791, in having another arrangement of the figures, with a different background'. \n\nIn the 1879 RA catalogue, the finished painting (l0ll) is 'Scene from \"Le Medicin Malgr\u00e9 Lui\" \" with several lines in French appended to the title; the episode depicted is from almost the end (act 3 scene 6) of Moli\u00e8re's play, first performed in 1666, and the lines are given in translation in the artist's <i>Catalogue</i>: \n\n<i>G\u00e9ronte</i>: My daughter speaks! Oh! great power of medicine! (Walking about the stage and fanning herself with his hat) \n\n<i>Sganarelle</i>: Really, this illness has given me a great deal of trouble. \n\n<i>Lucinde</i>: Yes, father, I have recovered my speech, but only to tell you that I will have no other husband than L\u00e9andre. \n\n<i>G\u00e9ronte</i>: Oh! What a rush of words! One can't stand it. \n\nIn the play, G\u00e9ronte's daughter Lucinde has pretended to be dumb, and Sganarelle, a 'miracle worker', is employed to cure her; she is in love with L\u00e9andre, who disguises himself as an apothecary and with Sganarelle's help tricks G\u00e9ronte and Lucinde's speech is restored (the scene in the painting). G\u00e9ronte then in the last scene allows the marriage when L\u00e9andre announces he has inherited a fortune. The characters shown in the painting are, from left to right, L\u00e9andre, G\u00e9ronte, Lucinde, Sganarelle, Lucas and his wife Jacqu\u00e9line.\n \nPROV: Bought by H S Ashbee 1898, and bequeathed by him to the museum 1900\"",
