He co-wrote with Tony Barrell and illustrated the book Superslave, the first colour illustrated book published by Penguin (1972). This watercolour is for an illustration featured on page 19 of this book. The illustration shows the character 'Superslave' in a long bright pink robe with his companion 'Doggo'. They are placed in the left foreground against the backdrop of the city 'Superbia Anagora', which is surrounded by a grey wall and barbed wire. The book comprises similar illustrations and text following the layout of a story board. The style of illustration is reminiscent of underground press graphics of the period.",
