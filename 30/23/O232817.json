R. C. Lathom Browne. Inscribed on the back in ink 'Drawn by my father John Constable R. A. C. G. Constable'. Shirley <i> Connoisseur </i>, Vol. XCI, 1933, p. 218, No. 33, dates c. 1820, but the drawing is clearly contemporary with Nos. 18-20. (See note following No. 20)\n\nNotes on Nos. 17-20\nOn admission to the Academy Schools Constable worked hard at the customary academic discipline of drawing from the antique and from the life. Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 13) says \"I have seen no studies made by Constable at the Academy from the antique, but many chalk drawings and oil paintings from the living model, all of which have great breadth of light and shade, though they are sometimes defective in outline\". Shirley, in the article cited in Nos. 17-20, entitled 'John Constable and the Nude', points out that Constable drew from the life throughout his career, and he sets out to classify the known drawings and paintings of the nude by Constable in groups by date. He gives reasons for assigning three of those in the Museum to the earliest group, from the first period of Constable's career as an art student, c. 1800; the fourth is clearly contemporary with them. More than any of the groups assigned to later dates they conform to Leslie's characterisation - breadth of light and shade and weakness of outline. The inscriptions on the back were all written by the artist's second son, Charles Golding Constable (1821-79).\nLambert, Susan. <u>Drawing: Technique & Purpose</u>.

(The date 1798 which has previously been accepted for this journey was derived from entries published under that year in the printed edition of Farington's <i>Diary</i> (Greig, Vol. I, p. 229); but they are dated 1799 in the original MS.) He entered the Academy Schools as a probationer in March 1799, and was enrolled as a student on 19 February 1800. In the summer of 1800 he stayed by himself sketching in Helmingham Park, the grounds of a seat of the Earl of Dysart.\n\n[G Reynolds]",
