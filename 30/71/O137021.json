            "public_access_description": "Phyllis Ginger studied at the Richmond School of Art between 1932 and 1935. Although her main ambition was to work in illustration, she was encouraged during her studies to also follow her interests in etching and portraiture. She exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1938 and was elected to the Royal Watercolour society in 1952. In 1939 Phyllis Ginger's skill as a topographical artist led to her involvement in the Pilgrim's Trust scheme Recording Britain, which invited artists to visit particular places and make their own choice of scenes to depict that may be destroyed by enemy action.\n\nThis watercolour demonstrates Ginger's ability as a topographical artist. The location has not been identified however it seems likely from the style of the architecture that it is of a street of Regency houses in Cheltenham. The artist lived in Saltford, near Bath from 1944 until 1946 and drew inspiration from these local surroundings, depicting Cheltenham for a number of her Recording Britain works. Elegant Regency terraces are presented to the viewer stretching out from the left foreground to the distance in the mid right of the page. Watercolour has been used to bring shade and depth to pen outlines. The two cars depicted in front of the terrace convey that this is a contemporary depiction of the cityscape. This watercolour does not relate to any in the Recording Britain series. However it demonstrates Ginger's perception of her capturing surrounding scenes in the 1940s.",
