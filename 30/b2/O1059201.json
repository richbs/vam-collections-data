Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>119 A Man, said to be Sir John Maynard</b>\n(b.1602 d.1690)\n<b>1660-5</b>\nP122-1910\n\n<b>Oval 55 x 45 mm</b> \n\nFeatures finely hatched in brown and sanguine, with a little blue-grey precisely stippled and hatched around the modelling of the features and with some white heightening, on a yellowish carnation ground; hair in pale grey, with some brown strokes, and white; cap and costume in dark grey wash, darkened with black and heightened with pale grey; collar in grey, modelled in grey and white; background to the left a brown wash worked over with darker colour, to the right a sky in opaque blue, grey and white; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> The margins damaged, the vellum torn in the right margin; evidence of some old restoration, and of pressing as part of the restoration where the chain and laid lines of the paper support show through the vellum and paint surface; abrasions, perhaps intentional, in the area of the signature and polish marks elsewhere on the surface. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Inscribed</b> centre left, in black: <i>TF</i> (see C in Appendix 2). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> A modern gold locket, slightly convex back, a sharp arris and flat sides, the shallowly convex glass held in a bezel by its bevelled edges; the hanger a small wire loop fitted with a ring. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> 'The Earl of Shaftesbury'; J L Propert by 1887; purchased with others from the Propert Collection by George Salting; (1) 1897, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> BFAC 1889, p. 98, Case XXXIV, no. 17 (as by Cooper); FAS 1897, no. 58 (as by Cooper). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Propert 1887, repro. facing p. 78 (as by Cooper); Long 1929, p. 155 (Flatman); Long 1930, p. 28; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 21; Murdoch 1981, p. 152. \n\nFrom the receipt of the miniature Long was dubious about the signature, pointing out in MS notes that the paint surface around the signature was scraped or smudged, and that the miniature had previously been identified confidently as a Cooper. By implication, there had perhaps been a forged Cooper signature, removed in the trade before Salting bought the miniature, by which time a more plausible TF signature had been substituted. Foster, who knew the market fairly well, may have known about this aspect of the miniature's history, for it is omitted from his listings. Neither Long nor any subsequent authority has doubted that the miniature is substantially the work of \n Flatman, yet the coloured stipple in the face painting and the use of a plain card support should have been seen as odd for Flatman. Both these factors are, however, probably the result of restoration - the extra colouring of flesh-tones being a speciality of the commercial restorers around 1900. \n\nThe appearance of Sir John Maynard, doyen of the Bar and knighted at the Restoration, is fairly well established by a series of versions of a portrait type (c.1675-80) which David Piper- attributed to Riley and which is represented in the NPG as well as at Blickling Hall, at Exeter College, in the Middle Temple and elsewhere. It shows a man in cap and gown, with thin features and a nose which is noticeably long and uneven. There is some superficial similarity to the sitter for the present miniature. \n\nPiper, who evidently did not know of the present miniature, also referred, not absolutely dismissively, to two miniatures, one by Hoskins ' and one attributed to Cooper (but possibly by Flatman). (4) But the sitters bear no resemblance either to the Riley type or to one another. They may conceivably represent, as Piper suggested, one or other of the contemporary Maynards - Sir John the Royalist (1592-1658; though he seems to have died too early) or John Maynard the Puritan minister (1600-1665). For what it is worth, Long seems to have taken the sitter for this miniature to be a cleric. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4637. \n2 Piper 1963, pp. 230-1. \n3 Evidently 'the Younger', signed and dated 1657, Pierpont Morgan sale, Christie's 24 June 1935, lot 138, repra. \n4 Buccleuch Collection, Kennedy 1917, pI.
