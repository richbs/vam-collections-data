The subject was chosen because it provided two strong female roles for the Paris Opera Ballet's current stars,  Carolina Rosati and Amalia Ferraris.  \nSuch a complex story was almost impossible to convey in dance.  Most memorable was the scene where the whole stage with thirty people, was raised, revealing an underground cavern beneath.  After a series of accidents the dancers began carrying charms to ward off evil influences.  \nToday, Marco Spada is remembered from prints of minor soloists, including Louise Marquet, who were depicted in costumes from the ballet.  Her dress follows the outlines of what has become a conventional ballet dress, given details and colouring characteristic of a particular country.  Louise Marquet wears a flat headdress characteristic of Italian national dress. \nBy 1860, photography had become a viable commercial medium, and several of the prints in the series Les Danseuses de l'Opera seem to be copies of photographs.  Maybe this was because most photographs were quite small and, of course, sepia toned; translated into lithographs, they could be larger and then hand coloured, making them more suitable for display.",

Louise Marquet was a soloist at the Paris Opera in the 1850s.  \nThe print is No. 5 in the series, Les Danseuses de l'Opera, published ca. 1860.  There were 14 in total, all the work of Alophe.\nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
