In the Bible Matthew is one of the Four Evangelists, the writers of the gospel accounts of Christ's life. The convention of representing the four as winged creatures is based on the book of Ezekiel, chapter 1, verses 5-14, where Ezekiel tells of a vision of three beasts and a man, all winged. Medieval commentators argued that the man represents Matthew, because his gospel begins with an ancestral tree of Christ's forebears.\n\nThis expressive panel  was carved from a single piece of oak, and was probably one of a set of four (another of which survives in the Museum, 676-1895). It was formerly in the collection of Emile Peyre (1824-1904), a notable Parisian collector of French Medieval and Renaissance woodwork. The V&A bought many pieces from him in 1895.",
