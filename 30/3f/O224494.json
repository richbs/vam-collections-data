The vase is set on a plinth, flanked by elaborate scrolling with foliage and flowers, this set with figures of birds and butterflies. The top is set with a gilt-brass moulding on the front and side edges. The sides of the commmode show smaller compositions centreing on a vase, the flowers with a central crown imperial.  The drawer fronts (8 fronts on 5 drawers) show a central area of plain ebony for the gilt-brass bail handles, flanked on each drawer fronts with symmetrical but not identical scrolls and flowers. The outset stiles on the front and back corners are inlaid with formal scrolling designs on a ground of ebony, as are the front edges of the dustboards between the drawers. The small, shaped apron panel, veneered in ebony, is set with a pierced cul de lampe mount with rococo scrolls (added later).\n\nThe gilt-brass lock escutcheons, including a blind one between the top drawers, are in the form of masks of Hercules. The eight bail handles have backplates in the form of male masks. \n\n<u>Construction</u>\nThe softwood case is constructed as a three-sided box, with dovetail joints.  It is supported on four stiles that are glued or pinned to the outer corners.  These are shaped to form the feet, and are serpentine in outline. The apron is cut from a single block of softwood and is glued to the underside of the case, as are the blocks that create the spandrels between the feet and the underside of the case. \n\nThe backboard is composed of horizontal boards and is nailed in place, through the case, into a long, vertical glue block set within the case at each back corner. The top is of cleated constructed, and appears to be simply glued to the top edge of the case. \n\nThe dustboards are each formed of several boards of softwood. The upper dustboard is tenoned into the case sides, the jointing of the lower dustboards with the case sides obscured by glue blocks set just above and below them and acting as drawer guides. The division between the two top drawers is composed of two boards (softwood on the left, beech on the right) and is simply glued in place. \n\nThe drawers are built of walnut with softwood fronts, all heavily stained. The fronts are laminated, to provide the necessary depth for the shaping of the curved fronts. The sides are joined to the backs with through dovetails and to the front with lapped dovetails, the drawer fronts slightly extended with additional strips of wood. The drawer bottoms are nailed in rebates in the sides, front and back.",

It is veneered in ebony, richly inlaid with marquetry showing motifs taken from a variety of engravings \u2013 flowers, vases and formal scrollwork.  It was surely made in a Parisian workshop but we know little of its history.  In the early 19th century it formed part of the furnishing of the Ch\u00e2teau de Montargis, to the south of Paris, from where it was bought, with four other pieces, by the English woman who finally bequeathed it to the Museum, but it is unlikely that it was made for that building.",
