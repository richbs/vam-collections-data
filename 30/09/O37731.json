Each of the front four girls is positioned on a wing and \n has a partly cut outline; the fifth girl is shaking hands with the boy, and \n both are printed on the flat back of the card.  The upper edge of the card \n is printed with garlands of berried holly tied with green bows, in a partly \n cut outline.  The months of the year are printed within small scrolls \n visible when the calendar is opened out; these and the words \"Calendar 1897\" are printed in gold.",
