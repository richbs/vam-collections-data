This pattern forms a border on 3 sides of the central panel and in between, on 3 sides, is a wide border with a meandering dark blue [on the right] and dark brown [on the left] line connecting elongated thin green leaves striped with yellow and red; spiky flowers and round buds grow from the blue stem.  The ground of this border has been quilted into an irregular diamond grid. The central panel is divided into a lobed arch and spandrels.  The arch is delineated by pink and green chevrons edged in dark blue.  The arch contains isolated floral sprigs: each bearing 3 carnations predominantly pink and light blue; some include black threads.  The ground has been quilted around the flowers using red silk; white silk has been used towards the bottom.  There is a roundel containing an inscription in dark brown and more black inscriptions have been embroidered around the roundel and across the panel.  The spandrels have been divided into an elaborate grid by a combination of small curved leaves and diamonds.  The ground has then been quilted with red silk; white has been used along the right hand side.  This mat contains no padding but the embroidery has been worked through a layer of cotton.\nEmbroidery Thread: dark blue, light blue, yellow, red, green, white, black, pink [very faded], dark brown; 2S\nBacking: pieced; plain weave cotton, yellow ground with off-set rows of a single white blossom on a brown stem with 2 leaves.  Poor quality printing.\nFacing: bias-cut, plain weave cotton with 2 shades of blue creating a fine check.",
