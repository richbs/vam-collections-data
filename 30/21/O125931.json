(some col.)\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 221, 225\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\"The drawing has been trimmed and laid down on card, and has lost any indications it may have had of being a sketch-book page, but the measurements suggest that it came from the sketchbook discussed in the note following No. 384 [836-1888]. \nThis study from nature was used by Constable as the sketch for his last big picture, the 'Arundel Mill and Castle', on which he worked the day he died, and which was exhibited posthumously at the Royal Academy in 1837. The painting is now in the Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio (reproduced L. ed, S., Pl. 150; L. ed. M., Pl. 54). See also the sketch-book No. 382 [316-1888], pp, 33, 35.\n\nNote on Nos. 378-381, 383 and 384 [272-1888, 260-1888, 312-1888, 615-1888, 314-1888, 836-1888]\n\nNos. 380 [312-1888], 381 [615-1888] and 383 [314-1888] come from the same sketch-book of which the leaves measure 221 x 285 mm. (8 \u00be x 11 1/8 ins.), which was used by the artist on his summer visit to George Constable at Arundel concurrently with the intact sketch-book No. 382 [316-1888], and again when he went to Worcester to lecture in October. For the reasons given in the entries on those drawings, Nos. 378 [272-1888], 379 [260-1888] and 384 [836-1888] are probably from the same book. Holmes, p. 252, notes in the Sir J. C. Robinson sale of 21 April 1902 a drawing 'Landscape with Cottages' dated 15 July 1835 and measuring 8 \u00be x 11 ins. This was made during the visit to Arundel and may have been from the same sketch-book.\u201d",
