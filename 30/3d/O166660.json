The original drawing was subsequently presented to the museum by the artist.\n\nHistorical significance: Stephen Walter read for a degree in Fine Art at Manchester Metropolitan University and subsequently went on to do a Master's degree in Fine Art Printmaking at the Royal College of Art. Although he works in a range of media, in recent years he has focussed increasingly on drawing.\n\nMuch of Walter's recent work has developed through a fascination with maps and signs. He draws landscapes in which objects are taken over by their symbolic representations, creating forests of geographical map symbols and places where every inch is mapped and quantified for human purpose.\n\n<i>Untitled (Subterranea)</i> is a highly individual map of South Kensington and the surrounding area with landmarks indicated.
