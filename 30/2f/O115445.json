They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the jatakas) and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is an example.\n\nThis painting can be found in cave one at Ajanta and depicts scenes from the Mahosadha jataka and the Sumagadha jataka.",

This painting depicts the Mahosadha jataka and the Sumagadha jataka.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the land of Videha, a crowning ceremony to turn a prince into a king is taking place. \nTwo servants pour water over the Prince\u2019s head and his crown is being held in readiness by another servant to his left. Other servants stand in adjoining rooms with dishes and jugs, and a group of beggars wait outside for gifts to be distributed. \n\nThe king appoints a new chancellor called Mahosadha. Four ministers plot against the new chancellor and make advances to his wife. To reap her revenge, the chancellor\u2019s wife tricks them into meeting her one evening whereby they are put into a sack and presented to the king  with their four heads pocking out of the sack.\n\n\nThe Sumagadha Jataka\n\nThis relates to the top left hand side of the painting only.\n\nThe merchant\u2019s daughter Sumagadha is a devotee of the Buddha. She convinces her father-in-law of the goodness of the Buddha and gains permission to invite him in to their home. The scene in the top left hand side shows a Sumagadha kneeling respectfully before the Buddhaas he is about to enter the home and other female servants stand nearby ready to offer food.\n\n\n** See note in Burgess about extention of actual wall painting not copied by Gill.

            "historical_context_note": "The cave paintings of Ajanta are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They depict scenes from the lives of the Buddha and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is one.",
