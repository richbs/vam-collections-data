The sleeves are short and puffed, the white satin of which they are made are gathered into vandykes of brocade, and trimmed with applied silver cord and tassels with twisted silver wire pendants. A white and silver Indian embroidered ribbon is stitched around the opening. The bodice has ovals of white satin let in at the top of the bust, shoulder bands, and five lobed panels of the same arranged fan shape at the centre front. The front panels are edged with plaited silver braid and twisted wire buttons are stitched to the top of the centre panels. The neck is trimmed with silver cord on a gathered silk net frill and similar silk net trims the sleeves.\n\nThe bodice is lined with white silk and there is a silk draw ribbon from the sides at the waist and round the neck.\n\nThere are traces of stitching at the centre front waist which suggest that there was once a skirt attached.",
