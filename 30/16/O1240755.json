            "public_access_description": "This fine Arts and Crafts necklace was made by William Pick of the Dryad Metal Works, Leicester in early 1913. It was a special order, placed by Basil Gimson (nephew of the Arts and Crafts architect and furniture designer Ernest Gimson) and intended for his bride, Alice Muriel Goodman, who wore it on their wedding day, 8 April 1913. \n\nDryad Metal Works had been founded by entrepreneur Harry Peach and metalworker William Pick the previous year, and the warm relationship between the Gimson family and Dryad can be seen in the following extract from a letter Basil received from his mother in January 1913. She wrote 'This morning Sydney and I were at the Dryad talking to Mr Peach. He spoke of the gold necklace Mr Pick is making for Muriel. He said they had picked out some first rate opals for it. From his description it sounded like a very costly affair, so I said: \"Oh, but there is a limit of price\". \"Yes, I know, but I have told Pick we are going to do this thing just tip top, the very best possible. It shall defy competition! Gimsons  have been the very best customers we have ever had, and we are going to turn out something worth having!\".'",
