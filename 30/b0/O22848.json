This example, shown in a drawing made for the catalogue of a small interior design firm, reduces to a manageable middle class formula the more elaborate schemes of bigger firms. The furniture is a mixture of modest old pieces and modern reproductions, notably the sofa based on a famous seventeenth-century example at Knole in Kent. The modern pottery lamps stand on antique tea tables and a reproduction candle stand. The wall panelling is new, but is inspired by the quantities of old panelling then available from demolished Georgian houses. It is shown without paint, a fashion partly inspired by the display in the Victoria and Albert museum of panelling which had been stripped of its original paint for instructional purposes. \n[Michael Snodin, 'British Design at Home', p.111]",
