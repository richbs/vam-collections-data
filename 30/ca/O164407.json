            "public_access_description": "This photographic poster, advertising The Sound of Music at the Palladium in 2007, is promoting the change in casting of the actress playing Maria. For the 2006 revival at the London Palladium, Andrew Lloyd Webber had originally hoped to cast Hollywood actress Scarlett Johannson. This fell through, however, and the first Maria was instead cast through a talent search reality show on BBC television. The promotion for the show resulted in sell-out performances. \n\nWhen time came for a cast change, Andrew Lloyd-Webber looked to a different form of publicity, casting the actress he intended for the role of Maria in the popular teenage soap opera Hollyoaks. The storyline, over the course of several months, led up to her character auditioning for a part in the musical and winning it, crossing the line between fiction and reality in a somewhat insidious piece of marketing.\n\nThe poster features the title of the musical in the same font and format as that of the classic 1960s film, recalling the enduring popularity of that film. It also prominently portrays Summer Strallen as the main attraction, with reviews above and below her photograph announcing her as a great new West End star.",
