He spent fourteen years with Irving, accompanying him on several British and four American tours, and during the summer breaks working with a company called 'the Lyceum Vacation Company'. He left the Lyceum in 1896 and was a freelance actor for three years, notably as Osric in Hamlet with Johnston Forbes-Robertson.Three years later he inaugurated his own management of the Lyceum with The Only Way after Irving was forced to release his tenure of the theatre. Martin Harvey's portrayal of Sydney Carton, the central figure who turns from a cynical drunkard to a heroic figure, assured his status as a star and one of Britain's last great romantic actors.\n\nMartin Harvey first played Richard III at the Lyceum in May 1910, and the brooding, dramatic nature of the role suited his character perfectly. After his knighthood in 1921 Martin Harvey became known as Sir John Martin-Harvey, introducing the double-barrelled surname.",
