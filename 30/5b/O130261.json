Closed by two doors at front, each of which consists of two panels decorated with patterns formed by a number of small drilled holes; the patterns in the upper and smaller panels are of scrollwork, and in the lower of floral scrollwork, with the date 1663 and IB repeated twice. Each end has two panels similarly decorated with scrolls and conventional leaves. The top, apparently original consists of two planks nailed down. The back panelled with three plain, roughly chamfered panels. Inside are two shelves with cut-outs to fit structure at the back. The shelves with moulded front edge, and a lot of warp. These are supported on a simple nailed batten which is half lapped to the stiles (note setting out marks). The floor boards missing.\n\nThe doors hung on three H form and a single butterfly hinge, replacing original ring hinges.\n\nJoined and panelled without any effort at mitres. The front doors with a nice stopped chamfer inside and out, but no scratch mouldings on the inside. Originally with a lock nailed to the proper right door, and probably a corresponding metal loop nailed to the proper left door, but no evidence of bolts to secure the proper left door. A mouse-hole at the rear (low down) and two patches inside the right end.",
