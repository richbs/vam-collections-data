At least as early as the Song dynasty (960-1279), Buddhist and Daoist temples were using glazed tiles on all their exterior surfaces. Here we see a very thick tile, constructed to provide a niche for the figure of the Bodhisattva (an elevated being committed to attaining Enlightenment), seated and holding a flask of ambrosia. Originally it would have formed part of a wall of similar tiled images, for its unglazed back has raised ribs grooved to key into adjoining tiles. The finely modelled figure is of the compassionate Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, known in Chinese as Guanyin.",
