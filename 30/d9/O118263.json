This was the popular improvised type of comedy which flourished in Italy from the 16th to the 18th centuries and had an impact on theatre throughout Europe, especially France. Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability for improvisation and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest. Various visiting Italian troupes performed in France in the 16th century where their type of theatre was called the Com\u00e9die-Italienne. By the 17th century however their plays were being performed largely in French, and by the 18th century Commedia dell'Arte was a recognised part of the French theatre. \n\nPantaloon was a stock character of Commedia dell'Arte who became an established part of British pantomime in the 18th century, along with Harlequin and Columbine. Pantalone was originally the rich and greedy Venetian merchant, old but athletic, whose greatest concern was his money, a perfect foil for the impecunious Arlecchino, or Harlequin. In British pantomime he was usually represented as Columbine's father.",
