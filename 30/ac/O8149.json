It was probably rarely, if ever, used to provide illumination. To function as a lamp, wicks would have been threaded through the three nozzles and the bowl filled with oil. Whale oil, which created a great deal of smoke, was the most common type used in Britain when these lamps were first made, but colza (vegetable) oil later came into use. Whale oil is lighter than colza oil. It would have been best for a lamp of this construction as it rises up the wick by capillary action alone.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe lamp combines classical and Renaissance elements. The bowl is based on an ancient Greek bronze hanging lamp of about 400 BC, but the figures are copied from the base of a 16th-century silver-gilt crucifix. These figures were thought in Wedgwood's time to have been made by Michelangelo, but they are now attributed to the Italian goldsmith Antonio Gentili (1519-1609). Similar figures appear on ormolu (gilt-bronze) items by Matthew Boulton. John Flaxman Senior (1726-1795, father of the famous sculptor, John Flaxman) probably supplied casting models for the figures to both Boulton and Wedgwood.",

Matthew Bolton used similar caryatids in his ormolu, the models for which were supplied by John Flaxman (1726-95). Flaxman was probably also the source of Wedgwood's models. Three of Gentile's figures are illustrated in William Chambers' <font -u>A Treatise of Civil Architecture</font> (1759) where they are stated to have been 'cast from models of Michel Angelo Buonarroti, and repaired either by himself or under his direction'.\nA similar grouping also occurs in a highly problematic drawing, the back of which is inscribed 'Stuarts Sale 1788'. Presumably referring to James 'Athenian' Stuart, who died in that year and is known to have lent models to Wedgwood.",
