It is fitted with metal strings on both sides and was widely used in Germany and the Netherlands from about 1650 to 1750. The player would set it on a table, pluck the melody with his right hand and strum the accompaniment with his left. It would no doubt have sounded like a cross between a harpsichord and a harp. This instrument is painted with Chinoiserie motifs, a highly fashionable form of decoration from about 1670 onwards.",
