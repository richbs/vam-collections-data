Isaac Newton was widely commemorated in busts and other forms of portraiture throughout the 18th century. Portraits in ivory were fashionable in the 17th and 18th centuries. Generally elephant or walrus ivory was used. Since the pieces were limited in size the portraits tended to be small, yet they could still be monumental in form. Gaspar van der Hagen was born in the Netherlands but later worked in London, in the workshop of Michael Rysbrack.",
