London: HMSO, 1964.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>GODWIN, Edward William, F.S.A. (1833-1886)</b> \n \nSketch-book containing studies of costume from works by Vecellio, Jost Amman and others and designs for stage settings for Mrs. Bancroft's production of Shakespeare's <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, first performed at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London, 17 April 1875, with Ellen Terry as Portia.  Also studies of costume etc. copied from manuscripts in the British Museum and from the Bayeaux Tapestry for Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i>.  On page 59 is a portrait of William Burges dated 25 June 1875.  76 pages (others missing) of metallic surfaced paper, thread-stitched in paper boards.  1875. \n<i>Inscribed by the artist inside the front cover</i> This book belongs to E. W. Godwin 34 Essex St. Strand.  <i>Inscribed throughout with notes, comments on plays, including a production of 'Macbeth' at the Lyceum Theatre, 5 October 1875, a description of some painted panels of the legend of Amor and Psyche, names and addresses etc.  Dated May to 5 October 1875. \nPen and ink and metal-point, with some water-colour. \nSize of volume</i> 15.2 x 8.3 cm.              E.236-1963\n\nGiven by Mr. Edward Godwin, son of the artist \n \n<i>Note:</i> Most of the costume studies in this sketch-book were reproduced as illustrations to an article by Godwin on 'The Costume of The Merchant of Venice' on p.74 of Vol.13 of <i>The British Architect</i>, January to June 1880, where it is stated that 'the illustrations given this week are taken from pencil sketches in my note-books, made chiefly in 1874-5, added to an tested a few weeks since'.  Other studies for the costume etc. of this play are in the sketch-book E.250-1963.  The article suggests that the costumes would be equally suitable for <i>Othello</i> and they may have been used in Mrs. Bateman's production of that play, first performed at the New Sadler's Wells Theatre, 20 September 1880.  One costume on p.17 was reproduced with others for <i>Othello</i> on a plate following p.176 of Vol.14 of <i>The British Architect</i>, July to December 1880.\"",
