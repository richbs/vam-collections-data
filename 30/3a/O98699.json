From the late 1950s, mods (nicknamed for their preference for all things modern) embraced a particular sartorial style. Mods favoured sharply-cut Italian suits and a streamlined, pared-down appearance, which was the driving force behind the new, young fashions of the early 1960s, a time when men began to express themselves more freely through the cut and colour of their clothing. From the mid-1960s many Mods began to wear more accessible and affordable casual clothing. Knitted shirts and berets were considered to give a continental appearance and shoes were often sand-coloured.",
