Since then multiple versions of the book and film have been reproduced, most recently by Tim Burton in 2010, and the character of Alice has become an almost cult like figure. It is no wonder then, that there are multiple versions of the doll available, following the success of Lewis Caroll's dream-like tale. \n\nThis version was made by Palitoy in 1972 and is sought after by collectors because of its traditional dress and ability to walk and talk. This large doll was made to coincide with the Josef Shaftel television production starring Fiona Fullerton as Alice. The doll comes with three records to play in the back of the doll, all narrated by Fiona, telling the story and singing songs from the film. She is dressed in the traditional light blue frock with long blonde hair, white tights and apron and black shoes.",
