Thus Duvernay introduced London to the cachucha, rather than Fanny Elssler, had created the role in Paris in June 1836, and whose interpretation of the dance was to become legendary.  Duvernay was a extremely popular with London audiences, including Princess Victoria, later Queen Victoria, and was Thackary's favourite dancer.  \nThe series \"Fair Favourites\" comprised 5 prints of which 4 were actresses and only No. 5, Duvernay, depicted a dancer.  \nThe word \"Proof\", formally printed on many English prints, related to a peculiarly English convention among printmakers.   It did not mean a test pull of the print; because lithographs could be issued in such large editions it was felt that they were of little worth, compared to engravings, so the practice developed of titling some of the early pulls as \"Proof\" and selling them at a premium.   The marking was no indication of quality, as later prints from the same stone could be as fine, if not finer.  \nThe print came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
