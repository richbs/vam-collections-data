He is best known for his activity as a sculptor, architect and set designer. \n\nThis painting, which decorates the inside lid of a harpsichord, was attributed to the Neapolitan artist Domenico Antonio Vaccaro by Nicola Spinosa (1984). The scene represents the Judgement of Midas who had to choose during a musical context the winner between Pan and Apollo. Midas stands between Apollo wrapped into a red tunic and goat-legged Pan on the right at whom he is pointing. Midas has ass\u2019s ears sprouting from the top of his head.",

Panel \n723/4 X 34 (187 X 86) \n444-1887 (F. & W.) \n \nThe subject is well suited for the decoration of a musical instrument. The mountain god Tmolus was asked to decide between Pan -and Apollo in a musical contest on the pipes and the lyre. After hearing the contestants play, he turned round to face Apollo and asked Pan to concede defeat. Midas, king ofPhrygia, objected to the decision as being unjust and decided himself in favour of Pan. Apollo could hardly permit such foolish ears to retain their human shape and so he chan.ged them into those of an ass. Midas is here shown standing between the two contestants, pointing at Pan, and already he has ass's ears. Tmolus, with an oak wreath round his head, is still gazing at Apollo. \nThe Judgement of Midas was a popular theme in rsth and 17th century painting (A. Pigler, Barockthemem, ii, 1956, pp. 170-73). 444-1887 is generally similar to the compositions that include the white-bearded Tmolus, such as that by Schiavone at Hampton Court, but it is not closely related to any of the better known versions. To judge from the style, it may be tentatively placed in northern Italy, perhaps Venice, in the period of Sebastiano Ricci (1660-1734). It was in Venetian painting, also, that this subject was particularly popular; there are at least five versions by Sebastiano Ricci himself (some listed in J. Byam Shaw, Paintings by Old Masters at Christ Church Oxford, 1968, p. 81, no. 122, pl. 92, and S. and M. Ricci in America, exhibition, Memphis, Tennessee, 1965-66, no. 15, repr.; others in the collections of Sir W. Worsley, Bt, and G. Locatelli, Pordenone). Anthony M. Clark (written communication, 1972) has suggested an attribution to Sebastiano Conca (who worked mainly in Rome) and a date c. 1685, but this is not entirely convincing, particularly as far as the landscape is concerned. \nProo, Bought for \u00a330 in 1887. \nExh.

Spinosa (1984) who situated its execution during Vaccaro's early career, between 1698 and 1708, when he also produced a series of altarpieces for various Neapolitan churches and others works displaying mythological scenes. \nThe present subject matter derives from Ovid's Metamorphosis (XI). Apollo and Pan, during a musical context, asked Midas, King of Pessinus, a city of Phrygia, to choose the winner and Midas chose Pan. Furious, Apollo gave Midas ass's ears as a proof of his ignorance. The subject matter, a mythological musical context, echoes the musical function of the piece it is painted on.\nVaccaro represented the god Apollo wrapped into a red tunic, his head surrounded by a halo of light, which alludes to his being also the god of the sun. Pan the satyr is leaning against a rock with putti playing in his back while Midas stands in between pointing at Midas. \nThe whole picture displays rococo stylistic features, smoothened by the use of a Baroque palette characterised by an intense use of light and shade that creates interesting contrasts. In particular, the cool colouring of the whole is enlivened by the red tunic and the pink hues on the figures' flesh. This manner is reminiscent of the art of Giacomo del Po (1652-1726), whom Vaccaro may have followed after he preliminary trained with Solimena.",

            "historical_context_note": "During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Italy, artists were often commissioned to create painted wooden furnishings for the domestic interior, especially for the <i>camera</i> (bedchamber) of wealthy private palaces. Such works were generally commissioned to celebrate a new marriage or the birth of a child and could include a <i>lettiera</i> (bed), <i>spalliera</i> or <i>cornicioni</i> (a painted frieze), a <i>cassapanca</i> (bench-chest) and a set of <i>cassone</i> (marriage chests) among other objects and furnishings. The decoration often included subjects associated with fertility, maternity, childbirth, marriage and fidelity and could include references to the patrons through inclusion of their coat of arms and heraldic colours, or of their personal motto or device. This trend extended well into the 17th and the 18th centuries and produced lavish ornamented pieces that rivalled in richness and beauty.",
