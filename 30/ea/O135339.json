By 1856, ever-widening skirts meant the weight of these petticoats became very uncomfortable. Various designs attempted to solve this problem.\n\nThe 'artificial' or 'cage' crinoline appeared in 1857 as a welcome and practical solution. It was made of spring steel hoops that increased in diameter towards the bottom and were connected with tapes. There was a huge variety of different crinoline styles on the market.\n\nAlthough crinolines were light, women often found them cumbersome and restrictive. Devices were invented to make sitting down easy.  Sometimes the hoops even had hinges to make it easier for women to go through doorways and up stairs.",
