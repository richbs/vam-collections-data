The yellow flower heads have little spikes extending from them, the left  two of which have red tufted ends.  The leaves and stems are modelled with thin black hatching over pale green and  turquoise-green washed grounds. The spray is  painted against a plain beige-coloured paper ground with a simple frame of collaged strips of green paper, matching the opposite page, (IS.48:7/A-1956). The painting is mounted on a plain ivory coloured border with buff strips of paper at the margins, which also match the opposite page. A strip of beige, woven textile has been stuck along the right hand side to act as a gutter for the album binding. The edges of the page have been gilded.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
