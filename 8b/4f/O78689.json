This splendid portrait was probably commissioned by the knight shown in the picture, Archibald William Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton and 1st Earl of Winton (1812-1861). He is dressed here as `Lord of the Tournament.'\n\nSubjects Depicted\nBy the 1830s tales of romance and chivalry inspired an interest in the costume and events of the Middle Ages. This painting shows Lord Eglinton dressed in gold armour at the `Eglinton Tournament', which he hosted on his Scottish estate in 1839. Eglinton and his guests dressed themselves in Medieval-style costumes, and took part in processions and competitions. The Earl had been fired with enthusiasm for the Gothic revival by reading Sir Walter Scott's novels of chivalry. Unfortunately it rained heavily and continuously on the Knights and Peers of the Realm in full armour with fully dressed horses. What the picture also illustrates is an early Victorian reconstruction of what antiquarians believed a Medieval knight should look like.\n\nPeople\nHenry Corbould (1815-1905) was mainly known as a watercolourist; his subjects included literature, mainly Chaucer, Spenser and Shakespeare.  Prince Albert appointed him `Instructor of Historical Painting' to the Royal Family in 1851.",

Studied at Sass's art school and RA Schools (won medals at the Society of Arts 1834-56). Exhibited 17 works at the RA between 1835 and 1845, and 1870 and 1874, one at the BI 1846, and 11 (including sculptures and watercolours); at the SBA 1835-42. Principally a watercolourist, exhibiting about 250 works in a long career, his subjects included literature, mainly Chaucer, Spenser and Shakespeare, the Bible, and genre. Patronised by Prince Albert and appointed 'Instructor of Historical Painting' to the Royal family 1851. Designed many illustrations for books; several watercolours and drawings are in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1864, p98, 1905, p286 (obit) \n\n<b>At Eglinton</b> \nP5-1981 Neg HF814 \nPanel, 53.3 x 42.5 cm (21 x 16\u00be ins) \nPurchased 1981 \n\nPurchased as a portrait of Archibald William Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton and 1st Earl of Winton, dressed as Lord of the Tournament, but probably the work exhibited at the RA with the title 'At Eglinton' and the following quotation in the catalogue: \n\nA Knight there was, and that a worthy man, \nThat fro the time that he firste began \nTo riden out, he loved chivalric, \nTrouthe and honour, freedom and curtesie. \n\nThe lines are from Chancer's 'The Knight's Tale', one of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. That story concerns a tournament, and is surely quoted because of the famous Eglinton Tournament organised by the earl in 1839, a remarkable event which is described by Anstruther (see Lit: below). The DNB describes the earl as 'a high-minded nobleman and a thorough sportsman, with frank and genial manners, and no particular ability'. He was born in 1812, and died 1861. The painting was not noticed by the <i>Art Union</i> or <i>Athenaeum</i> critics.\n \nThe work was purchased in 1981 for its valuable depiction of Eglinton armour, an important phenomenon of the Gothic Revival. Oil paintings are now only acquired by the museum if they relate to some aspect of the decorative arts. \n\nPROV: Purchased from the Christopher Wood Gallery 1981\n \nEXH: ?RA 1842 (269); <i>William Morris and the Middle Ages</i> Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, 1984 (repr in cat, 10) \n\nLIT: E H Corbould <i>The Tournament at Eglinton Castle</i> 1840; I Anstruther <i>The Knight and the Umbrella: An Account of the Eglinton Tournament</i>1839 1963; <i>Van Dyck in Check Trousers</i> SNPG exhibition catalogue 1978,\npp105-14\"\nCourbould, E.
