The text is as follows: The goddess Brizo Inscribed in ink (by the elder or younger Jonathan Richardson) \u2018h. 37\u2019 Pen and ink and wash heightened with white; circular 8 \u00bd (216) diameter 8091.1 PROVENANCE Padre Resta; lord Somers (the inscription refers to a ms. In the British Museum which is a transcript of Resta\u2019s notes on the drawings first in his and then in Lord Somer\u2019s collection; see Popham, Resta; also Lugt 2981 and Lugt, Supplement, p. 419); bought 1876 LITERATURE J. A. Gere, Taddeo Zuccaro. His development studied in his drawings, 1969, p. 116 and p. 169, no. 114 Under the item h. 37 in the copy of Resta\u2019s commentary the drawing is attributed to Taddeo Zuccaro and rightly with the Farnese Palace at Caprarola, where the correspondiong picture is in the Sala di Aurora. The name of the goddess is also given, but illegibly, and Resta describes her as \u2018Dea Vaticina\u2019. Annibale Caro was the author of the iconographical plan of the decorations, and his instructions to Taddeo Zuccaro are quoted in extenso in Vasari\u2019s life of the latter (Milanesi\u2019s edition, 7, pp. 126-27). The goddess in the tondo is described as \u2018Brinto Dea de Vaticinij &amp; interpretante de sogni\u2019, and Caro wishes her to be represented as a Sybil seated at the foot of an elm tree. Her name is really Brizo and she was a prophetic goddess on the island of Delos, who sent dreams to men and revealed their meaning. The paintings were probably designed by Taddeo Zuccaro, but mostly carried out by Federico after Taddeo\u2019s death. Gere ascribes our drawing and its companion (no. 419) to Federico, rather than Taddeo. There was another copy of the tondo showing Brizo in the collection of tha later Mr John Brophy, London. See also the entry under no. 419",
