Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nThe fine veining and slight irregularity of a natural leaf are here captured in miniature in this asymmetrical ring.\n\nJesus Elisabeth Kodr\u00e9 Defner was born in Innsbruck in 1931 and studied at the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna. Nature is often an influence in her work.",
