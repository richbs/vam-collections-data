The soft, responsive quality of chalk allowed him rapidly to lay in areas of dark and light tone, then to smudge areas for an atmospheric effect either with a \u2018stump\u2019 (a tightly-rolled tool of paper with a rounded end) or with his fingers.",

Black chalk, heightened with white.  671\n<i>Width,</i> 14 8/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>10 11/12 <i>inches.</i>'\nJohn Hayes, <u>The Drawings of Thomas Gainsborough</u> (London, 1970), cat. 661, p. 260.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n<b>661 Wooded Landscape with Country Cart</b>\nPlate 195\nVictoria and Albert Museum, London (Dyce 671) \n\nBlack chalk and stump and white chalk on buff paper. 11 1/8 x 14 15/16 (283 x 379) \n\nA country cart drawn by two horses, with a figure in the cart, and a dog following behind, travelling along a country road in the foreground centre; a horse reclining by the side of the road in the foreground right; a building amongst trees in the distance centre, with hills beyond. \n\nPROVENANCE: Rev. Alexander Dyce, who bequeathed it to the South Kensington Museum 1869. \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY: <i>Dyce Collection Catalogue</i>, London, 1874, pp.21 and 99; Woodall 189, p. 70 and repr. pl. 91. \n\nThe treatment of the foliage, the black chalk and stumpwork generally, and the highly rhythmical composition are closely related to the landscape with country waggon in the Morgan Library (Cat. No. 660). Also mentioned on p. 99. \n\n\n[p. 99 reference: ''Another notable collector buying at this period was the Rev. Alexander Dyce (1798-1869), the Shakespearean scholar, who formed a collection of drawings of all schools, the English being the best, which he bequeathed to the South Kensington (now the Victoria and Albert) Museum. Twenty-seven of his drawings were ascribed to Gainsborough, not all correctly, however, though the group included the superb seated housemaid (pl. 201) and the Van Gogh-like landscape with a country cart (pl. 195).'] ",
