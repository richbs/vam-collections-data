Sir Henry Pope, founder of Trinity College, Oxford, remodelled the chapel after he bought the house around 1547. His grandson, Sir Thomas Pope-Blount inherited Tyttenhanger in 1697, and it is likely he commissioned the set. This form of communion cup and cover was first employed by the Huguenot goldsmith John Chartier in 1699, only with the addition of \"cut-card\" work (Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford). The grand scale yet simple style is rare in English church silver of this period and was confined to a small circle of wealthy clergy and families. The set is in exceptionally good condition; the gilding is original and the engraving clear. Its lack of wear reflects how private plate was not used as extensively as that in parish churches. This part communion set, without a flagon, is in almost perfect condition having been kept in its original morocco covered boxes.",

They include pieces made for use in private chapels, such as plate and shrines, as well as personal objects like reliquaries and jewels used in private devotions. It was mainly the great houses, like Chatsworth, Hatfield and Arundel Castle, that had a private chapel. They held services for the family, their guests and servants and had their own altar plate. Many of the objects made for private chapels were similar to those made for parish churches. \n\nJewelled religious objects are used as an aid to prayer and were found in a much wider social context. Reliquary pendants act as a focus for devotion through the relics or images of saints they contain, while the rosary provides a discipline and structure for private prayer. Such pieces are often treasured personal possessions, passed down through generations.",
