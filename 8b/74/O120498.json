It is popularly known as the Turkish Sultana's Pavilion. The pavilion is attached to a pool and was probably used as a place for relaxation.\n\nThe structure is decorated all over with intricate carving and has often been described as a jewel casket. This view of one side of it gives a good indication of the variety of different designs that cover the building. \n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",
