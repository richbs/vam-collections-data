This was one of the Museum's early purchases, bought from the Great Exhibition in 1851for \u00a37 and catalogued as 'English, modern'.\n\nHistorical significance: The candelabrum perfectly reflects Pugin's policy of being inspired by, but not copying, medieval art. The design is based on late Gothic brass produced in centres like Nuremberg in  Germany and Dinant in Belgium, which Pugin had visited on his trips to Europe. The lobed foot and twisted stem hark back to ecclesiastical metalwork of the fifteenth century but the spray of branches set with glass beads is a Pugin invention.",
