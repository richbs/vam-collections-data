He acted at the Lyceum in his youth, using the name Bernard Gould, and made many drawings of Irving, some which appeared in the theatre's souvenir programmes. His work has provided both a record of costumes and scenery and of the dramatic effect of Irving's performances.\n\nThe image shows Henry Irving (1838-1905) as King Charles in Act I of Charles I by William Gorman Wills (1828-1891). The inspiration for both the text and the setting of the play was the painting An Episode from the Happier Days of Charles I  by Frederick Goodall (1822-1904). Irving first played the role in 1872.",
