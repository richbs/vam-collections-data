He trained at the Birmingham School of Art and was introduced to dry-point etching early in his career by Francis Dodd. During World War One he served as an artist for the Ministry of Information making drawings of the 'London Front'. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1921, and a fellow of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1923. He later became a Royal Academician.\n\nMalcolm C. Salaman included 'Low Tide, La Rochelle', as part of the 'Modern Masters of Etching' series (London 1928), as a fine example of the artist's work and described it as Rushbury having 'let himself go with thorough enjoyment. All we see is the bright glow of sun-light, the fishing craft against the quayside are lowered to the wet sandy bed of the harbour, and a small ferry steamer is left high and dry. The spacious quay, aligned on two sides with houses of diverse character...is peopled with persons busily engaged and loafers taking the sun...and here and there a horse and cart suggest activity...the white patches of sunlight, cleverly broken, are used most effectively in this design.\"",
