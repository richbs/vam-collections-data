The opened top has a circular compartment at each (lobed) corner, defined by shallow mouldings. In addition there is an oval recess at each player's right hand, near the front edge, set within a shallower long-octoganal recess. The octagons are very crudely cut, and clearly additions; they are set within scribed outlines for wider ovals, which was presumably an earlier idea for the shape of this alteration. The ovals themselves may also be added, but they are better-finished and have more professional polished surface. \nThe mahogany of the opened-out top surface is very poor, and apparently stained. The surface is partly covered in hatch-marks as though from a toothing-plane, so this was probably baize-lined originally.",
