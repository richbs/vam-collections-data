He subsequently founded his own independent studio in 1995 as 'Marcel Wonders', and later 'Marcel Wanders'. In 1995, Droog decided to initiate new work by liaising with the Delft University to experiment with new materials on the Dry Tech I and II projects and later the Dry Bathing collection of bathroom products. Droog then began work on its first collaborative project with a private sector partner in 1997 by developing a collection of ceramics with Rosenthal, the German porcelain manufacturer.\n\nThis witty vase was developed by Marcel Wanders for Droog Design as part of an experimental project with Rosenthal, the German porcelain manufacturer. to create the vase's bulbous form, Wanders stuffed a latex condom with hard-boiled eggs and then cast the resulting shape in white porcelain. In doing so, he imbued the traditional medium with humour and an organic sensibility not normally associated with it. \n\nMoooi designs and produces their modern lighting and contemporary furniture in the Netherlands: the Dutch word for 'beautiful' is 'mooi'.",
