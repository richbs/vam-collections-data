            "public_access_description": "Peter Gee joined the British Army as a graphic designer and typographer at the age of eighteen and later attended the Central Saint Martin's School of Art in London where he studied under Victor Pasmore, Harry Thubron and Sir Herbert Read. During the 1950s he travelled in Paris. In 1963 Gee left Britain for the USA where he worked as a graphic designer, teacher and colour consultant. His list of clients attest to the regard American corporations and institutions had for his output. He lived in the USA until his death in 2005.\n\nPeter Gee's systematic approach to graphic design stems from his Bauhaus-inspired studies in Britain. He infuses economical forms with screen-printed 'sensual' colour fields that recall the late work of Henri Matisse. Gee is also noticeably influenced by Op Art and by Pop artists Andy Warhol and Richard Hamilton in subject matter, technique and colour.",
