The closed bodice has set-in elbow-length sleeves.  It is trimmed with a double-gathered ruching of green silk around the neck and lower edge of sleeve.  The bodice is lined with linen.  Three lines of green silk braid follow the centre back of the bodice from neck to waist.  The open skirt, made of 4 panels of silk, has curved front edges and is lined with green taffeta at the back hem.  Two thread loops at the inside of the back waist attach to two buttons on the outside at the waist to create the polonaise effect.\n\nThe gown has been remade, probably from a sack back.  It has been altered for fancy dress in the late 19th century when the green silk ribbon rosettes, bows and stomacher of pink silk, bobbin lace and green ribbon was added.",

Using buttons and loops, the skirt of the gown was draped up to create a swathed effect at the back. This gown is a painted silk, made in China specifically for export to Europe. It was probably made in the 1760s. It was remade into a polonaise in the 1770s, and then altered considerably in the late 19th century for fancy dress. The green silk trim and rosettes seen here are 19th century additions.",
