The pair of canisters would hold black, fermented tea leaves and green, unfermented tea leaves, while the larger bowl would hold sugar. All the vessels have tightly-fitting covers to prevent moisture spoiling the contents. This set would probably have been kept together in a lockable wooden container.\n\nHistory\nTea canisters are usually known today as tea 'caddies'. The word 'caddy' came into common usage in Britain in the late 18th century, and is probably a derivative of the Malay word for a measure of weight (kati) equivalent to about half a kilogram.\n\nUse\nAs tea was prepared at the table by the hostess in the 18th century, tea vessels and utensils were usually of a material and decoration that reflected the social and economic status of the owner. This set is particularly unusual in being made of silver gilt. It is decorated in the most fashionable style. The maker of this set, Samuel Taylor (active from 1744), specialised in tea canisters and sugar bowls.",
