In addition to floral motifs, Arts and Crafts textiles such as this one made use of figures. The main impetus for using motifs like these, as well as birds and animals, came from the rise in popularity of book illustration, particularly those done for children's books.\n\nHerbert Horne was a writer, architect, designer and member of the Century Guild. He was apprenticed to Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo in 1883 and the two were business partners from 1885 to 1890. The Century Guild was established in 1883 by A. H. Mackmurdo and Selwyn Image with several others, including Horne. The Guild designed decorative arts of various types including textiles and upholstered furniture which were manufactured for it by outside firms, including Simpson & Godlee, a textile printing company. Much of this work was commissioned and sold through the Bond Street shop of Wilkinson & Sons.",
