The Abruzzi is a remote and mountainous area of central Italy, and traditional jewellery survived there longer than in many other parts of the country.  It was formerly part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and the jewellery is often different from that found elsewhere in northern and central Italy.  \n\nAll Italian women wore earrings.  They were usually made of thin gold, or gilt metal, but in the Abruzzi all kinds of jewellery were often made of heavy silver.  This earring is set with white pastes, imitating the diamonds worn with aristocratic jewellery.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
