            "public_access_description": "Charlie Phillips moved to London from Jamaica in 1956 and began to document life in his local community, taking photographs with a Kodak Brownie camera he had been given by a black American serviceman. His photographs of people and places associated with Notting Hill depict both significant and everyday moments in the area\u2019s history, particularly in relation to its growing black population. The local landmark of the \u2018Pisshouse Pub\u2019 on the corner of Blenheim Crescent and Portobello Road is a frequent setting in this visual history. At a time of racial hostility in Britain, Phillips created a record of multicultural community.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Charlie Phillips as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
