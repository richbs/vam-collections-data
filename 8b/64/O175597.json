The archangel is holding a small shield in his left hand and in his right a lance with which he strikes the dragon at his feet.\n\nThe material is pipeclay, which is a fine white clay also used to make tobacco pipes and pottery. Conveniently situated on a major trading route, Siegburg was a centre of ceramic production with well-organised workshops and kilns in which also  pipe-clay figures were fired.\n\nThis figure was cast from a two-part mould and is characteristic of the small mass-produced images that, like woodcuts, were cheaply available by 1500. Conveniently situated on a major trading route, Siegburg was a centre of ceramic production with well-organised workshops and kilns in which pipe-clay figures were also fired.\n\nThe archangel Michael is the first of the angels. He is usually represented in armour with a sword and standing over or fighting with a dragon or he is shown with scales. God sent him to cast out Lucifer and he is also regarded as the angel of the Resurrection. He would receive the souls of the dead to weigh them in his balance.",
