This type is entirely functional; the only decoration are the applied medallions, which in no way lessen its practicality.\n\nRetailers & Traders\nGiven the enormous size of the trade, competition between the Dutch shippers of Rhineland stoneware in the 16th and 17th centuries must have been fierce. Advertising was one way to become well known among the buying public and the the anonymous stoneware potters of Frechen were happy to co-operate by applying the name or 'Hausmark' (merchant's mark) of any major client. So many versions of the Jan Allers medallion exist that we may guess at a very extensive trade in the 1580-1620 period. It is thought that his son also used a similar mark. \n\nLater in the 17th century various factors combined to undermine this lucrative trade. The black glass wine bottle was invented in the middle of the century and the four Dutch Wars, which lasted intermittently from 1652 to 1684, interrupted trade between Holland and England. Finally, once John Dwight, founder of the Fulham Pottery in London, obtained his patent to manufacture stoneware bottles in 1672, native products effectively replaced the imported German versions. After the 1660s major shippers of stoneware into London such as Pieter van den Ancker and Jan op de Kamp found their trade had evaporated. Britain's aim to become self-sufficient was finally being realised.",
