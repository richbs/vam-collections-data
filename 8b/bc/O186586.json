E.461-1962\n\nThe Republic cocks a snook at Napoleon III, who is standing in chains. Fungi in the form of Veuillot (see pl. 27) and Eug\u00e8ne Schneider sprout from Napoleon's enormous nose, on which are scribbled caricatures of the Imperial family. On polling day a proclamation arrived from the former Emperor. He declared that he had been 'betrayed by fortune' and claimed to be the only legitimate representative of France. His pathetic attempt to regain power had no more success than this caricature forecast; only a handful of his supporters were returned and most of these by faithful Corsicans.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
