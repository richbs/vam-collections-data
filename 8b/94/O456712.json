            "physical_description": "Woman's dress (known as a <i>cheongsam</i> in Cantonese or a <i>qipao</i> in Mandarin) made from blue and white silk cr\u00eape with an all-over pattern of open flowerheads. The material is transparent. It closes all the way down the side and has a stand-up collar. The long sleeves are cut all in one with the main body of the garment and there is no seam across the top of the shoulders. The sleeves have been lengthened by inserting a band of the cr\u00eape just above cuff level.\nThe neckband and the collarbone are closed with fastenings in the shape of paired flower patterns with knots that go throught the loops . The rest of the fastenings down the side are formed into spiral shapes. All the fastenings are made from blue satin and each button is reinforced with an extra piece of cr\u00eape sewn at the back. There are also press-stud reinforcements.\nThe dress is edged with a line of the same blue satin as the buttons, cut on the bias, and this is doubled at the base of the neck.\n\nRight side fastening with ten loop and knot buttons and one press stud. The <i>huaniu</i> (loop buttons) at the collar are in flower shape, those on the side are in spiral shape. Small standing collar. Straight cut. Short slit at sides. 3/4 length (below the knees). No lining. Blue and grey synthetic crepe with supplementary warp patterns (scattered flowerhead designs) Hong Kong, 1930-1940\n<i>Huaniu</i>, traditionally knotted and decorated buttons and loops, were stitched to fasten the collar and lapel of the <i>qipao</i>. They were designed to match the pattern of the fabric as well as the colour of the braided trim, of the collar, cuff, and hem of the qipao. Common huaniu patterns included flowers, insects and auspicious symbols. cf: Evolution & revolution, Chinese dress 1700s-1990s. Powerhouse Museum.p.61",
