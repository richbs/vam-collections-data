            "public_access_description": "Jean Ducrollay, the maker of this box, was one of the most esteemed gold box makers in Paris. Born in 1709, he was apprenticed to Jean Drais and became a master in 1734. He is recorded in the royal inventories as making boxes for the French court of Louis XV, one of which was presented to the Ambassador of the Holy Roman Empire in 1757. An album containing designs from Ducrollay's workshop is now in the collection of the V&A (museum no. E.897-1988).\n\nThis box was designed for two different flavours of snuff (powdered tobacco). It opens both at the cover and the base. The surface is decorated with a pattern of ribbons on a reeded ground, produced by engine-turning. Around 1750, the use of a machine to allow patterns to be engraved on a gold ground (engine-turning) became widespread. Engine-turning can be carried out in straight or curved lines, allowing a variety of patterns to be produced, using straight-line or circular machines. Although the decoration is carried out with a machine, great skill is required from the operator to ensure that pieces are properly aligned and that an equal amount of pressure is applied.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
