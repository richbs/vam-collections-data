The keys that operated these locks were often richly decorated and skilfully made.  The works were carefully cut with a fret-saw, the barrel of the key was engraved and usually cut with a series of baluster mouldings.  The bow was pierced with delicate scrollwork and the crest or monogram of the owner.  English locksmiths were particularly skilled at this type of work in the latter part of the 17th century.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis key is pierced with the monogram of  William III (reigned 1689-1702) beneath a royal crown.  A key of this quality would have been made either for the Kings' private apartments or to give access to the gates of royal parks.\n\nPeople\nThis key is clearly the work of a particularly skilled craftsman.  The royal locksmiths to William III were the Bickford family. They are known to have supplied locks and keys to Hampton Court Palace. This magnificent key is very probably from their workshop.",
