The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe type of pattern repeat in this silk was known as a point repeat, in which the pattern appeared in mirror image to either side of a central axis. It gave quite a formal effect to the pattern, in which balance was very important, but the overall effect could be lightened with delicate drawing of the individual motifs. Here the leaf sprigs are overlaid as if built up in a natural arrangement of  real plant life.",
