Difficult to categorise, he is most frequently grouped with the Expressionists, who favoured subjectivity and emotional response as the subject of their work, rather than objective reality. Most of Klee's early work took the form of etching or drawing, and although he became a formidible painter and colourist, especially after a trip to Tunisia in 1914, line always remained a significant element in his work. He was a great experimentalist, and his use of celluloid, a relatively soft material, as the printing plate for this drypoint, allowed him to create a much more fluid line than a more conventional one made of copper or zinc would have.",
