This set of 143 drawings is the most extensive series known of the famous pillared hall ('mandapa') to the east of the Great temple, popularly known as Tirumala Nayak's choultry.  These drawings provided detailed architectural descriptions of the pillars, showing various elevations, and betray the hand of an artist trained in the conventions of Dravidian architecture.  Some of the drawings relate to, and are on the same scale as, a series of bronze models in the Victoria & Albert Museum (Guy 1990), and in the Ashmolean Museum (Harle and Topsfield, 1987 no. 68).  The drawings,  and the bronze replicas which show every evidence of having been modelled on the basis of these drawings, are in all probability those which Adam Blackader, resident in Madura in the 1780s, described in a letter of 1789 to his friend Sir Joseph Banks.  Blackader records that he spent three years preparing these drawings and models.  He had eighteen models made, selected to show the various types of  richly-carved pillars.  'These', he wrote, 'were not taken regularly from one end of the choultry but different pillars selected from the whole giving all the principal varieties which occurred in the carvings'.  These drawings are very similar to a set prepared at Madura under the supervision of Colin Mackenzie and now in the India Office Library (WD1063/1-57;  M. Archer, 1969b, vol. II, pp. 531-2).",
