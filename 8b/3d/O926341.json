Brown\u2019s drawings are similar in presentation to those of the renowned botanical artist Georg Dionysius Ehret (1708-70), under whom he may have studied.\n\nWhen Brown made this naturalistic study of wintersweet, the species was very new to Britain. It arrived from Japan in 1766, an event noted in the Botanical Magazine of that year. This explains its other name, Japanese allspice, although the plant is native to China.",
