The front legs and four stretchers are bobbin turned. A carved footrest has been added.\n\nConstruction\nOf joined construction. The single-piece back uprights are angled inwards and are raked above the seat. The top rail and lower back rail are tenoned into the back uprights, forming a frame in which a single back panel is held. The back panel, top and bottom rails are shallow-carved in the solid, and the panel has a wide chamfer on the reverse. The seat is a single oak panel held in grooves cut into the four seat rails; the front and side rails are moulded on both inner and outer upper faces, while the back seat rail is moulded only on its forward edge. The footrest is a single board with chip-carved ornament, supported on two carved oak brackets screwed to the front legs at a square 'knee'. The carved arms sit on the front legs, and are half-lapped to the rear uprights. Along the upper face of the arms are traces of punched (flowerhead) ornament. Through both hand rests a lateral hole has been drilled for a restraining bar (missing). With traces of a dark varnish.",
