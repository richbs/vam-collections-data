The lack of a handle on the tea bowl would have enhanced its appeal as something from the exotic East.\n\nJingdezhen is a town in central southern China, where all the fine blue and white porcelain exported to Europe was produced. At roughly the time this bowl and saucer were made, the Jesuit priest P\u00e8re d'Entrecolles spent much time there gathering first-hand information on the process of porcelain manufacture. His long letters describing in minute detail the activities in Jingdezhen had enormous impact on the development of ceramics in Europe.\n\nIn the late 17th century, trade between Europe and China was conducted only sporadically. Ships tried their luck at Amoy (Xiamen) or Canton (Guangzhou), and porcelain was a major traded item. European merchants carried engravings and sample tablewares to give to Chinese artisans to copy, but they also bought ready-made ceramics intended for the European market.",
