This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread. According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass. The bowls of silver chalices are usually gilded inside, to emphasize the precious nature of their contents and to protect the metal.\n\nThe inscription on the knop, CALICEM SALVTARIS ACCIPIAM (I will receive the chalice of salvation) reminds the faithful of the salvation of mankind through Christ's death. This is supported further by the embossed (hammered) scenes on the foot of the Flagellation of Christ, his Crucifixion and the Instruments of the Passion (the tools associated with his Crucifixion which were potent and much-used Christian symbols in Catholic art). Alternating with these scenes are three enamel plaques. The depiction of a sun in splendour symbolises the Catalan family of Sola (meaning 'sun'), who either owned the chalice or donated it to a church. Another plaque depicts St. Michael, possibly the patron saint associated with the family or church. The third, a kneeling monk, may have represented a particular religious order.",
