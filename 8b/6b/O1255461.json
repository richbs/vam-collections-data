It is a preparatory study for one of the figures in Rossetti's watercolour The Borgia Family (Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle), of which the V&A has a later version. The composition was originally planned as an illustration of the  lines from Shakespeare's Richard III: \u2018To caper nimbly in a  lady's chamber / to the lascivious pleasing of a lute\u2019, but, for the watercolour, Rossetti adapted the subject. \n\nThis drawing exemplifies the crisp, incisive line which Rossetti particularly valued at this time, and which he associated with artists such as D\u00fcrer.",

The head, turned to the front with the eyes looking to the right, is carefully worked; the long straight hair and the body are lightly sketches. The model was Miss Mead. (Boyce <i>Diaries</i>, p.36, 24 Feb 1860) On the back is a pencil sketch of a naked female figure, seated fronting the spectator with her head turned to the left and both hands raised to her mouth. There is no indication of the subject other than a faded inscription by G. P. Boyce, lower left, of which only the word \"Borgia\" is decipherable.'",
