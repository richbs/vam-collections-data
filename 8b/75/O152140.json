The panel is composed of a single skin, with no joins. It shows a narrow (1 cm) border outside the stamped area of decoration on three sides. On the fourth side, the panel has been cut through with a knife, interrupting the pattern.  The panel shows an intermediate stage in the creation of such leather panels, with only the background coloured in brown paint.Related Museum numbers (3703A-1856, 3704-1856, 3706-1856) show different stages of variant decoration of the same pattern. There is a narrow border (approximately  1cm wide) outside the stamped area on three sides.",

The panel shows the second stage, after the damp leather has been pressed into a mould to create relief decoration and the background has been painted brown. At later stages, other colours would be added and the highlights were often covered in metal foil, varnished to give the appearance of gold. Such leather panels were frequently used for wall decoration and are usually called 'gilt leather', although no actual gilding is involved. \n\nThe panels were made in1855 by the French firm of Jacques Michel Dulud. The firm often used historic styles which were particularly fashionable at the time.  This design of curving, scrolling branches, was based on designs of the medieval period.  The Metropolitan Museum in New York has a chair of about 1850 (inventory number 1995.164) by the French furniture maker Jeanselme, which uses exactly this pattern of leather for the upholstery, showing that wall decoration was not their only use.",
