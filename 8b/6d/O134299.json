As she describes it: 'The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is visiting each candidate city in turn to assess its potential as host of the 2012 games. Londoners are apprehensive as the IOC delegates inspect the decrepit tube.' \n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
