As well as being crucial records of the history of the V&A, and an important element within the National Art Library's visual encyclopaedia, these photographs are also significant artefacts in the history of the art of photography.\n\nThis is one of many photographs which were taken to document the construction of the 1862 International Exhibtion buildings.",
