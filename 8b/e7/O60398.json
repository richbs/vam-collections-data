            "public_access_description": "The church of San Michele in Isola is situated on the cemetery island, halfway between the Fondamenta Nove (Venice) and Murano. The church was built in 1469 with Istrian stone after a design by the architect Mauro Codussi (1140-1504). On the left hand side of the church, there is the white domed Emiliana chapel built in 1530 after a design by Guglielmo Bergamasco (?-1550). The elevation plan of the church shows a main door surmounted by a pediment and Latin inscription, and flanked by two columns. The fa\u00e7ade is decorated with Corinthian columns and low relief above the main door. On each side of the door is a full-length statue enclosed in a niche and three hemispheric windows complete the upper part of the fa\u00e7ade. A frieze with pedestals on which lays a three-dimensional stone ball separates the fa\u00e7ade from the domed roof. \n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
