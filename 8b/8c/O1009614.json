The scheme was to feature the emblems of English Kings from the Saxons onward. This design appears to refer to King Alfred, featuring a lion and the initial A. The emblem has been pricked for transfer and was used in alternate panels in the section of the corridor that remained painted in 1980. \n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
