His interest in art and design was aroused by a visit to the Great Exhibition of 1851 and he later became involved in the decoration of the Victoria and Albert Museum; he is depicted in a relief panel on the pediment of the Museum's Lecture Theatre. At the end of 1864, he was appointed Architectural Sculptor, one of three new posts for artist-craftsmen at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy School of Art and Industry in Bombay. This undated picture shows bales of cotton being loaded on to boats at Salkhia near Calcutta in Bengal. One of the bales being carried aboard has the name 'KIPLING' inscribed on it.",
