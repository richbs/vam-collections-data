Its unusual colouring gives it a unique and special look. The turquoise material has cut velvet motifs scattered across it, with the Chinese character for 'long life' matched across the front opening.\nThe garment is not traditionally cut or tailored. The style of neckline on this jacket is sometimes perceived as being especially Chinese. Historic Chinese garments, however, do not invariably show this feature. It seems to have come into vogue in the years either side of 1900, perhaps reviving a much earlier style.",
