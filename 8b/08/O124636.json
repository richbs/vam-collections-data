His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nFrancesca da Rimini, a symphonic fantasy by Tchaikovsky (1877), was first performed by Col. W. de Basil\u2019s Ballets Russes at the Royal Opera House, London, on 15 July 1937.   Choreographed by David Lichine (1910-1972), the role of Francesca was created for Lubov Tchernicheva (1890-1976), who had joined the Ballet Russes from the Maryinksy Imperial Russian Ballet in 1911.   Messel\u2019s costume and set designs were well received by critics, and were his first designs for a full length ballet production.\n\nFrancesca da Rimini is based on a character from Dante Aligheri\u2019s The Divine Comedy (written between 1308 and 1321).  Appropriately, Messel\u2019s costumes and sets were inspired by early Italian Renaissance painting.  The gate is set at an angle to create the illusion of space on the stage.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed by Col. W. de Basil\u2019s Ballets Russes at the Royal Opera House on 15 July 1937.  It was choreographed by David Lichine and featuring Lubov Tchernicheva as Francesca, Paul Petroff as Paolo, and Marc Platoff as Malatesta.  Also performed at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, 24 October 1937.  The costumes were made from Messel\u2019s designs by Barbara Karinska, and the set designs were realised by Prince Schervachidze. \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: These designs represent Messel's first designs for a full ballet production.",
