Samson began in the1830s, making copies of ceramics in museums and private collections, and replacement pieces for dinner services and sets.  He established his factory in Paris in 1845 producing pieces inspired by and copied from the work of famous factories including Chinese export porcelain, Meissen, S\u00e8vres, Chelsea , Derby and all the major factories of England, France and Germany, as well as tin-glazed earthenware or faience. He claimed to mark all pieces with his own double 'S' mark as well as the mark of the original piece, the base of this having the Crown Derby mark, but in many cases his own mark is missing.\n\nMrs Ford is one of the characters in Shakespeare's play The Merry Wives of Windsor who set out to deceive Sir John Falstaff and during the play dress him as a woman and hide him in a trunk.",
