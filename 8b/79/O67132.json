Soumak: wool Z2S; 9 colours: red, yellow, light yellow, green, dark blue, blue, pink, dark brown, very light brown; soumak thread over 4 warp threads and back under 2.\n\nSIDE FINISH: returned weft.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: knotted fringe, 5 rows (maximum) of knots with loose threads beyond; maximum total length is 7\" (18 cms).  Upper: as above but with a max. length of 9\" (23 cms).\n\nDESIGN: Field: red ground with one row of three large medallions, the outer dark blue, the inner, green.  The lower two contain a blue cross within a pink octagon; the upper medallion has a red octagon filled with small, variously coloured boteh.  A pair of large yellow octagons are beneath each medallion with a smaller pair above the highest.  Along the sides of the field are six pairs of inward-facing, pointed, dark brown objects; along the lower end is a band of 11 rosettes with other rosettes together with small stylised animals and birds scattered across the field.  Along all four edges is a narrow band of blue diamond heads reciprocating with the field ground; they become light blue towards and along the top.\nMain border: dark brown ground with a red zigzag edged with blue, and to each side are stepped triangles.\nInner and outer borders: upper and lower have a white ground with small rosettes paired by colour.  The sides have similar rosettes within small, white, adjacent octagons.\nOutermost border: reciprocal 'running dog' pattern in dark brown and red outlined in yellow.\n\nDate catalogued: 7.5.97",
