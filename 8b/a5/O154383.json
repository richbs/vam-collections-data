The crescent shape of the rib finial provides a visually startling impact as well as an admirably functional and stable means of supporting the implement.  Anatomical fact is combined with fantasy in the gold mounted silvery pearl that terminates the finial.  The bold and forceful handle is countered by the pierced and flowing blade, which evokes the watery environment where this creature must have been born.",
