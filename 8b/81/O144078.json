Unlike in most other European countries, women were just as likely to wear them as men.  Both sexes wore them in extravagant quantities, along the seams of jackets and trousers and in bunches at the wrist, as well as to fasten clothes.  \n\nThey were rarely sewn directly on to the clothing.  In some places people fastened them to their costume with a strip of leather, which ran through the button loops inside the garment.  More commonly they used T-shaped toggles permanently attached to the button.  \n\nThe design of this button, with a sheet metal back with scalloped edge, and open filigree front, is typical of those worn by the men of Salamanca.  Salamanca is so associated with filigree buttons that they have become the unofficial emblem of the town.  It was bought for two shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
