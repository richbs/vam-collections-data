The decorative motifs of  flowering trees, insects and colourful birds, hand painted in watercolours, was a favourite theme on such Chinese papers.\n\nPeople\nThe enduring popularity of Chinese wallpapers is proved by the existence of firms specialising in re-hanging the wallpapers, such as Messrs Cowan & Sons Ltd.\n\nTrade\nTea, raw silk and porcelain were the commodities which made up the bulk of the trade from China at the time this wallpaper was produced. The officers of the East India Company, who conducted the trade, were also allowed to profit from private trading, which included wallpaper. This is how such wallpapers would have reached Britain.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIn order for the paper to form a continuous scene around a room, the separate sheets sent from China had to be hung in sequence. The design went across the joins and some surviving unused rolls have Chinese numbers on them to indicate their position.",
