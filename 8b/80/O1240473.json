His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international  reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRing Round the Moon, a translation of Jean Anouilh's play L'Invitation au Ch\u00e2teau by Christopher Fry, was first performed at the Globe Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre), in 1950. Fry described as a 'charade with music'.  It is a poetic fantasy of love and confusion with a fairytale ending. Isabelle, an innocent ballet dancer, is hired by the heartless Hugo to attend a ball and win his twin brother Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric away from Diana, the scheming daughter of a millionaire. Diana, played by Audrey Fildes, secretly loves Hugo, but so does Isabelle. Thanks to Hugo's plotting the two women come to blows, but all ends happily when Hugo admits his feelings for Diana, while Isabelle finds true love with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric.",
