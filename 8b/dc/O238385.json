Filaretus mentions him in 1460 as one of the best contemporary sculptors. In 1461 he went to Rome, and until 1465 remained in the service of the Cardinal of Aquileia, Lodovico Scarampi Mezzarota; after the latter's death he was employed by Pope Paul II. in 1468 he was entrusted with the restoration of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius which was then in San Giovanni Laterano. After this date no mention of him occurs in contemporary records, and that leads to the assumption that he must have died in the early years of Sixtus IV's pontificate, whose medal was executed by Lysippus, Christophorus's nephew.\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon (Alfonso I of Naples), also called the Magnanimous, was the king of Aragon and Naples and count of Barcelona from 1416 to 1458. He was a son of Ferdinand I of Aragon (Ferdinand of Antequera). \n\nOn his father's side he descended from the House of Trastamara, a noble family of Castile and is one of the most conspicuous figures of the early Renaissance. No man of his time had a larger share of the quality called by the Italians of the day \"virtue.\" By hereditary right he was king of Sicily, disputed the island of Sardinia with Genoa and conquered the kingdom of Naples.",
