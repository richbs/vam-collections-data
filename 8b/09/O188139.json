Like many contemporary Dutch designers, Brajkovic is interested in distorting familiar objects to encourage us to think about them in a new way. The chair is made from bronze rather than wood, another feature that defies our expectations.\n\nThe embroidery on the chair reflects Brajkovic's interest in history. It shows three fantastical animals drawn from medieval bestiaries: a camel, a hippopotamus and a wild ass. Like the shape of the chair, these creatures seem at once familiar and strange. The embroidery is 'stretched' across the back of the chair in a witty gesture, which gives it the blurred appearance of a fast-moving object on film.",
