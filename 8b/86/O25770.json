During the years of the Cultural Revolution the factory produced many propaganda images based on portraits and photographs of leaders.\n\nMade to commemorate a famous swim by Mao Zedong, who was 73 at the time, in the Yangzi River near Wuhan on 16 July 1966. Intended to underscore his vigour and health, the swim was given euphoric coverage in the press and was presented as an event of huge significance to the Chinese people. Woven silk pictures of the event were possibly produced to decorate swimming pools throughout China. \n\nThe inscription is taken from a newspaper caption. It reads: 'Chairman Mao on board a launch reviewing the swimmers who are battling the waves of the Yangzi'.",
