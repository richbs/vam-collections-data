It depicts the Italian author Torquato Tasso reading before the Duke and Duchess of Ferrara.

Educated at Leeds Grammar School, and was deputy chairman of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company 1869-70.  Died Winslade, near Exeter, 7 December 1885.  Bequeathed all his collection of drawings, watercolours and oil paintings to the Bethnal Green Museum; they have since been transferred to the V&A.  He also collected engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Montagny's history paintings, a genre in which he specialised after studying with David. The present painting shows the famous Renaissance author Torquato Tasso (1544-1595) reading before his patrons, the Duke Alfonso II d'Este and his wife Princess Lucrezia, Duchess of Ferrara. Torquato Tasso composed a successful pastoral drama, <i>Aminta</i>, and an even more famous epic poem, <i>Gerusalemme liberata</i>. He is most likely represented reading one of these two masterpieces.\nThe setting however has some Neoclassical design and does not reflect very accurately the taste of the 16th-century Ferrarese society. While the costumes are representative of 16th-century Italian fashion, the setting and furniture look Neoclassical.\nThis painting is a fine example of the troubadour style, an aesthetic movement that aimed to renew the classical tradition by focusing of subject matters drawn from the medieval history. This movement preceded Romanticism, with which it shared its devotion to the past and had among his most famous exponents: Ingres (1780-1867), Richard Parkes Bonington (1802-1828) and Delacroix (1798-1863). Montagny apparently painted another version in a smaller format, which was formerly in the palace of the king of Naples. However Montagny is more famous for his composition inspired by the Greek and Roman history and mythology such as <i>Apollo and Phaeton</i>, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts et d'Arch\u00e9ologie, Besan\u00e7on.",

            "historical_context_note": "History painting, i.e. depictions of non recurring events based on religious, classical, literary or allegorical sources, particularly developed in Italy during the Renaissance (15th-16th centuries). History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
