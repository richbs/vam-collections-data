            "public_access_description": "This ice-cream pail would probably have been one of a pair included in a dessert service with matching decoration.  In the 1700s, the ability to keep anything cold during the summer indicated the wealth and status of an individual.  Ice was hewn from the rivers in winter and stored in ice-houses for use during hot weather.  The interior of the ice-pail and its deep cover would have been filled with crushed ice and the ice-cream spooned  into the plain liner inside where it would freeze, or almost freeze, sandwiched in between.\nIce-pails were made at S\u00e8vres from 1758 onwards.  We know the first ones mentioned in the records were included in a service given by Louis XV to the Empress Maria-Theresa of Austria in 1758.  These, together with their matching service items decorated with green ribbons and flowers, can still be seen in the Hofburg Palace in Vienna today.",

Ice-cream pails or coolers were used to serve ice-cream during the dessert course. The ice-cream sat in the inner liner, kept cold by two layers of crushed ice: one in the body of the pail below, the other filling the deep cover above. The factory inventory of 1st October 1759 lists a mould and an example of <i>seau \u00e0 glace</i> of the second size. An example, priced 432 livres was included in the ribbons service presented by Louis XV to the Empress Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Austria in December 1758. In presentation services from then on there was always at least one pair of ice-cream pails, sometimes two. The service ordered by the Empress Catherine II of Russia included ten pairs.\nGeoffrey de Bellaigue. <u> The Louis XVI Service, S\u00e8vres Porcelain in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen</u>, Cambridge University Press 1986.
