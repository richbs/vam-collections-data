He painted  portraits of all the Epps family on six large canvases, with Laura adding touches afterwards.\n\nPeople\nErnest Gambart, the picture dealer, wrote to the artist William Holman Hunt, 'Tadema went last Boxing Day [26 December 1869] to a dance at Madox Browns, fell in love at first sight with Miss Epps, the surgeon's daughter, and is going to marry her as soon as she names the day - it plays havoc with his painting; he cannot turn to work since.' Laura Epps and Alma-Tadema married in 1871.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nWithin the screen image from the left is Laura's father, Dr George Napoleon Epps, surgeon and homeopathic physician, who sits at the head of the table with his wife, Anne Charlotte Bacon. Next are Mary Ann Camille Epps, with her husband, Laura's uncle Dr Hahnemann Epps, who was both a homeopathic practitioner and a cocoa manufacturer, and their two small children George and Edith. Ellen Epps (who later married Alma-Tadema's biographer Edmund Gosse) is partly obscured by Emily, resplendent in a white gown. Both girls, like their sister Laura, were artists. Emily faces her brother-in-law Charles Pratt,a  wine merchant, and his wife, Amy Epps. Rowland Hill appears twice, peering round the screen and also standing ghost-like beside his wife, Louisa Epps, who holds their baby Charlotte. (The full-length figure of Rowland was painted out - probably because of a financial scandal that caused him and his wife to flee to Argentina in 1871 - but over a time the paint layers have become transparent.) Next are Frances Epps, her husband, Dr Washington Epps, also a homeopathic practitioner, and his sister Laura, wearing green. Through the door there is a self-portrait of Alma-Tadema. Next to him is Laura's uncle Elizabeth, who married that year and later emigrated to Omaha, Nebraska, USA.\n\nThe inscription that runs across the top of the screen is from Aesop's fables.  It extols the strength to be found in a united family.    This is somewhat ironic in view of Rowland's subsequent disgrace and estrangement from the Epps clan.",
