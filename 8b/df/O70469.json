But throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, images of the Virgin as immaculately conceived were widespread in Spain. Here the Virgin is shown poised on a celestial cloud of cherubims. Her delicate features, as well as the silhouetted billowing form, recall the work of the versatile sculptor, painter and architect Alonso Cano (1601-1667), who was active in Granada as well as in Seville.",
