They were made in a variety of fabrics, from checked and striped materials to delicate woven or embroidered patterns. The fabrics were often similar to those on women's fashionable dresses.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTartan was very popular in the 1850s. Some garments copied authentic examples but others were fancy tartans that no one would recognise.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis waistcoat was probably worn in the winter, as it is made of a woven silk velvet: cashmere and silk satins were popular for summer wear. Different styles of waistcoat were worn according to the time of day and occasion.  In the 1850s day waistcoats were often double-breasted, whereas those worn during the evening were single-breasted. They also tended to be made of more delicate materials, including satin and rich silks.",
