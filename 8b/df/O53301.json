It was ordered by the 8th Earl of Kintore for Keith Hall, Inverurie, in Scotland, and delivered in October 1850 by the makers, Jennens & Bettridge. This firm was the largest and best known maker of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 in Britain at the time.  They manufactured their wares in Birmingham, but also kept a showroom in Halkin Street in West London.  Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 makers often included well-known castles and stately homes in their decoration but this is clearly a special commission.  In front of Keith Hall, we can see the figures of the Earl and Countess, together with their dogs Flush and Bruno.",
