It is made up of a mixture of local woods, including rosewood to cedar and decorated with a border made up of jagged patterns filled in with composition to imitate inlay. The inside is decorated with  scrolls and a honeysuckle (anthemion) scroll, motifs popular throughout Spain and the rest of Europe from about 1765 and widespread throughout the Spanish colonies by about 1800.",

The style of the metal mounts can be compared with railing in the choir of the church of San Jer\u00f3nimo, Tlacochahuaya, in Oaxaca, and fittings on a trunk (San Marcos Tlapazola). In particular, the distinctive keyhole escutcheon can be paralleled on other pieces, suggesting a common workshop origin. Similar decoration can be seen on the pulpit and choir balustrades in the church of  San Jer\u00f3nimo Tlacochahuaya, Oaxaca. The internal decoration is likely to be a 19th century addition.
