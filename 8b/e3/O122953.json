He moved to Paris in about 1851 as overseer for the Dumas stove and tile firm and in 1855 opened his own studio and, later his own retail shop, with his brother Xavier. In 1887, only three years before his death, Deck became Director of the National Manufactory at S\u00e8vres.\n\nEmmanuel Benner (1836-96) and his twin brother Jean (1836-1906) were born in Mulhausen, Alsace-Lorraine and thus were compatriots of  Deck.  Both successful painters, they were among a number who collaborated in the design and decoration of ceramics made at Deck's Paris studio.  They specialised in portraits, still lives and genre subjects but alos shared Deck's interest in the 'Orient' and produced freely painted 'Japanese' decorations.  The subject of this dish would have appealed to the emerging fashion for the  'exotic'.",
