The man wears long, grey robes and a black cloak with gold stitching, fastenings and collar, and a tall, rimless hat, and is presumably a Jesuit. He holds a book in his right hand and a pair of spectacles in his left. The woman, painted on a slightly larger scale, is a versian of a figure seen frequently in Mughal painting of the period, has a long pink robe (open to expose her right breast), with a voluminous blue shawl over it. She carries a stringed instrument in her left hand (possibly a tanpura or sarod) and a bow in her right. Her gold jewellery consists of an anklet, bracelets, a bazuband, necklaces, an earring set with a pearl or ruby; in her hair is a feather in a gold holder. The ground is lightly washed with green at the bottom, and there is a long haired dog at bottom left. The painting has been extended at the top and a blue cusped arch added. The borders are decorated with gold, scrolling ornament and Persian couplets within black outlines, reserved against gold rectangles.",
