It is very long, however, but may have been pulled-up over the breasts.  The design of the lower border is incomplete and in places is unstitched, giving the appearance of having been attached to something else which might have been a fabric 'shoe' [see Afghan trousers which have attached shoes].\nAt the bottom of the panel is a large [54 cm long] cypress tree like motif totally infilled with small rosettes and buds and curving stems; it terminates in a slender pendant form with three small pendants at the base.  The whole motif is reinforced on the back with another layer of cotton. The stems are delineated by  quilting but infilled with small crosses in straight stitches. The quilting is worked in back stitch with light indigo cotton [2S] inserted after the stitching [trapunto quilting].\nAlong the bottom edge and up both sides to a height of 47.5 cm is similar decoration.  Up the sides, the stem delineation as straight lines with a line of rosettes and buds, while the bottom edge has an incomplete but possibly similar pattern with the addition of a quilted, closely packed undulating line.\nThe rest of the sides is turned in with a decorative back stitched hem.\nThe top edge has been reinforced with a narrow strip of bias cut cotton and is decorated with a line of rosettes and buds and a closely packed undulating line.",
