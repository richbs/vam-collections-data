A prolific pottery industry has flourished in this locality for centuries. Its fine clay is ideal for making stoneware. \n\nWesterwald production typically consists of sturdy grey salt-glazed stoneware pieces, often decorated in blue and purple. Early trade was limited to Europe but from the seventeenth century wares have been exported to places as diverse and distant as North America, Africa and East Asia.\n\nThis jug is impressed with an overall pattern of small rings - a form of decoration frequently seen on Westerwald stoneware products from the second half of the eighteenth century. At this period, local demand for fine white English salt-glazed stoneware drove the Westerwald potters to create a new repertoire of small items of tableware such as teapots and salt cellars.  The highly unusual cockerel form of this jug was likewise probably inspired by quirky Staffordshire earthenware and stoneware figures and figural useful wares, though may possibly have been influenced by colourful tin-glazed earthenware or Meissen porcelain bird figures.",

Cornelia, Countess of Craven's sale, Christie's London, 11th April 1923, lot 21.\n\nThe Westerwald region lies between the rivers Sieg and Lahn east of the Rhine. Stoneware was produced in the neighbouring settlements of H\u00f6hr, Grenzau and Grenzhausen from the 14th century and these are now merged in the modern town of H\u00f6hr-Grenzhausen. Stoneware is still made there today.\n\nThis jug is a very unusual form.
