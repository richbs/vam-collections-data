The public and most collectors of modern works started to prefer lighter and sometimes more sentimental themes.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nLeslie frequently used themes from humorous literature. Here he is illustrating a scene from a play by Moli\u00e8re, Les Femmes Savantes ('The Learned Ladies'), in which the conceited Trissotin reads a pretentious sonnet of his own composition to his admiring audience of literary ladies, the self-styled 'learned ladies' of the title. When this picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1845, it was called A Scene from Moli\u00e8re and several lines from the play were quoted in the catalogue.\n\nPeople\nAlthough Leslie began his career as a history and portrait painter, he soon turned to literary themes. The collector John Sheepshanks (1787-1863) owned 17 paintings by Leslie with subjects taken from well-known authors such as Shakespeare, Chaucer and Moli\u00e8re.",

Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n<b>Les Femmes Savantes </b>\nFA117 Neg 76916 \nCanvas, 99 X 76.1 cm (39 X 30 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1845, and, according to Taylor <u>(Leslie</u> 11, p280), painted for John Sheepshanks. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic simply dismissed the work with the comment 'a repetition, with, at best, very unimportant changes, of his well-remembered piece of humour'; other critics do not seem to note an earlier version of the picture, and none is recorded in <u>Leslie</u>. The title given in the RA catalogue was 'Scene from Moli\u00e8re', with the following lines appended (for some reason, a different quotation appears in the 1907 catalogue):\n<i>Trissotin</i>: Sonnet a la Princesse Uranie sur sa Fievre. \n                           Votre prudence est endormie \n                           De traiter magnifiquement, \n                           Et de loger superbement \n                           Votre plus cruelle ennemie. \n<i>Belise</i>: Ah! le joli debut! \n<i>Annande: </i> Qu'i] a le tour galant! \n<i>Philaminte</i>: Lui seul, des vers aises possede le talent. \n\nThe lines are from Moli\u00e8re's play Les Femmes Savantes (1673), act 3 scene 3. \nContemporary and later opinions of the painting differed, although the themes of Leslie's humour and chalky 'sketchiness' are common. The Art Union in 1845 thought 'This production is less careful than any we remember by its author ... Compared with what has been exhibited by the artist, this is in manner but a sketch, and the subject is slighted'; the costumes were also adversely noted: 'The male figure is attired according to the manner in which the French dress the character; but the female figures are dressed in what may pass for modem costume, and are decidedly too English in style, to support a scene from Moli\u00e8re as we are accustomed to see the author put upon the French stage'. The<u>Examiner</u> found it: \n\nCharmingly executed, with the usual exceptionable points in colour . . . How admirably conveyed is the conceited admiration of Trissotin's sonnet; and with what a comical gusto of folly the sonneteer sits among his learned admirers. Let us remember how little like Nature, scenes from plays are generally made: and admire Mr Leslie the more. \nBy 1857 the 'sketchiness' was still more a matter for comment. The <u>Art Journal</u>, reviewing the Sheepshanks collection, called it \n\nA picture in which is set forth the learning of a life-time. It is a full composition, abounding with even, small forms, which would be insufferably impertinent in unskilful hands; but the appositions are so masterly, and the light so brilliantly and beautifully distributed, that we feel that the artist has been guilty of a misdemeanour in not having finished the work more perfectly. \nTen years later, in a text accompanying an engraving after the work, the <u>Art Journal </u>admired the 'irresistibly humorous' treatment of the subject, but 'the picture shows the artist's accustomed tendency to \"chalkiness\" more than usual. This, with the peculiar light from the candelabra, renders the subject difficult to engrave effectively'. Taylor had also found the work 'disagreeably chalky in texture', but thought the expressions worthy of Hogarth. The Redgraves, however, opined that 'a truer effect is given of the brilliancy of candlelight by the slightest means, than in the most laboured work of Schalken or Honthorst'. Maas finds the effect 'delightfully brash'. \nThe background was taken from the White Library at Petworth, where Lord Egremont was one of Leslie's patrons; the existence in a private collection of a watercolour study for the looking-glass and console table is recorded on the Departmental files.\n\nEXH: RA 1845 (149);<i> International Exhibition</i> Dublin 1865 (148a); <i>Bicentenary Exhibition </i>RA 18-9 (175)\n\nENGR: P Lightfoot, in <u>Art Journal</u> 1867, facing p230, and J Daffome <u>Leslie and Maclise </u>1871, facing p45\n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 10 May 1845, pp466; <u>Art Union </u>1845, p183;<u> Examiner </u>1845, p293;<u> Art Journal </u>1857, p240;<u> Leslie </u>I, pplxiilxiii, II, p280;<u> Art Journal</u> 1867, p230; JDaffome <u>Maclise and Leslie</u> 1871, p51; <u>L'Artiste </u>1884, (XX), p254; Sand R Redgrave <u>A Century of British Painters </u>1866, pp310-1; J Maas <u>Victorian Painters</u> 1969, p109, repr in colour p120 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
