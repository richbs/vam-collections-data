The sides of the gangway are pink with green uprights and the underside of the seating area, seen through a doorway, shows as blue. In the background and elephant is going through his act with two keepers dressed in green. The foreground shows a walkway with a number of people in costume watching the act. These are probably the next acts waiting for the elephant to finish. One man has a red dressing gown with a yellow elephant depicted on the back and wears a pointed hat; another has red and green soldier costume and a rounded fur hat and is carrying a drum; another 'soldier' has yellow and blue costume and flat-topped fur hat; a man in green is rolling a larger drum-shaped stand of the kind an elephant might balance on during an act. In a doorway is a man in riding dress minding a horse and next to him a woman in blue and white dress with red ribbon belt tied in a bow. The border is grey and has a pattern of spots and wavy lines terminating in curls at the corners.",

Each lithograph had a drawn frame so that the print could be pinned to the wall. In the spirit of post-war optimism, artists responded enthusiastically. The scheme was a unique attempt at giving children access to original works of art in a period of austerity but ended in 1949 because of financial problems. Many of the prints depict a familiar world of everyday rural or urban life, some presenting a version of the pastoral idyll and others scenes of entertainment or leisure.",

Tomlinson, London County Council Senior Inspector of Art. Many of the prints depict a familiar world of everyday rural or urban life, some presenting a version of the pastoral idyll (John Nash 'Harvesting') and others scenes of festivity (Barbara Jones 'Fairground'), entertainment (L.S.
