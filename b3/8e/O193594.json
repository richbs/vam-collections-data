This included the destruction of old Hungarian villages in the interest of forced development and extremely low living standard in the region. \n\nIn his book 'United Colors of Hungary' P\u00e9ter P\u00f3cs tells the story of this poster which was commissioned  by the Young Artists' Club to advertise an aid concert.  \"Since its topic was sensitive both from a domestic and foreign policy point of view I had to show the poster to the Minister of Culture, who was B\u00e9la K\u00f6peczi at that time, in order to get permission. Although the big-size colour slide was not submitted directly by me, I could see from the next room, I could peep at his positive reaction to my concept. He testified it in a very special way. Getting up from the floor he made small gambolling movements. Although he did not utter a word, his peculiar, somehow familiar movements had a calming effect on me. I myself expressed the joy of lucky hits and cathartic moments in the same way - although not publicly. The poster was printed in several thousand copies and sold in order to transfer the income to help the Transylvanians. In 1989, during the Romanian revolution the town of Kecskem\u00e9t published the poster again in 2000 copies aiming to increase the aid parcels and money contributions...\"",
