He subsequently trained under the engraver and architect Domenico Tibaldi (1541-1583) and under the sculptor Alessandro Menganti (1531-c. 1594). He may also have been a pupil of Bartolomeo Passarotti (1529-1592). He ran an important workshop in Bologna together with his cousin Lodovico (1555-1619) and his brother Annibale (1560-1609), with whom he founded about 1585 the Accademia degli Incamminati. Agostino produced mainly history paintings and engravings. He went to Rome with his brother in 1594 for the decoration of the Palazzo Farnese. He left in autumn 1599 and went to Parma where he died in 1602.\n\nThis painting is an early copy after an engraving by Agostino Carracci, executed ca. 1590. It shows Venus in the middle of the composition chastising Cupid, who is blindfold and carried on the back of a putto while another on the left is weeping with a hand in his back, a gesture that suggests he also had been chastised. The scene is set in a mountainous landscape with a tall tree on the right. Agostino Carracci was a prolific and successful engraver whose compositions were much appreciated as witnessed by this early copy.",

The <u>Catalogue. Paintings, Miniatures, &c.</u> by Samuel Redgrave notes of the 'Oil Paintings', 'The strength of Mr. Dyce's valuable bequest to Department of Science and Art does not lie in [this] portion ... which is in its nature of a very miscellaneous character.  The collection was made apparently as objects offered themselves, and without any special design.'  Dyce's main interest was in literary subjects, and this is reflected in many of the paintings he bequeathed to the V&A.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a copy, probably of 16th century date, after an engraving by Agostino Carracci (impression in the British Museum, London, U,2.155) from the series titled <i>Lascivie</i> illustrating the different natures of love, made around 1590. The engraving is reproduced and the composition discussed by E. Tietze-Conrat in <i>Jahrbuch des Kunsthistorischen Institutes der K. K. Zentral Kommission f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege</i>, xi, 1917, p. 26 f., fig. 18. \n\nVenus is beating Cupid, who is blindfold and carried on the back of a putto, while another on the left weeping and holds a hand to his bottom, suggesting that he has been similarlyu chastised. The scene is set in a mountainous landscape with a tree on the right.\n\nAccording to mythological accounts, and especially to Herodotus' <i>Cosmogony</i>, Cupid was blinded by Folly, thus embodying the blind passion which characterises love. He also embodies two different aspects of love, both profane (Anteros) and sacred (Eros). The subject depicted here has traditionally been interpreted as the punishment of physical love, an iconography relating to Renaissance Neoplatonism, a philosophy in which the dual aspect of love plays a significant role.\n\nThis theme was also treated by Annibale Carracci in the Galleria Farnese, Rome, the decoration of which celebrates profane love (see Charles Dempsey, 'Et nos cedamus amori: Observations on the Farnese Gallery', in <i>The Art Bulletin</i>, vol. 50, no. 4 (1968), pp. 363-374).\n\nThis early painted copy painting demonstrates the success of Agostino's engravings; Bartsch listed about ten engraved copies, mostly in reverse, after the original print, and an early seventeenth century drawing inspired by it, although not a direct copy, in the Albertina, Vienna (Inv. 2776). The engraving was very popular in the 17th and 18th centuries and served as a model for bronzes as well as paintings. An 18th century etching (reversed) by Bouchard and Gravier (Rome, 1786) shows the same composition with the sole addition of a fluttering veil across the body of Venus",
