His father managed a farm at Makuyu before moving to his own dairy farm near Nyeri. His mother ran a nursing home on the farm. Llewellyn was known as 'Billy' as a child then always 'Bill' afterwards. He lived to the age of 90 and emigrated with his family to Wales in 1960. There, he managed a branch of a security firm before working with one of his greatest interests, antiques. In his later years he ran his framing business and was still doing some commissions until he was about 85. He was a talented artist, selling some of his paintings, and could turn his hand to several crafts. The chair was donated to the Museum by his daughter, Ann Skelton.",
