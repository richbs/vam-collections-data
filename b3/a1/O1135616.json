Massine appears to have met Felix Fernandez Garcia in Barcelona and again in Madrid in 1917 where he was invited to join the company. As Lydia Sokolova recalled in her autobiography 'The employment of Felix was the first step towards the realisation of the great Spanish ballet which Massine intended to create....The essential was that Massine and the company should learn to perform Spanish steps in a Spanish way; and Massine in particular had to master the grammar of the Spanish dance before he could work out his choreography.' Massine appears to have begun to study in Barcelona and he also studied with Felix's own teacher Senor de Molina. During the summer months Massine and Diaghilev stayed with Jose Maria Sert at Sitges and Manuel de Falla joined them in Barcelona. In July, with Falla and Felix, Massine and Diaghilev travelled in search of dances and music.\n\nLe Tricorne, choreographed by L\u00e9onide Massine was based on an 18th century Spanish comedy by Mart\u00ednez Sierra after Alarcon. It had a score by Manuel de Falla, and curtain, scenic setting and costumes by Pablo Picasso. It received its world premiere by the Ballets Russes on 22 July 1919 at the Alhambra Theatre, London.",
