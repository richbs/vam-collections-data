            "public_access_description": "When coffee drinking was still a novelty in Europe tall cups and beakers were normally used for it, firstly made in metal (usually silver) and later on in porcelain and pottery.  This shape of this Meissen coffee cup and saucer is quite rare as it has been specially adapted to enable the coffee to be poured into the saucer, presumably to allow the liquid to cool more quickly to a suitable temperature.  The decoration imitates Chinese (Batavian ware) teacups and saucers.\n\nThe tradition of coffee drinking originated in Ethiopia and only spread to Europe  during the 1600s via the Middle East.",
