            "physical_description": "The mounted painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, shows a group of ladies on a terrace in front of a pavilion beyond which there is a landscape.  The principal lady is sitting on a gold chair listening to a pair of female musicians; one playing a vina and other one clapping.   A female attendant, holding a peacock-feathered <i>morchal</i> stands behind the chair alongside a smaller girl holding a wine bottle and a small cup.\n      The seated lady is wearing a purple<i>peshwaz</i> over orange <i>paijama</i> decorated with a half-drop pattern of blue flower buds with a gold<i>patka</i> with floral embellishments.  She is wearing a transparent <i>dupatta</i> over her head and shoulder which is decorated with gold dots and a gold border with seed pearls.  She has a pearl and red jewelled hair ornament, elaborate pearl earrings and necklaces( three rows at her throat and two longer ones below), together with green and yellow stoned necklaces in between, which are matched by her <i>bazubands</i> and green wrist bangles.  Rows of pearls are also seen at her wrists and ankles.  She has hennaed fingertips and a number of finger and thumb rings and one toe ring.\n      The musicians are elegantly dressed in short <i>cholis</i> with short sleeves and seams picked out in contrasting colours, leaving their midriffs bare.  Both are wearing <i>gaghras</i>, the lady in front having hers gathered into a green waistband with a plain rose-coloured <i>patka</i> with a gold hem.  She is also wearing a transparent deep pink <i>odhini</i> edged in gold over her head and upper body.  The clapping lady is similarly dressed with a yellow <i>choli</i> edged in red and a crimson <i>patka</i>, a lime green <i> gaghra</i> and a pink gauzy <i>odhini</i>. She, too wears pearl necklaces bracelets and other ornaments.\n      The young girl on the right wears a high-necked orange <i>peshwaz</i> over green <i>paijamas</i>, similarly decorated with flower buds and a floral <i>patka</i>.  She is wearing a jewelled hat with a broad upstanding brim.  She has a cross-over body ornament of pearls as well as earrings, bracelets and <i>bazubands</i>.\n      The attendant with the <i>morchal</i> is less lavishly dressed with a plain green, high-necked <i>peshwaz</i> and matching <i>odhini</i> edged in gold with an orange <i>patka</i> with small floral motifs.\n       The ladies are all placed on a carpet or floor covering with an interlaced floral pattern on a dark green ground with a contrasting scrolling floral border on red.  This covers the terrace which is raised above beds of red flowers either side of a central small flight of white steps. The golden chair that the principal lady is sitting on, with bare hennaed feet, is of an Indianised style of European chair.  It has an integrated footrest which extends from the base of the front legs, open arm rests and a raking back with a cusped top rail. There is a low white wall at the back of the terrace and a white pavilion  with broad white eaves and a wall divided into compartments enclosing cusped arches or rectangular panels and a central shaped cartouche in outline surrounding a dark doorway with a raised blind of golden material decorated in a crimson floral pattern.  The parapet of the building is also decorated with stylised floral motifs within arched outlines.\n      Beyond the low wall the scene opens into a landscape of trees in front of a stretch of water with white water fowl with two intersecting hills outlined in trees in the distance. A group of buildings is seen on the brow of the left hand hill and two out of scale  'pin' figures are silhouetted against the skyline above which there is a blue sky with puffy clouds outlines in gold.\n      The painting is framed with gold lines and white and white outlines either side of strips of dark blue paper decorated with a stylised floral scroll.  The outermost blue line is drawn over the main border and its alternate floral decoration of red poppies and pink lilies on the ivory-coloured ground.  The margins of the page have strips of buff-coloured paper with an inner white outline.  A mushroom-coloured strip of paper is attached to the inner side of the page as a gutter for the binding.",

The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
