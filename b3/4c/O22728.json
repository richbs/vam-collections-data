W.R. Midwinter were the key producers of design-conscious contemporary tableware in the 1950s. Taking initial inspiration from the US, they designed several curvilinear-shaped ranges which are iconic of the 1950s in Britain. 'Midwinter Modern' is one of the ranges. Jessie Tait was a staff designer at Midwinter in the 1950s producing many patterns for the company. Unlike other tableware producers of the period, Midwinter ensured that the pattern designers were named on the base of each piece bearing their pattern. Other Tait pattern names in the 1950s include Cannes, Bali Hai, Tonga, Patio Hollywood and Shalimar.\nRoy Midwinter was innovative in employing known young and trendy designers for his works - in particular Terence Conran and Hugh Casson. These were promoted by name, as was his own in-house designer, Jessie Tait. This represents a major effort by a mass-producer to sell his products via the reputation of the designer.\n[Susan McCormack, 'British Design at Home', p.141]",
