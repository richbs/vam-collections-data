Student at the RA Schools, exhibited 14 works at the RA between 1825 and 1836, nine at the BI 1824-37, and nine at the SBA 1824-33. Subjects either portraits or children, usually at play. \n\n<b>I Will Fight</b> \n1395-1869 \nCanvas, 76.1 X 64.7 cm (30 X 25\u00bd ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nExhibited at the SBA in 1824 and presumably painted in that year, and exhibited again it seems at the BI in 1827 (size given in the catalogue as 41 by 36 inches including frame). The <u>Somerset House Gazette</u> critic in 1824 described it: \n\nJohn [Bull] loves a boy of spirit. 'I will fight' ... touches the chord of his heart. We behold in this very clever picture, by a promising young painter, a boy of about ten years, determined to <i>have a round. </i>One, bigger than himself, and of an amiable countenance, is endeavouring to dissuade him from the encounter; but 'I will fight' is demonstrated indelibly in his look, and in each fist ... Were we inclined to pun, we should say of this spirited piece, that even without a blow, the painter had made a 'good hit'. \n\nFor another painting of a juvenile fight, see William Mulready's 'The Fight Interrupted' of 1816 (FA139, p199). Both works were painted during a period which regarded boxing as an important manifestation of national character, celebrated in the spirited prose of Pierce Egan's <i>Boxiana</i> (1812-29). \n\nEXH: SBA 1824 (65); BI 1827 (308) \n\nLIT: <u>Somerset House Gazette</u> 1824 (II) p49 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
