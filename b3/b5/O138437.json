She has utilised material such as sweet wrappers, 18th-century newspapers and medicine packaging. \n\nThis neck-piece is constructed from hundreds of individual frames of 16mm film, woven together in cluster formations using high-tensile-strength steel wire. \nEach 16mm frame has been carefully cut from the film reel and then burnt for a brief period, in order to singe the edges of each image. This process creates a natural border around each frame, thus reinforcing the idea of each frame as an independent image, rather than as one part of a larger sequence. By weaving these frames of film together, Sieber-Fuchs explores the duality and tension that exists between photography and cinema. She forces the individual frames into a new, random sequence, thus examining the relationship between the discrete, static photograph and the concept of a cinematic sequence of images.\n\nThe 16mm film which Sieber-Fuchs uses comes from advertising reels for multinational companies such as Philip Morris and Levis. The constituent imagery therefore depicts everyday 'heavy-sell' objects such as jeans and cigarettes. By constructing a neck-piece from such images, the artist explores ideas about wearable commodities, individual fashion branding and consumer taste.",
