Conveniently situated on a major trading route, Siegburg was a centre of ceramic production with well-organised workshops and kilns in which pipe-clay figures were also fired.\n\nSaint Nicholas  (Santa Claus) of Bari is one of the most popular Saints. The legends told about him, were not spread before 500 years after his death. His parents having died when he was very young, he was consequently brought up by his uncle. He inherited a lot of money from his parents, which he all gave away to the needy and entered a monastery. He had a special affection to children. He died when only ca. 46 years old. His alleged relics were stolen by Italian merchants and are now in the church of Bari.",
