This obelisk probably also once had a brass knob on top, as there is a hole for attachment.\n\nIt shows a very distinctive form of 'marbled' decoration. In the 1790s experiments were attempted, using dry coloured clay particles to decorate earthenware. These crushed granules were applied to a wet slip ground, and could be either left whole as rough encrustation or rolled into the surface and eventually cleaned up on the lathe to give a smooth, finely dappled surface. This technique is known as \u2018Terra Tersia\u2019, tersia being a common term in the eighteenth century for certain types of marquetry or veneer.",
