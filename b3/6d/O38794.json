The front shows three children in nightgowns sailing in a wooden sabot by moonlight: the characters Wynken, Blynken and Nod, from the poem of the same name by Eugene Field, which was first printed in The Chicago Daily News on 09/03/1889.  The wording reads \n1 To-day\nwith the large figure one embossed and printed in gold coloured ink.  Inside is a vignette of the children in the sabot and another of a golden-haired baby wearing a white dress and sitting among toys.  Between is a verse based on the opening of Field's poem:\nWINKEN, BLINKEN AND NOD\nSail out in a wooden shoe,\nTo bring a HAPPY BIRTHDAY wish\nFor a tiny tot like you.\nThey have a star to guide them, \nAnd it will shine for you, my dear,\nTo guide you through the happy days\nNow you are ONE whole year.\n\nThere is an additional couplet which reads:\nOverleaf, you will see\nA Picture you can paint for me.\nand the back of the card carries a line drawing of the illustration on the front, with the words\nPaint us so we'll look our best\nIn pretty colours, gaily dressed !",
