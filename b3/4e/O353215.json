The skull cap (circum. 330mm) is made of eight triangles of silk fabric in different colours. There are four red triangles in a cross shape with two black opposite each other and two yellow opposite each other. The triangles are embroidered with a button hole stitch that surrounds a number of small holes. The threads used here are of different colours (blue, red, yellow). Between each triangle is a row of silk threads in X shapes; colours of yellow and brown / red and black. The sides of the red triangles have two rows of running stitch on either side of a row of holes. In the centre of the red triangle are five holes that make a diamond shape with a hole added to one end. The black and yellow triangles have a central decoration of colourful holes in the shape of a fish.\n\nThe skull cap is attached to head band (92mm wide). At the join is a double row of running stitch in yellow silk thread; then a row of colourful embroidered holes; a single row of running stitch; then a row of Xs in red and yellow / black and yellow. The edge is hemmed with dark thread. Most of the head band is made up of squares of one colour (red, black, yellow). At the bottom edge of the head band is a row of Xs in red and yellow / black and yellow; a single row of running stitch in yellow; a row of colourful embroidered holes; a double row of running stitch. The silk squares are plain woven and have running stitches (sewn in red thread) across them to make a criss-cross pattern / series of diamond shapes.\n\nThe linen lining is heavily stained; approx. 13x9 tpc (sys 1 x sys 2); z-spun.
