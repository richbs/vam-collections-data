Despite this, he enjoyed some early success in Nottingham, the city where he lived for most of his early life.  \n\nDawson began to exhibit landscapes in London, at the Royal Academy from 1838 and the British Institution from 1841.  In 1844 he moved to Liverpool and exhibited at the Liverpool Academy, becoming an associate in 1846 and a full member the following year. It was while he was in Liverpool that he started to produce the marine images which would become a staple of his out-put throughout his career.\n\nIn 1850 Dawson moved south, living in Croyden, Chertsey and Camberwell before settling in Chiswick.  He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy but had more success at the British Institution where he showed several key works such as The Wooden Walls of England and The New Houses of Parliament, Westminster.  In July 1878 he was honoured by a retrospective exhibition of fifty-seven of his paintings to mark the opening of the Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery.",

Worked from the age of seven in a lace factory in Nottingham, but painted in his spare time, mainly portraits; seeing prints by John Martin inspired him to paint landscape. Began as a professional painter 1835, visited London 1836, and received his only formal training there 1838 - twelve lessons from the landscape painter and watercolourist James Baker Pyne. Exhibited 28 landscapes at the RA between 1838 and 1874; he always complained, with some reason it seems, that his work was badly hung. Also exhibited 33 works at the BI 1841-67 and six at the SBA 1851-78 (elected Member 1875). Moved to Liverpool 1844, exhibiting at the Liverpool Academy 1845-51 (elected Member 1847). Entered (unsuccessfully) 1847 competition for decoration of new Palace of Westminster, with 'Charles I Raising his Standard ... ' (now Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery); achieved great success with one of his large views of London, 'The New Houses of Parliament, Westminster', at the BI 1858. Later works achieved high prices, his popularity culminating in the exhibition of 57 paintings to mark the opening of the Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery 1878. Lived in Croydon, Surrey, 1850-3, and Thorpe Green, near Chertsey, Surrey, until 1861; finally settled in Chiswick, Middlesex, where he died 13 December 1878; his studio sale was at Christie's 23-5 March 1882. His two sons, Alfred (1844-93) and Henry Thomas (c1842-78) were also painters. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1869</i>, p112, 1879, p48 (obit); A Dawson <i>The Life of Henry Dawson Landscape Painter</i> 1891; B Webber <i>James Orrock, RI, Painter, Connoisseur, Collector</i> 2 vols, 1903, I, pp25-42, II p237; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp114-8, 259; H Williams <i>Henry Dawson</i> Nottingham University Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1978 \n\n<b>Shipping at Sunset</b> \n501-1896 \nCanvas, 49.5 x 74.8 cm (19\u00bd x 29\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'HD [in monogram] 61' bl \nGiven by J D Paul 1896 \n\nPresumably the 'Sunset at Sea' exhibited at the BI in 1861 and priced at 20 guineas. This was described by the <i>Art Journal</i> critic (1861, p70): 'The phase is similar to that in the harvest picture, - the sun is dipping behind a cloud. We are not far \"at sea\", for there is even in the foresea a frigate at anchor. The sky and the water are unexceptionable'. Lot 508 in the artist's studio sale at Christie's 23-5 March 1882 was 'A Marine Sunset' (size given as 30 X 20 ins sold to Innes \u00a3294); 'A Stormy Sunset' was engraved by W Chapman for the <i>Art Journal</i> in 1869 (facing pl12), the picture having been exhibited at the Dudley Gallery 1867 and owned by J Orrocks (presumably the artist and collector James Orrock). \n\nEXH: ?Bl 1861 (110)\"",
