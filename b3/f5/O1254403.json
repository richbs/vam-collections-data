The sketchi is not dated but is likely to have been drawn in circa 1868.\n\nIrving appeared as Bill Sikes in a version of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, dramatised by John Oxenford with music by Mr Wallerstein, at the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, in April 1868. As well as J.L. Toole (1830-1906) as the Artful Dodger, the cast included Nellie Moore as Nancy. \n\nThe earliest dramatised version of Dickens' 1837 novel was produced at London's Surrey Theatre in 1838. Several versions appeared in the intervening 30 years, many more successful than this one, which didn't please the first-night audience, although it still ran until July. Toole's performance as the Dodger however impressed one critic with its 'real artistic capability'. Irving's Sikes was noted for its 'almost terrible earnestness' and 'intensity of expression', characteristics of his acting which later made him a star.",
