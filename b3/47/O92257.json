Kitchens in moderately wealthy town houses contained a variety of utensils such as trivets, basins, pans, skewers, ladles and mortars. Stands such as this supported pots and pans over the fire. The short legs and stepped domed feet suggest this stand fitted onto a further supporting mechanism allowing it to be detached and transferred to the table if necessary.\n\nAlthough primarily functional items, pot stand were often highly decorated. The pierced ornamentation of dragons' heads and men's faces in profile incorporated into this pot stand evolve from the a medieval tradition of casting representations of fabulous creatures in brass. The dragons, as breathers of fire, also have symbolic meaning for an item used in cooking.",

It was given to the Museum by Dr Walter Leo Hildburgh in 1953 converting into a gift an object already on loan.\n\nHildburgh was one of the V&A's most dedicated and generous patrons. Born in New York in 1876, he trained as a scientist. Initially he collected ethnography but after 1914 he turned to the decorative arts. Encouraged by successive Keepers of Metalwork, he accumulated huge collections of Spanish and German metalwork. From 1924 when he first offered objects to the Museum on loan, to 1956 when he bequeathed his huge collection, Hildburgh was  part of the Museum landscape. He regularly gave the Museum presents at Christmas and on his birthday. His will set up a fund for future purchases, administered in the spirit of his earlier acquisitions.

Kitchens in moderately wealthy town houses contained a variety of utensils such as trivets, basins, pans, skewers, ladles and mortars. Stands such as this supported pots and pans over the fire. The short legs and stepped domed feet suggest this stand fitted onto a further supporting mechanism allowing it to be detached and transferred to the table if necessary.\n\nAlthough primarily functional items, pot stands were often highly decorated. The pierced ornamentation of dragons' heads and men's faces in profile incorporated into this example evolved from the a medieval tradition of casting representations of fabulous creatures in brass. The dragons, as breathers of fire, also have symbolic meaning for an item used in cooking.",
