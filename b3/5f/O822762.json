Engraved by William Morris from designs by Sir E C Burne-Jones.\nNote: This edition of 'The Earthlt Paradise' was Morris' first scheme for the production of a fine book,many years befor ethe inception of the Kelmscott Press. It was planned as a foolscap folio to be printed in ? Old Face type, and profusely illustrated. Many of the cuts were prepared and several specimin pages were set up, but the scheme was not finally proceeded with. Illustration no 4 set in the page of Caslon type, is evidence that the publication of the book with these designs was considered later by the Kelmscott Press.",
