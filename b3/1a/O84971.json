ISBN 1851771026\nParkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 32\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"Clint, George ARA (1770-1854)\n\nBorn Brownlow Street, Drury Lane, London, 12 April 1770, son of a hairdresser. After school in Yorkshire, worked in turn for a fishmonger, attorney, housepainter, and bookseller. Trained first as a miniature painter; acquaintance with John Bell (see FA253, p31) and his nephew Edward Bell led him to produce mezzotints; also made coloured copies from prints after George Morland and others. First oil painting was a portrait of his wife, which resulted in an introduction to Sir William Beechey RA. Exhibited 99 works at the RA between 1802 and 1845, nine at the BI 1815-42, and 15 at the SBA 1831-47. Almost all were portraits, and after 1816 many were of actors and theatrical scenes in the tradition of Zoffany and Samuel de Wilde. His studio in Gower Street became a rendezvous for the leading actors and actresses of the day. Elected ARA 1821; repeated failure to be elected RA resulted in his resignation 1836. Died Kensington, London, 10 May 1854.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss) \n\nEdmund Kean as Sir Giles Overreach \n079 Neg 70315 \nCanvas, 28 X 22.9 cm (11 X 9 ins) \nDyce Bequest 1869 \n\nThe painting has been previously catalogued as by an unknown artist, but it is clearly a sketch for the head and shoulders of Kean in the painting exhibited by Clint at the RA in 1820 (311) and now in the Garrick Club collection. In the RA catalogue, the following title and quotation are given: \n\nThe last scene in Massinger's play of ' A New Way to pay Old Debts', with portraits \n\n<i>Sir Giles Overreach</i>: Village nurses revenge their wrongs with curses: I'll not\nwast a syllable; but thus I take the life which, wretche, I gave to thee (offers to kill\nMargaret). \n\nA very similar oil sketch (51.4 X 41.2 cm/20\u00bc x 16\u00bc ins), also in the Garrick Club collection, shows Kean as Shakespeare's <i>Richard III</i>. \n\nPhilip Massinger's comedy of 1633 deals with the deception and ultimate fall of the unscrupulous Sir Giles Overreach; in the last scene, finding he has helped unwittingly to marry his daughter to the wrong man and has lost all his property, he goes insane. The finished painting shows him drawing his sword to kill his daughter: 'This moment and the ensuing fit brought the strongest reaction from audiences and Lord Byron was one of the many, both on and off the stage, who had hysterics on the first night' (<i>The Georgian Playhouse</i>). Edmund Kean (1787-1833) made the sensational debut at Drury Lane in 1841, and became the leading and most controversial actor of the day. He played Sir Giles at Drury Lane for the first time on 12 January 1816; that role and in April 1920 his King Lear, were among his greatest triumphs. There are several portraits of Keen in various roles, but this brilliant sketch perhaps best captures the mercurial passion of the acting style for which he was famous. William Hazlitt believed that as Sir Giles 'he had no equal' in the 'soul and spirit of the part'; it was Charles Dickens's favourite role as an amateur actor. \n\nA mezzotint engraving by Clint's pupil Thomas Lupton from the finished picture was published in 1833; Lupton himself appears in the painting, fourth from the left.\n \nEXH: <i>The Georgian Playhouse</i> Arts Council Hayward Gallery 1975 (204) \nLIT: C K Adams <i>A Catalogue of the Pictures in the Garrick Club</i> 1936 (408,\n465); G Ashton and I Mackintosh <i>The Georgian Playhouse</i> Arts Council\nHayward Gallery exhibition catalogue 1975 (204)\"",
