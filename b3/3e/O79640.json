In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nBracelets like this, with a band of alternating projections shaped like pyramids and little houses, were more common in the southern part of the region, in Jordan and Palestine, where they are still worn today.  The design may come from the Yemen, where similar bracelets, usually made of filigree, were made and worn by the Jewish community.  Most Syrian jewellery in the 19th century was made by Christian or Jewish silversmiths, and they frequently moved around the region.\n\nThis bracelet was bought for five shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.  Its name was recorded as \u2018ussuar\u2019, which is a generic Arabic name for bracelets in the region.",
