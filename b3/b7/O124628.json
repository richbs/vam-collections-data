He began his career in Basel, where he worked mainly as a painter of altarpieces and designer of woodcuts. He visited England in 1526 to 1528 and through Erasmus, he met Sir Thomas More and his circle. Returning to Basel he received commissions from city authorities and produced designs for stained glass and goldsmiths' work. In 1532 he returned to England, where he worked almost exclusively as a portrait painter, mainly under the patronage of King Henry VIII and his courtiers.\n\nHolbein generated a steady production of stained-glass designs during his time in Basel (1519-1526) prior to his second departure for England in 1532, although, sadly, only a few connected glass panels survived. \nThe panel made after this design, a gift from Erasmus to the University of Basel, has perished.",
