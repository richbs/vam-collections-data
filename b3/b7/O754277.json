After his retirement he drew a small portrait of himself virtually every day, not so much as an exercise in recording his appearance, but as a method of self-analysis. He also made small informal drawings of his son, his friends and acquaintances. These were not made for display but to be kept in albums where they formed a kind of visual memoir.  \n\nThe subject of this drawing is the poet and scholar Francesco Algarotti, Count Algarotti in the Prussian nobility (1712-64). As a young man he was considered to be extremely charming and good-looking. His first visit to England was made in 1736, at the age of 24, the date of this little portrait by Richardson. He also captured Algarotti's features in a profile drawing of the same date, also in the V&amp;A (E.539-1929).",
