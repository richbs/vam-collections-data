The four struts of the handle are held by a vertical oval ring that joins the horizontal flat of the stem. Two copper pins on the inner oval are ornamental. On the underside, three copper pins hold the front end of the vertical strut; another holds the strut at the rear of the inner oval. The underside of the inner oval is chased with a densely stippled surface.",

Form has triumphed over function in this complex and elaborate construction, which questions the relationship between inner and outer spaces. The handle recalls the fossil belemnite form, where the inner body has been replaced with a \u2018skeleton\u2019 of stone. The strength of line and of outline connects this piece with other styles that focus on powerful linear forms. Hence the creator\u2019s sympathy with Celtic traditions and Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u2019s attenuated rectilinear forms, which were the precursors of the Modern Movement.",
