Caskets of wood, brass or steel with such scenes painted or etched onto them were variously used to hold cosmetics, hand mirrors, combs and other items for personal use, or letters and items of jewellery. The latter will have been the likeliest contents in this case as the casket is made of steel and has a complicated locking mechanism. To ensure further safety, the keyhole is carefully hidden underneath the movable central escutcheon, which only the owner would have known about. A further reason for the popularity of this type of casket is their easy portability. Little chests could be snatched up and carried away in times of danger, which made them preferable to larger lockable cabinets or cupboards.",

            "historical_context_note": "The pictorial motif of a gallant and his lady facing each other was a very popular one and is found on several painted, steel and brass coffers. The hidden keyhole is also a characteristic of this type of casket, as are the round ball feet. The lock functions by drawing back two little bolts from the in-turned edge of the front lid; this locking arrangement is found in other caskets of the period. Similar coffers, but reinforced by interlaced iron bands, were produced in great numbers in Southern Germany from the end of the 16th century; they are popularly known as 'Armada chests' and can be considered the forerunners of the modern steel safe. Their locking systems featured up to eight bolts hooked under the in-turned side edges, and they also sometimes had padlocks and a fake keyhole on the front, as well as the real keyhole hidden underneath the central escutcheon. It is possible that the extra security measures employed in this type of chest indicate that it was used to store valuables or money in a purely practical way, rather than as a gift, whereas our casket, characterised by its romantic imagery, is more likely to have been a gift to a lady and used to contain jewellery, letters, or other valuables of a personal nature. It is closer in type and iconography, if not in materials, to the gilt brass caskets produced in their workshops by Michel and Conrad Mann, late 16th century lock and gunsmiths who worked in South Germany, around Augsburg and Nuremberg. By the late Middle Ages, Germany, especially Nuremberg, had become a centre for decorating iron and steel, but the process of preparing it was extremely laborious, so presumably increasing its value.",
