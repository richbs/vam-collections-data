A cupid in the foreground holds a drawn bow with an arrow pointing towards her heart.  White enamel chapter ring with Roman numerals and half-hour marks.  Gilt-metal hands.  Brass movement plates.  Cylindrical pillars.  Fusee and chain.  Verge escapement.  Balance wheel and spring, with regulator of Tompion type, with rotating silvered dial, numbered 1 to 6.  Bridge balance-cock with mock pendulum aperture: engraved numerals 1 to 6 visible through the aperture.  Two steel hands are screwed on top of the cock at the ends of the mock pendulum aperture.  The cock is cast with a naked cupid setting fire to a heart by concentrating the rays of the sun with a magnifying glass.  The rim of the cock outside the pendulum aperture is engraved 'HOWELL HY VER AF IS'.   Pierced and engraved scrollwork applied to the top plate and the maker's name as below.",

            "public_access_description": "Enamelled watchcases continued to be valued in the eighteenth century. Some were turned into gold boxes.  Others, like this one, had a more movement inserted.\n\nIn about 1630  improved techniques made it possible to execute miniature painting in enamel in a wide range of colours. The metal  was covered with an enamel ground and fired in the kiln. It was then painted with metal oxides mixed with oil. Each  colour had to be fired in turn to fuse it onto the enamel ground. Such was the potential of the new technique that  some watchcases, like this one, became wider and flatter to provide an extensive surface for enamelling.  The  technique was used to decorate watchcases and other goldsmiths' work as well as to paint portraits in minature.\n\nThe key figures in this development, among whom the leading role is given to Jean Toutin (1578-1644), were  enamellers and goldsmiths in Paris, Blois and Ch\u00e2teaudun who had close links with watchmakers. \n\nThere has been considerable discussion about how the techniques employed in the new painted enamels differed  from those which went before, but it is apparent that the effect was different: previously it had not been possible to  create enamel paintings in such a wide range of colours as to rival or to copy an oil painting.",
