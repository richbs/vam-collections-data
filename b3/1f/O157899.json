The belief that bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ when consecrated during Mass was reaffirmed in the 16th century. It was a central decree issued by the Council of Trent which set out to confirm and strengthen the doctrines of the Catholic Church. This led to the increased production of exquisite vessels for Catholic worship.\n\nThe vine and wheat sheaf motifs on the ciborium refer to wine and bread: the blood and body of Christ in the Eucharist. The crown and orb are symbols universally associated with royalty and power. On this Christian ciborium they are brought together with the dove to represent the trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
