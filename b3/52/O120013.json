They were used to protect and enhance both secular and religious paintings. \n\nAs well as many picture frames acquired with paintings, the V&A acquired some frames - principally Italian renaissance in origin or style - as independent objects. They were usually chosen for the fine quality of their carving and decorative effects, and many are gilded using various techniques. Many of the ornaments used are classical and architectural in origin.\n\nThis type of ebony veneered frame was made in Augsburg, Naples and northern Italy around the early 17th century. The extreme hardness of ebony makes it difficult to date, but the use of a pearwood backframe (instead of, for example, poplar or a softwood) and the very clean condition of the gilt ornament makes it possible that this was actually made in the 19th century.",
