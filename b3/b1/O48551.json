People continued to use tablespoons  to eat soup  until the early 20th century.The Manners and Tone of Good Society, written in about 1880, recommended: 'Table spoons are always used when partaking of soup; it would be considered ridiculous to use a dessert spoon for that purpose.'\n\nThe Victorian Meal\nFrom the 1860s Victorian society embraced the new method of serving dinner known as \u00e0 la Russe, which fundamentally changed the look of the dining table. Previously food had been set out in silver and ceramic dishes and diners helped themselves, but with dinner \u00e0 la Russe each course was served individually to guests by servants. The silver entr\u00e9e dishes and ceramic tureens gave way to lavish floral displays in glass vases and ceramic fruit stands. The cover or place setting assumed a greater importance and occupied a larger area of the dining table. The Habits of Good Society, written around 1859 to give guidance on etiquette, described a place setting: 'Two large knives and a silver fork and fork for fish, a table spoon for soup, three large forks, a glass for sherry, a glass for hock and a glass for champagne.'\n\nDesign & Designing\nFrom the 1840s mass-produced cutlery, machine-made in Sheffield, expanded the choice of quality and pattern for consumers. This spoon was made in the popular King's pattern, but the Sheffield manufacturers James Dixon & Sons offered 28 different designs for cutlery sets in their catalogue of 1892.",

People continued to use tablespoons  to eat soup  until the early 20th century.<i>The Manners and Tone of Good Society</i>, written in about 1880, recommended: 'Table spoons are always used when partaking of soup; it would be considered ridiculous to use a dessert spoon for that purpose.'<br><br>\n\n<b>The Victorian Meal</b><br>\nFrom the 1860s Victorian society embraced the new method of serving dinner known as <i>\u00e0 la Russe<i/>, which fundamentally changed the look of the dining table. Previously food had been set out in silver and ceramic dishes and diners helped themselves, but with dinner <i>\u00e0 la Russe</i> each course was served individually to guests by servants. The silver entr\u00e9e dishes and ceramic tureens gave way to lavish floral displays in glass vases and ceramic fruit stands. The cover or place setting assumed a greater importance and occupied a larger area of the dining table. <i>The Habits of Good Society</i>, written around 1859 to give guidance on etiquette, described a place setting: 'Two large knives and a silver fork and fork for fish, a table spoon for soup, three large forks, a glass for sherry, a glass for hock and a glass for champagne.'<br><br>\n\n<b>Design & Designing</b><br>\nFrom the 1840s mass-produced cutlery, machine-made in Sheffield, expanded the choice of quality and pattern for consumers. This spoon was made in the popular King's pattern, but the Sheffield manufacturers James Dixon & Sons offered 28 different designs for cutlery sets in their catalogue of 1892.",
