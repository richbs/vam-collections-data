After the Second World War he worked briefly for Edward Molyneux (1891\u20131974). \n\nThis elegant, pared down design is a typical early 1950s shape with its fitted bodice and full skirt, and would probably have been worn with a matching stole around the shoulders.  The fabric is exceptional, with its complex double-weaving technique that creates an unusual frayed \u2018ribbon work\u2019 effect.  The white silk threads are interwoven with the grey organza.",
