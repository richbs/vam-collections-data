The text is as follows: BOLOGNA: mid 16th century 436 Design (elevation) for the decoration of an interior wall, probably a clerestory in a church. Pasted into a frame in the centre a design (by another hand) for a painting of the Assumption of the Virgin. Inscribed in ink in a later hand \u2018Giorgio Vasari\u2019 Another inscription in French on the back gives a short description of the drawing and states that it is from Vasari\u2019s collection Inscribed also in pencil \u2018Vente de M. Reville\u2019 Pen and ink and wash, with certain details tinted in water-colour 15 \u00bc x 22 \u00bc (387 x 565) C.1710-1885 PROVENANCE The name Reville in the inscription may refer to Narcisse Revil (Lugt 2138, where the various sales of drawings are listed) Neither the design for the Aussumption nor the architectural setting is typical of Vasari; nor is there any evidence in the drawing or the mount to support the statement on the back that the drawing was in his collection. The graphic style of the inset design suggest a Bolognese artist working under the influence of Raphael.",
