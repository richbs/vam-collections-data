Angelo Calabro, Rome, 1989.\n\nHistorical significance: F.M.Granet, the artist on whose painting this mosaic picture is based, studied with Jacques Louis David (1748-1825) and lived in Rome from 1802-1819. In 1810 one of his paintings was acquired by the Empress Josephine. His Choir of the Capuchin Church was bought by Caroline Murat (1782-1839) Queen of Naples, on completion in 1815. Her brother Louis Bonaparte persuaded her to give it to him so he could display it in the Paris Salon of 1819. Before long, almost every sovereign of Europe demanded a version of the painting and Granet spent the following four years producing sixteen copies, each one slightly different in detail. Alexander I of Russia, Charles IV of Spain, the Duchess de Berry, George IV of England, Louis XVIII of France and Napoleon III all owned versions. The American artist Thomas Sully (1783-1872) made a large scale copy of it in 1821 which was displayed in various parts of America.",

Wekler, Master of Mosaics at the Russian Royal Academy of Art, was asked by the Tsar to produce a micromosaic version of the painting in 1825. That Tsar died before it had been completed.",
