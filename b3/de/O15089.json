The expression on the face of the fruitseller, stationed outside the country school door, is well-observed, at once amused and disapproving, but alert to the fact that the mother is reaching into her purse.  While in eighteenth-century pictures of similar subjects, the vendor would have been a pretty young woman, here the features of the stall-keeper is contrasted with the youth and attractiveness of her customers.",

Exhibited 79 works at the RA between 1848 and 1887, 26 at the BI 1847-67, and 15 at the SBA 1851-9 and 1881/2. Subjects mainly genre, often involving children.

The<u> Art Journal</u> wrote: 'The objects of trial are some children, who are assembled round a fruit stall, presided over by a hard-featured old woman, sensible only to the touch of coined metal. She is a highly successful study. In the face there is a living truth not very often attainable'. \nA small oil study for the work was included in a group of studies sold at Christie's 2 February 1923 (111). The artist also exhibited 'The Fruit Stall' at the BI in 1852 (149, size given in the catalogue including frame as 27 by 25 inches). A similar subject, 'The Cherry Seller', with apparently the same female model, was recorded in a London private collection in 1969; this was possibly the 'Cherry-seller' exhibited at the RA in 1855 (1347). \nThe painting was reproduced in colour as a birthday greetings card published by the Medici Society Ltd. \n\nEXH: RA 1850 (69) \n\nLIT: <u>Art Journal </u>1850, p166 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
