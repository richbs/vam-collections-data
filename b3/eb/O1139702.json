I don't mention this to dishearten you as it was an entirely different complaint being exceedingly harmful and which when it gets in to the system takes a long time to eradicate.\nYours I trust will be very brief and from such good nursing and medical advice which I am sure you get coupled with your excellent constitution I have not much doubt but that we shall see you about again shortly.\nWhat with my weekly trip to Boringdon and other matter connected with Cannon St I have not any time to spare otherwise I would come and see you but nevertheless I frequently think of you having myself as previously mentioned passed thro [sic] the same unpleasant ordeal of illness and can therefore sympathise with you\nYour Aunt Louisa came rather unexpectedly to town yesterday medical advice as she is not very well and returned by herself last evening thro some misunderstanding with Mr Brookng the rector of Boringdon which I have not yet heard explained as it was arranged that he would call here and take her home.\nI have nothing further to add only that I hope it may please Providence that you may soon be restored to your usual good health,\nAnd Believe me Dr Anne\nYour very sincerely \nJohnathan Hale",

The four letters and two receipts provide a small insight into the life of Anne Hale and her relations during the period of Miss Hale's move from her teenage years into adulthood. \n\nThis particular letter is written to Anne Hale possibly from her cousin Jonathan Hale wishing her well after an undisclosed illness.",
