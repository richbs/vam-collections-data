The four shells around the central well each would have held a little salt. Elaborate sets of tableware were commissioned by wealthy patrons but tablewares were also given as gifts. Painting decoration onto tin-glazed earthenware was a difficult skill to master. The grotesque decoration used on pieces like this was derived from ancient Roman sources.
