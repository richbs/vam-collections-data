            "public_access_description": "An armchair similar to this one was shown by the manufacturer Jeanselme at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, where it was described as 'Etruscan style'. The design of the armchair is considerably earlier than 1851, however. It was orignally made by Filippo Palagi for the 'Camera di Toiletta' of Queen Maria Theresia, at Raconnigi, a palace south of Turin, in about 1834. The chairs for Racconnigi were probably made by the Parisian cabinet-maker Claude Chiavasse who made a similarly inlaid table. It is possible that Chiavasse was working with the Jeansealme firm in 1834 as well and Jeansealme may have been able to secure the design. This might explain why Jeanselme produced the series of armchairs of which this one forms part almost 20 years later.",
