This process takes place with each separate colour, which is slowly dried before another is applied. The consequence is that in the finished paper there is a considerable mass of solid colour. / \nMACHINE-PRINTED PAPERS are produced at a great speed, all the colours being printed at one time and rapidly dried in a heated gallery. In consequence of the speed at which they are printed, there is merely a film of colour deposited on the surface of the paper. / \nFOR PERMANENT USE we strongly recommend the hand-printed paper. / \n\nThe machine-printed papers are placed at the end of one of the books or in a msall book by themselves. / \n\nShow Rooms: / \n449, Oxford Street, London, W.'",

V&A Publications. London. 2002. pp. 118. pl 103.\nAn excerpt of the entry is as follows:\n\n'This upright stand-book was typically used in wallpaper showrooms to display the range of patterns to customers. This example is big enough to show a full repeat of all but the very largest patterns. 'Table books', which could be loand out, were rather smaller. The book includes a small selection of machine-printed papers, though the introduction stresses their inadequacies in comparison to the hand-block printed versions.'\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996, pp.206-207, ill.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n<b>L.3</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Fruit</i> (also known as <i>Pomegranate</i>), 5 \nDesigned by William Morris; designed and first issued c. 1866 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 68.6 x 50.0 cm \nV&A (E.446-1919) \nGiven by Morris & Co. \n\nThis pattern is usually given an earlier date because the serial numbering in the printing log places it between <i>Daisy</i> and <i>Trellis</i>. Mackail, however states (p.176) that Morris was seen at Queen Square working on the design for <i>Pomegranate</i> in 1866. Mackail's notes also show that Campfield, the firm's foreman, recollected the design being made at Queen Square (i.e. no earlier than 1865). There are strong resemblances between <i>Fruit</i> and the painted panels that form part of the decoration of the Green Dining Room at the South Kensington Museum, 1866. A letter from Warrington Taylor, probably of 1867 (NAL 86.SS.57) calls it 'our last new paper'. \n\nThe design is built up of the repetition of four rectangular elements. It appears more complex than <i>Daisy</i> because of the diagonally thrusting branches and because leaves from each rectangle creep into the adjoining spaces. Two versions for the design are recorded (see The Arts Council, <i>Morris and Company Centenary</i>, 1961) but their current whereabouts are unknown.' \n\n\u2018Mackail\u2019 refers to: Mackail, J. W. <u>The Life of William Morris</u>. London, 1899.\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996.
