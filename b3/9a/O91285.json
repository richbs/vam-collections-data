The only photographs attributed to Bellocq are images of prostitutes and their surroundings. They are remarkable for their relaxed portrayal of nudity (or here, where the sitter wears a total body stocking, a parody of nudity). Bellocq\u2019s work became widely known when photographer Lee Friedlander bought his damaged glass negatives and made new prints from them. Friedlander\u2019s interpretation of this secret archive is now as much a part of the history of these photographs as the scant details known of Bellocq\u2019s life. Despite their \u2018discovery\u2019 and promotion, we still do not know why Bellocq made these curious images, and they have lost little of their mystery or charm.",
