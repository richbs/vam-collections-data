Wrought iron firedogs survive from the Iron Age and the basic design has remained unchanged. Until the early 16th century firedogs were usually made of wrought iron but records confirm that from the 1540s onward cast iron firedogs were produced in great numbers.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis firedog is of cast iron, a material first used in Europe around 1400 for military purposes. In Britain, military and domestic objects were being made from this material by around 1500. Using cast iron to make firedogs was cheaper and quicker than using wrought iron and it  had the advantage of making the mass production of a single design possible.\n\nPeople\nThe inscription on this firedog, 'Wyllam Man', probably refers to the name of the owner rather than the maker.",
