After his huge success in the role, several different figurines of Liston as Pry were produced based on contemporary engravings.  Some of the figures were porcelain and others, like this, were the cheaper earthenware. The play was enormously popular throughout the 19th century. Paul Pry's catch-phrases 'I hope I don't intrude', 'Just dropped in' and 'It's nothing me to' were quoted everywhere, and the name Paul Pry became a well-known term for a busybody. The character regularly carried an umbrella, seen here under his left arm.\n\nListon achieved his greatest successes in farce, particularly as Paul Pry, but was also well known for several other roles which were also seen in drawings, painting, engravings and figurines. An expert dancer, Liston became the higest-paid comedian on the stage, earning  between sixty and a hundred pounds a week at the Olympic Theatre, a huge salary for his day. He retired in 1837 after a career that spanned over thirty years.",
