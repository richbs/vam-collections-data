            "public_access_description": "Francis Frith was one of the most successful commercial photographers from the 1850s and 1860s.   He also established what was to become the largest photographic printing business in England.  This image is part of the V&A's Francis Frith 'Universal Series' archive which consists of over 4000 whole-plate albumen prints predominantly of historical and topographical sites.  Images such as these were highly desirable throughout the 1850s and 1860s. \n\nIt is now known that nearly all of the works bearing the F. Frith and Co. stamp were not taken by Frith himself, but by one of his travelling employees.  Photographers associated with Frith's 'Universal Series' include Robert Napper (Andalusia), Frank Mason Good (Egypt) and Frederick William Sutton and Hugo Lewis Pearson (Japan).  In addition to hiring his own photographers, Frith also bought the negative stocks of established photographers such as Roger Fenton and Francis Bedford.  \n\nFrith's growing business coincided with many technological developments taking place within the field of photography. These developments changed and expanded the audience for photography and Frith's operation was well-prepared to provide for it and, it can be argued, worked to develop it employing a diverse range of publishing channels.  Targeted towards a market that would later adopt the postcard as the ideal format for its needs, the 'Universal Series' forms a bridge between the initial low volume craft/art production associated with photography of the 1850s and the more commercial mass production work of the latter half of the century.\n\nBarrackpore developed as a country retreat outside Calcutta for the Governor-General, the Marquis of Wellesley. These bungalows were built after 1801 in the park surrounding the Governor-General\u2019s residence to house secretaries, aides-de-camps and visitors.  The architect may have been Lieutenant Charles Wyatt, who reconstructed the main house for Lord Wellesley. They are built of brick covered in white plaster with flat roofs and tall rooms inside with windows placed to allow cross-draughts to keep the interiors cool. The classical style is typical of British housing in India from the late 18th to the mid-19th centuries.",
