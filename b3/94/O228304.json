Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  They used thin sheet gold to make impressive pieces of jewellery, and decorated them with glass stones made to look like real gems.  The red stone in this pendant looks like a genuine garnet, but it is probably a doublet, made from a tiny sliver of garnet stuck to the front of a transparent glass stone.\n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  The shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Foggia, in Apulia, but earrings covered in seed pearls were common throughout southern Italy in the 19th century.  The goldsmiths there made lavish use of seed pearls, which were abundant in the warm waters of the Mediterranean before the industrial age.  They attached the seed pearls with thin gold wires.  When these broke, as they frequently did, the pearls were lost.  \n\nMost Italian traditional earrings have pendants.  The original owner of this one would probably have hung a large matching pendant from its wire, which has since been lost.  It was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
