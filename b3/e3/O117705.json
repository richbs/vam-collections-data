The coat is cut in the style of court dress, which suggests that it was worn for ceremonial events.\n\nDuring the late 18th and early 19th century there was a revival of archery in Britain. The numbers of societies rapidly increased and with them the regulations governing dress. Many publications offered advice. The Bijou Book of Out-Door Amusements stated: 'The dress of the archer varies in different clubs ... For gentlemen, nothing is better than a green cloth coat with gilt buttons, having the club device upon them.' \n\nFor shooting, a green jacket was recommended. Green is traditionally associated with archery, supposedly originating from medieval foresters and huntsmen who wore it as a form of camouflage. As well as headwear, breeches, boots and equipment, men often had to invest in outfits for different occasions. Archery could be a costly sport, especially as fines could be imposed for not wearing the prescribed uniform.\n\nThe coat was acquired with a collection of costume worn by members of the Lowndes family, formerly of Leahall, Chesterfield, and the Gorst family of Chester.",
