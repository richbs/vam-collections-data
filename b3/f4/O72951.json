The terracotta was probably the one exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 1882. This bust was given to the Museum by Richard Redgrave's children as a memorial to Redgrave's work at the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was made Art Superintendent in 1852, Inspector General for Art in 1857, and Director for Art in 1875.\n\nIn addition to being a painter, Richard Redgrave (1804-1888) was one of the most distinguished administrators of the Victorian era. He was the first Keeper of the paintings collection at the South Kensington Museum and between 1857 and 1880 was Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures. Along with Cole he was a driving force in the reform of art education. Redgrave held several positions in the Government School of Design, including headmaster, art superintendent and inspector-general for art. He trained as a clerk in his father's counting-house before entering the Royal Academy Schools in 1826. After initially supporting himself as a drawing-master, he specialised in contemporary scenes of the poor.",
