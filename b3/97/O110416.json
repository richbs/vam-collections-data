In 1968, she designed Peter Wright's production of The Sleeping Beauty for the Royal Ballet, and the surviving artefacts are little masterpieces of both imagination and craftsmanship.  There were, in fact, so many visual delights that it took several viewings to realise them all.  \n\nIn the ballet Princess Aurora and the Royal Court are put to sleep for a hundred years by the wicked fairy Carabosse. Director Peter Wright and his designer Lila de Nobili took a refreshingly practical attitude to the fairy story and decided that there should be no magical preservation of the costumes, so the whole Court woke wearing outfits that had decayed during their sleep, although fortunately their bodies had not aged one iota. \nOne much appreciated visual touch was the bird's nest built on the head of  the King's minister, Catalabutte, made all the funnier because, despite the appendage, his behaviour was as fussy and officious as ever. In Act I, before the Court falls into its enchanted sleep, Catalabutte wears a domed cap trimmed with ermine. This is attached to a close fitting underhat with long chin straps.  For the Awakening in Act II he wears a similar underhat and on this is placed the bird's nest headdress. Unusually, it is made of real twigs. The nest has a fur trim at its base to give the impression that it has been built on top of Catalabutte's domed cap.",
