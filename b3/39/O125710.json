            "public_access_description": "Karl Heffner (1849-1925) was born in W\u00fcrzburg where he first studied music. He was a pupil of Adolf Stademann (1824-1895) and Adolf Heinrich Lier (1826-1882) in Munich. He travelled extensively in Germany, England, Italy and Holland, exhibited in Vienna and Munich between 1873 and 1883, and in the Royal Academy in London between 1880 and 1881. \n\nHeffner was one of the greatest exponents of the Munich School of Paintings led by A. Stademan and A. G. Lier who were his masters. This painting is part of group of six Swiss views mounted together and depicts the Castle of Chillon on Lake Geneva The castle was built on a site that was both a natural protection and a strategic location to control the passage between northern and southern Europe. Following the Realist technique, this work was probably executed directly after the motif in open air. This work is a fine example of Heffner's mature manner, which became broader and sketchier over the years.",

It is a good example of the Realist movement that developed in the Germanic countries in the second half of the 19th century under the influence of French realism and the Barbizon school.  It was probably executed in open air, following the tradition of Realist paintings. \nThis work may have been painted directly for the English market as Heffner regularly supplied pictures to the English art dealer Thomas Wallis, whose business activities brought to Munich. Such pictures attracted patrons and collectors and hitherto a great extent of Heffner\u2019s oeuvre is to be found in private collections rather in public institutions.",
