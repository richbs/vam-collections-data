Although it was made about 1880, its rigorous, stark form anticipates the modernist designs that began to emerge after the First World War (1914-18). \n\nDresser was perhaps the first independent industrial designer. During his long career he worked for a large and varied number of manufacturers and designed prolifically for many different media. In about 1878 he became art adviser to Hukin & Heath (founded 1855), a Birmingham firm that manufactured silver and electroplated goods. The firm specialised in novelty items for the luxury market and they were anxious to find a new direction.  A report in the Furniture Gazette on 23 August 1879 marked Dresser\u2019s arrival: \u2018The Firm have secured the services [of Dr Dresser] in order to be reliable in point of design\u2019. Dresser\u2019s designs, such as this toast rack, were stamped with a facsimile of his signature in addition to the Hukin & Heath maker\u2019s mark",
