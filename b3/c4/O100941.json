Sides open from the waist to hem and on either side of the openings pleated panels inserted to give fullness to the skirt.   Under arms and down edge-to-edge front elaborate arabesque motifs as 'frogging', of black silk bordered with silver strip over a padded base, finished with bright sequins held by silver thread knots.  Down centre back and from shoulders four strips of silver braiding, accenting line of body, which meet at the waist and continue into the skirt.",
