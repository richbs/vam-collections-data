The house, which no longer exists, was the summer residence of the great art collector Robert Vernon. He collected British paintings of the time. Two years before his death in 1849 he gave 157 works to the nation. Most of the paintings are now in Tate Britain.\nJohn James Chalon painted this watercolour around 1840. Experts originally thought that it was by his brother Alfred Edward Chalon, who was also an artist.",

Bryant, 'Finest Prospects - Three Historic Houses: a study in London Topography', English Heritage, 1986\n'Chalon's Studio sale of 1861included an upright watercolour entitled Marble Hall Cottage and the Thames (7) and The grounds and front of Marble Hall with Mr. Vernon and a dog (75). The group to which this watercolour belongs, presumably commissioned by Vernon, also includes an oil painting of the cottage with Richmond Hill in the background (cat.58) and an oil painting of the cottage seen from Richmond Hill (cat.70)\n'A Hand-Book to Richmond & Twickenham' of 1842 gives the following account of the house:\n\"After walking through Twickenham Meadows we arrive at a beautiful green terrace-walk on the margin of the Thames, where our attention is immediately attracted by Marble Hill Cottage, belonging to W.B.Brent, Esq., seen through the stately trees which surround it. This charming retreat, so justly esteemed for its fine situation and tasteful arrangement, is screened by a rustic verandah, completely covered by the jessamine, woodbine, clematis, and rose, and its lawn bedecked with lovely flowers; while over the bower itself immense trees spread with their giant arms, as if to protect a cabinet of beauties destined to be the dwelling of Flora herself.'\n\nMr Vernon is probably the same Robert Vernon as the army horse dealer who became a major patron of contemporary British painting by buying works direct from artists in the 1820s; his collection now hangs at the Tate Gallery.'",
