Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, June-September 1970.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'George Cruikshank (1792-1878)\n<b>The maniac father and the convict brother are gone.- The poor girl, homeless, friendless, deserted, destitute, and gin mad, commits self-murder.\n</b>Drawing for the last plate of <i>The Drunkard\u2019s Children</i>, published 1 July 1848\nSigned in ink <i>George Cruikshank</i>\nPencil and pink wash.\n9429.H\n\nOn acquiring a copy of <i>The Drunkard\u2019s Children</i>, a publication which recorded the downfall of the Drunkard\u2019s family in eight plates, attributing all their troubles to alcohol, Dickens felt compelled to write \u2018a few words by way of gentle protest\u2019 in the Examiner. He praised the plates lavishly and limited his criticism to Cruikshank\u2019s philosophy. Dickens believed that the artist\u2019s teaching should begin with the causes of alcoholism rather than its effect. Dickens retained the attitude expressed in \u2018Gin Shops\u2019 in 1835 all his life.\n\nDrinking is \u2018a vice in England, but wretchedness and dirt are greater\u2019. If \u2018temperance societies would suggest an antidote against hunger, filth and foul air, or could establish dispensaries for the gratuitous distribution of bottles of Lethe-water, gin palaces would be numbered among the things that were\u2019. Later he tried to cure the roots of the trouble with his work on the Committee of the Metropolitan Sanitary Association and with Miss Burdett Coutts.'",
