There is a selvedge at either side of the length.\nThe compact nature of the material comes from the way it is woven. It has a second set of warps (longitudinal threads) to bind the design-making wefts (transverse threads). In Europe, the term lampas is used for such a weave. This term is difficult to translate into Chinsese as traditionally textiles have been classified in other ways. The Chinese term <i>jin</i>, an all-embracing name for any multi-coloured patterned cloth, would be the word used to describe this silk.\nThe weight and style of the cloth make it suitable for decorating Chinese-style book covers, and silk of this type is also used in several different ways on scroll paintings, albums of pictures and folding screens. It could also have been used as a furnishing fabric.",
