In the form known as 'pilgrim bottle',  the decoration is in fact Chinese in inspiration. This vase would impress as evidence of the owner's knowledgeable and artistic taste.\n\nPeople\nRichard William Binns (died 1900), art director at Worcester, was an enthusiast for East Asian ceramics, after seeing the displays from Japan in the International Exhibition in London in 1862.  He collected Japanese, Chinese and Korean ceramics himself and encouraged the factory's designers to use images and motifs from these countries in their designs.  James Hadley (1837-1903) worked for Worcester from the mid-1860s until 1875, when he left to work as a freelance modeller.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis vase and its pair were exhibited by Thomas Goode's at the Annual International Exhibition held in 1872.  This exhibition was the second in a series instigated by Henry Cole (1808-1882) and held in the galleries around the Horticultural Gardens between the (present) Royal Albert Hall and the Natural History Museum (the site of the 1862 International Exhibition).  The series was not a success, however, and closed  in 1874.",
