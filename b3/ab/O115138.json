It was bought by the Indian Museum in 1855, almost certainly from an exhibition which may have been the Paris Exposition Universelle of that year, and was presumably made not long before. It was transferred to the South Kensington Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum, in 1879. The form is extremely unusual, but was identified as the traditional form called \"jhapta\", or \"jhumka\" when reproduced in a book by Zulekha Haque, Gahana. Jewellery of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Small & Cottage Industries Corporation, Dhaka, 1984, fig. 65 and p. 48).",
