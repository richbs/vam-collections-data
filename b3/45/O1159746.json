Vanderck in a production of Le philosophie sans le Savoir. \n\nBelow the image is the quote:\n\"Mon fils est mort!...Je l'ai vu l\u00e0...et je ne l'ai pas embrass\u00e9...\" (Acte V, sc. V).\n\nLe Philosophe sans le savoir is a comedy  in five acts written by Jean-Michel Sedaine. Although it was due to be performed at La Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise on 21st October 1765, the pressure to censor the play's perceived praise of 'the duel' delayed the opening night. It was eventually performed, with changes, in early 1766 and continued to be staged up until the 1880s.\n\nThe hero of the play is the lawyer, Mr.Vanderk, an aristocrat turned merchant, who shows his 'philosophic' qualities by coping simultaneously with his son's involvement in a duel and his daughter's marriage to a lawyer.\n\nPraised for its focus on the drama within the domestic sphere the play was also applauded as a vindication of 'philosophic' virtues in action and a reply to Palissot's Les Philosophes.\n \nThe design is part of the Harry Beard Collection.",
