The crackled glaze is a deep greenish colour. The lid is missing and the glaze has been wiped off the underside of the foot, which bears spur marks made of fireclay mixed with sand.

            "public_access_description": "The kundika (water sprinkler) was a popular object during the Koryo dynasty (918-1392), when it was made in ceramics as well as bronze. This kundika has an ovoid shouldered body, a tall neck surmounted by a disc-shaped piece and a slender tubular spout. On one side of the shoulder there is a projecting mouth through which to fill the vessel with water, and on the base there is a recessed ring. It is covered with a crackled celadon glaze and has black-and-white inlaid decoration featuring willow trees and swimming ducks. \nThe development of sanggam inlay is one of the crucial components of Koryo celadon making. The method was an independent achievement by Koryo craftsmen at a time when inlay was not used by Chinese potters, and it has come to represent the elegance and gracefulness of Koryo period art. The inlay technique is believed to have derived from metal and lacquer wares on which it had been used several centuries earlier. The method of inlay is different to that of incised and carved designs. First the motif is carved into the clay body, and the resulting grooves are covered with black or white slip. Excess slip is scraped off and the piece is biscuit fired, before being glazed and fired again. The ensuing design is clearly visible underneath the thin and highly translucent glaze.",
