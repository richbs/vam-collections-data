Wedgwood's amphora is a purely decorative imitation of a piece from classical antiquity, and was probably intended for display in a private library or other domestic interior. It was made at a time when vases were enormously popular. Wedgwood exploited and promoted this fashion, boasting of his intention of becoming 'Vase Maker General to the Universe' in 1769.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe amphora is made of Black Basalt, one of several types of pottery Wedgwood developed or perfected in order to respond to shifts in taste. The pottery body and the colour scheme were inspired by ancient Greek pottery. Wedgwood called the type of painting on this piece 'encaustic'. The name originally indicated an ancient Greek and Roman technique of painting in which pigments are worked in hot wax. Wedgwood's encaustic decoration was hand-painted in a mixture of enamel pigments and slip (a mixture of clay and water), and then fired onto the body. Unlike Jasper, his greatest invention, Wedgwood patented his encaustic process. However, the patent gave him little protection and the technique was immediately taken up by other potters.",
