He was best known as the creator of spectacular and amusing scenery and costumes for revue, musicals and pantomimes. He successfully combined theatre work with a career at the famous London department store, Fortnum and Mason, where he was head designer, and for which he devised the clock that had become the shop's symbol..\n\nThe revue, Slings and Arrows, was devised by Hermione Gingold, who also starred in the show, and by Charles Hickman, and was staged at the Comedy Theatre in 1948.  The design shows a Victorian family taking tea in one of the Opening Tableau. It is a good example of Sutcliffe's witty, decorative style, which conveys character as well as costume, and is heavily annotated with details of the required colours and materials. The design was given to the Museum by the actress, Gwen Cherrell, who appeared in the revue herself.",
