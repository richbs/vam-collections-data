My method has been to treat the lithograph as a medium of expression in itself so that the final result becomes something which could not be produced in any other way and is not merely a reproduction of a work on canvas or paper.  For 'Egyptian Eclogue' I made no preliminary sketch and constructed the design by thinking only in terms of five superimposed colours.  I had intended to produce a series by this method, but was compelled to abandon the project for various reasons.  The proof is one of three existing successful proofs all differing slightly.\"",
