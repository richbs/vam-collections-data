The image is signed by the artist, E.P.Kinsella, in the bottom right hand corner, 1919.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1938 the Lyceum Theatre was run by the Melville Brothers, Walter (1875-1937) and Frederick (1876-1938). During this period the theatre established a reputation for staging some of the West End\u2019s premier pantomimes, rivalling those staged at the traditional home of pantomime, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nMany of the elaborate pantomimes staged at the Lyceum during this period were written by Frederick Melville.  They were often written in rhyming couplets, with deliberately dreadful puns. As well as seeking to restore the narrative elements of pantomime, the Melvilles recognised the importance of spectacle, investing in stunning scenery and costumes. They also indulged in a great deal of \u201cSlap-stick\u201d and the comedians they employed specialised in plate-smashing, messy cake-making in the palace kitchens, and very messy \u201cpapering the parlour\u201d scenes. \n\nThe 1919 production of Dick Whittington and His Cat was written by Newman Maurice, with costumes by Clarkson. It starred Miss Mabel Lait as Dick Whittington, George Bass as Idle Jack, and Miss Edith Drayson as Alice, the Alderman\u2019s daughter.",
