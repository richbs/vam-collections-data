He has been combining computer graphics with painting since 1988, working both with physical and digital paint. Photography is an important element of Faure Walker's practice and he uses his digital camera in a snapshot photography style for the means of collecting the 'everyday' he encounters. These photographic elements within a painting give a glimpse of the 'real world' in contrast to the otherwise abstract geometric patterns.\n\nFrom the mid-seventies he has engaged in art-criticism and in 1976 he co-founded the journal Artscribe, which he edited up until 1983.  He is the author of 'Painting the Digital River: how an artist learned to love the computer', published by Prentice Hall in 2006.",
