The highly prolate handle is formed by interweaving, in a loose long tapered corkscrew shape, twisted striated strips of 16 gauge silver, along with some gold strips and several gold beads.  The strips are bound at the front of the handle by an everted, peened round collar, and are all gathered under a pricked irregularly rounded cap.  They recall the tangled seaweed of the caption name.  The handle is held to the apron by a small diamond capped pin.  It terminates in a long tapering shape that culminates in a grey pearl.  The completed slice was oxidised and then selectively highlighted.",

The blade is sharply dished and shaped as an angled scimitar. The sharp point and serrated edge evoke the menacing presence of deep sea creatures. The handle is a wondrous display of technical ability combined with beautiful design. It is formed of interweaving striated strips of silver and gold with beaded details. The strips are bound to the blade with a peened round collar under a pricked round cap. The irregularity of the intricately textured joint juxtaposed with the elegance of the twisting handle captures the essence of natural forms. The piece is beautifully embellished with gold details, a diamond capped pin that secures blade to handle and a grey pearl finial. This ingenious piece has a mysterious, evocative presence.",
