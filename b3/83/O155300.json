He is perhaps best known for his collaborations on experimental film with Frances Bruguiere in the 1920s and 1930s.  This experimental photograph made ca. 1940 was intended to serve as the cover of a magazine called 'New Voices', edited by Nicholas Moore.  The magazine was never published, and this photograph remains a unique survival of that project.  The image is thus a relic of literary and artistic Modernism in Britain.",
