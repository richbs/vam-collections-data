The vase is also formed of narrow strapwork, the body with shell-like, overlapping motifs, and is filled with a symmetrial arrangement of formalized flowers. On either side of the flowers are further scrolls, with in-curved lower ends.  In the pattern repeat these form an arched motif between the urns, which supports a vertical section of strapwork ending between the C-scrolls of adjacent plinths. This strapwork is outlined with plain fillets flanking a serpentine floral trail against a dotted ground. The ground is overall filled with formalized flowers and leaves. \n\nConstruction\nThe mould is composed of six planks of softwood of unequal widths, butt-jointed and with battens of beech cut as sliding dovetails running into the back of the mould at top and bottom from the right side. A batten of softwood is screwed behind the top edge, presumably as a recent addition to allow the board to hang.",

Such deposits would not have resulted from use in making embossed leather.  At present we cannot be certain of the use of the mould, but it is possible that it was related to the making of early wallpapers.",

This wooden mould is no longer thought to be for embossing leather, as it was previously thought to be. The main reasons for that are:\n- the pattern has been cut out with straight edges of 90 degrees\n- the cut out pattern shows no details at all (which all the embossed leather do)\n- the mould shows many traces of having been cleaned (to take the lefts over out, after the printing). With embossing leather, there are no left overs. \n- gilt leather with this pattern has not been traced at all, although this mould has been published in 1971, and early 18th century gilt leather is not rare at all. \nEloy Koldeweij, October 1996",
