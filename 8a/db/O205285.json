These were often made of filigree, which was considered synonymous with traditional jewellery of all kinds in the 19th century.  \n\nThis cross is made of silver-gilt filigree, in a style which is typical of north-eastern Italy, particularly the region around Venice.  The front of the cross opens, so that the owner could place a small piece of material of religious significance, such as a fragment of a priest's vestment, inside it.\n\nIt comes from the Marches, and was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
