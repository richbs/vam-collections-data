The way the patterns line up once it has been cut is testament to the skill of the weaver.  This is an example of Ewe weaving; the Ewe people come from the South Eastern part of Ghana\u2019s Volta region.  The cloth is made up of 19 strips which are each about 10cm wide and 280cm long.  The size of this cloth makes it likely that it was intended as a man\u2019s wrapper.  \n\nEwe cloth differs from other Ghanaian weaving traditions, such as Asante, because figurative designs are included in the patterns.  These patterns often relate to proverbs which are an important part of Ewe culture.  This cloth has a pattern of leaves which relates to the proverb \u2018I will not survive if I am plucked from the tree\u2019.  \n\nThis cloth was bequeathed to the museum by Mary Kirby, a weaver herself, she also taught weaving.  She collected textiles from around the world and used them as teaching aids.",
