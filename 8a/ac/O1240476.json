His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international  reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nDer Rosenkavalier, an opera by Richard Strauss (1909-1910), was mounted at Glyndebourne in 1959 in tribute to Carl Ebert, who retired that year after 25 years as the director of Glyndebourne.  The action takes place in 18th century Vienna during the reign of Empress Maria Theresa. Messel designed the settings and costumes and created a lavish rococo fantasy.  This was his last production for Glyndebourne.\n\nThe boorish Baron Ochs, who is engaged to Sophie, becomes involved in an argument with the Notary over a clause in the marriage contract. At Glyndebourne the Notary was sung by Derick Davies.",

The production designed by Oliver Messel was first performed by the Glyndebourne Festival Opera at Glyndebourne on 28 May 1959.  It was directed by Carl Ebert and featured Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m as Octavian, Regine Crespin as the Marschallin and Anneliese Rothenberger as Sophie.  It was revived at  Glyndebourne in 1960 and 1965. This was Messel\u2019s last Glyndebourne production.  \n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.   The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A  from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord  Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his  popularity as a designer for the stage.  His Glyndebourne designs are regarded as some of his best work.",
