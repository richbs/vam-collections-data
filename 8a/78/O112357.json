He illustrated a number of children's books, including Zig Zag Fables (1897), Uncle Remus (1901), Wanders in Monsterland (1901), Nights with Uncle Remus (1903), The Three Jovial Puppies (1907), The Life of a Foxhound (1910) and The Story of Chanticleer (1913). He lived in Charlwood, Surrey and Cirencester, Gloucestershire. \n\nThis illustration is thought to be an original drawing for John Mills' The Life of a Foxhound, published by Hodder & Stoughton in 1910.",
