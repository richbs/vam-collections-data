ISBN 089835000X. pp.185-187.\n'To understand works such as this, one must keep in mind that Mrs. D\u00fcrer offered her husband's prints for sale in a stall at Nuremberg's market square and at annual fairs as far away as Frankfurt. In the absence of picture postcards, the visitors, as well as the peasants who offered their produce for sale, were likely customers for D\u00fcrer's prints. They had an almost photographic quality, compared to the two-dimensionality of many of the earlier woodcuts which were then still in circulation. It is likely that some of D\u00fcrer's small engravings, like the present one, depict persons who came to the city on market days, and were recognised as such by their audience.\n\nFor the stance of this couple, the artist seems to have taken the \"Stargazer Fool\" (.513) for his model.'\nHeller, Joseph. <u>Das Leben und die Werke Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>.
