In the same year he declared himself in favour of a conciliatory policy towards the American colonies. America is represented here as a black woman who kneels, in gratitude, at Chatham\u2019s feet.\n\nThe convention for depicting the Four Continents as female figures was used as early as the Counter-Reformation to symbolise the worldwide spread of Catholic Christendom. The figures were given wider appeal through their inclusion in the Iconologia of Cesare Ripa, an illustrated book of emblems widely used by artists from the early 17th century.\n\nWithin the convention, \u2018America\u2019 was depicted as an olive-skinned indigenous woman wearing \u2018a Veil folded over her Shoulder; round her Body, an artificial Ornament of Feathers of divers Colours; in one Hand a Bow, and a Quiver by her Side; under one Foot a human Head pierc\u2019d with an Arrow, and a Lizard on the Ground.\u2019 Here, however, she appears as an African woman, alluding to the spread of slavery within the region.",
