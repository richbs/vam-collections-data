Separate pockets were worn mainly by young girls, older women and working class women. They were also a feature of ethnic or regional costume.\nThis silk pocket was purchased in 1907 from a Russian dealer, along with a collection of other textiles from Russia. At the time it was thought to date from the reign of Catherine the Great (1762\u20131796). However, the style of the embroidery suggests a date in the early 19th century. The silk fabric is woven with a wide stripe of moir\u00e9 (watered silk) and a narrow one of twill. A pattern of leaves and roses covers most of the pocket. A view of the back shows how bright the pink binding was originally. The front of the pocket is badly faded possibly due to overexposure to light.",
