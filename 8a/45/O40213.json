            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nIn this page, on the left a Tirthankara or Jina, having attained the degree of a Kevalin (Omniscient) is seated within the triple-walled enclosure or Samavasarana which had prepared by the god Shakra. He delivers a religious discourse on the law to gods, men and animals. On the right is a preaching scene with one monk teaching another in the presence of the Laity. \nThe Kalpasutra text became particularly associated with this opulent blue and gold colour scheme during the mid 15th century.",
