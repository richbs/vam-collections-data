The intention of the series was to highlight the change in the transition between mechanically based and electronically based designs. According to Sowden and du Pasquier mechanical devices have shapes that must be housed in an exterior shell while electronic devices are with regard to their appearance flexible. Both designers made twelve objects for the series. \nThe title of the clock pays tribute to the physicist Werner Heisenberg and his famous 'uncertainty principle' which held that observation of an atomic particle (an electron) changes its location, so that a 'true' location cannot be fixed - an apt metaphor for post-modern ambiguity. Du Pasquier and Sowden were members of the Italian design group Memphis but even their independent work, e.g. the series Objects for an Electronic Age, applies characteristic post-modern features pioneered by the group: the use of plastic laminate and painted steel, the application of ornament, and the rejection of functionality in favour of a sculptural form.",

            "history_note": "The <i>Heisenberg</i> clock is one object of the series <i>Objects for an Electronic Age</i>, initiated and designed by George Sowden and Nathalie du Pasquier. The premise of the series was to mark the transition between mechanically and electronically based designs. The key argument of Sowden and du Pasquier was: 'electronic age objects will be anything'. Sowden claimed: 'If mechanical design is about function, then electronic objects will be about decoration'. According to Sowden and du Pasquier mechanical devices have shapes that must be housed in an exterior shell while an electronic device can become any shape. Both made 12 objects for the series, of which <i>Gracieux Acceuil </i>by du Pasquier (W.32-2010) and <i>Penrose</i> bowl by Sowden are part of the V&amp;A's collection. The title of the clock pays tribute to the physicist Werner Heisenberg, especially his important 'uncertainty principle' which held that observation of an atomic particle (an electron) changes its location, so that a 'true' location cannot be fixed - an apt metaphor for post-modern ambiguity.\n\nDu Pasquier and Sowden met at the inception of the Memphis design group of which they were both core members, and subsequently married. The series <i>Objects for an Electronic Age</i> was the couples own project and not directly connected to Memphis. However, the project employs many distinctive features pioneered by the Memphis group: the use of plastic laminate and painted steel to create a colourful, patterned surface, the use of ornament, and a departure from obvious functionality in favour of a vivid sculptural form. The micro-architectural composition is reminiscent of other designs by Memphis including Ettore Sottsass <i>Murmansk</i> centrepiece (M.35-2010).",
