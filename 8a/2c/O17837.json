If you see a very pretty little picture, with a very large crowd assembled to see it, you may be pretty sure it is by Mulready'.  The artist's bright and precise technique appealed very much to contemporary taste, as did the charm of his subject-matter, both qualities very much in evidence here.  Two errand boys have met: one, a laundry-boy sitting on a basket of linen, has acquired from the Gypsy girls a cabbage-leaf full of black cherries, which he is now trying to lob into his friend's mouth.  The butcher-boy's face is stained with the fruits that have missed, his dog watches with interest, and the accuracy - and humour - of expression provoke comparison between Mulready and such great masters of Dutch seventeenth-century genre as Teniers and Steen.\nOil on lined canvas",

He was persuaded by John Linnell to resume work, and it was finally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1848. Although the technique was much admired, some reviewers thought the subject unworthy of such painterly skill in colour and effect. Mulready's subject matter was frequently criticised as being too low-life or even violent, the disturbing and realistic scenes of children bullying others were too contrary to the current idyllic view of childhood innocence.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Mulready (1786-1863) had four sons of whom he had custody after a bitter separation from his wife, Elizabeth Varley. She was the sister of John Varley, Mulready's first teacher, who remained a lifelong friend in spite of this misfortune.  It is evident he used scenes from their childhood and his own as subject matter for some of his paintings.",

Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \nThe Butt -Shooting a Cherry\n FA148 Neg 15043 \nCanvas, 38.4 \u00d7 45.4 cm (15 \u00bc \u00d7 18 ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nHeleniak (166) records a related watercolour at Glasgow Art Gallery and a chalk drawing in the V&A (6303) \nStephens reports how John Linnell visiting Mulready's studio in 1847 found the long neglected canvas (begun 1822) with a hole in it and very dusty and encouraged Mulready to work on it again, which he did while staying at Capheaton with Sir John Swinburne. When exhibited the picture was well received, the Art Union (1848, p168) commenting: 'There are in this picture qualities which Masaccio and his most distinguished followers did possess; and others for which they strove a life time, qualities which we confess we heartily wish had been bestowed upon another subject'. But The Examiner (1848, p293) wrote: 'For power and richness of colour this picture is marvellous. It lights the room all round it'; while the New Monthly Magazine (1848 Part II, p230) commented: 'one of the gems of the exhibition. If you see a very little picture, with a very large crowd assembled to see it, you may be pretty sure it is by Mulready.' \n\nEXH: \tRA 1848 (160); 1855 (891); William Mulready South Kensington Museum 1864 (95); Arts Council English Romantic Art, 1947 (55); 1964 (23); William Mulready V&A 1986 (143) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
