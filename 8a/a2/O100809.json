The embroidery is executed through two thicknesses of materials, and has not been completed at the sides where the inked design can be seen. The stitches used are split, satin, basket-weave and underside couching (?). The faces and hands of most of the human figures are in pinks and white, but two are depicted with brown skin colour; the clothes are in the more vivid tones of red, blue and green, most have gold borders.\n\nA small piece of the top of the orphrey is missing (the top of the uppermost spandrel), and a full scene is missing from the bottom. This section would probably have added about 9 inches to the length. The embroidery is extremely fresh. The underside not currently visible because the orphrey has been sewn down on a padded support.\n\n<i>Imagery</i>: In the cross-arms are fathers of the church, Saint Peter (holding his attribute the keys to heaven and a book, and standing on a rock) and Saint Paul (identifiable by his sword and book). Scenes from the Life of Christ are shown in the central pillar, contained within spandrels: from bottom to top, the Flagellation (Christ flogged by two men), Christ carrying the Cross, Christ Crucified flanked by the Virgin and St John, and Christ in Judgement with two attendant angels holding the instruments of the Passion (the cross, the spear,  crown of thorns and two scourges.) The image originally at the bottom of the orphrey is missing (only the top of its framing bears witness to its former existence). The contours of Christ's torso and the drapery of his loin cloth are captured through the use of similar shades of the same silk, much more subtley executed than the drapery of the coloured robes of the other figures. The expressions on the faces are particularly vividly depicted; drops of blood fall from Christ's hands, side and feet. \n\nEach spandrel also contains a shield in its upper left and right corner, containing a lion rearing up on its hind legs and wearing a silver coronet - in the language of heraldry, blazoned <i> gules a lion rampant argent crowned or</i>,  for Wokyndon. Along the division between the spandrels two creatures (wyverns or dragons?) confront each other.",

            "public_access_description": "English embroidery was an artistic product which achieved wide fame in the middle ages. It was in demand all over Europe and bought by princes and popes. Almost all the surviving embroidery is ecclesiastical. As it is usually pictorial, it can be compared closely with contemporary illuminated manuscripts and was often referred to in Latin, the language used in documents, as acupictura or painting with the needle. \n\nThe highest quality examples were made in professional workshops between about 1250 and 1350. The detail here of Christ carrying the cross is from an orphrey, a decorative strip - in this case cross-shaped - which would originally have been sewn onto the back of a chasuble. This was the main garment worn by a priest for celebrating the Christian Mass. The rich and exquisite embroidery is worked in silver and silver-gilt thread and coloured silks on a linen background.   \n\nScenes of Christ's passion - his torture and crucifixion - are vividly portrayed, the contours of the faces formed by working spirals of stitches tightly so that the linen underneath was pulled into slight indentations.  The scenes are framed by decorated arches in the style of the favoured Gothic architecture of the period.\n\nThe decoration includes shields for the Wokyndon family, who were benefactors of St Paul's Cathedral. The will of Joan, widow of Sir Nicholas de Wokydon, dated 1322 is in the cathedral archives and she founded a chantry there.",

            "history_note": "Mrs Grace Christie found the orphrey mounted on a 19th century chasuble and still in use in Marnhull, Dorset in 1935. At that stage she was working on a major publication on ecclesiastical embroidery. She recommended to Father William Moylan of Marnhull that he lend the orphrey to the Museum and that it be photographed. By 15 July, the Vicar General had given permission for the loan and photography and the possibility of the orphrey being available for purchase at some later date had been mooted; by 29 August a price was to be discussed; by 13 December permission had been granted for Mrs Christie to publish the embroidery in her forthcoming book.  The Presbytery accepted that a price in line with that given for John of Thanet embroidery (T.337-1921) bought a decade earlier would be appropriate, and by 26 February 1936 was asking for \u00a3600-\u00a3700. On 18 June 1936 the NACF suggested an initial offer of \u00a3500 for the orphrey although they might be able to go up to \u00a3600. They wondered whether an external opinion beyond that of Mrs Christie should be sought on the condition of the object and suggested Sir William Burrell as an appropriate reviewer. Father Moylan accepted the \u00a3500 (24 June 1936). The money was to be invested for the Marnhull Mission.\n\nGrace Christie's note to the NACF stated, 'The piece is typically English in both design and technique. I have examined it closely, and there is no question of any restoration of the needle-work having been attempted; it has not been touched by later hands. To find in these days such an example, almost as fresh as when it came out of the embroidery frame, is a matter for congratulations' (24 June 1936). (Correspondence on file: RP 1936/4228)\n\nAt the time of purchase the arms had not been identified. The chasuble from which the orphrey was removed, was to remain unnumbered and retained for Departmental use (note in accession register, JB, 22 May 1952)\n[Orphrey] Historical significance: This piece is significant for the fine quality of its embroidery and for the fact that it can be associated with a particular family.The embroidery demonstrates why English work was so highly regarded across Europe in this period. The family are important as they are known to have been benefactors of one of the most important churches in London.",

            "historical_context_note": "[Orphrey] The cruciform shape of this orphrey indicates that it would originally have been attached to the back of a chasuble, while its pillar-shaped equivalent would have adorned the front of the same chasuble. In this case, the pillar-shaped orphrey that matched this one does not exist, and the piece taken from the front of the same chasuble (T.31A-1936) was made at a later date, probably in the following century. Only part of it has survived.\n\nThe use of decorative bands over seams can be traced back to the everyday clothing of the first Christians in the late classical period, the clothing from which Medieval ecclesiastical vestments derive. It is thought that they were originally used to cover and strengthen seams (Johnstone, <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>, p. 1). Orphrey bands were usually highly decorative, often created through embroidery, with iconography that related to the life of Christ, and includes images of saints and/or apostles. Sometimes the decoration also incorporates references to the patron who commissioned them (as in this case). Often the orphreys survive when the original garment to which they were attached has been lost, indeed they were recycled over time as the base fabric wore out. The shape usually reveals which particular vestment they were made for - cope, chasuble or dalmatic. In this case, the orphreys were found on a 19th century velvet, which may merely have been the last in a succession of backings since the creation of the orphreys in the 14th century. At the time they entered the museum, this 'life' of the object would not have been as important to the curators as it might be now, hence the divorce of the backing from the orphreys.\n\nChasubles of the date of the orphreys were usually circular in shape, made of patterned silk textiles. It was quite common for the embroidery to be English, while the woven silk was manufactured in Italy or Spain, the two main centres of silk weaving in fourteenth century Europe (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, pp.36-49 ). Archaeological records suggest that by the 14th century, Italian fabrics had ousted Spanish ones (Crowfoot, E. et al., <i>Textiles and Clothing 1150-1450</i>. London: Museum of London Publication, 2006 reprint, p. 89)  Other examples in the Museum collection show that even if the original silk ground survives, often the vestment has been cut down into a less voluminous shape at a later date (e.g. the Erpingham chasuble,T.256-1967). From the point of view of the congregation, the back of the chasuble was most consistently visible during church services, as until Vatican II in the 1960s, the priest faced the altar when saying Mass, raising the host so that it was visible to the faithful (e.g. representation of wedding service from <i>Tr\u00e8s Belles Heures de Notre Dame</i>, Turin, Museo Civico, f. 87, reproduced in Margaret Scott. <i>Late Gothic Europe, 1400-1500</i>. London: Mills and Boon, 1980, pl. 34, p. 84).\n\nThe shields in the spandrels  are blazoned <i> gules a lion rampant argent crowned or</i> for Wokyndon. The Wokyndon family were patrons of St Paul's Cathedral and the cathedral archives contain the 1322 will of Joan, widow of Sir Nicholas Wokyndon. She founded a chantry at the cathedral in 1321.\n\nThe embroidery is representative of <i>Opus Anglicanum</i>(literally English work) which was an artistic product famous throughout the Middle Ages. It was in demand all over Europe and bought by princes and popes. Typically, it has a linen ground which is entirely covered with gold threads couched on to the surface, from the underside; colour is added through a variety of stitches in coloured silks. Almost all the surviving embroidery is ecclesiastical. As it is usually pictorial, it can be compared closely with contemporary illuminated manuscripts and was often referred to in Latin, the language used in documents, as <i>acupictura</i> or painting with the needle. The highest quality examples were made in professional workshops between about 1250 and 1350. In this case the pattern comprises quatre foils, foliate crosses and lions. The effect is similar to the illuminated images in the twenty-six miniatures illustrating the Life of Christ in the Bodleian Library (MS. Gough, Liturg. 8). The figures in these East Anglian miniatures, notably the Flagellation, are similar to those on the orphrey (<i>The Medieval Treasury</i>, p. 203). \n\nThe depiction of the dress of the figures is significant as it picks out high status and low status, good and bad. Long robes since Roman times had denoted high rank, while the short tunic worn over hose was the reserve of the labourer. The Virgin's gown follows the conventions of mediaeval depictions of dress in manuscripts, as her green gown is lined with brown with shield shapes, a shorthand for fur, and a sign of status in medieval dress (Ruse, Evelyn & Bell, Clifford R.'Illustrations of Costume from Historical Sources', <i>Costume</i>, p. 80 ) At this date, blue was only just becoming the usual colour in which to depict her (Pastoureau, Michel. <i>Bleu. Histoire d'une couleur</i>. Paris: Editions du Seuil, 2002, pp.44-47). The depictions of the lower ranking individuals is also suggestive: two of the men flogging Christ are depicted as dark skinned, rather than white like all other figures; the two men flogging Christ ('baddies') wear variegated hose (checked or striped); such variegation often had negative connotations in this period (Pastoureau, Michel. <i>The Devil's Cloth. A History of Stripes and Striped Fabric</i>. New York: Columbia University Press, 2001, pp. 12-23.)",
