Upper: missing.\n\nDESIGN: Field with a brown ground with a row of seven hexagons linked by an arch-shaped pendant. Each hexagon is bordered by dark green or blue/light red/green/light red/dark green lines. The outer one forms a stepped outline on the diagonals. The centre of each hexagon is brown and is divided by a light red horizontal line bearing 2 stylised red blossoms outlined in white. In the centre is a large blue/red blossom with 4 white stylised red blossoms. In each quarter is a multi-coloured rosette and a blue or green and yellow bird-like motif. Some of the hexagons extend into 4 long dark blue stems and flowers. Various geometric motifs are paired across the field.\n\nBORDERS (from the centre):\n\n(1) narrow red stripe.\n(2) brown ground with a double, angular meander in dark blue edged with light red. This forms cartouches, each containing a long dark blue stem and a flower. There is a green diagonal bar between every pair of cartouches. In the centre of each pair (alternately the inner or outer edge) there is half a hexagon which has a dark blue border containing white and red florets and a coloured centre. There is a coloured rectangular block opposite this.\n(3) narrow red stripe.\n(4) reciprocal diamond heads in light red and green.\n(5) narrow light red stripe with a central blue stripe.\n(6) Broad undecorated brown border; there are two pairs of boteh towards the lower end and a single comb-like motif in the middle of the right hand side border.",
