Ballet students today wear much more revealing leotards, with their hair pulled back, but these children could be at almost any general dancing class from the mid-19th century until today.  \nDance schools were attached to many major European opera houses.  They took pupils from an early age and, with luck, a girl would progress through the school and into the company, appearing in ballets and dance sequences in the operas; eventually she would retire with a pension or, sometimes, go back to the school as a teacher. Thus dancing was a secure living at a time when there were few opportunities for women. The Paris Opera was also a haunt of wealthy men, who selected their mistresses from the ballet girls.  Every opera had to contain a ballet at the start of the third act so that the gentlemen could dine before going to the theatre to see the girls. Wagner's Tannhauser caused uproar because the ballet was in Act I and most men missed it.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
