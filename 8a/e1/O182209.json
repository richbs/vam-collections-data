            "history_note": "This is one of four watercolours by Adam Callander (worked 1780-1811) acquired by the museum in 1953 (museum numbers : P.39, 40, 41, 42-1953).  All four works were catalogued at the time as views of \u2018Highcliffe, near Christchurch, Hampshire, the seat of the Marquess of Bute\u2019; today this building is known as Highcliffe Castle, and is now in Dorset.  A written communication from Michael Hill, FSA, architectural historian, has confirmed however that while two of the works show Highcliffe (P.39-1953 and P.40-1953), the other two works show Luton Park, also called Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire (P.41-1953 and P.42-1953).  \n\nBoth  properties belonged to John Stuart (1713-92), 3rd Earl of Bute.  Three of the watercolours by Adam Callander (P.39, 41, 42\u20131953) are in fact copies of oil paintings by Charles Steuart (worked 1765-90), commissioned by Bute of these two houses.  The fourth watercolour (P.40-1953) is likely also to be a copy of a now untraced oil by Steuart.  The oil paintings of the two views of Luton Park (Luton Hoo) are in the Mount Stuart collection: http://www.mountstuart.com/history-and-heritage/bute-collection/  (ref. Frances Russell, 2004, plates 69 and 70). The original oil by Steuart of P.39-1953 is in a private collection (ref. Francis Russell, 2004, plate 77).\n\nFurther reference should be made to Francis Russell, <i>John, 3rd Earl of Bute: Patron & Collector</i>, Merrion Press, 2004.
