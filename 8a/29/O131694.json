The back stiles are carved at the top with inward-facming scroll ornaments. The front stretcher turned with bobbins. The front and side seat rails with a scratch moulding along their outer, lower faces, and all four rails slightly chamfered on the upper, inside edge.\n\nConstruction\nPegged mortise and tenon joints throughout, with split turnings nailed. The seat consists of four oak boards, grained side to side, chamfered on their edges (underside) where they sit in grooves cut in the rails.\n\nModifications\nIt seems possible that the frame has been disassembled and repegged, and the seat boards replaced. With a dark stain overall.",

This chair  would have been used with a separate seat cushion on the solid seat board. The distinctive  carved back-pieces of this chair suggest a south Yorkshire origin. Several workshops must have  produced large quantities in the second half of the 17th century, judging by the numbers of such chairs that have survived.",
