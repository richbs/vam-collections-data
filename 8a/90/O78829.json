It might have been chosen for a woman's gown, a man's waistcoat or his nightgown, worn informally at home. The complexity of its woven structure and the amount of silver thread would have made it expensive, while its bold pattern would have been highly fashionable for a fairly brief period only. For both of these reasons it may have been passed on to the church for re-use.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe silk is thought to be English, dating from about 1708, because of  its similarity to designs of this date by James Leman. Leman was born into a weaving family of Huguenot descent and was apprenticed to his father, on whose death he took over the family business in Spitalfields, London. He trained as a designer as well as a manufacturer, very unusually for the English industry. His dated designs from the early 18th century are the earliest proof of the high standards being achieved in English silk-weaving in competition with imports from France.",

Although it was found by a dealer in France and is part of an ecclesiastical set which generally suggests a continental origin, in every other way the silk appears to be English (Spitalfields).\n\nPurchased.
