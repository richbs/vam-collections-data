As the successor to the Hungarian Socialist Workers\u2019 Party that had ruled the country during the communist era, the Hungarian Socialist Party could not refer to a glorious past.  Its politicians had lost all respect and socialist ideology had become degraded. Nevertheless, the party\u2019s association with the former monopoly on power was an effective argument in the campaign.  This was the reason, they declared, that there were so many experts in the socialists\u2019 ranks. A high evaluation of expertise and management skills replaced leftist ideology as the party\u2019s selling point.  \nThe pictures on the poster, printed by cheap offset lithography, simply mirror the text: here is the parliament (signified by a silhouette of the well known building on the Danube) and here is our expert. The poster was issued by the 19th electoral district, which used the official, newly designed party logo.  The logo designer, Bea Farkas, constructed the carnation from the elements of a five-pointed communist red star, while also incorporating the Hungarian national colours (red, white and green).",
