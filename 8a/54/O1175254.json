It shows a full length image of a woman in a costume loosely inspired by Russian 'peasant dress'. She is dressed in a loose grey overdress, finishing just below her knees and fastening diagonally across her chest. The overdress has vivid pink cuffs, a pale red belt at the waist and a dark band at the diagonal fastening. It also has dark trim at the pocket tops and at the top of the side seams. Underneath this overdress she appears to be wearing a narrower dark blue underdress with a wide pale red scalloped band at the hem. She is also wearing a narrow white apron decorated with delicate dark blue diamond and dotted motifs. A headscarf printed with dark blue and green spots is wrapped around her head and shoulders. The design is signed Comelli and dated 1921.",

The story follows Sybil, a singer from Paris, who arrives in Russia and meets an officer, Petrov who falls in love with her. There follows a case of mistaken identity in which Sybil is thought to be the wife of the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke goes along with this deception and his wife pretends to be Sybil. The Grand Duchess then becomes attracted to Petrov and the Grand Duke tries to attack him. After much confusion everyone's true identity is revealed and the play ends happily.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis production of the play opened at Daly's Theatre, London on 19th February 1921.",
