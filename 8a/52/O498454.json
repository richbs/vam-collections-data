The flask was held in place with a wooden wedge and the charge ignited through the vent hole. This form of artillery loading was first developed in the 1400s and was commonly used on ship-borne anti-personnel swivel guns. The practical limitations of the mechanism meant that it could not fire projectiles larger than 4lbs in weight. It was probably introduced to Japan from mainland China or by Portuguese traders in the mid 16th century.",

One name for them was 'Ozutsu' Lit: 'big tube'. Despite technical limitations (gaseous escape and the weight of the chamber) the breech loading swivel was favoured as an anti-personnel weapon. They were used for the defence of warships and were mounted on fortifications. The removable chambers gave it a high rate of fire and it remained in favour in Asia into the 20th century. One example of a Japanese breech loading swivel gun, with a 47mm calibre can be see at the Musee de l'Armee, Paris.\n[breeches (barrel components)] This is one of several flasks that would have been used to load a small calibre swivel gun, probably based on the Spanish or Portuguese type known as a verso. Such swivel guns could be fired rapidly and reloaded quickly and were widely used as anti-personnel weapons for the defence of shipping.\nThe vent hole on European breech chambers is usually situated to the left of the handle. There is a small pit (now blocked) on the right hand side below the inscription which may be the vent.\nIn Europe, forged iron chambered swivel guns were made by competent blacksmiths. Unlike other examples of Japanese bronze cannon casting, this piece has a rough and ready workman-like appearance which may signify similar humble origins.",
