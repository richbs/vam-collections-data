            "public_access_description": "Instead of painting from life, enamellers often copied well-known oil paintings, such as this one of American general and first US president George Washington (1732-99). This gave members of the public the opportunity to own an image of a public figure.  Henry Bone's inscription on the reverse of this miniature reveals how difficult the firing process was, as he records that the enamel 'cracked in the fifth fire,' or firing.  \n\nIn the 17th century, new techniques of painting enamels allowed delicate portraits resembling tiny oil paintings to be created. These enamel miniatures were first fashionable in continental Europe, but were particularly in vogue in Britain from the 1720s to 1760s. Painted enamels were made by firing finely milled glass which had been coloured with metal oxides onto a metal base, usually gold or copper. The colours had to be applied and fired in several stages, according to the firing temperature required by each colour. Incredible precision was needed for a successful enamel portrait, since each firing carried risks of cracks and bubbles that might ruin the entire effort.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
