The dress has a high round neck with a narrow band collar and long plain sleeves. The bodice fastens in the centre front with round glass buttons. The waist is round and the skirt flat pleated with a plain section in the centre front and a narrow plain panel flanked by closer pleating at the centre back where it is slightly trained. The shoulders, wrists and front of the bodice are trimmed with applied bands of purple ribbon matching the colour of the spray on the material of the dress, and small flat glass buttons are stitched to these bands. Where the skirt overlaps at the neck and at the waist are brass hooks to the left hand side. The bodice is lined with glazed linen (unlined) which is boned at the side seams as well as the front of the skirt, but faced at the hem with tarleton and bound round with purple velvet ribbon. The dress is hand stitched.\n[Dress] An additional piece of matching material, with two irregular pieces cut out.",
