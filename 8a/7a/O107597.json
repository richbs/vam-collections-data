The donor was usually a prominent member of the community, which in country parishes often meant the local landowner. But gifts came from other sources too. Many were given by women, showing their active involvement with the church. Churchwardens also took pride in commissioning new silver and often contributed to the cost. Occasionally, gifts like Lord Hertford\u2019s chalice and flagon were made to win support for a political cause. \n\nNot all of these gifts were new. Old-fashioned domestic plate, often richly decorated with secular ornament, was welcomed and used for the service of communion or the collection of alms.\n\nChurch Plate from The Hague\nThis impressively austere service was given to the English Reformed Church in The Hague between 1673 and 1711 by different members of the congregation. It was made by four different local goldsmiths. The provision of stands for the vessels is most unusual. The church closed in 1822, and the plate was later used in the chapel of the British Embassy in The Hague.\n\nOne of a set of three, these large dishes carried the communion bread to the altar for consercration. This one was given by Jacob Havius, an Elder of the Church.",
