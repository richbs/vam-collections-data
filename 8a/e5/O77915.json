The clever use of dark and light clay together with the artistic shaping of the handle and spout in the form of branches would have stimulated the visual senses while tea was being taken.\n\nYixing is a town in eastern China, near Shanghai. The local clay is considered particularly suitable for making teapots, which retain the fragrance of tea better than porcelain ones. The clay needs no glazing and is very easy to mould. Yixing potters have a reputation of being highly creative in their production, taking their inspiration from plants and other natural forms.\n\nYixing teapots had always been treasured by Chinese connoisseurs before they caught the attention of Dutch and English traders in the late 17th century. Though exported in fairly large quantities to Europe, Yixing wares were seldom adapted to suit Western taste, for most teapots sold to foreign customers were no different from those produced for the home market.",
