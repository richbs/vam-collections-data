            "public_access_description": "This printed linen fabric is marked \u2018Maud\u2019 on the back and was designed by the Omega Workshops in 1913. It was probably called after Lady Maud Cunard, a Bohemian society figure. Printed in Rouen in France, it is an early example of the application of abstract art to a British textile. The bold black lines and blocks of colour are found in a few other Omega designs and anticipate the jazzy Deco fabrics of the twenties and thirties. Roger Fry wore pyjamas of this fabric to a party for the Ballets Russes in 1918, and Duncan Grant used it in a costume for Jacques Copeau's avant-garde production of Twelfth Night in Paris in 1914.\n\nThe Omega Workshops were founded by Roger Fry (1866-1934). Together with Vanessa Bell (1879-1961), Duncan Grant (1885-1978) and other artist friends, he designed furniture, ceramics and fabrics between 1913 and 1919. The organisation was an artistic rather than a business venture.",
