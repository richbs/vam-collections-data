The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised.\nThis window mount is similar to others in the collection. It has a label with red edging with the title of the photograph. This type of label and mount suggests inclusion in an exhibition, possibly the Paris exhibition of 1867 or the subsequent South Kensington exhibition for which no catalogue has been found.\n\nHistorical significance: This photograph is a close-up view of  the central pillar inside the building popularly known as the Diwan-I-khass. \n\nThe pillar starts off as a square and then forms an octagonal further up before joining with the capital. The magnificent capital consists of 36 tripartite corbels ( two superimposed tiers of serpentine brackets) on top of which is a platform. The intricately detailed carving and the work on the capital is evidence of the influence of Gujarati craftsmen on the architecture of Fatehpur Sikri.  A similar corbelled capital structure is used in the four corners of the building and bridges link the central platform with these. \nSimilar brackets can be seen in the balconies of Guajarati minarets, as seen in the mosque of Sidi Bashir at Ahmedabad (last quarter of 15th century).\n\nThis pillared structure has been the focus of much debate regarding the function of the building. The building is commonly known as the Diwan-i-Khass, the hall of private audience, as it was thought that Akbar would have sat high up on the circular platform and addressed his ministers down below. However, because of the difficulty/ impracticalities  of actually sitting on the platform \u2013 a small cramped space and having to turn round to see people behind you - modern scholars  now believe that this is unlikely to be  the Diwan-i-Khass. Rizvi believes that the building could have been a jewel house where the emperor sat on the platform and inspected his storehouse of gems down below. Nath takes the view that the building is a symbolic representation of Akbar\u2019s belief in the cult of the sun and that the pillar represents the axis of the cosmic order.",
