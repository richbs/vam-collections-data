He made a pulp of recycled paper, which he left to drain and then applied directly to the surface of two cross-cut tree stumps. When dry the pieces of paper were removed from the wood; the tree-rings, cuts, grain patterns, and other indentations were thus preserved in the dried paper casts, which are faintly stained, presumably with natural pigments absorbed in the process. These relief-printed paper fragments are suggestive of pottery shards, or plaster casts, but as the unique physical traces of organic materials they also resemble fossilised remains, or sections of bleached bark. Subtle, ambiguous and austerely beautiful, they are clearly influenced by a Japanese craft tradition in which the natural qualities of paper are explored and revered.",
