It became popular in Britain during the 18th century when the term was first coined in English (whereas in French the term was not recognized until the 20th century). At first it was used in pulp form for architectural mouldings and frames. As technology progressed a technique of moulding laminated sheets of paper was developed. The durable waterproof nature of this material meant it could be used for anything from trays, boxes and screens to chairs, pianos and even carriages.  \n\nThis tray was made by the Birmingham and London manufacturers Clay & Company (1770-1860).  In 1772 Henry Clay patented a durable form of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 known as a 'heat-resisting paperware'.  It could be carved, cut and lacquered like wood or metal, with the added advantage that it was lightweight and did not warp.  Such a stable material was ideal as a support for japanned decoration as used on this tray.  Clay's patent ran out in 1802 but his firm continued to produce papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 items successfully well into the nineteenth century.",
