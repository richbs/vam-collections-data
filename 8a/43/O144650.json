Haag was not present on that occasion but had visited the Bedouin shaykh in July-August 1859 during his own tour of the Holy Land.  He was therefore able to reconstruct the scene using his sketches in conjunction with eye-witness accounts and sittings from the Prince and several of his suite.  The address on the sketch also suggests that he took advice from Francis Bedford (1816-1894), the photographer who had accompanied the Prince on his tour of the Near East in 1862. Bedford's Photographic Pictures made...  during the Tour In The East..., published 1863, does not however include a view of this event.  Another preliminary sketch, in pencil and watercolour, 29 x 59.5 cm., was lot 55 in the same sale as the Searight sketch (now Royal Library, Windsor).  The watercolour was completed in July 1863.  See Searight Archive and D. Millar (forthcoming catalogue). Aghil Agha was the shaykh of the Hawarah tribe, based in the area around Mount Tabor, and was often visited by European travellers: see E. Beaufort, 1861, pp.60-4.  A portrait of him by Haag is in the Royal Collection, and is possibly the one exhibited at the RWS, 1900 (118; illustrated).  Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815-1881), Dean of Westminster, had published Sinai and Palestine, 1856, an account of his tour of the area in 1852.  He accompanied the Prince of Wales on his trip, and described the meeting with Aghil Agha in a letter: see A.V. Baillie and H.H. Bolitho, A Victorian Dean  A Memoir of Arthur Stanley, Dean of Westminster, 1930, pp.168-9.\nOn Bedford, see VAM, The Golden Age of British Photography 1839-1900, 1984.",
