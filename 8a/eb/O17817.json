Studied at Cork School of Art 1822; moved to London 1827, entering RA Schools 1828 and won many prizes. Exhibited 84 works at the RA between 1829 and 1870, 20 at the BI 1832-44, and 21 (mostly watercolours) at the SBA 1830-71. Early subjects included portraits, later predominantly literary and historical. Elected ARA 1835, RA 1840. Visited Paris 1830, 1844, 1850, Brussels 1845, Italy 1855, Germany 1859. Executed vast wall paintings for the Palace of Westminster 1846-65. Friend of John Forster and Dickens. Contributed (as \u2018Alfred Croquis\u2019) caricatures to Erases's Magazine 1830-8; illustrated several books, including Dickens's Christmas books, Moore's Irish Melodies (1845), B\u00fcrger's Leonora (1847), Tennyson's Princess (1860). Declined to be proposed PRA 1866; supposedly refused a knighthood. Died Chelsea, London, 25 April 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 24 June 1870. His portrait by E M Ward 1846 is in the NPG; there are letters to Forster in the National Art Library, and many drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \t\u2018Autobiography\u2019 (MS, RA Library: see E Kenealy in Dublin University Magazine XXIX, 1847, pp594-607); Athenaeum 30 April 1870, pp586-7 (obit); Art ]ournal 1870, pp 181-2 (obit); W J O'Driscoll A Memoir of Daniel Maclise RA 1872, p187; J Dafforne Pictures by Daniel Maclise 1871; R L Ormond \u2018Daniel Maclise\u2019 Burlington Magazine 1968, pp685-93; R L Ormond Daniel Maclise Arts Council National Portrait Gallery exhibition catalogue 1972 \n\n\n\"Daniel Maclise 1806-1870\n<i>British School</i> \nWATERFALL AT ST NIGHTON'S KIEVE, NEAR TINTAGEL \nSigned <i>D. Maclise R.A. 1842</i> \nOil on canvas, 94.5 X 70.5 cm \nF.22. <i>John Forster Bequest.</i> \n\nThis painting is, among other things, a souvenir of the friendship between three men; the artist Daniel Maclise, the novelist Charles Dickens and John Forster the biographer and man of letters. The three had become boon companions in the late 1830s and it was one of the happiest phases in Maclise's life before he fell prey to depression and hypochondria in later years. Maclise sketched the spot which forms the background to this painting, and from which it takes its title, when they were holidaying together in Cornwall in the autumn of 1842. The artist afterwards began a painting using Dickens' sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth as a model. Dickens bought the painting through an intermediary, believing perhaps that if he declared his desire to own it, Maclise would either give it to him or suggest a ridiculously low price. The revelation of this subterfuge was much to Maclise's chagrin. John Forster purchased the painting from the sale of Dickens' effects after his death and bequeathed it to the Victoria and Albert Museum as part of the Forster collection, which is notable for containing the manuscripts of many of the most celebrated Dickens novels. \n\nSt. Nighton's Kieve is a beauty spot in Cornwall which has attracted visitors, since the beginning of the 19th century. Along a gorge, the river has worn away many caves and potholes including the basin into which a waterfall plunges. The water then escapes through a hole in the side of the basin and tumbles over some rocks. It is this basin that has been given the name kieve, a Cornish word for bowl or cauldron. The origin of the first part of the name is more obscure and in the last century it varied between Nathan, St. Nathan, Knighton, Nectan and Neot. \n\nThe dark background, careful rendering of the plant life growing from the rock and of the bubbles in the stream, do not seem to be in the same world as the brilliantly lit figure of the girl, on whom all the colour in the painting is concentrated. As in many of Maclise's paintings there is something theatrical in the way that the figure has been posed against a backdrop. \n\nNevertheless, the combination of dramatic scenery, feminine beauty attired in peasant fancy dress, the domestic touch of carefully rolled stockings inside shoes on a nearby stone, and the serious expression of the dripping wet lapdog, give the painting its great appeal.  \n\nElizabeth Clunas\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
