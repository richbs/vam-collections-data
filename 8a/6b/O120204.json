            "public_access_description": "Elephant table clock with movement by Jerome Martinot (1671-1724) and case by Philippe Caffieri (1714-1774). The base is a later addition and the dial is a 19th century replacement. Such clocks were assembled by marchands merciers in Paris. They commissioned works of art which combined contrasting luxury materials including bronze, horn, porcelain and ormolu. Such elaborate clocks often included an organ in the base. Other mid 18th century clocks incorporate elephants in ormolu or Meissen porcelain, or lions in Chinese porcelain. Although the surface chasing on the V&A's example is not of the highest quality, this may be explained by the later regilding which covers the original chased surface.\n\nJerome Martinot was Valet de Chambre- Horloger Ordinaire du Roi to Louis XIV in succession to his father Jean Martinot with whom he worked until 1702.  Jerome Marinot's most famous creation was a moving armillary sphere made in co-operation with Thomas Haye, a celebrated manufacturer of scientific instruments. The sphere was displayed in the small gallery at Versailles and Martinot was paid 400 Louis d'or from the king's private purse for the work which was presented to the king on 28th February 1701. Jerome Martinot was certified insane in October 1718 and was succeeded by his son Jean as Valet de Chambre-Horloger du Roi and Gouverneur du Grand Horloge du Palais. Both father and son lived under the Grand Horloge.  It is likely that the movement, although signed by Jerome Martinot was supplied by his son Jean who regularly produced clocks for the royal household and used cases by J.Caffieri, E.J.Gallien, J.J,.de Saint Germain and A.L.Duval.",

CHarleston points out that it is difficult to determine whether the ormolu clocks were inspired by the porcelain prototype or vice-versa. Verlet, <i>Les Bronzes Dor\u00e9s Fran\u00e7ais du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle,</i><i>1</i><i>987, plate 230 page 201</i> compares this clock which he dates to 1760 with a musical clock illustrated plate 219 in the Cathedral, Tournai, given by the Prince de Ligne which is attributed to St Germain by comparison with the Rhinocerous musical clock signed by St. Germain in the Louvre. Reinier Baarson, <i>Paris 1650-1900,</i> <i>Decorative Arts in the Rijksmuseum</i>, New Haven and London, 2013, no.50 pp. 21, 213 writes ' Jacques Caffieri was perhaps the first to execute an entire elephant clock-case in bronze. The dial of the V&amp;A elephant clock is signed by the enameller Antoine-Nicola Martini\u00e8re and dated 1742 and a spring in the movement is signed by Alexis (?) Magny and dated 1743.",
