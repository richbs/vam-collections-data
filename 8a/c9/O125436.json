It shows the artist at the age of about 40 years in a pose of melancholy and self-questioning, yet also defiance (Schiff 1973, 154). Together with another example in the collection (E.1030-1918), this study is one of the few documented self-portraits by Fuseli (there are various drawings depicting his hands, but only few examples of self-portraits in his work (Schiff nos. 569, 570, 571 (?), 1743; Powell no. 23)). According to his biographer John Knowles, he was well aware of his 'unheroic' appearance being only 5'2\" tall (Lindsay 1986, 483). By contrast, he was known for his witty character and unconventional and eccentric behaviour. \n\nE.1028-1918 and E.1030-1918 are exceptional examples of full-face studies that are finished to a high degree of elaboration and detail showing Fuseli in a psychologically intimate context. A comparable self-portrait, although less elaborate, in the National Portrait Gallery (Schiff no. 1743, p.555) shows Fuseli half-length leaning over a book. Furthermore, the drawings are extraordinary in terms of their technical execution, as Fuseli is known to hardly heighten his drawings with white although this was common practice among artists of this period. Also, he preferred pencil and most often pen to working in chalk (Powell 1951, 28). His drawings are mostly executed in an expressive, impatient manner, rather 'rhetorical and declamatory' than 'diligent and persuasive' (Myrone 2001, 27).\n\nThe meaning of the inscription 'Wickstead' by an unknown hand remains unclear. According to Powell, the close resemblance to other known self-portraits allows the assumption that the drawing represents indeed Fuseli and not Philip Wickstead, a contemporary of his (Powell 1951, 20). Furthermore, the strokes in the shading undoubtedly identify Fuseli as the executor of this drawing, slanting from upper left to lower right. Fuseli was ambidextrous, but practically always drew left-handed as he was left with a weaker right hand after an illness (Powell 1951).",
