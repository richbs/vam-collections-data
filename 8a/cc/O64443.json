            "public_access_description": "The goddess Tara (literally 'saviouress') was widely worshipped in later Buddhism as an independent deity, particularly as a divine mother. Here she is represented holding a flowering lotus stem (padma) in one hand whilst gesturing the granting of wishes with her open hand (varada-mudra). The Green Tara, Syama-tara, is closely identified with Avalokitesvara Padmapani, the Buddhist embodiment of compassion and she is often regarded as his female manifestation.\n\nThe Tara is set against an elaborate backplate (prabha) which frames her figure and defines her status. She is standing against a throne back, with upright pillars, cross-beam and a large nimbus framing her head. Behind the throne-back are two stupas that flank her. This degree of architectural elaboration underscores the way in which such icons functioned: as miniature or replica shrines and temples. This message is supported by the presence of two smaller attendant figures, both of whom appear to be guardians (dharmapalas); one leans on a axe, the other has the combative stance of a Mahakali.\n\nA dedicatory inscription, reciting the \u2018Ye Dharma\u2019 Buddhist creed, appears in the nimbus, expressed in Sanskrit and written in the siddhamatoka script of medieval eastern India.",
