They would have been used during the service of Mass, when wine (in the chalice) and bread (on the paten) are consecrated by a priest and, in Catholic belief, transform miraculously into the body and blood of Christ. The costly value of the silver and the high quality of the craftsmanship reflect the precious nature of their function. The foot of the chalice is chased (hammered into relief) with the twelve apostles and the paten depicts Christ in Majesty. \n\nBy tradition, these were the only items of silver from the Convent to survive an attack during the French Revolution in 1791, a period when much French silver was melted down. The convent had been set up in 1630. These pieces were probably presented to the nuns when their chapel was ready for services and were probably the gift of 'IC' whose unidentified arms are engraved on the foot of the chalice. He may have been the priest Jacques Camusat, who first suggested the foundation of the convent.",
