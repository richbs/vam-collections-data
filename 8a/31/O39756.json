The blazer is made of a twilled woollen blend patterned in graduated stripes of black, yellow and white, and has a back yoke lining of black satinised cotton, sleeve linings of black striped white cotton and facings of reinforced self fabric.  The collar is notched, with revers of medium width; the sleeves are wrist-length and each is finished with a brass button stitched to the side seam above the hem; the patch pockets are placed on the true left breast and at each side of the front below the waist.  The blazer is cut without vents and is slightly fitted at the waist; it fastens at the front with three brass buttons and stitched buttonholes.  The school badge is stitched to the breast pocket: embroidered in red, white and yellow silks on black wool over an embossed linen backing, it combines the linked coats of arms of the cities of London and Westminster, each contained within an oval cartouche, and conjoined by a mace. Beneath is the school's motto 'UNITATE FORTIOR', which was adopted for the United Westminster Schools (of which Westminster City School was one) in 1873.",
