This indicates that the cabinet, as outlined in the sketchbook, was probably intended for the Paris International Exhibition of 1878. However, there is no proof that the cabinet, as made, with slight modifications to the top, was actually shown.  \n\nThe design shows a number of influences. Anglo-Japanese motifs have been employed, for instance, in the bell-shaped, seemingly Gothic, lattice openings on the lower doors. These were copied from volume five of the Hokusai Manga (1816) which Godwin owned. The upper balustrade of the cabinet in turn is reminiscent of Japanese exterior architecture. In spite of this, however, the cabinet's overall form and lightness, the reeded mouldings and the use of satinwood, are closely related to late 18th-century English cabinet designs by Thomas Sheraton.",
