She would have worn it overlapping slightly in the front, revealing a portion of her leg as she walked. It would have formed part of an ensemble, as depicted, with a jacket (5623(IS)) and a breast cloth (IM.10-1909). Typical of hta-mein, the central area is the focus of decorative interest and displays the unique horizontal wave patterned \"100 shuttles\" interlocking tapestry weave known in Burmese as acheik-luntaya in greens, blues, yellow and white on a red ground. From this flows a striped pink train, the graceful management of which was an acquired skill.",
