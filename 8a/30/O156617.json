            "public_access_description": "Wenzel Jamnitzer was one of the most highly acclaimed German goldsmiths of the Renaissance. He is renowned for his complex decorative style and life castings.  While this domestic tankard is simpler in decoration than his most famous works, being a typical example of mid-16th century south German decorated plate, its cherub feet mark it as unusual.  The medallions on its cover and base are attributed to the goldsmith and engraver Nickel Milic and the diecutter Lucas Richter, respectively.\n\nThis piece is an example of 16th century domestic silver. Such silver was both functional and ornamental. Objects for dining and drinking took elegant forms and were decorated in the latest styles. Beautifully crafted items intended only for display often adopted functional forms such as cups and dishes. Domestic silver was not confined to the most wealthy. Many people owned silver spoons or mounted vessels, items which often became treasured possessions.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
