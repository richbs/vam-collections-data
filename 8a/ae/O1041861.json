The sheet has been mounted, probably before it was received into the Museum's collections, on a larger sheet of paper, which is inscribed below on the left in pencil <i>The breakwater Harwich</i>.  Mr. Frank Hussey has pointed out that on the right may be seen the <i>Orwell</i>, the first steamer to come to Harwich; she began service a few days before the visit on which Constable made the drawing.  There is a rough drawing of the steamer in col. J. H. Constable's collection, and an etching of it attributed to Constable in the National Maritime Museum.\nA pencil drawing also made at Harwich on 1 September 1815, and measuring 4 \u00bd x 7 ins., was in the collection of Sir Bruce Ingram.",
