This was probably during the week of 23 January 1904, when he was making a return visit. He was billed as \u2018The Hanley Favourite\u2019, singing new songs and 'his latest success \"It\u2019s a good job I was there\"'. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums.\n\nThe diminutive Rudd later became an agent and songwriter. He made his name with \u2018Bobbing Up and Down Like This\u2019, a song about the adventures of a henpecked husband and his wife Gert at the seaside. It made Rudd a star and proved equally popular in Australia and South Africa, where Rudd went on tours organised by the promoter Harry Rickards. He is seen here as a timid curate. He later wrote the song \u2018She Was a Clergyman\u2019s Daughter\u2019. Rudd was a favourite in Hanley and appeared at the Grand several times, including May 1905 and January 1906.",

The caricature comes from the first album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum, compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke. The album is dated 1903-4-5.\n\nRudd appeared at the Grand Theatre, Hanley, in January 1904 and was back again during the week of 20 May 1905 when he received a great reception from the audience. Rudd was a favourite in Hanley and appeared at the Grand several times, including May 1905 and January 1906.",
