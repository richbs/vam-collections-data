It has four brass castors underneath for rolling over the table top.  A whole cheese was large and circular, with a flat top and bottom. It would rest securely on its side within the curved shape. Possibly the cheese would be cut in half before serving.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMost cheese cradles were made of mahogany, like this one, and were relatively simple in design. The elegantly scrolling shape gives the it a fashionable Neo-classical look.\n\nOwnership & Use\nIn wealthy homes cheese was served as a separate course, after the main courses but before the dessert. The Footman's Directory and Butler's Remembrancer, published in 1823, advised: 'Have your cheese and butter and salad all ready against the second course is done with'. It also advises: 'wine is seldom drank with the cheese, only porter, ale, or something of that kind'.",
