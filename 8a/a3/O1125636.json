Originally working clothes for men and boys, they have been particularly popular for younger children from about 1920 onward.  The word dungaree derives from a coarse calico fabric of the same name, while 'overall' is literally descriptive of a protective garment worn over other clothes.\n\nOshKosh B'Gosh, Inc., of Wisconsin, USA, the firm which produced this pair of dingarees, was originally known as Grove Manufacturing Company, and was founded in 1895 as makers of such garments for workers.  The 'OshKosh B'Gosh' label was in use as early as 1911.  \n\nThe company had always made child-sized versions of its overalls, but apparently did not take its children's clothing range seriously until the late 1960s, and had even thought of discontinuing it.  Inclusion of the garments in a mail-order catalogue led to a huge demand, and the garments began to be stocked by major US department stores such as Bloomingdales and Saks Fifth Avenue.  The company realised that childrenswear was a growing market and that the buying of workwear was declining, so diversified into nightclothes, shoes, outerwear and other garments for children, and devoted more of its resources to producing these ranges.",
