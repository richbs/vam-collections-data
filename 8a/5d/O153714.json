            "physical_description": "Silk satin embroidered with silk in tambour stitch worked from the wrong side, the borders have been quilted, cord quilting, Italian quilting, and the other face of the cover is undecorated plain weave cotton. This cover has been made from a textile which might originally have been a prayer mat; only the lover part of the mat has been re-used. If you turn the cover inside out it is possible to see part of a pink and yellow selvedge.  The under-drawing in black ink is also on the back of the satin. Interesting technical piece. The embroidery thread is tightly twisted 2Z black silk.  On the reverse of the satin there is lots of black silk with raised stitching and yet the lines on the front of the fabric are fine and regular.  Could this be tambour stitch worked on the back where the under-drawing is?  The exact lines of the under-drawing have not been followed.  This piece needs further thought.\nThere are no border along the upper edge, which forms the closed end of the cushion cover.  The central area is undecorated except for a fine border of rolling scrolls with a bud alternating with a floral sprig including a tulip. Along the bottom there is a vase with an upright floral arrangement including tulips.  There is a similar motif on the diagonal in each corner.  The lines are very delicate.  The border is wide.  There are solid lines of black stitching and broken lines of stitching and three small floral elements.  the central patterned stripe also includes larger motifs of scrolling leaves and along the sides a small vase with flowers.  at each corner there is an inward pointing stylized diagonal cypress tree.  The quilting has been worked through a cotton canvas backing and cotton yarn has been used for the quilting.\nBacking: pieced, plain weave cotton probably originally pink.",
