The first one, Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) became the most successful film in history and grossed over $290 million.  It was not only the film that became a success but also the mechandising that was produced along side the film. The films captured the public's imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis toy figure is of the character Luke Skywalker dressed in his flight suit.  This is taken from a moment in the film where he flies along side the Rebel Allianceto destroy the Death Star.  His character in the film is played by the actor Mark Hamill.  This toy was produced under the Kenner trademark by Hasbro in 1996 in a series known as the Power of the Force Range 2.",
