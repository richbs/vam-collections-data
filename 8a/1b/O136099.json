He specialised in looking at circus tents with an architect's eye and this is one of a series of 'Tentmaster' prints after his original drawings.\n\nThe artist noted the technical details of Gerry Cottle's Circus Big Top on this print so we know it was made by the tentmakers Canobbio in Milan, Italy, and that it had a seating capacity of about 1,360.  It had four lattice King Poles 13 metres tall, each pole in two sections but travelled as one, with 36 quarter poles painted blue.  The canvas top had 6 sections, 2 centres, 4 quarters and a cupola, and the walls were in 12 sections, 4 metres high. The tent was first used for a tour with Mary Chipperfield's animals in the 1970s and was also used in Hyde Park in May 19769 for 'The Great Children's Party celebrations when it was visited by Her Majesty The Queen.",
