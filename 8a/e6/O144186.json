In the centre is a 'gold' 8-pointed star with a central roundel qand a circle of red silk dots outlines in silver.  The dots may be chenille thread; they are unlike the rest of the coloured embroidery which is flat. Each point of the star ends with a blue trefoil.  The star is surrounded by an 8-pointed line decorated with small inward pointing pink trefoils and outward pointing green, yellow and pink trefoil.  Each point of the line ends with either a 'gold' flower head in profile couched to create a basket-weave effect or a 3-petalled flower head in pink, light blue , yellow and black with metal thread basket-weave leaves.  There are coloured silk and metal thread flower and leaf groups filling the spaces between the main motifs. Isolated pink flowers and coloured leaves form a border around the edge. \nEmbroidery threads: silk: black Z-twist; yellow, pink, light blue, dark green, blue, light green all 2S.\nMetal threads:  silver strip close S-wound on Z-twist white silk core; silver-gilt close S-wound on Z-twist white silk core.\nThe stems and outlines have been worked over laid white silk threads to create a raised effect.\nAn edging has been added: it seems to be braided metal thread with a crochet border along one side.\nBacking: pieced, dark reed plain weave silk.",
