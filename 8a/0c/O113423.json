This represents the Captain, a character from the Italian knockabout comedy called the Commedia dell'Arte, or 'artistic comedy'.  This was the popular improvised type of comedy which flourished in Italy from the 16th to the 18th centuries and had an impact on theatre throughout Europe, especially France. Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability to improvise and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest. Various visiting Italian troupes performed in France in the 16th century where their type of theatre was called the Com\u00e9die-Italienne. By the 17th century however their plays were being performed largely in French, and by the 18th century Commedia dell'Arte was a recognised part of the French theatre. \n\nThe Captain, or Il Capitano, was one of the stock characters of Commedia dell'Arte. His character was a satire on the military profession, and if he ever was a Captain, it was a long time ago.  He is seen as a boastful, swaggering figure with a rakish moustache and beard.  Although originally conceived as Italian, he became Spanish during the period of Spanish domination of Italy.",
