The artist also claimed to be the first European artist who had been given full facilities for making paintings of this subject. \n\nElfrida Tharle-Hughes (1874-1950) was an English artist, born in Ryde, Isle of Wight on the 25th April 1874.  She had two siblings, Esther (1871) and Reggie (1873).  They were the only grand-children of Jabez Hughes (1819-84), Photographer to Queen Victoria whilst at Osborne House, and lived at Jabez\u2019s photographic studio at 60-60 \u00bd Union Street, Ryde.  Her family name was originally \u2018Hughes\u2019, added \u2018Tharle\u2019 in1921 in gratitude to her mother for the sacrifices she made bringing her up after their Father\u2019s premature death at 35.\n\nElfrida received art training at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and ateliers in Paris.  She spent two years travelling to Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, India, Burma, Thailand and Indonesia in the 1920s and had produced several drawings in watercolours, of which she donated five pictures to the V&A in 1928.",
