The sculpture may be viewed from any angle, but it is only when seen as shown here that the front so clearly appears to consist of four rather than three actual panels. This is the result of the way in which the ridges, which run in parallel from right to left, have been made to meet at a line on the left-hand panel so as to from a shape mirroring that of the triangular top.\n[Storage box] Wooden box, comprising box and lid, signed on top: 'Jokaku Toshi / 1987 nen / Miyanaga Rikichi saku' + seal ('Temple Roof' /1987 / made by Miyanaga Rikichi).

The last of these, the Modern Art Association, was set up in 1950 with sections devoted to painting and sculpture. Photography and crafts sections were added in 1954.",
