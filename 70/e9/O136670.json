The term derives from lacquer objects made at the Negoro temple for the priests' daily use. The temple was founded in 1288 when Bishop Raiyu Sojo and his pupils moved down from the nearby Mount Koyasan. Negoro-nuri later became a generic term for undecorated lacquer characterised by thick layers of red over black lacquer. Through repeated use, the top layers became worn away resulting in irregular patches of the underlying black lacquer. The resulting unplanned colour effects, combined with the shapes of the objects, were greatly prized. \n\nThis tray also has historical associations as it was given to Christopher Dresser (1834-1904), the industrial designer, in Japan. With the opening of Japan in the late nineteenth century, Dresser did much to introduce Japanese art to the British public. In partnership with Charles Holme, a Bradford businessman, Dresser set up a wholesale company, Dresser & Holme of Farringdon Road, London, to import Japanese art. The tray bears a label  'Given to me as a present by the chief priest at the temple where we stay at KOYA-ZAN as a specimen of old red lacquer. No.122  C. Dresser'. It was given to the museum by one of Holme's descendants.",
