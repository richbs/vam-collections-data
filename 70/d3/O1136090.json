Crosbie graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1995 and established the design and production studio Inflate to experiment with new technologies for designing inflatable objects. Inflate started by creating small functional objects such as bowls, cups and lamps, but soon progressed to much larger objects like furniture and architectural structures. Over the years, Inflate has produced apparel, including collaborations on inflatable clothing with fashion designers. \n\nThis capsule shaped backpack was made in 1999 and like many of Inflate's pieces, has a distinctly industrial feel to it, yet its embossed rib-like shapes give it an anthropomorphic quality.",
