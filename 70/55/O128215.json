One tracery panel missing from 539a-1892, whose left hand end appears to fit into the right hand end of 539-1892 539a-1892 has a visible return at the right hand end suggesting that the adjoining section of panelling (539b-1892) continued around a corner at this point.  Each linenfold panel shows 3 double gatherings, the bottom edge straight without carving, the upper edges carved with a chiselled 'hourglass' motif sets between punched cross motif.   The tracery panels each with four and a half quatrefoils containing an eight petalled flower, within a circle, and flower heads set within the spandrels, and a twisted cord running above (but see below for 539b-1892).  539b-1892, a narrow section consisting of two linenfold panels of the same pattern set within two rails and one stile at the right hand end, with one horizontal panel above (that differs from those on 539-1892 and 539a-1892, being of a stylised rolling leaf design, with punched cord above) and a single finial. It appears that its right hand end (lacking a stile) fits the exposed end of 539a-1892. The right hand stile of 539b-1892 is bevelled at a 30 degree angle at its outside edge, presumably to provide a neat finish to the wall.  The stiles, muntins and rails moulded and with chiselled 'hourglass' motif flanked by two lines of punched circles. The finials are integral to the stiles, but superimposed on the muntins. The rails run uninterrupted between the stiles, above the muntin. The pegging apparently original, as a scratch moulding has been cut through the tops of the pegs. Plain mortice and tenon joints, with no mitreing. The rear surfaces plain, probably roughly planed. A recent softwood batten has been affixed to the underside of each wide section. The remains of some iron nails in the panelling at irregular points.",

Along with other, similar sections it probably formed the back to a bench seat fixed to the wall and running around a corner of the room. The design of the panels is known as 'linenfold', and shows vertical mouldings with the ends, as here, carved in such a way as to give the appearance of the decorated edges of folded cloth. Linenfold was common in Northern Europe from about the mid 15th century, with frequent variations, and remained in use in Britain into the early 17th century.",

No further information from nominal file MA/1/W2842\n\nTracy, cat. no. 270\nFrom a farmhouse, now destroyed, at Kingston, near Taunton, Somerset. Figured in Roe 1902, 116 and Robinson 1905, PL.XIII. This panelling may originally have formed the back of a fixed settle like the one, about 1500, in the abbot's parlour at Mulcheney, Somerset.\n\nRoe (1902) says that the panelling remained 'until a few years since' in the farmhouse.\n\nChinnery comments that the panels reflect the earlier type of linenfold, in which the curtain hangs down to the ground, with a formalised decorative edging only at the top. (p.420).\n\nChinnery ennumerates a series of settles from Devon and Somerset, with broadly similar characteristics, and dating to about 1500-1550, many discovered during the twentieth century as fixtures in inns and farmhouses. They share basic proportions and arrangement, with linenfold panels, distinctive horizontal carved crest panels slotted between the finials, and all appear to be unpainted oak. Photographs of some examples in situ (Murray Adams-Acton, Wallseats and Settles of the 16th century, The Connoisseur, March 1948) show the seats constructed as separate planks supported on crude brackets, 'which are curiously out of keeping with the fine standard of the framed panelling', though the fixed settle c.1500 with lockers under the seat that survives in the Abbot's parlour, Mulcheney Abbey, Somerset has a well-constructed joined substructure with parchmain panels (see 'Settles' in Dictionary of English Furniture (Country Life 1924-7, 2nd rev. ed. 1954, vol. III, p.111). Of this latter example Margaret Wood (The English Medieval House (London 1965), p.22) notes how the domestic parts of monasteries, in particular the abbot's lodgings, often modernised c.1500 were retained as useful to the new secular owner, whereas the church and chapter house would be destroyed.",

The British Tradtion (Woodbridge, 1979), pp.235-240 outlines the history of the settle, evolving from low benches ranged around the walls of the communal Saxon hall. 'Settle' is one of the earliest English words related to seats, and derives from the Latin sella and sedilia. The term langsedile is found, anglicized as longsettle. Fixed or moveable settles were often provided within the hearth area, following the introduction of wall chimneys in the 16th century, but could also be found sited behind long dining tables in larger halls (such as Oxford or Cambridge colleges) and inns.",
