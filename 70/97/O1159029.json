Some of the employees for Merrythought were previously employed by Chad Valley. \n\nFlorence Atwood was an employee who was hearing impaired and mute. She produced the entire range of toys for the first Merrythought line in 1931. She became the chief designer for Merrythought until her death in 1949.
