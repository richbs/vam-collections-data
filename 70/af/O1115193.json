Working under his given name Rothenstein (which he was to change during World War I), he designing the costumes for Barker's celebrated production of The Winter's Tale at the Savoy Theatre (1912), then, during Barker's four-month lease of the St James's Theatre (from September 1913), he created the settings and costumes for Shaw's Androcles and the Lion, the dress worn by Jennifer Dubebat in Act IV of a second Shaw play The Doctor's Dilemma, and for set for Moliere's one-act comedy Le Mariage Forc\u00e9. Rutherston only other designs were the set and costumes for the ballet Le R\u00e9veil de Flore at the Palace Theatre (1914) and subsequently on tour in North America, in which Anna Pavlova danced the role of Flore.",
