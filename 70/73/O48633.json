Designed by Sergio Mazza in 1968, the chair is made from one continuous piece of fibreglass. The fibreglass sheet is heated and then shaped over a solid mould. The fibreglass retains the shape, becoming hard as it cools.  The 'Toga' chair was first shown at the International Furniture Exhibition in Milan in 1969.\n\nThe chair was manufactured by Artemide, a Milan based firm, renowned for producing products that combined practicable serviceability with stylishness. Firms such as Cassina, Kartell and Tecno, and designers such as Ettore Sottass and Gaetano Pesce, were responsible for raising Italy's profile in consumer product design in the 1960s until it became a dominant force in the international field .",
