They were often printed Ex Libris (Latin for 'from the library of') followed by the owner's name. This one is an engraving, that is a print taken from a metal plate in which the lines have been incised by a tool called a burin.\n\nPeople\nCharles W. Sherborn attended the Government School of Drawing and Design at Somerset House and trained as a goldsmith, both in London and abroad. From 1881, however, he specialised in designing and engraving bookplates, producing over 400 examples. He was a founder member and later Vice-President of the Ex Libris Society (founded 1891) which promoted the art of bookplates as well as providing a forum for collectors.  Sherborn was inspired by 16th-century German engravers such as D\u00fcrer and 'The Little Masters' and was credited with single-handedly reviving and enlivening traditional armorial bookplates.  He was also a founder member of the Society of Painter Etchers, in 1884.\n\nOwnership & Use\nBookplates were specially commissioned by individuals to identify their books. The earliest bookplates, from the 15th century, and books themselves, were only owned by the very wealthy. It was only in the 19th century that book ownership became more widespread.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe bookplate is a rebus, or a visual riddle. The owner was called Ashbee, so the bookplate is printed with an ash tree and a bee, as well as a portrait of the owner.",
