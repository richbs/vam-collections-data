In royal palaces they were sometimes used as seats for a few influential courtiers, but even this was a mark of royal favour, since most people were required to stand in the presence of the monarch.\n\nA footstool for a child is very unusual indeed, and it is significant that this one is said to be a copy of one presented to Victoria, the Princess Royal (born 1840), the eldest child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.  Although Victoria and Albert tried in many ways to give their children what was a realistic upbringing in comparison with some royal children, Princess Victoria was in a rather special position.  She was not only their first child, but was born at a time when there had been few legitimate and healthy royal children for some years, and was therefore of considerable importance.",
