Snuffers were first invented to cut off and retain the burned wicks of candles when the wax around them had melted; they were not necessarily used to extinguish the candle's flame. The point at the end was for retrieving the tip of the wick if it fell into molten wax. They are first recorded in the 15th century. Numerous patents for snuffers are known from the middle of the 18th century, regularly reappearing with new improvements until 1840 when candles that completely consumed their wicks were first developed, rendering snuffers superfluous.\n\nThe snuffer tray is a small shallow tray upon which to rest the snuffer.  Such trays are variously shaped and decorated;  some having four feet, a vertical rim, decorated with reeding, pierced work, gadrooning or relief masks.  Later examples in both silver and Sheffield plate could be oval, canoe shaped or hour glass shaped.  After ca.1770 the stand loses its handle and is frequently indistinguishable from the so called 'pen tray'.",
