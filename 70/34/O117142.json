Another prize for Religious Architecture, in the form of stained glass panels by Graham Jones, is displayed at the far end of the V&A's Sacred Silver and Stained Glass gallery. ACE promotes understanding of the links between religion and the visual arts. Together, the prizes celebrate contemporary artistic achievement in religious settings. They are displayed in the V&A, but loaned for temporary display in the award winners\u2019 own sacred space every two years.\n\nThe design of the font recalls the Greek word for fish, ichthys, whose letters represent the words for \u2018Jesus Christ God\u2019s Son Saviour\u2019. The early Christians used the fish image to communicate their baptismal creed. It appears in the 1st-century catacombs in Rome and still has a special significance for many Christians today.",

The medieval stone carving high on Gloucester Cathedral is being restored and the stone-masons have erected scaffolding giving access to normally inaccessible stonework. This I have case and used as the starting point for new works'.",
