            "bibliography": "<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1959 </u>. London: HMSO, 1964.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n\"<b>BOUCHARDON, Edm\u00e9 (1698-1762)</b> \n \nDesign for a <i>jeton</i> issued by the French navy (<i>Marine</i>) in 1747, showing a mariner's compass. \n<i>Inscribed in capital letters within the design</i> Dublis Secundis Que Rebus Recta <i>and</i> Marine 1747.  <i>Inscribed in ink on the mount</i> Jetton <i>and</i> le 11 novembre 1746 remis \u00e0 M. Roetier le dessin de jettons de la marine pour 1747. \n<i>Red chalk.  Cut out round the circumference and laid down. \nDiameter</i> 21 cm.            E.101-1959 \n \n<i>Note:</i> This drawing was probably formerly in the collection of P. J. Mariette (1694-1774).  The medallist referred to in the note on the mount may have been either C. J. Ro\u00ebttiers or his son C. N. Ro\u00ebttiers, who were both working at the Paris Mint and both carried out Bouchardon's designs. \n \nThis drawing, together with E.100, 102-1959, was bought by the Museum from a collection of about 25 similar drawings, which had probably once belonged to P. J. Mariette, since some of them (like E.100-1959) are mounted in a manner characteristic of that collector, on blue paper with the artist's name on a scroll thought none of them is stamped with his mark.  Some of these drawings may perhaps be identified with those described in Basan's catalogue of Mariette's collection (1775) under Lot 1143 (as by Bouchardon): \"Douze sujets de forme ronde, premieres pens\u00e9es de dessins, faits pour l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions.\" \n \nBouchardon was appointed designer to the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1736, and he occupied the post until the year of his death.  His task was to provide designs, not only for the various commemorative medals struck by the royal mint, but also for the <i>jetons</i> which certain departments of the state had long been accustomed to present to the king every year, a custom which had survived from the days when such <i>jetons</i> (or counters) were actually used for keeping the accounts. \n \nThe three designs acquired by the Museum may be accepted as original drawings by Bouchardon, whereas all those in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale are offsets and those in the Mus\u00e9e Mon\u00e9taire appear , with one exceptions, to be copies made by the medallists in the course of carrying out the designs.  The one exception is an original sketch by Bouchardon which is inscribed \"Le cinq janvier, remis le dessein \u00e0 M. Roitier, qui est celui qu'il fault ex\u00e9cuter\", exactly the same type of note as we find on E.101, 102-1959. \n \nFor an account of  Bouchardon's work as a design of medals and <i>jetons</i> see H. Bouchot's 'Bouchardon dessinateur en m\u00e9dailles', <i>L'Art</i>, Vol.32, 1883, pp.214-217 (with two illustrations of designs for <i>jetons</i>); A. Roserot's 'Bouchardon dessinateur de l'Academie des inscriptions et Belles-Lettres', <i>R\u00e9union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s des Beaux-Arts</i>, Vol. 19, 1895, pp.609-613; and F. M. Mazerolle's 'Le dessins de m\u00e9dailles et de jetons attributes au sculpteur Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon', <i>ibidem</i>, Vol.22, 1898, pp.349-358.\"",

            "history_note": "This drawing was probably formerly in the collection of P. J. Mariette (1694-1774).  The medallist referred to in the note on the mount may have been either C. J. Ro\u00ebttiers or his son C. N. Ro\u00ebttiers, who were both working at the Paris Mint and both carried out Bouchardon's designs. \n \nThis drawing, together with E.100, 102-1959, was bought by the Museum from a collection of about 25 similar drawings, which had probably once belonged to P. J. Mariette, since some of them (like E.100-1959) are mounted in a manner characteristic of that collector, on blue paper with the artist's name on a scroll thought none of them is stamped with his mark.  Some of these drawings may perhaps be identified with those described in Basan's catalogue of Mariette's collection (1775) under Lot 1143 (as by Bouchardon): \"Douze sujets de forme ronde, premieres pens\u00e9es de dessins, faits pour l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions.\" \n \nBouchardon was appointed designer to the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1736, and he occupied the post until the year of his death.  His task was to provide designs, not only for the various commemorative medals struck by the royal mint, but also for the <i>jetons</i> which certain departments of the state had long been accustomed to present to the king every year, a custom which had survived from the days when such <i>jetons</i> (or counters) were actually used for keeping the accounts. \n \nThe three designs acquired by the Museum may be accepted as original drawings by Bouchardon, whereas all those in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale are offsets and those in the Mus\u00e9e Mon\u00e9taire appear , with one exceptions, to be copies made by the medallists in the course of carrying out the designs.  The one exception is an original sketch by Bouchardon which is inscribed \"Le cinq janvier, remis le dessein \u00e0 M. Roitier, qui est celui qu'il fault ex\u00e9cuter\", exactly the same type of note as we find on E.101, 102-1959. \n \nFor an account of  Bouchardon's work as a design of medals and <i>jetons</i> see H. Bouchot's 'Bouchardon dessinateur en m\u00e9dailles', <i>L'Art</i>, Vol.32, 1883, pp.214-217 (with two illustrations of designs for <i>jetons</i>); A. Roserot's 'Bouchardon dessinateur de l'Academie des inscriptions et Belles-Lettres', <i>R\u00e9union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s des Beaux-Arts</i>, Vol. 19, 1895, pp.609-613; and F. M. Mazerolle's 'Le dessins de m\u00e9dailles et de jetons attributes au sculpteur Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon', <i>ibidem</i>, Vol.22, 1898, pp.349-358.\"",
