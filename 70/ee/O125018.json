            "physical_description": "Tabernacle of irregular hexagonal form, in two parts, a base unit with 2 floors and a ceiling, and a separable spire. The spire with pierced triangular panels (about 8mm thick), and a crocketed finial scarf-jointed to the stiles, and a thin floor (14mm). The base formed by five full-height panels held within crocketed buttresses, and the sixth formed by two, hinged doors (the lower apparently adapted from an original single panel), with 19th century strap hinges, nails, a lock and a wooden keep on the upper solid door. Each single full-height panel is held in place with irregular metal pins and an applied moulding (see below), and terminates above the ceiling in a pierced cusped arch, then shows pierced tracery at first floor level (two with fleur-de-lis motif), then at the lowered ground floor level shows blind tracery (four with fleur-de-lis) above a plain flat area with the shadows and metal pins indicting the loss of an applied arch. At the levels of the ground floor and first floor solid oak ceilings (21mm thick) which are pegged from outside into the buttresses, a horizontal moulding has been applied to all six faces using metal pins, all of which are now lifting. Various small losses, a dark stain applied overall, notieceably more matt in finish on the spire.\n\nThe tabernacle appears to have been restored in the 19th century, by the replacement of two buttresses, the replacement of one panel-door with two hinged doors (one reusing part of the original panel) and the replacement (?) of the horizontal mouldings, and it is possible that the spire was created at that time - given its condition and different colour.",
