Her signature piece is the fabric, which she has hand-printed with a stylised floral design characteristic of many of her patterns. \n\nShe designed this dress for the fashion designer Elizabeth Emanuel, who wore it when she married David Emanuel in 1976. (The Emanuels designed the fairytale wedding dress for Lady Diana Spencer when she married HRH Prince Charles in 1981.)\n\nZandra Rhodes is renowned for her romantic and lavishly embellished evening clothes. She trained as a textile designer and studied at the Royal College of Art, London, before setting up her own textile printing business. She soon realised that she was the best person to translate her textile designs into fashion and she set up her own business in 1968. In The Observer (9 October 1977) she was described as 'the most original and fearless of British designers, admired for her dedication to doing what she feels'.",
