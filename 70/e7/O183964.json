McLaren\nE.667-1969\n\nSee SE, p 247: \u2018The latest comer in relief decorative materials is steel, which is embossed and nailed generally to the rafters.\u2019\nSherard Cowper-Coles (1866-1936), was founder of the Faraday Society: \u2018inventor of an electrical process for making metallic wallpaper in continuous lengths, and at a price in keen competition with that of other embossed and stamped materials for wall- and ceiling decoration. This wallpaper he claimed was damp-proof, fire-proof, economical, far more sanitary, artistic and durable than any existing wallpaper and especially suitable for railway carriages, cabins and damp walls\u2019 (A. A. McGregor, <i>Phantom Footsteps</i>, London, 1959, pp 182, 183).\nThe firm of Cowper-Coles, Sherard & Co. were metallurgists, working during the early 20th century and established in Westminster and Chelsea. Cowper-Coles was the inventor of \u2018sherardizing\u2019: coating with zinc by heating with zinc dust in the absence of air.'\n\nFor the reference to SE given above, see:\nSugden, A.

This wallpaper he claimed was damp-proof, fire-proof, economical, far more sanitary, artistic and durable than any existing wallpaper and especially suitable for railway carriages, cabins and damp walls' (A. A. McGregor, <i>Phantom Footsteps</i>, London, 1959, pp 182, 183).\nThe firm of Cowper-Coles, Sherard & Co. were metallurgists, working during the early 20th century and established in Westminster and Chelsea. Cowper-Coles was the inventor of 'sherardizing': coating with zinc by heating with zinc dust in the absence of air.",
