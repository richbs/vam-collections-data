Printsellers published engraved portraits of actors and actresses in starring roles as soon as they made their names in the roles at the theatre. Fans would buy the portraits to paint and decorate with the tinsel and leather scraps that were sold for the purpose. Traditionally they were then framed in frames of walnut wood.",
