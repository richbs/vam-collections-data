These are chevron lines in yellow and green with pink and blue edges.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: downward pointing tree-like pointed blossom in  yellow and pink with 4 pink circles in the centre, each with a blue dot.  There is a small blue/light blue pansy-like flower near its base.\n[2] wider stripes with two designs: [a] a lollipop-like flower: long pink stem with head of concentric circles in green, yellow, dark blue, pink alternating with a less dominant lollipop flower in which the head is filled with small segments in pink, blue and green. [b] Dark green with densely packed motifs.\nThere are no narrow side border because the sides have been cut.\nThe bottom border has downward pointing red flowers with three round petals alternating with blue/light blue ones.\nThreads: 2S silk: blue, light blue, red, dark green, yellow, green, pink, orange, white, light beige.",
