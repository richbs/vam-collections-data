Baker who printed it at their Swaisland Print Works, Crayford in 1899 (Baker design B552, border B634). Details of both designs can be found in Baker's first block-book which is still in the possession of the firm.\n\nSimilar fine silk bed covers and hangings (see T.157-1985 and T.5-1986) were printed for Liberty's and Heal's shops although the Baker block-book gives the Baker code as being the originator of the design.\n\nThe donor states that her father-in-law bought the bedcover from Liberty's at the beginning of the 20th century so it is likely that Baker's sold the product to the shop after printing rather than acted as commission printers.\n\nJohn Illingworth Kay was a member of the Silver Studio but as he is listed in Baker's records by name, it is likely that he sold this pattern privately.",
