It is part of a set of exact replicas of the 14 batik  banners made by da Silva for the Sri Lankan parliament building in 1980. The original set was commissioned by the Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa, the architect of the parliament building. The originals became worn and were removed from the building: this piece, and the others in the set, was made using the original stencils as a replacement and were used in an exhibition curated by Dr David Thompson, from whom the V&A later acquired this piece.\n\nThe design shows Vishvakarma, the god of craftsmen, Hanuman carrying the mountain of healing herbs (from the Ramayana epic) and at the bottom, some Sri Lankan metal-workers.",
