Along with other British and European artists, Moore was asked by Ascher to design prints for dress fabrics in order to create more exciting textiles than those that had been available during the Second World War. \n\nThe appeal of this design is its simplicity and clarity, yet at the same time the motifs remain unrecognisable and somewhat mysterious, like an ancient indecipherable script. The origin of the symbols is unknown; some bear a resemblance to surrealist motifs in Moore's ealier drawings, whilst others appear to be completely imaginary. Moore's drawing for this design is on a deep red background, unlike his textile design where he chose a background of white, with the squares in black and varying colourways for the symbols.",
