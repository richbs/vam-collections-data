The fabric is called 'Pan Pipes' and the stylised trees and figures follow the forms of Art Nouveau. The main impetus for using motifs like these came from the rise in popularity of illustrations for children's books as well as Continental poster design.\n\nNapper worked for the textile design firm the Silver Studio from 1893, but left in 1898 to work on a free-lance basis. Absorbing the most fashionable elements of British and Continental design at the end of the 19th century, Napper produced a range of very successful stylised floral designs. He sold to many manufacturers, including G. P. & J. Baker and his textiles were particularly popular in France.\n   \nAlexander Morton founded his textile company in Scotland in 1867 and in 1900 moved to a factory in Carlisle. Morton's son James was responsible for buying patterns from most of the leading freelance designers of the day, including Voysey, Butterfield and the Silver Studio.",
