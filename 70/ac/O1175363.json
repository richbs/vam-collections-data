            "public_access_description": "This staff formed part of the costume worn by the actor Henry Irving (1838-1905) when playing the role of Malvolio in the 1884 production of Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare. \n\nTwelfth Night was not popular among Victorian audiences and the play's chances of success were not improved by the heat wave which greeted the first performances. Further disaster struck when blood poisoning compelled Ellen Terry (1847-1928) to leave the production after only sixteen performances, and her sister Marion Terry (1853-1930) had to take over the role of Viola. \n\nAudiences were also dismayed by Irving\u2019s decision to play Malvolio as a figure who was far more tragic than comic, and some actually booed at the end. Irving retaliated with a furious curtain speech which Ellen described as 'the only mistake I ever saw him make'. Unsurprisingly the production ran for only thirty nine performances in London and was never revived. Despite the failure of the London production Irving decided to assemble a new cast to mount a production of the play on the subsequent tour to America and this revised version was received much more positively by American audiences.\n\nHenry Irving became a professional actor in 1856, and learnt his trade in regional theatres until 1866, when he came to London.  In 1871 he joined the Lyceum Theatre company under the management of H. L. Bateman.  Irving remained at the Lyceum until 1902, taking over the management of the theatre in 1878, thereby achieving the status of an \"actor-manager\".  At the Lyceum, Irving produced a range of plays both old and new, including melodrama, Shakespeare, historical drama, and literary adaptations.  He worked tirelessly to raise the status of the Theatre profession both in the view of the public and among official bodies, especially religious organisations.  His success in this field was recognised in 1895, when he became the first actor to receive a knighthood for services to the Theatre.\n\nMany of Irving's productions were spectacularly staged with large casts of performers.  He created desired effects of colour and movement using scenery, costume and lighting, set to music appropriate to the action, played by a full orchestra.  Although from the 1880s electric lighting was available for theatres, Irving always used gas, as well as lime-light (a form of spot-lighting).  Gas lighting gave a softer appearance to the general stage picture, whilst lime-light could be used to highlight Irving as the focus of attention at key points in the play.  Outside of London, Irving toured complete productions, taking the full London company, scenery and costumes, throughout the United Kingdom and also across the United States and Canada.  His was the first generation that could do this through the rapid development of the railway system.",
