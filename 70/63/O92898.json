In the section to the left the nuptial ceremony between the Prince Siddhartha and Yashodhara is being celebrated.  The couple have joined hands and walk round a fire in the centre with two water jars. On either side stand two trumpet players in celebration. The scenes are divided by  rectangular panels enclosing squat pillars and capitals at the left end and off-centre to the right.\n   In the upper register, nine male figures, dressed in tunics and <i>uttariyas</i>, are shown gesticulating as though in lively conversation with trees at either end.",
