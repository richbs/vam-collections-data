Because of the shortage of manpower and raw materials, non-essential items were restricted and clothes rationing was introduced in June 1941.  A year's allowance of clothing coupons was sixty-six and this screen-printed textile, designed to add colour and fun to life during war, was inspired by the rationing scheme.\nScreen-printing, using a mesh on which parts of the pattern have been masked out and through which the pigment is forced, had been developed in the late 1920s and greatly increased the freedom of the designer.  It also enabled enterprising manufacturers to try out experimental designs without incurring the heavy costs of engraving metal rollers. The wartime shortage of copper further encouraged the use and development of screen-printing.",
