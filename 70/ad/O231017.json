The ground fabric and the reversibility of the stitches is typical of Ottoman work. A series of narrow bands form a border: black diamond-heads, a band of mauve, dark blue and dark pink stars, a wider band with black leaves forming a double meander, a repeat of the stars and diamond-heads down the sides and along both ends. In addition, across the ends is a row of blue cypress trees [?] alternating with a pink or faded purple flower. \nThere is an added lacis border along the lower end only. It has a dark pink silk square net ground and is embroidered with white silk to form a grid of diamonds with a border of blocks.\nA black silk fringe has been added across the bottom and a little way up the sides.",
