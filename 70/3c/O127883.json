This figure, together with the Rebellious Slave (V&A cast no. 1863-16), was executed for the second project (1513) for the tomb.  In this scheme, Michelangelo planned to place them on either side of the Moses (V&A cast museum no. 1858-278).  The project was never completed in this form. Around 1546, Michelangelo gave these two statues to Ruberto Strozzi, a Florentine exile in Lyon, who in turn presented them to King Francois I of France. They were given by King Francois I to Con\u00e9table Anne de Montmorency and thereafter passed through the hands of several members of the Montmorency and Richelieu families. In 1794, the Rebellious and Dying Slaves were purchased for the French state, and have been preserved in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre ever since.",

This figure, together with the Rebellious Slave (V&A cast no. 1863-16), was executed for the second project (1513) for the tomb.  In this scheme, Michelangelo planned to place them on either side of the Moses (V&A cast museum no. 1858-278).  The project was never completed in this form.  Around 1546, Michelangelo gave these two statues to Ruberto Strozzi, a Florentine exile in Lyon, who in turn presented them to King Francois I of France.  They were given by King Francois I to Con\u00e9table Anne de Montmorency and thereafter passed through the hands of several members of the Montmorency and Richelieu families.  In 1794, the Rebellious and Dying Slaves were purchased for the French state, and have been preserved in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre ever since.",
