Twining around the bodice and over the shoulders, intersecting the two sides and creating a very low V-neck back and front, is an appliqu\u00e9 serpent formed of strips of sequins in spectrum colours, with diamant\u00e9 eyes. The lower part of the front neck is filled with flesh coloured chiffon over a pink cotton base, latticed and outlined across the top edge with small brilliants. The bodice is boned and laced down the back, using eyelet holes. The open topped sleeves match their respective sides of the bodice, the left being of black net, the right of silver tinsel tissue; both are caught at the lower edge with a silver tissue bow and two silver bullion tassels. Following the line of the shoulder straps and down the V back are bold graduated frills of black net scattered with silver sequins, edged with silver tissue and wired along the outer edge. The low calf length gored skirt is made up of ten panels simulating feathers, in violet paper taffeta, deep blue silk, turquoise satin, pale green silk, green yellow ribbed silk, gold silk, pale orange silk, flame silk, cyclamen silk, and purple silk, all interspersed with strips of black silk.  The illusion of feathers is created by lines of fine silver braid scattered with silver sequins on the inner 'frond'; and black braid scattered with black sequins on the outer 'frond'; each feather has a strip of matching sequins between the black and silver lines which form the spine, and clusters of matching elliptical sequins following the spine.  The tips of the feathers curl outward from the centre front, creating a scalloped hem bordered with a gathered ruche of stiffened black net edged with narrow silver tinsel ribbon; between the scallops are small gathered sections of silver-edged black muslin. The underskirt of black tarlatan is edged with silver tinsel ribbon. Attached at the waist, under the skirt, is a pair of ankle length shirred silver pantaloons. Down the outer edge of each leg are set seven and a half ellipses of gathered black net strewn with silver sequins and outlined in silver tinsel ribbon; around each leg, at the top of each ellipse, are horizontal bands of narrow silver tinsel ribbon, ending at the ellipse in minature bullion tassels.\n[Theatre costume] Fantastic headdress of matching ostrich feathers, set in a high sequinned and diamant\u00e9 back, a diamant\u00e9 edged fillet fitting around the head, set, at the front, with a sequinned 'antenna'.",

This Edwardian design combines the froufrou so beloved of that period with the glitter of the music hall. The costume, which could have been a riot of vulgarity, is extremely refined in its execution; Wilhelm knew exactly the results he wanted to achieve (the associated design is so skilfully executed that it is possible to tell the materials he envisaged) and the blending of sequins, bright silks and silver tissue is masterly, as is the way the whole is muted by the use of black net relieved by silver braid and sequins. The silver tissue pantalettes peeping from under the black net frill and the tarlatan underskirts, are sweetly tantalising.   There is a wit and a sparkle in the costume which must have reflected the personality and performance of Adeline Gen\u00e9e, who did so much to set standards and establish the popularity of ballet in the London music halls of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
