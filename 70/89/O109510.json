            "public_access_description": "Stars of the 19th century theatre were often celebrated in paintings, prints and drawings, and in ceramic figurines. Several Staffordshire factories specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This represents the English actor-manager William Charles Macready (1793-1873) as the money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, the r\u00f4le he first played at Covent Garden Theatre on 13th May 1823. The pose was copied from a contemporary engraving published in Tallis's Shakespeare Gallery, 1852-1853, showing Shylock by the Grand Canal  in Venice in Act 1, scene iii.\n\nThe son of a provincial actor-manager, Macready made his first stage appearance at Birmingham as Romeo, and made his London debut in 1816 at Covent Garden. By 1819 he was firmly established as a leading actor and a rival to the great Edmund Kean.  His Lear, Hamlet and Macbeth were especially acclaimed, prompting the critic Hazlitt to call him the best tragic actor of his day, with the exception of Kean.  At various times Macready managed both Covent Garden and Drury Lane theatres and worked hard to encourage excellence in his profession and to make many reforms in both acting and texts. \n\nAt least seven earthenware portrait figurines are known to have been copied from engravings in Tallis's Shakespeare Gallery, and these have become known as Tallis figures.  They were made in many sizes and are thought to have been made by the Burslem potters Thomas Parr, who was working from 1852 until 1870, John Parr, who worked from 1870 to 1879, or the Kent & Parr firm, who worked from 1880 until 1894. These manufacturers passed the moulds to each other and the figures were produced throughout the Victorian period.",

Macready first played Shylock at Covent Garden Theatre on 13th May 1823.  This figurine was based on the Tallis Shakespeare Gallery engraving of Macready as Shylock standing by the Grand Canal in Venice.
