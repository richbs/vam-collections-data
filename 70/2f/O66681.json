Leprosy can manifest itself by lesions on the face and is often depicted this way in the Middle Ages. The man may have originally formed part of a panel which depicted acts of mercy to the poor and sick.\n\nThis fragment is part of a 'composite' panel of stained glass fragments made in England and the Netherlands between the 15th and 16th centuries. These fragments were grouped together in order to show a range of images of people and different decorative techniques in glass painting.\n\nThe glasspainter has used a technique for decorating glass that was developed around 1300, known as 'staining'. It consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass which, after firing in a kiln, becomes a yellow or orange colour. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
