The building had been purchased in 1698 by a wealthy local yeoman. It was described in various documents at the time as being a slaughterhouse, a little hovel, and a warehouse. The purchaser had it rebuilt as a house for his son, to whom it was given in 1700. It is very likely that this wallpaper was hung as part of this scheme of refurbishment. The wallpaper would have been one of the more expensive designs available at this date. It has a large-scale pattern and has been stencilled by hand with at least six different colours.",

It was then described variously as a slaughterhouse, a little hovel, or a warehouse. The purchaser had it rebuilt for his son, to whom it was transferred in 1700. It is likely that the wallpaper dates from this phase of refurbishment. The building was converted to offices in 1954.",
