The colour scheme adopted in this woven pattern is also similar to that found on some Portuguese handwoven silk.  However, the floral scrolls patterns bear stronger resemblance to East Asian floral scrolls, suggesting that this may have been woven by Chinese (or even Japanese) weavers for an export market. \n\nBy the second half of the 16th century, the Portuguese had succeeded in acquiring a trading base at Macau (off Canton) from the Chinese government, where trade from China and Japan passed through. It is supposed that the woven pattern here may have been made by Japanese or Chinese sojourners in Macau, according to patterns given to them to follow.",
