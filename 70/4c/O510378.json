The linear treatment of the figures is emblematical of his vigorous style, and reminiscent of his caricatures for the satirical journal <i>Le Charivari</i>. \n\n<i>Une cause criminelle (L\u2019information)</i> is a preparatory study for the watercolour of the same title and dated about 1865 (The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) where the intellectual hierarchy between the lawyer and his client is restored. \nThe drawing can also be related to a series of sketches focusing on a lawyer pleading in the foreground (see for instance <i>Le Defenseur</i>, Washington, the Phillips Collection or Avant l\u2019audience, New York, The Honorable Samuel J. and Mrs. Ethel LeFrak and Family). Moreover the gesture of this figure with his arms stretched recalls another sketch in the V&A collection entitled <i>Avocat plaidant</i> (see CAI. 127, verso). In both sketches, Daumier emphasizes the dramatic gesture of the characters to connect the court activity to theatrical productions. \n\nDaumier was a prolific draughtsman hence the difficulty to date most of his sketches. However these often turn out to be preparatory studies for compositions later engraved. It is not rare to find stylistic discrepancies in Daumier\u2019s work of the same period.\n \nDaumier was most celebrated during his life time for his satirical and anti-monarchist illustrations rather than his paintings and drawings. This sheet is a good example of Daumier\u2019s observation of the French society and its professional categories. He did a few series of sketches focusing on different categories such as musicians, comedians, art collectors, rustic life, saltimbanques\u2026",
