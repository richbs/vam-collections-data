According to Steiner\u2019s doctrine, the imaginative life of children should be encouraged through free expression, creativity and play. Richardson documented the everyday activities of Harlemville\u2019s children, capturing a sense of a Utopian but fragile innocence. \n\nPhotographing the community over the course of a year, Richardson gradually gained the trust of its members. She has described her way of working on this project as follows: \u2018I\u2019d find that I\u2019d spend three days with the Harlemville community and, though I might not have taken a picture during that time, when I did, the relationships I was forming were evident and came through in the pictures.\u2019",
