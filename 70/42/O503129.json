Wanklyn (written communication, Jan 1975) suggested that this drawing was executed by Etienne Delaune on grounds of stylistic resemblance with, respectively, Delaune\u2019s drawings in the British Museum, and a drawing in lavender ink and wash, and of the same subject, in the Ashmolean museum, Oxford (box V of Delaune drawings). \n\nIn 1977, Janet S Byrne published this drawing and its companion piece (1541) along with two drawings of similar size and character in the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid (pls 15 & 16); the latter two were subsequently published in the catalogue of the 15th and 16th century drawings for architecture and ornament in the collection of the National Library of Spain (E.M. Santiago P\u00e1ez (ed.), <u>Dibujos de Arquitectura y Ornamentacion de la Biblioteca Nacional. Siglos XVI y XVII</u>, Madrid 1991, nrs 286-287). The Madrid drawings are catalogued in Madrid as by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau. Like the V&A drawings those in Madrid are also numbered in their upper right hand corners, 22 and 29 respectively, indicating a common source for all four drawings. \n\nHowever Prof. Dr Peter Fuhring has pointed out (written communication, April 2012) that 1542 (and its companion piece 1541) is not by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, though it has been occasionally published under his name. Three of the sheets bear a manuscript number top right (the fourth drawings has been cut) and this seems to suggest that they all come from an album of similar drawings that has been taken apart in the 19th century and of which no further sheets have been localised. \n1542 is therefore considered to be by an unidentified draughtsman, occasionally called precursor, whose work can be dated from the 1530\u2019s and early 1540\u2019s. \n\nThe identification of the nature of this elaborate free-standing structure is somehow problematic. It was originally catalogued as a design for a fountain or a garden ornament, and is now more generally retained as an \u2018elaborate structure\u2019. The complex edifice combines a series of superposed niches, columns and pinnacles with satyrs and male figures, which could represent Roman soldiers, and at least one identifiable cupid. Interestingly the genitals of the satyrs have been erased by scratching out the ink.",
