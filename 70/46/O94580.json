Tiffany's of New York and Gorham of Rhode Island, USA, stimulated Elkingtons and others by their experiments with textured silver, embellished with base metals which imitated traditional Japanese metalwork.  However, the strict British hallmarking laws prevented the application of base metals to silver and makers could only resort to cast silver details and engraved scenes, borrowed from Japanese prints to meet the fashionable demand for Japanoiserie.",
