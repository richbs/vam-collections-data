The back is embossed with the symbols of St John, Mark and Luke, whilest at the bottom is a bearded cleric holding a book (perhaps an unusual depiction of St Matthew). In the middle is the Agnus Dei below which is a mutilated inscription.\n\nThe silver sheeting has been rearranged and cut about. Hildburgh considers that the cross has been shortened.",

Abruzzi flourished in the manufacture of fine ecclesiastical metalwork in this period. Hildburgh considers this cross to be an example of the simpler work from this area, which was made in large quantities. Iron moulds were used to quickly and effectively emboss the metal sheets.\n\nOwing to a partial inscription upon the object, Hildburgh considers that the cross has been shortened and reconstructed at some point. He dates the cross on the basis of the inscription, which notes a 15th century date. \n\nThe upsidedown angel depicted on the top of the cross is unusual. Hildburgh argues that this figure once held a censer. Censing angels were popular in Spanish art but did not take hold to such an extent in Italian art, leading Hilburgh to consider this object as a sign of artistic influence between Italy and Spain in this period. The Abruzzi came under the rule of the Alfonso V of Aragon in the 15th century.\n\nThe representation of the fouth evangelist is uncommon, as it depicts a bearded man rather than a younger figure. Similarly the representation beneath the crucifixion, which Hildburgh considers to be Golgotha (the place where Christ was crucified), is unusual.",

            "production_note": "Hildburgh dates the cross between 1455 and 1458 on the basis of a partial inscription upon the object. Taking into account the later reconstruction of this object, and the strong possibility that this inscription was added later, it is uncertain that this dating is accurate.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The cross is the distinctive emblem of Christianity and the symbol of Christ's crucifixion. Models of the cross begin to appear from about 350 AD, probably for use in private prayer. Only from about 1000 was a cross regularly placed on the altar during Mass; a more ancient custom was to suspend a cross above the altar or to place one beside it. Crosses were also carried in procession before a service. In early centuries these were hand-held, later replaced by more visible crosses raised on staffs. Both altar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilt metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems. From about 800 they were adorned with the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the iconography of European crosses had become established, usually including the symbols of the four Evangelists, often with the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist flanking the figure of Christ crucified.",
