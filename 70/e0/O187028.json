The field is edged with a line of outward pointing triangles in metal thread.  Then a fine band of offset blocks is white silk, and a band of needleweaving. In each corner is then a smallsqaure of pulled thread work in metal thread and between these is a border in which hexagons of pulled thread alternating with a block of a pair of triangles, each made from 3 small triangles, bracketing a diamond made from 8 small triangles. Part of the hexagon in the left of the lower border as displayed, has been worked in metal thread. A band of needleweaving completes the border.\nIn the centre is an octagon of needleweaving with metal thread.  This lies in the middlke of a large octagon of needlewoven bars forming a vertical and  diagonal grid with discs where the lines cross.  Reciprocal triangles in metal thread, 4 diagonal bands of pulled thread work with silk and an outer line of reciprocal diamond-heads in metal thread surround the octagons.  It does not seem to have been possible to work the reciprocal triangles along the diagonal. This is more obvious where the combination of decorative bands is used to create a cross shape filling the field.  Within this the ground is simply embroidered with floral and geometric motifs in metal thread: there are 3 sprigs, 2 octagons, each containing a star, 2 diamonds shaped trees, small flowers and more stars in each section.  The corner units are filled with a grid of round holes in pulled thread work in silk and enclose a hexagon with a pulled thread ground in metal thread.\nThe metal thread appears to be silver strip wound around a white silk core.",
