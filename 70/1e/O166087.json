After his death, he was venerated as a loyal and righteous figure, until he was given the title of an emperor in AD 1594. With the name Guan Di, he was worshipped in temples and households as the Daoist God of War and patron of honest merchants. \n\nIn addition to large statues placed in city's temples, smaller wooden or porcelain images of Guan Di were made for worship. Figures with turquoise and purple glazes were particularly popular; in this Ming example, Guan Di is depicted in martial aspect, wearing full armour. The figure would have been placed on an altar in a household or in a temple.",
