The whole is cast in two halves along the length and held with tongue and slot joints. The horse is in a galloping stance supported above the clockwork mechanism by a wire to the right side of the lower body and to the back legs by a second wire which bends round and attaches to the outside of the right wheel. The clockwork mechanism is mounted on two large wheels marked\nGERMANY and a small wheel extended out at the rear. The key is integral to the left of the clockwork and when wound the large wheels move forward while at the same time the right wheel forces the legs of the horse up and down so it appears to be galloping. \n*The treatment of the horse looks pre-1914; however; it is possible that it could have been made shortly after the 1st World War before the development of the new designs.",
