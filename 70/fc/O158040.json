The circular stand with a gadrooned edge has scrolling strapwork with rosettes and shell motifs, on a punched matted ground and a second row of gadrooning. The waisted socle repeats the gadrooning and a simpler form of strap work; a central band is decorated with rosettes. The bowl of the fountain is decorated with similar strapwork, scrolls, rosettes and shell-motifs on a punched matt ground. The spout terminates in a dragon's head and the lever is of cast scroll design. The central section of the vase is highly polished and punctuated by two applied oval egg-and-dart edged cartouches surmounted by a calyx of acanthus leaves. An applied cartouche on the back contains an inscription whereas the front cartouche contains a coat of arms within an ornately chased rococo cartouche. A pair of handles hangs from scroll mounts on either side of the fountain. The bulbous rim of the urn is decorated with the strapwork, scrolls, rosettes and shell-motifs on a punched matt ground (similar to the decoration on the bowl and stand). The vase is surmounted by a gadrooned border. The double-domed lid is decorated with cut-card scroll-work punctuated by vertebrate sections. The highly waisted section between the lower and upper domes is highly polished, and the dome is covered in a chased calyx of laurel leaves. The fountain is surmounted by a fleur-de-lis finial.",

It was used to rinse wine glasses before they were refilled to guests at the dining table. The maker, Pierre Platel, was a prestigious Huguenot goldsmith to whom Paul de Lamerie, later the most successful smith in London, was apprenticed.\n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the religiously tolerant Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauce boat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
