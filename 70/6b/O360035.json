Five bands are attached to a seam on either side of the bodice and from the trace of ribbon stitched to the back, and the absence of pin marks on the underlying satin, were probably intended to tie in the middle. The satin ribbons now stitched to them are probably not contemporary. The skirt is tightly gathered to the concave pointed waist and is open fronted, and a band of graduated pointed appliqu\u00e9 trimmings expand towards the hem stitched at either side. The sleeves are half length and shaped to the elbow, and are similarly trimmed. The bodice is lined with canvas, stiffened with bones and has two gore inserted below the waist at either side. There is a small brass ring stitched at the neck on either side of the back.",
