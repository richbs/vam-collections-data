Edward Dewing was killed as a result of an accident in the hunting-field in 1827. His death was reported in The Ipswich Journal Saturday 24 March 1827\n'Monday last died, in the 59th year of his age Edward Dewing Esqu. of Guist, in this county. It was whilst enjoying his favourite exercise, the chase, that about a fortnight ago, he was seized with a fit of apoplexy, dropped from his horse, but did not sustain any injury from the fall, it being a ploughed land. Under the effects, however, of a second attack of the same disorder, he expired, to the sincere regret of his family and friends.'",

'It is likely that the silver waiter was sent to Henry Hewitson Esquire (agent) by Sarah Dewing (wife of Edward) from Guist during June/July 1808. She probably used the Yarmouth Office of the Union Society which later became the Norwich Union Insurance Company but at that time covered 6 million properties etc and a Richard Dewing was Director. The Town Clerk of Yarmouth was Sarah Dewing's brother and they were frequent visitors. Sarah Dewing when she died in 1838 only singled out the silver waiter from her extensive fortune and specifically mentions Bewick'.\n\nHenry Hewitson has multiple entries in Thomas Bewick's  Workshop 'Weekly Engraving Book' and 'Daily Cash Received Book'.",
