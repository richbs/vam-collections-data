Pen and ink.  371 \n<i>Width,</i> 6 1/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 2/12 <i>inches.</i> \nCollection-William Esdaile.'\nRichard Godfrey, <u>Wenceslaus Hollar: A Bohemian Artist in England</u> (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1994), no.2, p. 39\nThe following is the full text of the entry: \n\n'If the inscribed date of 1625, added by a later hand, is correct, this is possibly Hollar's earliest surviving drawing. The subject of Fortune balancing on a globe above a stormy sea is an appropriate metaphor for travelers, and it may have a connection with Hollar's departure from Prague in 1627. The rather fussy, nervous technique of the penwork certainly suggests a very early date. At this time it is unlikely that Hollar had ever seen the sea, and his conception of vessels and waves owes much to prints after Brueghel and other Netherlandish masters. The figure of Fortune is borrowed from an engraving by Theodore de Bry in <u>Emblemata Nobilitati</u>... (Frankfurt, 1592-1593). This also served as the model for a miniature dated 1620 in a <u>Liber Amicorum</u> in the Narodni Galerie, Prague, which has been published by Denkstein as a very early work by Hollar.'\nRichard Godfrey, <u>Wenceslaus Hollar: A Bohemian Artist in England</u> (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1994), p. 4\n'The pen drawing <i>Fortune,</i>dated 1625 by a later hand, is one of Hollar's earliest surviving drawings. In it Fortuna is perched on a globe above a raging sea that threatens to overwhelm a number of wallowing galleons. Lightning divides the sky, and Fortuna's garment transforms itself into a billowing sail. It is almost certain that Hollar had never seen the sea, and his vision of a distant harbour and his schematically rendered waves owe much to Flemish prints of the previous century. Hollar copied Aldegrever's little print of Fortune in 1626, but the serpentine pose of the figure in <i>Fortune</i>owes more to mannerist sources. It is an immature and derivative work but drawn with vivacity, and the subject may have greater significance than previously realised. It is evidently intended as a metaphor for the perils of travel, and it is tempting to link it with the artist's own departure from Prague into an unmapped future. It should perhaps be associated with a drawing now at Dessau, signed and dated \"1st January 1628\", inscribed \"made in Stuttgart\", and sektched for one of the <i>Album amicorum</i>(Friendship Albums) then popular in Germany, to which the owner's friends contributed drawings, poems, or personal inscriptions. It features a partly clad man clutching the caduceus of Mercury (but without Mercury's other attributes) and jumping onto dry land. Behind him a ship founders in heavy seas. A Latin tag in the sky translates as \"Art is the staff of life\".'\nFranz Sprinzels, <u>Hollar, Handzeichnungen, beschrieben und herausgegeben von Franz Sprinzels</u> (Wein, Leipzig [etc.]: Verlag Dr. Rolf Passer, ca.1938), no. 83.\nMichael Wood, <u>In Search of Shakespeare</u> (London 2003), p.325\nV.
