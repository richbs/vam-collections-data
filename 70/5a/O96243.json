Ideas were also transmitted by terracotta models, plaquettes and engravings, as well as by decorative objects for which sculptors had provided designs. Peisser probably made this relief as a model for a silver roundel. He based the composition on Peter Fl\u00f6tner's lead roundel of Temperance (see inv.no. A.29-1954). It was possibly one of a set of Virtues decorating a cabinet. However, in the seventeenth century, a smaller roundel by Peisser, also depicting Temperance, was in the celebrated collection of Paul Praun in Nuremberg. This suggests that the relief was regarded purely as a Kunstkammer object.\n\nHans Peisser (ca. 1503-ca. 1571) was active as a woodcarver and architect in Nuremberg and Prague. He carved monumental wood figures for altarpieces, along with small-scale wood models for plaquettes and bronze figures.",
