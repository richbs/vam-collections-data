The story is set in the strange uncanny landscape of Romney Marsh, on the borders of Kent and Sussex. Puck - in the guise of Tom Shoesmith, a long-dead friend of Ralph Hobden - tells how the 'people of the hills' flitted out of England in the 1530s. They were much troubled by the cruelty and suffering caused by the religious conflicts of the day, and decided they would have to go. They crowded onto the marsh, on the edge of England, and the air was full of their discontents. They called on the Widow Whitgift to help them, and lend them her two sons to carry them over the sea. They did so, and since one was blind, and the other unable to speak, they could tell nothing of what they had seen.",
