The garden courtyard is viewed at night, from above, with trees surrounding a pool in the foreground. In the arcaded passage at the far end of the courtyard sits the young maharana, identified by a nimbus, conversing with a group of nobles. Holy men are seated in the arcade to the right, and musicians, singers and dancers occupy the right hand side of the open court. Torch bearers stand to the left. \n\nThe young ruler can be identified as Raj Singh (born 1744, reigned 1754-1761) by comparison with other portraits of him. Paintings from Raj SIngh's reign are comparatively rare, and mostly date from 1754-1756.",

In this large painting he appears with a halo denoting his status as ruler and seems to be only ten or eleven years old. He and his nobles are being entertained by dancers and musicians. They are in an inner courtyard of the City Palace in Udaipur, which still has the distinctive black and white stone flooring slabs around the central garden and pond. No paintings survive from Raj Singh's reign that date from later than 1756. He died aged only seventeen in 1761. Large-scale paintings of the architecture and interiors of the palace at Udaipur became popular during the reign of his predecessors Sangram Singh and Jagat Singh II.",
