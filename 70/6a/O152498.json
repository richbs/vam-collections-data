The depiction, carried out in overglaze blue, red, brown and white overglaze colours is very realistic and appears to have been copied from a photograph. The soldier wears a fur-lined cap with ear-flaps (tied up), a red-star badge on the front of it. His olive-drab army jacket has red flashes on the collar, ech side with a brass button and 3 gold stars.",
