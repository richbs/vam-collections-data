Long periods of immobility, with the arms hanging freely from the body, represent one form of severe penance undertaken on the path to liberation. The proportions of the figure follow iconic convention: the shoulders  are broad and the chest is slightly expanded, representing an inner breath. The waist is slim and athletic, with muscular details represented on the abdomen. Parvanath is here represented as a naked, Digambara image. A triple umbrella and fly-whisks evokes the regal status of Parsvanatha. The base bears an inscription in Kanarese recording that this image was made for a Jain shrine dedicated to Parsvanatha at Garsoppa (or, as previously thought, Gulbarga) at the time of the temple's restoration in the 12th  century after a period of persecution.

Long periods of immobility, with the arms hanging freely from the body, represent one form of severe penance undertaken on the path to liberation. \n\nA \u2018naga\u2019 (serpent) protects him with the coils of his body and shelters him with his seven hoods. Parsvanatha is flanked by the attendant minor deities Dharanendra and  Padmavati, both holding a goad and noose in their hands. A triple umbrella and fly-whisks evoke Parsvanatha\u2019s regal status. Here he is represented naked, which identifies the image as belonging to the Digambara ('sky-clad') sect of Jainism.\n\nAn inscription on the base records that this image was made for a Jain shrine dedicated to Parsvanatha. It was created at Gulbarga when the temple was restored in the 12th century after a period of persecution. It also records the name of the \u2018stone engraver\u2019, Chakravarti Paloja, which is rare in Indian sculpture.\n \nThe reverse of the back plate is inscribed \u2018Parasa-naat\u2019, an anglicised rendition of Parsvanatha\u2019s name, and \u2018C.McK 1806\u2019. These initials indicate that this sculpture once formed part of the collection of Colonel Colin McKenzie, the British antiquarian.",
