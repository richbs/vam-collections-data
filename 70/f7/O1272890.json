Bert had bought Toby from St. John's Market, Liverpool for 7/6d in 1949, and Bert died just two days after the death of Toby in 1969.\n\nBert Codman was a third generation Punch Professor who worked at Colwyn Bay and  Rhos on Sea. His father was Richard Mortimer Codman II (1870-1951) who in 1888 had  taken over the Punch & Judy show outside Liverpool's Lime Street Station that had been  established by his father, Richard Codman I (1832-1909).",
