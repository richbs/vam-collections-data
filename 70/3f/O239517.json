With her work she explores the fields of interaction, participatory and web-based art.\n\nShoe-Field is an interactive artwork. It measures people's feelings about their shoes. By answering the shoe questions on the diskette you will get from the printer one of five plot patterns. The pattern you receive represents your shoe-psyche charge. This charge is a measure of how different your feelings are about your shoes from those of the average person who has taken part in previous SHOE-FIELDS. Your charge pattern is an example on a non-interactive plot. However, you are invited to create an interactive plot by selecting  a pair of shoes that you would like to interact with from the enclosed shoe chart. By typing in the number indicated on your shoe selection you will receive a printout on an interactive plot. It resembles two footprints and can be considered a podiatric Rorschach plot. Note the change in your first shoe-psyche pattern! It's because of the influence of your \"sole-mate\" choice. The computer can now give you a shoe-psyche reading. If you'd like to take this step just type \"y\" for \"yes\".\n(these are instructions being part of the artwork (pack) - Mus.No.: E.1012:4-2008)",

By answering the shoe questions on the diskette you will get from the printer one of five plot patterns. The pattern you receive represents your shoe-psyche charge. This charge is a measure of how different your feelings are about your shoes from those of the average person who has taken part in previous SHOE-FIELDS. Your charge pattern is an example on a non-interactive plot. However, you are invited to create an interactive plot by selecting  a pair of shoes that you would like to interact with from the enclosed shoe chart. By typing in the number indicated on your shoe selection you will receive a printout on an interactive plot. It resembles two footprints and can be considered a podiatric Rorschach plot. Note the change in your first shoe-psyche pattern! It's because of the influence of your \"sole-mate\" choice. The computer can now give you a shoe-psyche reading. If you'd like to take this step just type \"y\" for \"yes\".\n(these are instructions coming with the whole artwork (pack) - Mus.No.: E.1012:4-2008)",
