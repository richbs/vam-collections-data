The empty frame was designed to contain Picasso's picture L'enfant au Pigeon. There is a strip of the original 19th-century chinoiserie wallpaper in the collection (P.13A-1977). \n\nWhistler was a noted painter of murals, as well as a book-illustrator and stage-designer. Perhaps his best known murals are those in the restaurant of Tate Britain.",
