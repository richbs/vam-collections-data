If a child in a poorer family needed a warm garment, the knitted jumper and cardigan were a godsend to any parent who could use knitting needles and either afford new yarn or unravel an old garment to re-use; patterns were published free in popular periodicals, and copiable if a neighbour had one.  \n\nSchool photographs of groups of children from Board schools provide some of the best evidence of the increased use of knitting in clothing children: before the 1890s, many of the children are wearing garments, particularly jackets, which are too large or too small, and doubtless in some cases so worn out that they provided little warmth.  By the 1910s, many of the children, and certainly the majority of the boys, are wearing knitted garments instead.  Knitted clothing also had the advantage of a certain amount of elasticity to accommodate a child's growth, and was thrifty.  If need be a jumper could be unravelled and knitted up again in a larger size, with a contrasting welt and cuffs of some other yarn, or in stripes using up several old garments.",
