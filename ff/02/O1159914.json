He is internationally recognised as a fashion and furniture designer. Hajjaj designed the Salon Afrique interiors in Royal Festival Hall during the 2005 exhibition Africa Remix and was shortlisted for the Jameel Prize. \n\nHajjaj often designs the clothing worn by the models in his photographs, some of which incorporate the logos of global brands to create surprising juxtapositions with more traditional motifs such as the veil. The end result is an exuberant melange of stereotypical symbols of Western consumerism and Middle Eastern tradition.",
