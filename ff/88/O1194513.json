            "public_access_description": "This 'Baby Sweetums' doll was manufactured by the US company Uneeda. They were a doll company founded in 1917 in Brooklyn, New York and produced thousands of cloth, composition, hard plastic and vinyl dolls that were well made and reasonably priced. Their slogan was 'A Uneeda Doll is a gift to be treasured', as can be seen on this box.\n\nTheir first 'Sweetums' was made in 1936 and was a composition doll with a cloth stuffed body, which was also a drink and wet doll. Encouraged by the advances made in technology and equipment in the 1930s, manufacturers of baby dolls began to produce dolls that were more realistic with the functions to drink and wet. In more recent years however, manufacturers have pushed even further into realism with some dolls coming complete with hospital identity tags, nappy rash and being anatomically correct. This has proved to be controversial and the level of realism which 'Baby Sweetums' depicts, seems to be an appropriate level for a childs toy.",
