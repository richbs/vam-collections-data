She obviously cherished these clothes as a reminder...\n\nWorn by Charles \"Laddie\" Powell (b about 1880) who lived in Amoy, Fukien province, S China, with his sisters Florence Gwendoline (Gwen) (b 1875), Norah Jane (b 1876), and Dorothy Maud (\"Bobs\") (b about 1878) and their parents, Charles Powell (a British tea merchant) and his wife Florence (n\u00e9e Doggett), although as the children grew older they were sent to England to school.  On a visit to England with their amah, Ahlan, they were all photographed together in Chinese costume, and in fact the Powell children seem to have worn native dress much of the time at home.",
