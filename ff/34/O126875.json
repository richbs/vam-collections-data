Particularly during the first three centuries of the Empire's existence (27 BC-AD 284)  images were made of historically recorded (and some unrecorded) people. Trajan was one the greatest of the Roman emperors.He waged successful wars against the Germans and the Parthians, and was rewarded with the title Optimus, 'the Best'. His memory was greatly honoured, and he was given the unusual right of burial within the city limits of Rome. His ashes were placed in the base of his great column, held in an urn made of gold. Theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas, discussed Trajan as an example of a virtuous pagan. In the Divine Comedy, Dante, following this legend, sees the spirit of Trajan in the Heaven of Jupiter with other historical and mythological persons noted for their justice. Dio Cassius reported that \"he was devoted to boys and to wine\".",
