Evidence on lower right of extra cords and blue and red oversewing onto another piece, probably onto the back of the bag. The final knot on either end of each row has been pulled towards the centre of the piece to create a firm edge.\n\nEND FINISH: missing\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark red ground with three bands of three guls each outlined in dark blue, quartered in red and white and containing a quarter hexagon in dark blue and red. Offset between them are two and two part motifs of five small rectangles in blue or light blue, each containing a red start; the central, fifth, rectangle is white or light red with a dark blue star. The field extends upwards in the upper left hand corner to accommodate a complete secondary motif and extra wedges of weft have been inserted.  \n\nMain border: white ground with rectangular stars.\n\nInner and outer border: reciprocal red/blue running dog pattern.\n\nLower: unpatterned dark red ground maximum 21 cms deep. This unpatterned area extends along the sides and joins with the uppermost band.\n\nUppermost band: 5 cms unpatterned dark red followed by a band of repeating motifs: a light blue vertical bar between a geometric motif with a pair of narrow pendant branches. These motifs intersect with the lower of two narrow bands of diagonal  blocks which give the impression of a chevron.\n\nThere are areas of re-piling in the top left and top right.",
