If so, it was probably made as a fastening for a woman's belt.\n\nTime\nThe pointed oval shape of the Jasper medallion was fashionable from about 1780. Belts with wide, heavy fastenings were not worn by women in late-18th-century Britain. However, they appear in portraits of women in court dress painted around 1810, where they are shown worn high under the bust.\n\nTrading\nThe Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) sold small quantities of Jasper medallions with steel mounts in his London showrooms, but the majority were mounted and sold by others.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSteel was relatively inexpensive, but the labour-intensive facetting on the best cut-steel work made it costly. The cut-steel mounts on Wedgwood's Jasper are often attributed to the great Birmingham industrialist Matthew Boulton (1728-1809), a friend and rival of Wedgwood's. However, Wedgwood also supplied Jasper for mounting to other firms, including Green & Vale of Birmingham and Vernon & Hasselwood of Wolverhampton. Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Woodstock were the chief centres for cut-steel.",
