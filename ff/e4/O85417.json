One poem reads:\n\n\u2018It has not been my habit, where lust is concerned,\nTo speak of the pain in my heart to anyone.\nDespite this, I wish to say one thing:\nI have died for love of you! Respond to my cry for help!\u2019\n\nIn many Islamic societies, scenes containing humans and animals were a common type of decoration in non-religious contexts. The source of this imagery was usually poetry, the most highly esteemed form of secular literature. \n\nLuxury copies of narrative poems were often illustrated with fine paintings, and the more familiar episodes were depicted on palace walls and objects. Love lyrics accompanied portrayals of beautiful young men and women. Odes in praise of the ruler inspired enthronement scenes. The recitation of poems at court was depicted, as were princely activities such as hunting and, as here, playing polo.",
