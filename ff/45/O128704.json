The inscription shows that the object was commissioned and given  by a cleric and citizen of the town of Faenza, Nicholas Marchesi. Local people would have donated gifts to the treasury as signs of their faith and as way of ensuring remembrance after their deaths. They may also have wished to improve the status and authority of their local parish.\n\nFaenza held the relics of St Peter Damian, an eleventh century bishop. These relics would have encouraged pigrims to visit the area and may have increased donations to the cathedral treasury.\n\nThis chalice is made form copper, a material more affordable that silver and gold. Less costly metals were often used in the construction of chalices, however gold or silver-gilt was always used for the bowl of the cup. This had a symbolic meaning, as the bowl was to hold the blood of Christ but also a hygienic purpose, as base metals could contaminate the wine.",

Medieval Treasuries contained two types of object; functional items used during the liturgy such as chalices and symbolic items to be revered and admired, namely reliquaries. These objects were made from rich materials such as gold, silver, enamel and gems. Such materials were considered to be the best way to honour God. The development of a treasury relied upon gifts. People donated precious objects as a sign of their wealth and status and to ensure remembrance after death. Some churchmen also sought to obtain treasures for their Church stores. Abbot Suger for example worked hard to improve the treasury at St Denis.\n\nTreasuries signified the wealth and power of their Church. Important relics attracted pilgrims, bringing wealth and status to the area. Many church treasures were kept on public display and used in public processions and festivals, which encouraged a sense of community. Other treasuries however were more closely guarded. The Basel Cathedral Treasury was kept locked in cabinets in the sacristy, only to be used on special feast days. This exclusivity only served to increase the objects\u2019 status as important and sacred objects.\n\nA chalice was used during the mass to hold the consecrated wine. Chalices were usually made from gold or silver, although less wealthy churches owned chalices of base metal. The bowl however was always made of precious metal because it would hold the sanctified wine, which Christian believe is transformed into the blood of Christ during the Mass.",
