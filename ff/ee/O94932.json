Trained in the family workshops and at the \u00c9cole de la Bijouterie-joaillerie-orf\u00e8vrerie (School of Silversmithing and Jewellery), his reputation rests largely as a jeweller designing and producing highly geometrical, simply proportioned forms. For this he won two major prizes at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1925.  Like Puiforcat, Sandoz was a member of the Union des Artistes Modernes, many of whom produced silver in a dramatic, geometric style.  Again like Puiforcat, Sandoz often incorporated blocks of dark wood, as on the handle of this teapot, to serve as a contrast to the shiny surface of the silver.  In 1931, he abandoned his jewellery and silversmithing business altogether to devote his time to painting and film production.",

Trained in the family workshops and at the \u00c9cole de la Bijouterie-joaillerie-orf\u00e8vrerie (School of Silversmithing and Jewellery), his reputation rests largely as a jeweller designing and producing highly geometrical, simply proportioned forms. For this he won two major prizes at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1925.  Like Puiforcat, Sandoz was a member of the Union des Artistes Modernes, many of whom produced silver in a dramatic, geometric style.  Again like Puiforcat, Sandoz often incorporated blocks of dark wood, as on the handle of this teapot, to serve as a contrast to the shiny surface of the silver.  In 1931, he abandoned his jewellery and silversmithing business altogether to devote his time to painting and film production.",
