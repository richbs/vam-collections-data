It is very simple in form, relying on the use of large-scale blocks of wood to create the bulbous turnings that are its most dominant feature.  We do not know why these areas of the table are so heavily worn but it was painted when it first came to the Museum and may have spent part of its life in rather lowly circumstances.  \n\nDraw tables were an ingenious invention of the late-16th century.  The under-sections of the table top pull out at each end and are cantilivered on sections that run through the main frame. As they are pulled out on the tapering cantilever sections, they rise up until the lock into position at either side of the main table top, at the same height.",

            "history_note": "This table was purchased as a 17th-century English draw-table from C. Fell, Corporation Street, Chesterfield, in 1907 (Nominal File: Fell, C., MA/1/F321, RF 1716/1907).  A report to Mr Kendrick by Oliver Brackett states that 'The surface at present is covered with the remains of a red paint, which was put on, perhaps, some time in the 19th century. This does not improve the appearance of the table which is otherwise in fairly good condition; except that some of the mouldings round the drawer-fronts are missing and the feet are almost worn away; the drawer-knobs, also, are of different wood and may be of later date, while the bulbous parts of the legs are mere shapeless masses, having, no doubt, been kicked out of shape in the course of time. The object, however, is an honest example of rough, country-made furniture  of the period and although principally remarkable for its solidity, is shapely in proportion and sound in workmanship.'  The table was compared to 384-1898, which was of finer quality.  The table was purchased as being of relatively low price and 'untouched by the restorer'.",
