The front legs angled at the outside and square on the inside are joined by a plain square stretcher and above by a deep, apron-like front seat rail shaped on its lower edge with two rising steps at each side and in the centre a pendant square. These shapings are surrounded by double-incised lines. The back legs are slightly tapered and curved slightly backwards. They are joined to the front legs by a plain stretcher just above ground. The back legs rise to form the sides of the tall back, tapering, chamfered on their outside back edges and following an attenuated reverse S-curve. The back is filled with a grid of 12 squares in 6 vertcally stacked pairs: the framework is plain. The top rail has a cresting with 2 steps on each side which projects as a square moulding.",
