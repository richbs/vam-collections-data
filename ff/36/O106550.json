It was revived in Europe during the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Cameos and intaglios were prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power and mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment. This intaglio may simply portray a shepherd, his flock represented by a single goat.  On the other hand the subject could be the god Mercury who, among his many other manifestations, was known as the protector of shepherds and flocks. In this guise Mercury's attribute is the ram, and he is frequently shown wearing the 'petasus',  the broad-brimmed hat of felt or straw associated with farmers and travellers,  and sometimes carrying the 'syrinx' - the reed pipes of Pan.",

Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.",
