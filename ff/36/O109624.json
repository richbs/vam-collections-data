The effect was often achieved with glazes of a single colour.  Many of these wares have moulded or carved decoration, as on the rim of this piece.\n\nIn the 16th century, ceramic production in Iran was on a modest scale. When the capital moved to Isfahan around 1600, the production of luxury dishes and wall tiles in a wide variety of styles and techniques rapidly increased.\n\nWe cannot identify a particular centre of production of ceramic vessels. Surviving pieces illustrate the many techniques the potters used. These included underglaze painting, coloured glazes and lustre, which was revived after 1650.",
