            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe teapot is small, reflecting the cost of tea in mid-18th-century Britain. In 1747, a few years before this one was made, the tax on tea imported from China was greatly increased, and the figures for imports fell accordingly. In the 1750s the annual weight of tea legally imported into Britain was about 3.2 million pounds. However, much was smuggled into the country to avoid paying import duties. Black, fermented teas were more widely drunk than the unfermented green teas. They were usually drunk with milk and often sweetened with refined white sugar. Afternoon and after-dinner tea were usually served by the lady of the house in the drawing room in comfortably-off households.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Bow factory made a type of porcelain that was strengthened with bone ash, making it suitable for utilitarian tea- and table wares. Painting in underglaze (cobalt) blue was one of the cheapest forms of decoration, and was much used for utilitarian wares. At its commercial peak, the factory was operating on a vast scale, employing in the region of 300 people around 1760 and calling in receipts of around \u00a311,555 in 1755.",
