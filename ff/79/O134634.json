They were all for gentlemen's studies, or 'Herrenzimmer', in Munich, for example at the Thieme House (1906-6) and the Sultan House (1906). We do not know where this particular chair was originally supplied for, or who made it.\n\nThe chair shows how Riemerschmid's design ideas were developing.  The construction of the chair is made very clear, especially the way in which the sides of the back drop down at an angle below the seat to form a three-sided brace with the vertical rear leg and the horizontal side stretcher, giving the chair strength.  At the same time as he was designing this chair, Riemerschmid was developing furniture with components that could be manufactured by machines before being assembled by hand. The simplified shapes and decoration of this chair suggest that he may have intended these elements to be machine-made.  Richard Riemerschmid is regarded as a precursor to and influence on the revolutionary ideas of the Bauhaus some fifteen years later.",
