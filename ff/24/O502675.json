Lawrence (Lugt 2445); S. Woodburn (sale, Christie, 4-8 June 1860, unidentified lot, bought for the Museum) \n\nFormerly catalogued under Bronzino; attributed to Tosini by Pouncey and, as he subsequently discovered, connected with a picture in the Museo Civico at Udine. In the picture the artist substituted a landscape and a ruined stone house for the rustic hut, and the figures on the left are differently grouped. But the shepherd raising his cap is there, so is the kneeling Virgin, flanked by two \nangels, and the Child lying on the ground. The pose of the angel on the right, with hands raised, is almost the same in the picture as in the drawing; and the little separate sketch of St Joseph kneeling, with his hands crossed on his breast, in the bottom left-hand corner of the drawing was used in the picture instead of the kneeling shepherd.",
