The chrysoprase body was carved from a single stone and richly set with hardstones and diamonds. Chrysoprase was a particular favourite of Frederick. It was mined in Silesia, the first territory which he added to Prussia by conquest in 1740. In his final illness, specimens of polished and rough chrysoprase, as well as his jewels and boxes, were laid out for him to see.  The diamonds have been coloured by being set over pale pink, green and lemon yellow metal foils.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

A highly cultivated admirer of the arts, the king was himself a gifted musician, composer and linguist. Frederick's taste in elegant boxes was shaped by his mother Sophia-Dorothea, who had an extensive collection. He carried a box at all times: one saved his life by deflecting a Russian bullet during the Battle of Kunersdorf (1759).\n\nAs Crown Prince, Frederick visited a goldsmith's workshop to learn the secrets of the art. When he became king in 1740, he immediately decreed a ban on the import of French gold boxes 'for the good of Berlin's goldsmiths'. \n\nHe summoned goldsmiths to his palace at Potsdam to discuss their work and even provided them with his own drawings. Each year when Frederick moved to Berlin for the carnival, he had some of his boxes carefully transported on the back of a camel.",
