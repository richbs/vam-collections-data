Worked as assistant to his father by the age of 15. Exhibited 34 works at the RA between 1843 and 1898, 18 at the BI 1844-67, and 25 at the SBA 1846-94. Early works mainly subjects from English history, and from literature, particularly Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites in the 1850s, in both technique and subject matter; painted several scenes of modem life, notably 'Omnibus Life in London' (1859, Tate Gallery). Later works are mostly 18th-century costume subjects. Designed one of the first Christmas cards, an etched greeting dated 1848. Friend of W P Frith, for whom he painted backgrounds on occasion. Died Chiswick, London, 20 February 1916. \n\nLIT: W M Egley <i>Catalogue of Pictures</i>. . .

Unusually, it does not seem to have been exhibited in any of the major shows such as the RA, but toured the country between 1889 and 1895, its price, apparently, being reduced en route from \u00a340 to \u00a315. \n\nThe work is described as no 928 in the artist's <i>Catalogue</i>: \n\nThe picture represents Florence Dombey on the day after she had fled from the cruelty of her father to take refuge in the house of Solomon Gills, the nautical instrument maker, of which Captain Cuttle had taken charge. 'Florence, being busy with her needle in the little parlour, was more calm and tranquil than she had been on the day preceding'. \n\nAfter a detailed description of the composition, Egley adds: 'Florence was, at this time, presumably, under twenty years of age; and the costume is that of a young girl in 1848, the date of the publication of <i>Dombey and Son</i>'. The episode depicted is taken from chapter 49 of Charles Dickens's novel <i>Dombey and Son</i>, first published in monthly parts between 1846 and 1848. \n\nPROV: Bought by H S Ashbee for \u00a325 1898, and bequeathed by him to the museum 1900 \n\nEXH: Leeds 1889; Liverpool 1889; Manchester 1890; Nottingham 1890; Birmingham 1891; Crystal Palace 1892; Southport 1894; Brighton 1895; <i>An Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by Victorian Artists in England</i> National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, 1965 (36) \n\nENGR: A chromolithograph of 1893 is recorded\"\nVictoria and Albert Museum <u>Charles Dickens: An exhibition to celebrate the centenary of his death</u> London: HMSO, 1970.

Maw Egley 1888</i>\nOil\n1824-1900\n\nStanding in opposition to the hard capitalist world of Dombey is the shop of Sol Gills, at the sign of the Wooden Midshipman. Though Sol is commercially inept - 'the world's gone past me. I hardly know where I am myself; much less where my customers are' - his heart is in the right place, and with his nephew Walter he cherishes a secret love of the marvellous and adventurous. When Florence Dombey is driven from her home by her father's harshness, she takes refuge in the Wooden Midshipman, now (in Sol's absence) under the supervision of the lovably eccentric, sentenious Captain Cuttle. The painting was retouched in 1890.'",
