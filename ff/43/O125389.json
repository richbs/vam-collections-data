The earliest datable figures appear to be of Queen Victoria, and although a few figures were produced after her death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints.  They represented a wide variety of subjects but those of actors and actresses were especially popular. \n\nThis flatback probably represents an actor in costume, but the engraving from which it would have been taken has not been found so it cannot be identified.",
