After a year in the studio of Henry Perronet Briggs, he studied in Paris, returning to Hull to work as a portrait painter for five years. Moved permanently to London 1845 and became a successful genre painter. Also painted marine subjects after 1860. Some 40 of his works were popular through engravings. Exhibited 55 genre pictures at the RA between 1843 and 1882, 19 at the BI 1846-67, and 11 at the SBA 1846-68. Died 1891, in June according to <i>The Year's Art</i> (1892); his death was noted in the July 1891 issue of the <i>Art Journal</i> (p224). \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1872, pp197-9 \n\n<b>The Dawn of Love</b> \nFA241 \nCanvas, 111.7 x 86.4 cm (44 x 34 ins) \nSigned and dated 'T Brooks 1846' bl \nGiven by Christopher Pearse 1864 \n\nPresumably the painting exhibited at the RA in 1846, with no title, but the following quotation from Robert Burns's song 'There was a Lass', verses 10 and 12: \n\nO Jeannie fair. I lo'e thee dear; \nO canst thou think to fancy me? \nOr wilt thou leave thy mammie\u2019s cot, \nAnd learn to tent the farms wi\u2019 me? \n\nNow what could artless Jeannie do? \nShe had nae will to say him na; \nAt length she blushed a sweet consent, \nAnd love was aye between them tha.\n \nThe <i>Art Union</i> recorded of the RA painting that 'the composition consists of two figures at a spring - Jeannie listens with a modest and retiring air to the confession of her lover, who is not less timid than herself. The picture is brilliant, well drawn, and judiciously treated; at least it seems to have all those qualities, for it is placed high, and is assuredly worthy of a better position'. The 1872 article on Brooks in the <i>Art Journal</i> paraphrased those comments, adding that the picture 'might have been called \"The Dawn of Love\", for it shows Burns's \"Jeannie\" with her lover ... '. Brooks exhibited several Burns subjects in the 1840s. \n\nEXH: \tRA 1846 (627)\n\nENGR: 1 June 1847, published by Henry Meeson, Hanover Galleries, George Street, Hanover Square, London W1 \n\nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1846, p184; <i>Art Journal</i> 1872, p197\"",

The timid and hesitant natures of both boy and girl are delightfully expressed, and the picture's simple directness, which perfectly matches that of Burns' verse,  make this one of the most affecting images of rustic courtship in nineteenth-century art.",
