The design was executed for a production of  Gluck's opera \"Orpheus and Eurydice\", performed by the Lyric Opera of Chicago, November 24th 1962.  The opera was produced by Christopher West, conducted by Pierre Dervaux, choreographed by Ruth Page, and the cast featured Gabriel Bacquier as Orpheus, and Lisa Della Casa as Eurydice.  The principal dancer was Maria Tallchief.\n\nThe production (originally produced and choreographed by Frederick Ashton, designed by Sophie Fedorovitch, and lit by Louis Yudkin) was borrowed from the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, where it was premiered on February 3rd 1953. The original cast featured Kathleen Ferrier as Orpheus.  Alix Stone designed new costumes for the principal artists in the 1962 Chicago revival.",
