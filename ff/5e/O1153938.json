Olympic mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially children and youth. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held. They convey the theme of the Olympic Games and showcase the distinctive geographical features, history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nThis Olympic mascot is a plastic dog called Cobi made for the Barcelona games in 1992. He was designed by the Valencian cartoonist Javier Mariscal. Several figures were made of Cobi in a range of stances and sports. This figure is standing with outstretched arms. \nThe Barcelona Organising Committee for the Olympics had specially produced a TV series for Cobi and he has endured as one of the most loved Olympic mascots.",
