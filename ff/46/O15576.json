            "public_access_description": "Elsa Schiaparelli (1890-1973) was born in Rome and initially studied philosophy. She spent her early married life in Boston and New York. In 1920 she moved to Paris. One of her first designs, a black sweater knitted with a white bow to give a trompe l'\u0153il (trick of the eye) effect, was seen by a store buyer and subsequent orders put her into business.  In 1928 she opened a shop called Pour le Sport. Her own salon followed a year later.  \n\nSchiaparelli was famed for her attractive and wittily designed evening ensembles. Her clothes were smart, sophisticated and often wildly eccentric, but she had a huge following. Her ideas, coupled with those she commissioned from famous artists, were carried out with considerable skill. Salvador Dal\u00ed, Christian B\u00e9rard and Jean Cocteau, for example, designed fabrics and accessories. Jean Schlumberger produced costume jewellery and buttons. Cubism and Surrealism influenced her designs. She used tweed to make evening wear and hessian for dresses. She dyed furs, put padlocks on suits and created a vogue for Tyrolean peasant costume. In this dress she was faithful to one of her favourite colours, shocking pink, which she has toned down with an overlay of semi-transparent white organza. \n\nThe dress was worn by the Duchess of Devonshire. It forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. This Collection was brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination, Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",

At the time he was not expected to inherit the dukedom but his older brother William was killed in combat in 1944. Andrew became duke, and Deborah became duchess, when the 10th Duke died in 1950.\nThe Duchess has been the main public face of Chatsworth House for many decades, and has remained so in her widowhood.  She has written several books about Chatsworth, and has played a key role in the restoration of the house.\nIn 1999 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (DCVO) by Queen Elizabeth II. She has three children, including the 12th Duke. She is a grandmother of the fashion model Stella Tennant.\nHer Grace became the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire in 2004 when her son inherited the Dukedom upon the death of her husband of 63 years.\n\nThe Dowager Duchess was contacted during the course of research for <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-1957</i> exhibition (2007: V&A), but does not recall to where she wore the dress or the occassion.

Gabor's costumes were based upon Toulouse Lautrec's posters depicting Jane Avril.\n\nThe dress featured the 'shocking pink' colour made famous by Schiaparelli and which characterised her work for many.\n\nSchiaparelli designs from this year are scarce as the house was facing bankruptcy, and eventually had to close in 1954.",
