This is the only known instrument built by this otherwise unrecorded luthier, but Carlos IV, who is best known for his patronage of  the artist Francisco Goya (1746 - 1828),  was a keen encourager of the arts, despite his turbulent reign which was blighted by wars that followed the French Revolution. \n\nVallejo's  guitar is fitted with six courses of double strings, which would have been normal for a guitar by about 1780, and an extra ten treble courses, like the Italian chitarra-salterio  (Psaltery guitar), 'Russian theorbo' and Parisian guitare-multicorde.",
