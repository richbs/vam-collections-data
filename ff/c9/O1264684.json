His refusal to shoot a captured bear cub in November 1902 was made famous through a political cartoon by Clifford Berryman in the Washington Post newspaper. The endearing cartoon bear became associated with the President. When the teddy bear craze took off in the States in 1906, the soft toys became commonly known as teddy bears.\nThis bear was produced as a special edition for the charity, Good Bears of the World, and marks the centenary of President Roosevelt\u2019s association with the teddy bear.",
