            "public_access_description": "This plaquette is made by Moderno.\nModerno (Galeazzo Mondella) (1467-1528) is the pseudonym of this goldsmith and medallist active in North Italy and later in Rome. He signed certain pieces of his work with OPUS MODERNI (opus is the Latin term for 'work' - which then means 'work of the modern'). The modern here is referring to the Ancient World, in contrary to the Naturalism of the Gothic. His earliest works may date around 1485-1490, and his earliest dated work is 1490.\nModerno specialised in small bronze plaquettes exploring religious or antique themes, and catered for a clientele of learned humanists.\n\nThe best examples of Italian plaquettes were produced between c.1485 and 1530, and were limited to central and northern Italy. In their purest form they were by definition light and of a size that could be held comfortably in the hand for close inspection. Unlike portrait medals they were one sided. They were modest in their relief and often used rilievo schiacciato, a very shallow form of relief, to give a subtle illusion of depth, as used to the extreme for the hill-town in the backround of this plaquette. This differentiates the plaquette from larger bronze reliefs, along with the fact that up to 50 were cast from the same moulds. Plaquettes were usually bronze like this Ulocrino relief, but they were also cast in brass, lead or precious metals.",
