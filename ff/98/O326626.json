Bowcher was a British medallist and sculptor. He studied in London at the National Art Training School,  under Edward Onslow Ford and in Paris, where he was influenced by the work of Jules- Cl\u00e9ment Chaplain and Oscar Roty. In 1886 he produced a medallic portrait of the Khedive  of Egypt and was then commissioned to produce designs for the Egyptian coinage. In 1903, following the death of George William de  Saulles, Bowcher stepped in to finish the great seal of Edward VII. He was a founder- member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors and until the 1930s exhibited regularly at  the Royal Academy. In the early 1920s he produced, under the direction of M. H. Spielmann (1858\u20131948), a series of plaquettes of the rulers of Baroda.",
