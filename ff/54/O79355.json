Fine arts and scientific inventions and discoveries remained central display themes but each exhibition presented different aspects of manufacture. In 1872 one emphasis was on jewellery, including \u2018peasant jewellery\u2019. The Exhibition Commissioners arranged with the South Kensington Museum (later V&A) to make a collection of peasant jewellery from \u2018all parts of the world, which should become public property, for exhibition in the Museum after the close of the Exhibition\u2019. A letter was sent by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to British representatives overseas asking for their help in securing pieces of jewellery, particularly examples with \u2018a direct connection with the native instinctive art, which has been handed down by a long tradition\u2019. The outcome was considered to be \u2018most satisfactory \u2026 a collection of characteristic ornaments never before equalled was obtained\u2019. \n\nThis earring, originally one of a pair, is part of this collection. Described as \u2018Moorish\u2019 at the time, its thick hollow hoop, stud on the side, and pendants hanging from the base, are all typical of earrings worn in Morocco.  This design is not found anywhere else in North Africa, but similar earrings were worn with traditional dress in central Spain until the early 20th century, demonstrating the common Moorish heritage of both cultures.  The little bird in the centre is probably a symbol of fertility.",
