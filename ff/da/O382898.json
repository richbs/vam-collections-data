They were as decorative and expensive as more conventional pieces like brooches or necklaces.\n\nSquare appliqu\u00e9s like this were used to add extra decoration.  They were worn on the waistband, or sometimes attached to ribbons for the hair.  The pendant disc is a very common decoration in Nordic traditional jewellery.  This appliqu\u00e9 has been converted to a brooch for easier wear.  It is marked with the Stockholm town mark of St. Erik's head, the date mark M5 (1866), and the maker's mark AGM.  Anders Gustaf Millberg was a silversmith who worked in Stockholm from 1860 to 1888.  This appliqu\u00e9 was bought for nine shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
