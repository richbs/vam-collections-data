The outer two are sewn with running stitch with red leather on brown exposing a gilded leather layer beneath. The central cross is in a circular medallion. Red leather is on a gilded background, sewn with running stitch. Back seam sewn with ship stitch.\n[Fillet] The curved end of a hair stuffed crescent shaped object. The hair is wrapped in linen then covered in brown and black leather.  The end is decorated with an openworked design of interlaced waves (guilloche) with four central gilded ovals. The thread used is golden. This leads to a larger design that is broken at this point. The seam at the back is sewn with running stitch.",
