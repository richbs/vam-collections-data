Before being exported to Europe, the pair of vases had probably stood for hundreds of years on a temple altar in China. It is likely that they were part of a set of altar vessels, for a number of similar examples are known, some bearing inscriptions. Such sets were also made in bronze, although from early times pottery was substituted for metal. Well potted and skilfully painted in light, clear cobalt blue, the form of the vase was current around the year 1500. The lotus panel around the foot, the cloud collar on the shoulder and the plantain leaves on the neck and handles are further indicators of such a dating. The most interesting section comprises the band around the body, which has a lively design of dragons with flaming pearls above waves. The dragons are unusual, for they have webbed, bat-like wings and fins. By the mid Ming period, a whole variety of new dragon types had begun to appear in Chinese art.",
