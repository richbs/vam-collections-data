Rambert determined that her company would dictate new trends in dance and in the 1960s, Ballet Rambert began producing contemporary dance only.\n\nCruel Garden is based on the poetry and events in the life of the Spanish poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who was murdered at the start of the Spanish Civil War. Its development was conceived by Lindsay Kemp, choreographed by Christopher Bruce, designed by Ralph Koltai and its music was written by Carlos Miranda.",
