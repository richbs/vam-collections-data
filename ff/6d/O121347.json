The design of the framework is strongly influenced by French art of the period of Louis XIV. In the centre is the coat-of-arms of Michel B\u00e9gon and Elizabeth Beauharnais, united by marriage in 1711. \n\nResting upon a draped base with scrolled feet are two oval shields of arms. The left hand azure shield contains a chevron between two roses and at the base a lion, argent (for or) for B\u00e9gon; while the right hand shield, argent a fesse, contains three martlets, sable, for Beauharnais. The shields are placed side by side (accol\u00e9es) and ensigned by a count's coronet.   \n\nAt each of the corners is a symmetrically-arranged bunch of lilies, carnations and others flowers and foliations, from which spring slender curving stems of flowers and leaves which fill the straight borders. At the middle of each side is a leafy device connected by straight bars with the corner-devices. The corners of the field have floral bouquets, which extend into the border with its floral meander design. The napkin is painted on both sides.",
