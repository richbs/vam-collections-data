The design of roses and lilies on a bright blue ground is characteristic of popular floral design in the 1850s and early 1860s. The cosy would have been kept for special occasions and used with the 'best' silver or porcelain tea pot when entertaining important visitors for afternoon tea.\n\nBeads were popular for all forms of Victorian embroidered decoration on dress and for a wide range of domestic items in middle-class homes, such as upholstery, cushions, bell-pulls and fire screens. The glass industries of Germany and Italy produced and exported vast numbers of glass beads for this use in a wide variety of colours. The beads used in this example were known as 'pound' beads as they were purchased by weight. This tea cosy is decorated with two popular types: those in bright opaque colours and others in translucent clear shades.",
