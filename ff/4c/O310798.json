The bier, which stands on four ivory bun feet, is held between two wood runners inside the box, and slides out of it at one end. The arms are cut from separate pieces of ivory pegged on at the shoulder. The right one lies straight at her side, while the left one is bent, the lower arm lying over her thorax. When the arm is raised, the hand half-covers the figure's face, as if in modesty, a feature which is seen in many other such anatomical figures. The upper part of the trunk lifts off disclosing the viscera and the intestines, which are covered with an apron or membrane, which is also removable. Parts of the viscera are coloured red. Beneath this second cover is a membrane made of vellum, underneath which is the womb with a fetus, likewise partly painted in red. A small length of string is attached to the fetus's stomach, replicating the umbilical cord. The torso of the woman is elongated, and the proportions generally of the body are anatomically incorrect. E.g. the feet are disproportionately small. She is depicted smiling, wearing a headband and her shoulder-length hair is carved in a fairly elaborate if stylised fashion. The back of the body is relatively unworked and flattened, and seems to be glued to the velvet pad on the bier.",

The figure, which is not carved at the back, lies on a bier covered with red velvet. The upper part of the trunk lifts off disclosing the viscera and the intestines covered with an apron or membrane which in turn can be removed to show the foetus. The figure was likely for general educational purposes, not only for medical students or midwives. They might also have been kept in private collections as objects of curiosity. Such figures were made in Germany, France and Italy. It is difficult to attribute this piece definitively; the style of the box, which much be original, suggests it dates from the first half of the eighteenth century.",
