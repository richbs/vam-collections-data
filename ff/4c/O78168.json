This design is from an album made up from sheets cut from two pattern books published by Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) in the 1770s and in the 1780s. It consists of 25 whole-page plates and 121 plates pasted in onto 18 leaves. The designs are for domestic silver and include candlesticks, candelabra, cruet-stands, inkstands, bottle tickets, waiters, tea-urns, vases, wine coolers, mugs, cups, entr\u00e9e dishes, a dish cross, a fish-slice, sugar tongs and a tray.\n\nPeople\nThe architect James Wyatt (1746-1813), who is known to have made designs for silver for Matthew Boulton in 1776, may have supplied this particular design. Boulton, like his contemporary Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795), tried to secure the talents of the best designers available. \n\nDesign & Designing\nHigh-quality pattern books like these ensured the rapid spread of fashionable Neo-classical design across Europe and America. Silversmiths often compiled their own design books from a variety of sources. This particular album remained in use in various workshops and manufactories until the 1930s, which indicates how long such patterns remained useful sources of design.",

Although working outside Sheffield he was from the mid-1760s onwards the largest single manufacturer of Sheffield plate. He is known to have produced two engraved catalogues for silver or plate. The first, made in the 1770s, contained small images well adapted to being cut up and sent individually to correspondents rather like the small drawings which were sent to special customers. At a later date, perhaps in the 1780s, he published another catalogue probably for plate alone, containing full-size images like the ones produced by his Sheffield competitors. It is probably this one which was described in 1803 as the 'Book of Engravings ... of plated wares such as he generally sends abroad for Correspondents to order from'. This example is a later amalgamation of the two catalogues. That its donor, John Wateridge (cat. no. 4.6), was a designer in metal who acquired the volume in 1910 indicates how long such patterns remained useful sources of design.'",
