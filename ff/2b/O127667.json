It is attributed to the Reverend J. Thomson who was a successful, Scottish landscapist as well as minister of Duddingston from 1805. \n\nAs well as painting works influenced by the Old Masters, Thomson produced works of real originality in which the main features of the Scottish landscape and climate were evoked in broad, rapid brushstrokes. He was a close friend of the writer Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), who was an important influence on his work, and collaborated with J.M.W. (1775-1851), to produce illustrations for Scott\u2019s Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826).",

In a balanced and harmonious composition typical of Claude, the trees frame the foreground and guide the viewer\u2019s eye to the central vista of the castle and distant hills beyond. This sense of recession is further enhanced by the contrast between the dark trees and foliage in the foreground and the bluish-white haze of the water and sky in the background. Thomson was familiar with Claude through the<i> Liber Veritatis</i> (<i>Book of Truth</i>), a collection of drawings Claude made after his own works, that became widely known through Richard Earlom\u2019s engravings published in 1777.\n\nThe painting is signed Paul Sandby in the left corner but was attributed to Reverend J. Thomson in 1931 by Basil Long. It may derive from Thomson\u2019s sketching trip to North Wales in 1828. \n\nThomson was a successful, Scottish landscapist who was also minister of Duddingston from 1805. He was influenced by the Old Masters, including Claude Lorrain, but also produced works of real originality. He was a close friend of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), who was another influence on his work, and collaborated with J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851) to produce illustrations, which were later engraved, for Scott\u2019s <i>Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland </i>(1826).",
