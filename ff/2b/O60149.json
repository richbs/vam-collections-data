            "public_access_description": "The Church of the Zitelle's longitudinal plan shows the double-domed structure of the church and its entrance surmounted by a bow-window and a pediment. Built between 1581 and 1588, perhaps after a design by Andrea Palladio (1508-80), the church had its orginal design modified during the construction by Giacomo Bozzetto (1521-83). The current church has a two-storey fa\u00e7ade decorated with large windows and surmounted by a hemispheric cupola. Corinthian columns support the first level of architecture. On the top left hand side, there is a staircase leading to the campanile. The main dome is surmounted by a free-standing statue supported by a circular domed structure. The longitudinal plan also shows the relief of the fa\u00e7ade. \n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
