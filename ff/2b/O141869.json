Jarman's cast of natural objects to create these works entice you to look more closely, investigating their surface, whether it be polished, hard, smooth or sharp. her work often incorporating multiple textural elements to create contrasts that both entice and repel the viewer.\nInfluences from her childhood, such as nature trails, television programmes, biology class, and as she grew older her research in Freud's theories of the \"uncanny\" permeate her glass sculptures. After establishing her vocabulary of form using colourless glass, including black, she began incorporating metal elements to her glass pieces, which can be seen here in Cyclops I.\nAngela Jarman is a key contemporary glass artist, producing sharp, confident, thought provoking works, I am sure we will see her experimentation lead to more interesting additions to her works in the future.",

Her interest in Freud's theory of the \"uncanny\" is also evident in her work.\nShe creates pieces that are beautiful, yet have a sense of unease, something quite strange and sinister.\nAngela uses mainly colourless glass in her sculptures, including black, which she sees as the ultimate absence of colour. She also incorporates metal elements into her sculptures, which highlight their petrified organic ness.",
