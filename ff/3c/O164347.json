At the lower edge of the quilt there are split sides for ease of fitting around the post ends of a bed. The design of the quilt is near-symmetrical, with the exception of one particularly early black and pink silk that has been used only in the proper right lower corner of the cover. This silk is thought to date from the 1670s. The maker has used 5 different colours of plain silk velvet (red, green, blue, black, gold) and 1 patterned velvet (deep red/orange and black). At the head of the quilt is a Coat of Arms in silver gilt thread on a blue velvet ground, showing a rampant lion. The maker has also used a wide variety of complex weave textiles, including a green and silver thread bizarre silk dominated by a silver ground, and a blue silk with brocaded pomegranates and flowers in silver and silver gilt thread, both thought to date from the 1690s. There are yellow, pink, blue and green taffetas, and pink and yellow tissues. A brown tissue has been used extensively on the right and left borders. There is also a late 17th century yellow silk which is possibly Chinese, and a silver gilt tissue with brocaded flowers which seems to be of Persian design. Wadded with wool and lined with a green and cream striped silk, and a cream silk satin. Most of the textiles date to before 1700.",

            "public_access_description": "In 'piecing' or 'patchwork', small pieces of fabric are sewn together to produce a decorative design. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, and the work is often embellished with appliqu\u00e9 and embroidery.\n\nQuilting is a method of stitching layers of material together. The layers are most commonly divided as follows:\n\nQuilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. \n\nWadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. \n\nReverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. \n\nHand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design. This bed cover has been quilted with a technique now known as 'stitch in the ditch': quilting along the seams of the patchwork to enhance the pieced design.\n\nAccording to the donor, this quilt was made for Bishop's Court, a medieval manor house in Devon once used by the Bishops of Exeter and later purchased by the Earl of Bedford. In 1651, the house was bought by Peter Beavis, son of a wealthy Exeter merchant. The rampant lion is thought to be from the Bedford arms, and its inclusion at the head of this quilt seems deliberately to affiliate the Beavis family with the former owners.",

In 1651 the house was bought by Peter Beavis, son of a wealthy Exeter merchant.\n\nThe bed cover would probably have been made professionally, and would have been an expensive commission. The arms at the head of the quilt suggest a strong connection to a family of high status, possibly the Bedfords. The arms would have been created by a heraldic embroiderer, and could have been made specifically for this quilt or recycled from another object. At this point it was not unusual for a family to declare their love for their king or a  patron through domestic objects such as this.",

They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.\n\nBeautifully worked bed hangings and bed covers were found in both middle-class and aristocratic households, and could often be more costly than the bed that they dressed. Some were purchased from professional centres of production such as Exeter.",
