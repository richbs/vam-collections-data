The front is longer than the back. It is fastened at chest level with two round silk braids (<i>munahimo</i>), parti-coloured in white and faded yellow. The large sleeves appear to be tailored from one and a half loom widths. There is a flat parti-coloured braid threaded through each sleeve at the cuff-end (<i>sodegukuri</i>). There are five applied knots (<i>kikutoji</i>) of round silk braid at the top of the jacket on the seams. The jacket is lined with plain weave thin cream silk.\n[Trousers] The trousers are wide and pleated and lined with the same cream silk as the jacket. The wadded waistband and ties are also of this silk. There is a pair of narrow round cream cords running along the base of the waistband back and front, and a wider flat braid threaded through at ankle level. The same applied knots as appear on the jacket are sewn one either side of the trousers at the base of the side slits.",
