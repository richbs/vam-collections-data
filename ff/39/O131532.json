            "public_access_description": "Many formal evening gowns in the 1960s used stiff, sculptural fabrics. This crisp satin  full-length evening dress was designed by Jacques Heim for Autumn 1967. The heavily beaded neckline is in the form of an inverted A, a subtle witty comment on the A-line silhouette of the dress. A long gown in plain fabric in the Museum's collection retailed at 42 guineas (see T.141-1998), but beading added further expense. This specific design, 'Fougere', retailed at 60 guineas.\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R.L.Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes went to high-end London boutiques. This design had a wholesale price of 36 guineas.",
