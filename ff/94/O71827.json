Needle lace, still then seen as a branch of embroidery, was made in professional workshops in London. But through the teaching of embroidery as a domestic skill with needle lace stitches in the repertoire, lace was also made at home, for the decoration of household linen, clothing and other objects. This piece may have been made to decorate a linen cover. \n\nThe most popular subjects for the needlework pictures and other types of object to which this lace is related, were scenes from the Old Testament of the Bible and classical mythology, as well as abundant plant and animal life. This piece includes motifs which the maker would have found in pattern books and which could have also been used for embroidery. Cupid, the pagan god of love, is firing his bow and arrow to ensnare a lady, who may be identified by her crown as a queen or princess.",
