Alfred Stevens designed what was called the 'Console Stove' consisting of a grate and chimneypiece, for Messrs Henry E.

From 1850 to 1857 he was chief designer to Hoole & Co., Sheffield, where he produced award-winning designs for metalwork, majolica, terracotta ornaments and chimney-pieces. \n\nPerhaps his two greatest works were the decorations for the dining-room at Dorchester House, London (about 1856), for which he made countless drawings inspired by the Italian High Renaissance style, in particular the work of Michelangelo and the monument to the Duke of Wellington for St Paul's Cathedral, London, which was completed after his death. \nThe two allegorical groups from this monument made a lasting impact on the New Sculpture movement.",
