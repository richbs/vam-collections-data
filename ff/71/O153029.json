The meander carries a densely packed arrangement of buds, leaves and flower heads including blue irises. The predominant colours are light and dark blue, green and red with yellow details. This pattern is also carried along the top and bottom. This wide border is edged on both sides with a narrow dark brown band with a pale yellow meander bearing isolated green leaves and red flower heads, the latter outlined in white. The composite border forms the frame for the central field which is itself delineated down the sides with pairs of narrow boteh shaped leaves in blue and red facing inwards, each containing a white, blue and green floral sprig.  In between each pair is a thin upright stem in black with red, green, blue and yellow details.  These botehs are linked at the base by a thin undulating line in red and yellow sometimes outlined in red or green or purple.  This zone of decoration appears to be very fine embroidery in wool.\nIn each corner of the central field there is a yellow and black flowering stem pointing inwards, bearing large and small blossoms, buds, sprigs and leaves in two shades of green, two shades of blue, red, purple and yellow. \nWarp: cream wool, S twist\nWeft: Dark blue, blue, dark green, green, red, purple, dark blown/black, yellow, cream wool; all S-twist.",
