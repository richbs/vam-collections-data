The instrument was made by Agust\u00edn Altimira (1805-1884) of Barcelona, who won a silver medal for one of his guitars at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. It is a fairly late example of  the smaller-bodied and lighter-toned guitar widely used in Spain until the 1870s, after which it was gradually replaced by the modern classical guitar, the invention of Antonio Torres (1817-1891) of Cadiz.",
