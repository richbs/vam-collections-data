The term toilet at that period referred to a lady's dressing table and its accessories. From the late 18th century onwards such mirrors were described as dressing glasses.  A. Hepplewhite & Co. illustrated several 'dressing glasses' in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide published in 1788, with later editions in 1789 and 1794 . This example, with a tall rectangular bevelled glass and a shaped top, and burr-walnut veneer, dates from about 1700. The drawer underneath the glass is divided into small compartments by shaped partitions.\n\nCurrently on loan to Valentines Mansion, Redbridge.",
