            "public_access_description": "Dennis Morris moved to Britain from Jamaica in the early 1960s and began taking photographs from the age of eight. His personal photographs of British Caribbean community life in Hackney came to form the series Growing Up Black. \n\nMorris became interested in photography through the church, after joining a photographic club that had been set up for the St. Marks Church choir he was part of. Some of his first photographs are of the choirboys dressed in their formal Eton suits, a style of clothing worn by pupils at Eton College in Windsor. The formality of this clothing and the church setting gives a sense of the English traditions Morris and his fellow choristers encountered growing up in London. Morris recalls the experience happily, \u2018this is where it all began for me. This is how we looked in our Eton suits. We were little devilish angels.\u2019\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Dennis Morris as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives.  The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
