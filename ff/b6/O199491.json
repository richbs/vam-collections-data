The painting was popularised through an engraving by Nicolas Ponce (1746-1831), which inspired European porcelain manufacturers to copy the scene. The same scene occurs on Chinese famille rose porcelain made for export to European markets.\n\nThe potter who made this bowl may have copied the design from a Chinese or a European original - porcelains from Europe and China were widely available in Iran, and in fact the V&A has two famille rose versions of \"The Cherry Pickers\" which were acquired in Iran. In his version of the scene, the potter has changed the cherries into much larger fruit, perhaps apples or pomegranates.",
