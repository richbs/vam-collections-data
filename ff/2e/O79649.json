The tang is made of silver-plated metal and is attached to a bar across an oval hole in the space between two of the trefoil motifs.  This oval hole is surrounded by four rings with granules, like the trefoils, and there is a plain trefoil, without granules, opposite the hole, where the point of the tang rests.",

A ring brooch is a very efficient kind of dress fastener, which was used universally in the late Roman period.  It differs from a modern brooch in the way it is attached.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  \n\nRing brooches survived into modern times as part of women\u2019s traditional costume in only a few places in the Mediterranean region, including Algeria and the tiny Greek island of Castellorizo, off the coast of Turkey.  This one was bought for two shillings at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery, when its name was recorded as \u2018dabaloos ansarie\u2019.\n\nThere are no published examples from Syria, but there seems no reason to doubt the origin of this one.  Its details are different from those worn elsewhere. The preference for new jewellery at weddings has ensured that few pieces of Syrian jewellery survive in use for more than a few generations.  It is only the V&A\u2019s early interest in traditional jewellery which has preserved this example.",
