Tea leaves were expensive, so were usually kept in lockable containers. Small tea caddies \u2013 boxes with one or two fixed inner compartments \u2013 were introduced as containers for tea leaves from about 1780 onwards.  The word 'caddy' is thought to derive from the Malay word for a measure of weight (kati) equivalent to about half a kilogram, but is now used as a general term for all tea containers. Prior to the introduction of the  tea caddy, early tea containers were referred to as canisters, kept in locked boxes known as tea chests. Tea caddies were often highly decorative because they were placed on the table as tea was served, where they would be seen by family and guests.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis one is decorated with fashionable Neo-classical designs.  The front has a  vase in delicate outline surrounded by narrow scrolls and swags. On the lid is a crudely-drawn flower motif surrounded by a wreath of berries and leaves.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe caddy is veneered in hardwood, inlaid with other wood to form the design.  The shading on the leaves and drapery has been drawn with a pen.  The lock-plate is ivory.",
