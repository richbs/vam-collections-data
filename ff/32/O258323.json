The only piece preserved is small, and any dissection is therefore impossible; the work done was based mainly on the photographs. We find that it can be woven... on four heddles.\nTHE WEAVE\nThe weave..., having a pattern in reverse, gives the appearance of a double weave, but this is an optical illusion. In a given portion, for instance, the front will be white and the back blue, but the back colour, the blue, is actually present in front, concealed. It is interesting that exactly the same procedure is used in Navaho weaving to produce the famous two-faced blankets, the weave of which, so long kept secret, has at last been discovered and described.' A glance at the diagram of Navaho two-faced weave will show the similarity to the Coptic two-faced weave. It is produced on the simple Indian vertical loom by means of three rod-heddles and a shed-rod. But though the weave is so similar the resulting textile is something quite unlike ours, Indian ingenuity being directed towards using the method to weave different patterns on the back and the front.
