The flat, circular base with sides gathered on a drawstring prevented spilling or revealing the contents.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis gaming purse is quite plain, with no embroidery, only a twist of copper gilt thread.  Its lack of decoration may have been deliberate, to deceive other players into thinking its owner had little money.  Copper gilt was a cheap substitute for the precious metal thread made of silver-gilt.\n\nSocial Class\nPlaying and betting on card games was a socially acceptable pastime for the wealthy in the late 17th century.  Along with dancing, riding and the theatre, it was an amusement for those classes that did not have to work.",
