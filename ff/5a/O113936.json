However, because of their elaborate lace and embroidery these aprons were never intended as protective accessories, but as a symbol of an accomplished and capable wife (and in the case of young girls, potential wife).  Because of their fragile fabrics and potential for recycling into smaller garments or accessories, few aprons have survived in museum collections.\n\nThis finely worked cutwork apron is probably unfinished.  It would have had an edging of needle or bobbin lace, and more embroidery in coloured silks may have been intended.",
