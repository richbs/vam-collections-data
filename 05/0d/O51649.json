The play was developed by Brook and a group of multi-national performers from his Centre for International Theatre Research in Paris, who took it on a tour of Africa, journeying from Algiers across the Sahara to Lagos in a convoy of landrovers and rehearsing and performing the play in the townships and villages of Nigeria and Mali between December 1972 and February 1973. This epic trek was documented in John Heilpern's book, Conference of the Birds: the story of Peter Brook in Africa (Faber, 1977). The company then toured to America in July 1973, playing in California, Colorado, Minnesota and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York. The Conference of the Birds was subsequently revived at the 1979 Avignon Festival in a newly adapted version scripted by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and then taken on a world tour.\n\nHistorical significance: A research drawing associated with a remarkable theatrical production by one of the 20th century's most innovative theatre directors",
