The cubes were made from bundles of blocks that were finely cut across the grain. A pincushion covers the top, so the box was probably used to store sewing accessories. It was made in Tunbridge Wells in Kent. This was a popular spa town and a centre for the production of souvenir wares, particularly ones that used this technique. Tunbridgeware items were also supplied to shops in other resorts such as Brighton. On the base of this box is the paper label of the manufacturer: 'T.BARTON, Late NYE, Manufacturer, MOUNT EPHRAIM, AND PARADE TUNBRIDGE WELLS'.",
