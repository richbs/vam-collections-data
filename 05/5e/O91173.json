It shows the right side of an adolescent (or young adult) human female skull. The out-bone of the right side of the maxilla and the corpus mandibulae have been removed to reveal the roots of the teeth and unerupted teeth.\n\nThe photograph may be of a skull kept in the Royal College of Surgeons in London, because the mode of preparation is typical of that college. The photograph was printed in black ink by the photogravure process, a high-quality reproductive technique introduced in 1879. This provides an arresting quality. The work has now become more a poetic symbol or image rather than a teaching aid for students of dentistry, thus transcending its original purpose.",
