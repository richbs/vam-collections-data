W., <u>Catalogue of Scandinavian and Baltic Silver</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1975, p. 250\n'Other beakers by the same maker similar to this fine and massive display piece are recorded by Neumann. The decoration introduces late Baroque and Rococo motifs into a type of ornamental composition whgich first appears in late sixteenth century German goldsmith's work. The Berainesque ornament may show Scandinavian influence. The thaler was designed by Johann Lorenz Holland, mint master at Dresden from 1698 to 1716. It is known as the Vicariats Thaler, and was issued to commemorate the appointment of King Frederick Augustus (better known as Augustus the Strong) as Imperial Vicar after the death of the Emperor Joseph I on 17 April 1711.'",
