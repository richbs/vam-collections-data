In the 1970s aspects such as humour, eroticism and symbolism were also present. \n\nThe 'Warrior' bracelet was described  in 2006, as follows: 'The woman whose head forms one terminal of the warrior bracelet has a stern, sad face. Perhaps she is an Amazon, perhaps a goddess of war.\" Jardine refuses to pin her down, but has written; \"In her hands she holds a drop of blood. Is it her own blood or sacrificial ? I don't know, but it is the continuous cycle of life and death, war and peace.'  Viewers must decide for themselves. \n\nThe 'Warrior' bracelet was acquired from her Degree Show at the Royal College of Art, London. She also studied at the Central School of Art and Design, London. After graduating, she returned to her home in Trinidad, becoming one of the island's first artist jewellers. \n\nJardine's jewellery is figurative and has a strong sculptural expression. She tends to use organic materials in combination with gold. Among the materials Jardine favours are ebony, recycled ivory, opals and moonstones, abalone and pearls. But the medium she has made completely hers is turtle-shell, used hundreds of years ago by West Indian craftsmen whose techniques are now lost, but which Jardine has reinvented.  She also draws on Art Nouveau jewellery as a major source of inspiration for her work.",
