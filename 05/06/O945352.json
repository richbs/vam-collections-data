The series was originally attributed to Nicolas Poussin but were catalogued in the section dedicated to the rejected attributions (\u2018dessins rejet\u00e9s\u2019) in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 (Rosenberg, 1994). P. Rosenberg suggests however that the drawing was made by a close follower in the style of Fran\u00e7ois Verdier (1651-1730).  \n\nThe present drawing shows two draped figures dancing together. They are joining their hands while the woman on the right hand side holds a cymbal in her right hand. This is a recurrent motif within the series (see D.309, 310, 312-1885), which probably comes from the same source. Moreover the scene is reminiscent of the Pompeian frescoes discovered in the early 17th century.\n\nA number of decorative projects and architectural designs have been influenced by Poussin, who favoured academic individual figures. In the 17th century, Poussin merged Classical with Baroque arts, focusing on the emotional mode within a clear and fluid composition. He sometimes sculpted or drew models from the Antique and worked on the purity of contour to transmit the idea of truth and morality. In this perspective, the drawing is reminiscent of such works as the <i>Martyrdom of Saint Erasmus</i> (Vatican Pinacoteca, Rome) and <i>The Triumph of Bacchus</i> (Kansas City) drawn from Greek low-reliefs.  \n\nIn his early career, many artists worked as studio assistants with Poussin, drawing academic cartoons to help him to achieve designs for commissions and therefore imitating the master\u2019s manner. His work influenced a major part of the 17th century artists.",
