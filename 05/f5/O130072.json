It was Sykes who had influenced the architect, Francis Fowke's choice of terracotta as the signature decorative material for the Museum. From 1861 he was engaged on the vast scheme of decoration for Fowke at the new South Kensington Museum (renamed the Victoria & Albert Museum). With a number of assistants, including James Gamble (1835\u20131911), Sykes designed for the museum terracotta columns, stained glass, bronze, ironwork, decorations in majolica and mosaic, and tile pavements made by Minton, Hollins & Co. However, Sykes was able to complete only a year's work at South Kensington before he himself died prematurely in 1866.\n\nThis design for the columns on the exterior of the west side of the Victoria and Albert Museum is articulated by a round-headed colonnade on the ground floor and an open-arcaded loggia on the upper floor. The columns for both are embellished with decorative terracotta to enhance the grandeur of the architecture. The Italian Renaissance revival in 19th century Britain brought with it a reinterest in terracotta decoration which Sykes championed.",
