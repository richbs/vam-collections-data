The taste for poking fun at women's driving skills evidently goes back much further than the invention of the motor car. The lettering on the print refers to the gig, whiskey and phaeton, which were all types of horse-drawn carriage.",

Hammersmith Turnpike, 1782 (BM S: 6155)\nLettered <i>TOM LONGTROT'S ACADEMY for YOUNG LADIES.

The Bowles family were a publishing dynasty first established in the City of London at the beginning of the eighteenth century, with various family members carrying on the business until the early nineteenth century.\nThis humorous print was aimed at a much wider audience than the metropolitan-based products of the West End caricature publishers of the same date.\nMezzotints are notoriously difficult to ink up and print successfully and they yield fewer impressions than etchings and engravings, so that hand-colouring was a useful way of extending the life of a plate, although that is not invariably the reason for the hand-colouring of a mezzotint.  A print of this kind was probably intended for close framing (the margins have been trimmed off in this case) in a black frame with a moulded gilt filet, as a substitute for a painted picture for use as decoration.\nThe colouring shows wear and tear on, for example, parts of the figure clutching the milestone where the blue pigment has been rubbed off.  The condition of the colouring is a pointer to its date.  Early hand-colouring will share the history of a battered or tatty print whereas modern colouring may lie on top of sign of old folds or repairs in the paper.\"",
