The name khulkhal is a generic Arabic name for anklets.\n\nThese, hollow and much lighter in weight, are similar to those worn on the Arabian peninsular. The tiny pellets inside them, which make a rattling sound as the wearer moves, were thought to have a protective function and to deter evil spirits.  They were bought for four shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.",
