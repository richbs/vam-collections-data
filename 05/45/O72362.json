Wulff, 'Neu erwerbungen Mittelalterlichen Byzantinisches Keramik' p. 179), where 15th century is suggested as a date.\"\nTheir jug was acquired in 1915 apparently in Constantinople. It is described as imitating an Islamic metalware shape with the exception of the spout. The applied slipware 'cords' resemble ropework wrapped around an object to facilitate carrying.\nThe jug is covered with white slip and a very dark brown glaze.
