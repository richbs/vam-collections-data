The seat is of\n machine-stitched canvas hanging down from a horizontal squared frame\n made from a steel rod, and has two holes for the baby's legs; attached\n by canvas straps to a smaller concentric steel frame above are a\n back-rest, and a front (pouched) tray in which toys or rusks could be\n put.  The apparatus is suspended by a spring clip from a series of\n long springs attached to a horizontal steel ring, which hangs from a\n swivel screw-hook connected to a large screw-eye with a spring clip; a\n length of steel chain has been added to this last spring clip, with\n another spring-clip at the other end (possibly for use as a safety\n chain).",
