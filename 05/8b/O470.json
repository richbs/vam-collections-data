Beakers of this shape were produced in different techniques and with different decorative details. This beaker is made of filigree glass in three colours. This involves picking up prefabricated opaque white and coloured canes onto a bubble of hot, colourless glass. This can then be further inflated and manipulated. Twisting the top and bottom of the bubble in opposite directions creates the spiral effect we can see on our glass. Fragments of this type of multi-coloured beaker have been excavated at the site of a 17th-century Amsterdam glasshouse, but they were probably also imported from Antwerp and Middelburg.",
