The design of the body of the cloth consists of diagonal rows of a parang design (the closest being the parang sawut) on a background design of husked grains of rice (gabah sinawur). At each end is a border similar to half the central kepala of a sarong with a panel with husked rice background on which foliate and flower motifs are shown. The kepala section consists of tumpal with background similar but smaller than the papan section with fern like stems on a blue background in the space between them. The tumpal protrudes into the diamond shapes, the first row of which are divided vertically into two, and the inside half, mostly obscured by the tumpal consist of lines following the outline of the diamond, and the outer half alternating between a husked rice grain background with floral foliage motif and a more controlled foliage motif on a blue background. The next row of diamonds alternate between two different kawung designs, one with smaller kawung elements with the lar type motif at the centre, and the other a bolder design centred on one unit. In the interstices of these diamonds at the edge of the cloth, the pattern reverts to the husked rice background and floral foliage design.",
