            "public_access_description": "The Dutch captured the British colony of Suriname during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1667). Under the West India Company it was developed as a plantation slave society and became a primary destination for the Dutch slave trade. The brutal regime caused high mortality; despite the import of 300,000 slaves between 1668 and 1823, the population never grew beyond 50,000. \u2018Maroonage\u2019 became the major form of resistance. Fugitive slaves, or \u2018maroons\u2019, escaped inland to form permanent communities from where they waged a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the Dutch.\n\nIn 1774 the Scottish-Dutch soldier John Gabriel Stedman witnessed the brutal oppression of slaves during a campaign against the maroons, which he described in his Narrative of a Five Years Expedition Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam. The book, which included illustrations by William Blake, was adopted by thosw who advocated the abolition of the slave trade, though Stedman was thought to support reform rather than abolition. This image reflects Stedman\u2019s ambivalence towards slavery by offering the reader the possibility of a slave family in a \u2018state of tranquil happiness, which they always enjoy under a humane and indulgent master\u2019.",

Stedman introduces his readers to a slave family in a \"state of tranquil happiness, which they always enjoy under a humane and indulgent master.\" Notice how productive, yet carefree, this family appears. The father carries a basket brimming with fish and one too large for his basket in his hand, while the mother carries fruit on her head, a baby on her back, toddler at her heels, pregnant with a third child, all the while knitting with her hands and smoking a pipe. This image portrayed by Stedman reflects a romantic and peaceful view of slavery that appears to defend the institution under these conditions. Stedman, John Gabriel.
