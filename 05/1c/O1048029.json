At this event, Lady Hawarden sold her work from a stall 'which was covered by a number of very artistic photographs executed by her ladyship' [The Times, 24 June 1864, 14] as part of the successful effort to raise funds to build a studio on the top floor of the Female School of Art building at 43 Queens Square, Bloomsbury. As well as selling her photographs Lady Hawarden offered, with the assistance of Charles Thurston Thompson (Official Photographer of the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington), to take photographic portraits for a guinea each in an outdoor studio at the fete. [See Female School of Art, Programme of the grand fete and bazaar ( \u2022\u2022\u2022 ), London 1864. National Art Library, V&A Museum.] The engraved scene which decorates the handbill advertising this seems intended to depict Lady Hawarden at work, as it shows a group resembling her husband and children gathered on a terrace not unlike that of 5 Princes Gardens. The face of the woman behind the camera is obscured. The device of a fairy with wand descending from the sun plays on the notion of the camera as the 'magic box' and is in keeping with the light-hearted goings-on at the fete. The engraving has been attributed to Thurston Thompson's father, John Thompson, the noted wood engraver. Lady Hawarden's success at taking portraits at the fete may be gauged by reports that she raised more than \u00a350 for the Female School of Art Building Fund. The only recorded purchasers of her work are Lewis Carroll, who bought five photographs (now in the Gernsheim Collection, University of Texas at Austin) [see Helmut Gernsheim, Lewis Carroll, Photographer, New York 1969]; and the Prince and Princess of Wales [The Times, 24 June 1864, 14]. However, the photographs they bought have not been located in the Royal collections at Windsor and Sandringham.
