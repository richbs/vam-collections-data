Artwork conjured up a female form of Marco Polo (the 13th century Venetian explorer and merchant) returning to Venice from China, gloriously resplendent in precious materials from the Orient.\n\nThe tabard is simply constructed from two lengths of knitting joined together leaving a hole for the head, gathered across the shoulders and caught at the sides underarm. The wide ribbing is smocked at random with metal studs. Underneath are worn a sweater and leggings in a 'seersucker' effect stitch, uneven bands of stocking stitch ruched into narrow bands of garter stitch. The shaggy stole is knitted in stocking and garter stitches from a knitted yarn and strips of woven fabrics, the knotted ends of which are left hanging in profusion from the surface.
