Carved with a representation of an Emperor, haloes, wearing the stemma although only the catatheistae are visible, a military tunic and a loros, holding an orb in his right hand, his left hand raised in a gesture of adventus and standing in a chariot drawn by six horses. Near the Emperor's right hand, above the heads of the group of three horses is a Chi-Rho monogram; on the Emperor's left a Victory raises a garland in her right hand. The group is placed on a ground line below which is a bowl containing largesse or fruit. \n\nThe crystal. slightly scratched and abraded, is carved in reverse intaglio, masked by a crystal segment at the back, the two bound by a gold collar chased and engraved with a guilloche pattern. The complex is suspended from a ribbed loop on a chain of finely plaited gold wire. The terminals and clasps are missing. Originally gold foil was probably placed between the two segments of crystal.",
