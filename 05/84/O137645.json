As one of the most important Italian designers of the 1980s and 1990s, Versace became famous for his flair and daring, strong colour sense and clean lines. After Gianni's death, his sister Donatella took over the house of Versace. \n\nThis suit was given to the Victoria and Museum by Sir Roy Strong. Author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to 1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Sir Roy was a high-profile figure known for his strong sense of personal style. Within a fairly conservative dress code of suit and tie, Sir Roy frequented designers known for sartorial exuberance such as Gianni Versace.\nVersace, a friend of Sir Roy\u2019s, designed this suit expressly for him.",
