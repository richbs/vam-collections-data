Of the nine half-figures bearing scourges and other instruments, two alone are well preserved - a helmeted figure on the right with a scourge, and a bearded figure above him holding a sword.\n\nIn Christian art the Flagellation, also called Christ at the Column, is a frequently shown scene from the Passion of Christ.\n\nThe boss is said to have been found near Pentney Priory, Norfolk.",
