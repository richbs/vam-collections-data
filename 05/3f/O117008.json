In medieval examples the posy is mostly engraved around the outside of the hoop but later examples find it on the inner surface. Rings with amatory inscriptions can be found from the fourteenth century and would have served as love gifts, betrothal and wedding rings. Documentary sources attest to their use in weddings, for example, in 1550 John Bowyer of Lincoln's Inn in London bought a ring for his bride inscribed DEUS NOS IUNXIT (God joins us together) along with their initials and date of marriage. Posy rings were also given to friends or used to mark significant occasions.",

The name is derived from the 'poesy' or motto usually engraved around the hoop. In medieval examples the posy is mostly engraved around the outside of the hoop but later examples find it on the inner surface. Rings with amatory inscriptions can be found from the fourteenth century and would have served as love gifts, bethrothal and wedding rings. Posy rings were also given to friends or used to mark significant occasions. \n\nPosies, also known as 'resons' or 'chansons' can also be found on personal items such as gloves, handkerchiefs or painted on trencher plates. They were chosen by the giver or could be taken from published compendiums or commonplace books such as the 1658 <i>\"The Mysteries of Love or the Arts of Wooing\"</i> or <i>\"Love's Garland or Posies for Rings, Hand-kerchers and Gloves and such pretty tokens that Lovers send their Loves\"</i> (1674). Goldsmiths would also have kept rings in stock inscribed with a range of posies.",
