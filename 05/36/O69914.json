The border is separated from the field by an undulating flowering garland. Beneath this, under in arches formed by the garland are little scenes, depicting European men and Eurasian women, in the costume of the early 18th century, disporting themselves in various ways. Two themes, repeated alternately are: 1) a small 'island' landscape with central flowering tree. Beneath it are on one side a pair of goats, and on the other a European plucking berries from another tree, which is balanced by a second small tree at the goat's end of the scene. 2) Another island with three trees of similar size and situation. On one side are two women, one accepting fruit from the basket of another woman, probably her attendant, while on the other side of the central tree they are serenaded by a European playing a stringed instrument with a small bow. The man and the woman are accompanied by small dogs. Below these scenes is a frieze in which two scenes of European life (repeating) alternate with two large repeating floral motifs, one a flowering plant in a vase, the other a large peony (?) surrounded by foliage, and with a triple stemmed flower and leaf arrangement growing from its top. The Europeans in the next row are 1) two men on horseback, one with a gun and the other with a spear, hunting a tiger; and 2) a man leading by the hand a woman who with her free hand is plucking a bloom from the large vase.",
