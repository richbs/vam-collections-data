(some col.)\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 179, 183-185\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\u201cThe drawing represents the wooden bridge and the cottage seen in the \u2018View on the Stour near Dedham\u2019 (Huntington Library Art Gallery, San Marino) (L. ed. S., Pl. 76).  Other views of the bridge and cottage described in this Catalogue are in the sketch-book No. 121 [317-1888], pp. 27, 29, and 53; the sketch-book No. 132 [1259-1888], p. 52; No. 298 [244-1888]; No. 324 [243-1888]; No. 346 [229-1888].\nHolmes, p. 252, links No. 297 [313-1888] with No. 380 [312-1888] of 1835.  However, the leaf comes from the sketch-book used in Suffolk in October 1827 and the drawing was no doubt made at that time.\n\nNote on Nos. 290-300 [834-1888, 624-1888, 802-1888, 269-1888, 837-1888, 838-1888, 241-1888, 313-1888, 244-1888, 274-1888, 242-1888]\n\nNos. 290-300 [see above] are all on leaves from the same sketch-book, measuring about 224x331 mm. (81x13 ins.) used in 1827. Nos. 290, 291, 292, 294 and 295 [834-1888, 624-1888, 802-1888, 837-1888, 838-1888] are inscribed for places in the neighbourhood of Flatford.  Nos. 297 and 298 [313-1888, 244-1888] are independently identifiable as scenes in that locality. The drawings were made on a visit of Constable's to Flatford Mill, which lasted nearly a fortnight; he took his two eldest children, John and Maria, and arrived probably on 2 October (<u>Beckett</u>, II, p. 439). \n\nTwo sheets from the same sketch-book are in the British Museum: \nL.B. 8. The Cottage in the Lane. 221 x 321 mm. (acquired in 1887). \nL.B. 15. Lock on the Stour, with Dedham Church in the distance. 222 x 327 mm. \nOn paper watermarked: J WHATMAN TURKEY MILLS 1824. (Gift of \nMiss Isabel Constable) \nThe National Gallery of Ireland has a sheet from the sketch-book:- \n2057. Flatford Lock, with Flatford Old Bridge and Bridge Cottage. Pencil. \n221 x 329 mm.  Inscribed by the artist<i>Flatford Octr. 5 1827.</i> \nAnother washed pencil drawing on a leaf from the sketch-book of 1827 is in the possession of Mrs. E. O. Beazley. It represents a large timbered house with a tiled roof, and on the left a haystack with haymaking in progress. It is inscribed by the artist<i> Flatford 13 Oct 1827</i> The sight measurement is 221 X 326mm. (about 8 \u00be x 12 7/8 ins.). At the back is the inscription <i>This sketch was presented to the late James Beazley by the widow or relative of Constable the artist, out of gratitude for a slight service rendered to her by him. J. H. Beazley.</i> (Since Mrs. Constable predeceased her husband the gift must have been made by another member of the artist's family.)\u201d",
