Ballerina Ad\u00e8le Dumil\u00e2tre appeared in the divertissement L'Aurore, during her debut season in London in 1843.  (A divertissement, literally a 'diversion', consists of solos or group dances with no plot.)    \nMany ballets in the mid-19th century centered on spirits of the air and stage machinery was used to make the ballerinas fly through the air, disappear or, as here, move them on clouds - anything to increase the illusion of lightness and flight.  Dancers had always worked to defy gravity in their jumps and spins, but now the new technique of dancing on the tips of the toes increased the sense of ethereality and otherworldliness. Dumil\u00e2tre wears what we now recognize as ballet shoes.  These developed from the heelless satin slippers, held by crossed ribbons, which were the height of fashion in the early 19th century.  Darned to give extra support, and then stiffened by various techniques and with a solid base across the toes, they developed into the modern pointe shoe.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
