From December 1914 onwards Concert Parties regularly travelled to France, performing at base hospitals. The actress and manager Lena Ashwell (1869-1957) organised entertainment for the troops on a national basis.\n\nThis programme with its hand-painted cover is for the Farewell Concert to the 'Lena Ashwell' Concert party, held on board HMS  Prince of Wales, and performed entirely by the sailors who comprised the Concert Party. This programme was clearly prized as a much-loved souvenir by the sailor who kept it and attached his cap tally to its cover. The programme provides a first-hand account of the type of entertainment that was popular at the time. The first half comprised songs and a four-scene sketch, and the second half numbers by the Pierrot Troupe The Scarlet Runners, whose performers also took part in the first half.\n\nThe HMS Prince of Wales on which this concert party took place was a Royal Naval battleship built in Chatham Dockyard and launched in 1902.  After active service in the Dardanelles campaign and Adriatic operations in 1915, HMS Prince of Wales became flagship of the squadron in March 1916. She ended her flagship duties in June 1916 when this performance took place and when she went to Gibraltar for a refit.",
