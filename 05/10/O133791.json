Worked as assistant to his father by the age of 15. Exhibited 34 works at the RA between 1843 and 1898, 18 at the BI 1844-67, and 25 at the SBA 1846-94. Early works mainly subjects from English history, and from literature, particularly Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites in the 1850s, in both technique and subject matter; painted several scenes of modem life, notably 'Omnibus Life in London' (1859, Tate Gallery). Later works are mostly 18th-century costume subjects. Designed one of the first Christmas cards, an etched greeting dated 1848. Friend of W P Frith, for whom he painted backgrounds on occasion. Died Chiswick, London, 20 February 1916. \n\nLIT: W M Egley <i>Catalogue of Pictures</i>. . .

A preliminary pencil sketch and a perspective diagram are also recorded. \n\nIn the French Gallery exhibition catalogue, lines from the play are appended to the title, in French, and given in Wall's translation in the artist's <i>Catalogue</i> as follows:\n \n<i>Argan</i>: (Threatening Toinette with his cane) Come here, come here, let me teach you how to speak.\n \n<i>Toinette</i>: (Running to other side of the chair) I interest myself in your affairs, as I ought to do, and I don't wish to see you commit any folly. \n\n<i>Argan</i>: Jade! \n\n<i>Toinette</i>: No, I will never consent to this marriage. \n\n<i>Argan</i>: Worthless hussy! \n\n<i>Toinette</i>: I won't have her marry your Thomas Diafoirus. \n\n<i>Argan</i>: Angelique, won't you stop that jade for me? \n\n<i>Angelique</i>: Ah! father, don't make yourself ill. \n\nThe lines are from act 1 scene 5 of Moli\u00e8re's play, first performed in 1673; Argan, the hypochondriac of the title, aims to marry his daughter Angelique to a doctor's son in order to save his medical bills. In this scene, the servant Toinette has a long argument with him about this until Angelique intervenes. \n\nPROV: Bought by H S Ashbee 1898, and bequeathed by him to the museum 1900\"",
