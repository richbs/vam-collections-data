The rattle is waisted beneath the cylinder, expanding into a cushion-shaped knot chased with flowers and foliage (matching those on the upper part) and hung with four ribbed bells.  Beneath this section the rattle is waisted into a narrow cylindrical section which is again chased with flowers and foliage and a truncated scallop shell to match the top, and hung with four ribbed bells suspended from silver gilt brackets.  The rattle is finished with a teething stick of polished natural coral, set in a scalloped socket .",
