Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \n\nLIT: <u>Art Journal</u> 1857, pp137-9; <u>Gentleman's Magazin</u> July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd </u>[1873]; P van der Merwe <u>The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield</u> Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and <u>The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield</u> Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \n\n\n<b>Shrimping</b> \n682-1893 \nMillboard, 31. 7 X 49.2 cm (12\u00bd X 19 3/8 ins) \nSigned and dated 'C Stanfield RA 1848' \nBequeathed by Miss E Anderson 1893 \n\nOne of a number of small oil paintings that may be compared to similar works by Bonington showing figures of shrimpers and inshore fishermen. \n\n\n\nRonald  Parkinson\"",
