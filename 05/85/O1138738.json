His performance on the rope had been going on for some time, when, says one account, the lights became exhausted and all was total darkness, and the whereabouts of the daring adventurer was entirely lost to the gaze of the anxious crowds below. This state of things continued for some considerable time, perhaps a quarter of an hour, and a chill seemed to fall upon the whole scene. It was now fully twenty minutes since Blondin started from the centre mast for the second time, and people began to look grave, and to ask themselves the question as to whether the \"poor fellow\" had met with some mishap. All eyes were bent on the south mast, when suddenly a blue light was kindled, and Blondin, amidst a tremendous clapping of hands and shouting of \"Bravo!\" appeared wheeling a barrow, discharging fire-works of the most magnificent description. etc'",
