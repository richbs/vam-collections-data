Manufacturers of handmade lace recognised that technical and stylistic excellence were needed to compete successfully against the threat of machine-made lace.\n\nThis border or flounce was made in Alen\u00e7on, one of the main centres for high quality hand made needle lace in France since the 17th century.",
