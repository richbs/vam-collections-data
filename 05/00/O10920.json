Wicker is used in the swinging bail handle to provide insulation against the heat. \n\nUse\nThe 'lamp' (burner) would be filled with spirit and lit to provide a small amount of heat to keep the contents of the kettle hot.  The kettle and lamp-stand are attached to a salver, which would have protected the surface on which the set stood. The set may have been placed on a small table drawn up to a larger table.\n\nOrnament\nThis set is a bold example of the exuberance of the early Rococo decorative style, which still displays elements of the sculptural movement of the Baroque period. The marine theme dominates both the sculptural and the chased decoration.  The stand is made up of three mermen, and the handle is formed of mermaids, while the spout is formed of a triton, blowing a conch horn. Each side of the kettle depicts the story of the sea deities Neptune and Amphitrite, the lamp-stand is decorated with marine creatures, and the engraved armorials on the salver are flanked by further depictions of marine gods and goddesses.",
