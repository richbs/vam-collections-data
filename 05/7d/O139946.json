The impresario Serge Diaghilev had spotted Massine in Russia in 1914 and brought him into his company, the Ballets Russes, as a  successor to Nijinsky. He developed into an outstanding dancer and one of the most important choreographers of the 20th century, devising ballets with character and style.\n\nPicasso drew this portrait in Rome where Jean Cocteau, the deviser of the ballet, persuaded Picasso and Satie to meet to work on the piece. Although Picasso intensely disliked travelling, he agreed to leave his Paris studio to go with Cocteau where they joined Diaghilev and Massine, and  Picasso showed them the preliminary models of his settings.  It was Picasso's first work for the stage, and the first time that a Cubist style had been proposed for dance costumes by a designer.",
