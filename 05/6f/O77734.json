The seal then denoted the legality of the document and the identification of the issuing authority or individual.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe practice of wearing a seal ring engraved with a heraldic crest became common in England in the 15th century.  At first the ring was only engraved with the crest (the top part of a complete coat of arms). However, after the mid-16th century it became usual for a gentleman to wear a 'seal of arms' like this ring, which has a complete shield. \n\nThe image of a gentleman wearing a signet ring appears in Sir Thomas North's translation of  Plutarch's  life of the ancient Persian king Artaxerxes II. The translation appeared in 1579. In it, North describes the Spartan officer  Clearchus drawing a 'seale of arms' from his finger, though he went on to say that the ring was engraved with a  classical subject not a coat of arms.\n\nPeople\nThere was a Christopher Baker at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, from1559 to 1564, but there is no known link between him and this ring.",
