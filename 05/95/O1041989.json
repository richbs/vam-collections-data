He records a pencil sketch, probably the original for this and other replicas, in the Fitzwilliam Museum, on two sketch-book pages, dated 13 August [1818].  Other water-colour replicas are in the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, and formerly with Mr. H. A. Sutch.  One of these replicas is recorded by Holmes, p. 244, when on exhibition at Messrs.
