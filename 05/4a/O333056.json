Woodfull and John Vale of the BIP Product Design Unit.  When asked by Woodfull to undertake the cup and saucer design for Ranton &amp; Co., he was able to advance the process further with the first of the two-colour bi-moulded cups.  Seeking to start afresh and avoid the convention of handle attached to side wall of a cup, his design solution was to fully integrate the handle and cup as one consolidated design. The handle, which sweeps up and outward from the rim, is higher than usual, providing good balance when the cup is lifted, and enabling the handle to accept the high pressure flow of the melamine during moulding, resulting in low stress and very good strength. The subtle detailing of the handle, made possible through precision toolmaking, is further enhanced by bringing the second colour that forms the cup interior out over the top of the handle.",
