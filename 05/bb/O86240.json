It was produced under the Ottoman dynasty, who sought to challenge the Italian domination of the international textile market.\n\nThe design is based on a pattern like those found on Italian velvets. However, the Turkish weavers have changed individual elements to give it a more 'Ottoman' look. The dominant floral motif shown here is a stylised, fan-like carnation that is one of the most typical of Ottoman textile patterns.",
