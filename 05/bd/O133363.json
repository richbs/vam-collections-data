Their philopsophy was providing innovative, high fashion at affordable prices.\n\nThis dress fabric featured the 'Chinese Girl' also known as the 'Green or Blue Lady', originally painted by the self taught Russian-born South African artist Vladimir Tretchikoff.  Tretchikoff became known as the 'King of Kitsch' for his super realistic paintings of figures, portraits, still life and animals.  Reproductions of his work were extremely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and were sold in lingerie departments of large stores.  This particular portrait became the highest selling print in history. However Tretchikoff was never taken seriously by critics, who considered his work commercial..  A Tretchikoff car-boot find inspired Red or Dead's 'Techechniko' prints and dresses, which formed part of the 1994 Autumn/Winter Collection.",
