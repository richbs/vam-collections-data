It is known in several variations which are believed to be from the workshop of Benedetto Buglioni. Benedetto was said by the famous painter and biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574) to have learned the art of enamelled terracotta from a woman who worked in Andrea della Robbia's house, but he was probably active initially in Andrea's workshop. He is also known to have been employed by other sculptors and his work shows influences from a range of painting and sculpture produced by Florentine artists at the time.\n\nSimilar reliefs are in the Museo Nazionale at Florence and elsewhere.\nThe small relief was probably made for private devotion in a household.",
