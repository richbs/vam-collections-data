Each consists of two stiff bands, of equal size, hinged together with tubes made of coiled wire, with a similar pin fastening opposite the hinge.  The pin is split in two so that it catches inside the loop of the fastening, and cannot be lost.  The band is made of open filigree, in a pattern of interlocking hearts, inside a border of beaded and twisted wires.  There is an open filigree rosette over the fastening, and half a rosette applied to the other end of each part, adjacent to the hinge.  Each rosette has a small piece of opaque turquoise glass set in its centre, and there is a similar piece of turquoise glass set in the centre of each part.",

They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nFlat hinged bracelets are one of the commonest types.  The quality of the filigree and the silver in this example are much better than in pieces made later, in the 20th century.  Bracelets were originally always worn in pairs, one on each arm, but most have now been split up, and it is rare to find an old pair complete, like this.",
