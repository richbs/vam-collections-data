It was redesigned, with arms, in 1941.\n\u2018Mathsson\u2019s chair structures are light and elastic, in a fashion now no longer unusual but which was something new and characteristic of him when this chair was first made.\u2019\n\u2018A chair can be made comfortable in two different ways: either it can be so large and so fully upholstered that it gives to the weight of the body, or it can be designed with such form and proportions that it requires little or no upholstery. Mathsson definitely works on the latter principle, and avoids upholstery completely.\u2019 Erik Zahle: Scandinavian Domestic Design London 1963\n\n\nDescription of Craftsman from Hollis, R. 1970.
