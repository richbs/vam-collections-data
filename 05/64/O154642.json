The curl of the crozier is decorated with seven crockets (although this print has been cut irregularly following the shape of the crozier and through three of the seven crockets). Four tiny male figures climb through the tracery on top. At the centre of the crozier are the crowned Madonna, seated on a throne between two angels playing a lute and an organ. The Madonna holds the naked Child who is standing and blessing. A blank shield rests on the bottom of the circle, ready to receive the bishop's coat of arms. The polygonal shaft of the crozier rises through an architectural section fitted with niches with small figures beneath Gothic arches with finials, showing St Margaret, a king with a sceptre and orb and St Barbara, standing on consoles.\n\nThe print has been cut in half at some stage and given A and B numbers (14001A and 14001B). The two halves have been stuck together.",

Jahrhundert</i>, 1925, 5, 105.\n\nThe making of prints (engravings) from engraved metal plates is believed to have derived from the decorative methods of goldsmiths. The gold-smithing origins of the early engravers show not only in their tight decorative technique but also in their subjects, which included almost from the beginning decorative foliage and representations of whole metal objects, presumably intended for use by their fellow goldsmiths. Martin Schongauer was the first German engraver who is known to have been more of a painter than a goldsmith. His father, however, was a goldsmith, and his prints of foliage and metalwork show a good understanding of that medium. The simple and direct treatment of this crozier (unlike his very complex later print of a censer) suggests its use as a goldsmith's model, as does the close clipping of the image, a characteristic of such engravings when found in surviving craftsmens' scrapbooks. Unfortunately no croziers to this design have been recorded, but the design of the stem was adapted for the decoration of a manuscript of 1490-91.\n\nThe revival of interest in early German prints had begun by the 18th century and by 1856, when the crozier design was bought by the Art Libary for the use of design students, such prints were also sufficiently valuable in their own right to be faked. The faker has cleverly avoided copying the signature which would have invited inspection, but his line-work differs in many ways from the original.'\nJane C.

In this regard it is useful to recall that painted and sculpted bishop-saints were much more numerous than real bishops and that each of them required an elegant crosier, often executed in gold leaf. Harmut Krohm (1994) has made the valid point that both the crosier and the censer were created by Schongauer as works of art in themselves, without reference to specific usage, and that they both were probably used as points of inspiration by other artists and craftsmen in just the same way as medieval model books had been used before the invention of engraving. ....'\n(The Illustrated Bartsch; 8 Commentary, Part 1; .105; page 264)",
