The textiles in the resulting 'Still Life' collection 'all share their reference in design and name to Nature' according to the designer and 'The palette is akin to the colours in many of my paintings, as are translucency and tone'.  There are six designs, each available in three different colourways, in the range, printed onto three different weights of cotton to add texture and dimension to the designs.",
