He was a mining engineer attached to the British Army in the Ruhr and the house, a scale model of a Bavarian house, was made by German POWs in the area.  It was a special `toy' for me and subsequently by daughter.\nI would like very much to donate the house to your Museum in memory of my daughter, Joanne, who died six years ago at the age of 18....\n\n*Letter from Jane Else's brother (not named or dated)\nDOLLS HOUSE.\nIt was made in Germany in about 1947.  Our father Robert Moncur was in Germany at that time with the North German Coal Control, which was administering the production of coal in the R\u00fchr following the end of the 1939-45 war.  If I remember correctly, he was stationed at Essen.  There would be considerable unemployment and distress among the German population, and hearing that he had a young daughter, two craftsmen offered to build a doll's house.  Perhaps they went to so much trouble in order to create a thing of beauty amid so much ugliness and unhappiness.  I have no idea of the cost, but I seem to remember hearing that the price was paid at least partly in cigarettes!\nI have never looked for any signatures or names on it, but there might be some perhaps under the base?",
