Here's The Sex Pistols\u2019 got its first release in France, via Barclay Records. To help counteract the French import it was decided to bring forward the UK release by one week, to October 28th, 1977. The band insisted that a 12th track was now added to the album, Submission. 50,000 copies of the album had already been pressed without Submission, so a one-sided 7\u201d single was inserted with the track, along with a fold-out poster of this original artwork. The album was then immediately repressed with Submission added to the tracklisting.\n\nThe artwork is lettered with the album title and the titles of its 12 tracks: No Feelings, Bodies, New York, Liar!, Problems, EMI, Anarchy in the UK, God Save The Queen, Holidays in the Sun, 17, Submission and Pretty Vacant. Jamie Reid designed promotional material for the Sex Pistols as well as being involved with the running of the band. Instead of featuring photographs of the group, he assembled extracts of text, suggestive of a ransom note, to convey the feeling of crime and anarchy that underlay the group's appeal.",
