            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. \nThis inro is part of a unique set of 12 calendar inro by Shibata Zeshin, each representing a different month of the year. All 12 inro are of a different shape and size, while the decoration is carried out in different lacquer techniques. \nZeshin usually referred to a particular month by depicting some aspect of a popular or religious festival that took place at that time. This inro representing the fifth month depicts the Boys\u2019 Festival (tango no sekku). In order to instill boys with notions of military honour, courage and bravery, toy arms and armour were arranged indoors, while carp and streamers were hung outside. Zeshin\u2019s inro for the fifth month accordingly depicts a toy sword and arrows.\n From the 1700s onwards, many artists signed the inro they made. This example is by Shibata Zeshin (1807-91), one of the most talented and renowned lacquer artists of the 19th century. He was head of a successful workshop with an enprmous output.",
