They are one of 11 sheets of designs by Pugin of internal decoration and furniture for Oswald Croft, Bishop Eton, near Liverpool in the V&A's collections. Pugin's designs were to be executed by J.C. Crace of the Crace firm for the owner Henry Sharples in 1847.\n\nPugin seems to have liked this design because he referred to it in 1850 when ordering material for a tester and bed for the Grange, Ramsgate: 'I should be perfectly satisfied if this stuff was green with yellow roses - like what you sent to Mr. Sharples'. Moreover Crace exhibited this design in cotton damask with yellow roses on a deep pink ground in the Medieval Court at the Great Exhibition and then presented a piece to the Museum of Manufacturers, the fore-runner of the V&A. This survives in the Museum's Textile Department. He had also exhibited the design in silk at the Birmingham Exposition of Arts and Manufacturers in 1849, when it was illustrated in the Journal of Design.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
