Operating switches and charge indicator are located on the topside of the lantern.  On the pr side is a winding handle which pulls out.  The handle when turned winds up a carbon spring inside the lantern and powers the light for 3-4 minutes or contributes to recharging the battery.  A blue Freeplay logo is visible on the handle.  There are two sockets at the rear for plugging in a mains adapter which will also recharge the battery.  The lens twists anti-clockwise and conceals a bulb, spare bulb, flasher switch and rechargable battery.\n[Packaging] Printed blue cardboard box packaging with carrying handle on the topside.  Images of the lantern appear on both longsides, demonstrating its main features.  Benefits and use are highlighted with small cartoon images on one shortside.  Features are listed in five languages on the opposite shortside.  Moulded polystyrene packaging and operating instructions leaflet are contained within the box.",

Designed as a simple, practical, ecologically sound household tool.\n\nHistorical significance: The lantern complements the two Baygen Freeplay radios in the Museum's collection.  They have been acquired as examples of innovative contemporary product design which harnesses technology in response to ecological and social needs.  In order to make the products self-powering, wind-up technology from clockwork has been exploited, and obviates the need for a permanent electricity supply.  A rechargable battery cuts down consumption of conventional batteries which are harmful to the environment when disposed of.",

The technology has important ecological and social implications for the manufacturing and use of electrical appliances.  Initially, these were manufactured by Baygen (a conflation of 'Baylis' and 'generator') who made Freeplay products.  Subsequently the design, development and production of items such as this lantern, have been brought together under the name of Freeplay.  The first radio was initially conceived for use in the developing world, to provide a source of power for communications in remote areas.  The second radio was marketed to consumers in the developed world who are aware of the ecological effects of disposing of batteries.  The self-powered lantern was also designed for Western consumers as an economic and ecologically friendly domestic tool.",
