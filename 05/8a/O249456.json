The Corporation of Birmingham desired to buy the park and hall but the price of \u00a3 40,000 was too large for their means. Local working men and their employers, with other wealthy assistance raised the necessary money for the purchase. The park was used for a playground and the hall for exhibition purposes.\n\nJoseph Moore (1817-1901) was a British engraver and medallist who  already at ten years of age convinced his parents to let him earn his own living and entered the office of a then well-known silversmith.",

Local working men and their employers, with other wealthy assistance raised the necessary money for the purchase. The park was used for a playground and the hall for exhibition purposes.",
