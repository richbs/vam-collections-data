Illustrated p. 85, text p.201.\nText reads: Ozzie Docrat was born in his grandfather's house on Delarey Street, in 1928. He grew up in his parents' house, on 20th Street, with four brothers and two sisters. It was in that house in 1950 that he prepared this room for his bride. He had the walls decorated with a wavy plaster finish and he had this bedroom suite made to order. In time he inherited the house from his mother. Then in 1977, having been 'disqualified' under the Group Areas Act from living in his house, he cut six inches from the width of each of these beds, so that they would fit into his new bedroom, in the house he did not want to build in Lenasia, the group area some 40 kilometres to the south-west of the city to which most of  Johannesburg's Indians were consigned.\nThe Docrats' house in Pageview was demolished in 1977. Unaccountably a ruined fragment survived the bulldozers: the Docrats' upstairs lavatory on concrete columns among the new houses built for Whites by the Department of Community Development. Docrat told me,'I haven't been back to Pageview, but I passed in a bus. More or less I kept my eyes closed and I cursed. I saw my lavatory and I thought, \"Shit. That's all they've left us is shit.\"' It stands, monumentally, to this day.",
