An etching is made by transferring ink held in grooves on a flat copper plate onto a sheet of paper. The grooves are made by the action of acid eating into ('etching') the surface of the copper plate.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe subject depicted is a masquerade taking place at Ranelagh Gardens (located in a part of London, called Chelsea). A masquerade was a sort of fancy dress party where guests also disguised their identities with masks for part or all of the evening. In the background is Ranelagh's most famous feature: the round building called the Rotunda. This was designed by William Jones, architect of the East India Company, and built in 1741.\n\nPeople\nThe woman in the centre foreground, standing between a friar and the clown Pantaloon, is Elizabeth Chudleigh. In 1749, she caused a sensation by appearing at a masquerade at Ranelagh, dressed as the sacrificial victim Iphigenia, in an outfit with a see-through top. Elizabeth Montagu, who had gone as Queen Henrietta Maria, remarked, 'Miss Chudleigh's dress, or rather undress, was remarkable; she was Iphigenia for the sacrifice, but so naked the high priest might easily inspect the entrails of the victim.'",
