Many people believed that the supernatural powers embodied in an amulet could promote fertility and good health and offer protection against malign forces or the 'evil eye'.  Although the Catholic Church was opposed to the pagan nature of many amulets, it was powerless to prevent their use.\n\nIn southern Germany and Austria, amulets like these were worn by both men and women, often mixed with Catholic religious pendants.  The women usually wore them hanging from the long chain which laced their bodice, and men wore them on their watch chain.  \n\nThese amulets were described as bodice pendants, typical of those worn by peasants in Bavaria, when they were acquired in 1872.  They were bought for ten shillings and one penny at the International Exhibition in London.",
