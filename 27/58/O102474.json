From the apprent age of Robinson, this bust likely dates from about 1864-5. \n\nIn 1853 Robinson was appointed the first Keeper of the Museum of Ornamental Art at Marlborough House, a predecessor of the South Kensington, later Victoria and Albert Museum. Robinson was a friend of Marochetti from the late 1850s and they were also founding members of the Collector's or Fine Arts Club.\n\nBaron Carlo Marochetti (1805-1867) was born in Turin. He initially studied in Paris, where he was resident, intermittently returning to Italy between 1822 and 1827. Following the 1848 Revolution, Marochetti settled in England, where he produced a number of public monuments and became a favourite of Royalty, producing the effigies of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert for Frogmore, Windsor.",
