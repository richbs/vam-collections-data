It consists of various coloured cups which are knocked from their seating by a spinning top and a suspended striker.  There are 5 red cups, four blue cups, 2 yellow cups and one black cup.\n\nTO COMMENCE PLAY\nPlace the coloured cups on top of their towers.  One player is elected to act as banker and winds the top, setting it spinning with a strong pull.\nPlayers slect their colours on the stake chart which is printed on the inside of the lid.\nOne player now holds the rubber striker clear from the arch, the banker places the spinning top in the recess in the middle of the board and the striker is released on to the top.\nThe spinning top knocks the striker outwards and it commences to dislodge the cups from their towers.\nGenerally the last surviving colour is considered to be the winner, but there are various other methods which will suggest themselves.  When playing on the colours the numerals are ignored.\nVarious odds have been worked out and these are printed on the inside of the lid so that it can be used as a stake chart.\n\nFOR CHILDREN\nIt is usual to ignore the colours and use the numerals.  Each child spins the top in turn and then withdraws the striker as soon as SIX cups have been knocked off.  The total scores of the remaining cups are then added together and this is written down as that player's score.  When each has had a turn the winner is the player with the highest score.\nAs in the adult game many other methods of finding the winner can be thought of, thus adding more variety and fun.\n\nASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS.\nDo not take the game out of the box.  Erect the `arch' by fixing it into the two sockets provided.  Now check the length of string on which the rubber striker is suspended.  The striker should be approximately \u00bcin above the playing surface.  Fix all the metal towers into the holes around the edge of the board.  The `rings' on top of the towers should face the centre.  The colours can be situated in any position.\nThe spindle of the top should be oiled occasionally.",
