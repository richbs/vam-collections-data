The buffet was not functional but was designed as a piece of decorative furniture, with a May Day theme, echoing the painted panels showing the months, which decorated the walls of the Dining Room. In 1868 Henry Stacy Marks, an artist, offered his watercolour of a 16th-century May Day procession for use in decorating the interiors of the Museum, and Henry Cole, the Director, chose it as the design for the three porcelain panels on the buffet. These were painted by a female student in the porcelain class of the South Kensington Art School, now the Royal College of Art, and incorporated into the buffet, made by Gillow & Co., a prominent firm of cabinet-makers..",

Black of the South Kensington Art School and these panels incorporated into a buffet in Renaissance Revival style, designed by F.W, Moody and made by Gillow & Co. The buffet was intended for the window bay facing the door from the Green Dining Room into the gallery.\n\nBefore installation in the Green Dining Room the cabinet was displayed in the International Exhibition held in London in 1871. It was placed in Room VII, West Gallery, on the left of the door, looking north, and is illustrated there in <u>Scheme of Annual International Exhibitions of Selected Works of Fine Art (including Music) Industrial Art and Recent Scientific Inventions and Discoveries To be Held under the Direction of Her Majesty's Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851</u>, London n.d, Photograph V.",
