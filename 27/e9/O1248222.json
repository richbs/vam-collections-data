Each player aims to be the first to move their play-piece around the board to the refrigerator. However, each coloured space requires them to press an alarm clock button next to the 'Daddy' figure lying in bed. When the alarm goes off, 'Daddy' sits up and his night cap shoots off! There is no reading involved in the game, and the simple rules and short game play make it suitable for a young audience. \n\n'Don't Wake Daddy' was designed by George Robinson of Hackney, East London. George explains how the idea came from his five year old daughter trying to wake him up. When he pulled the bed sheet over his head and sat up shouting 'Don't Wake Dad!' she 'jumped out of her skin and then burst into fits of giggles'. After pitching the idea to a major manufacturer, the game was licensed and marketed internationally. It has been in constant production for twenty years and is regularly cited as a classic of the 1990s.",
