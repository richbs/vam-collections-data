As a young man Thomas Landseer attended the school run by the artist Benjamin Robert Haydon, which was set up in opposition to the Royal Academy schools. Study of anatomy was a crucially important aspect of Haydon's curriculum, and his students made drawings from dissections and attended classes in anatomy run by the famous surgeon Sir Charles Bell. Human corpses were difficult to obtain at this time, so animal subjects were often dissected instead. A related drawing in the V&A is inscribed 'Bell's', evidence that Landseer made it during one of the anatomy demonstrations given at Bell's premises in Soho, London. This is one of a group of three drawings of an \u00e9corch\u00e9 (skinned) dog in the V&A by Thomas Landseer which he made as a young student.",
