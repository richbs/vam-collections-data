The name comes from maserle, the French for 'maple tree'. Maple is a hard wood that does not split or shrink easily, and was used for drinking wines that would otherwise have been contaminated by gold, silver or pewter. The lid is decorated with pseudo-Arabic script, probably based on the designs found on imported Turkish textiles. The insides of both the lid and the base of the bowl are inscribed with sayings in French and Latin about drinking - about appreciating your host and taking on the strength of Sampson slaying the lion after a cupfull! The grotesque head at the bottom of the bowl is no doubt a playful addition intended to give the drinker a surprise when he had almost finished.",
