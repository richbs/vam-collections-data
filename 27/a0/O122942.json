This painting is a late eighteenth or early nineteenth century copy of an oil sketch for a ceiling by Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640)  now in the Liechtenstein collection.Rubens was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and diplomat. He was a versatile and influential Baroque artist employed by the rulers of the southern Netherlands as their ambassador and became painter to the courts of Europe. Rubens blended features of the Italian High Renaissance, with which he became acquainted during an extended visit to Italy, with northern realism and a love of landscape.  In his oil sketch, Rubens rendered the Roman writer Apuleius' tale of Psyche Taken Up into Olympus. Enchanted by Psyche's beauty, mortals forgot to pay homage to Venus. Venus sent her son Cupid to exact revenge, but Psyche immediately fell in love with him. After many travails Cupid eventually weds her and persuades Jupiter to allow Psyche to live in Olympus. The Olympian gods are rendered in foreshortened perspective from below. The Liechtenstein sketch was probably painted around 1621 in connection with the ceiling decoration of the Great Hall of the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London, although the final work differs considerably. Although CAI. 94 faithfully reproduces Rubens' composition, the handling is less vigourous and the figures animated. As the original Rubens sketch was acquired Prince Johann Adam Andreas I von Liechtenstein before 1712, the artist of CAI.94 must have seen it in his collection.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 249-253, cat. no. 312.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nSir Peter Paul RUBENS (1577-1640) \nFlemish (Antwerp) School \nBorn in Siegen, Westphalia, of an Antwerp family, Rubens moved to Antwerp in 1587 where, after leaving school, he became a pupil of Adam van Noort and Otto van Veen. From 1600-08 he lived in Italy, entering the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, on whose behalf he visited Spain in 1603. He returned to Antwerp in 1608 and was appointed painter to the Brussels Court of the Archduke Albert in the following year. He was commissioned by Marie de M\u00e9dicis to execute a series of paintings for the Luxembourg and accordingly visited Paris in 1622 and 1625. His activities as a diplomat took him to Spain in 1628 and to London in 1629-30, when he was knighted by Charles I. Having returned to Antwerp in 1630, he carried out the paintings for the ceiling of the Whitehall Banqueting House in the succeeding year. He died in 1640, renowned as a courtier and diplomat as well as a painter. \n\nAfter Peter Paul RUBENS \n\n312\nMERCURY CONDUCTING PSYCHE TO OLYMPUS\n(Apuleius, <i>Metamorphoses</i>, VI) \nPanel, circular \n22 3/8 X 21 (57 X 53) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.94 \n\nJupiter is seated in the centre with Juno; on the right Psyche is being carried upwards by Mercury towards Cupid, who is at the feet of Venus. \nThis is a late 18th or 19th century copy of a sketch for a ceiling by Rubens in the Liechtenstein collection, Vaduz (A. Rosenberg, <i>Rubens</i>, K d. K, 1906, pl. 366; L. van Puyvelde, <i>Sketches of Rubens</i>, 1947, no. 53, repr., dated c. 1625; G. Martin in <i>Burl. Mag.</i>, cviii, 1966, p. 613 f., fig. 25). This sketch is related to the composition of the Apotheosis of the Duke of Buckingham painted for the Whitehall Banqueting Hall in c. 1627 (sketch in N. G., no. 187, painting formerly in Earl of Jersey collection, see Martin, <i>op, cit. </i>, figs. 21-2) and Martin suggests that it may be an allegory describing the events leading up to the marriage of Charles I and showing Buckingham, as Mercury, bringing Henrietta Maria, as Psyche, to Charles, as Cupid, who kneels before James, as Jupiter. \n\nProv., Constantine Alexander Ionides; bequeathed to the Museum in 1900. \nLit.

            "history_note": "Purchased by C. A. Ionides before November 1881; mentioned as a painting by Rubens in his inventory, and valued at \u00a3150 (his inventory, private collection). Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\nThe collection formed by Constantine Ionides includes works of a wide variety of schools, periods and artists. His collection includes Old Masters, 17th century works, contemporary British works and French 19th century works. Constantine formed friendships with artists of the day, especially Legros, who, having spent 17 years in Britain, became a naturalise British citizen. Constantine proved a stable and generous buyer of Legros work, while Legros, in turn, became an advisor in the matters of art to the attentive Constantine. Under the influence of Legros Constantine developed a keen interest in French 19th century paintings purchasing works by Delacroix, Degas, Millet and Rousseau.\n\nConstantine\u2019s plans concerning his collection conformed to a more \u2018public-welfare\u2019 vein of thought than his father or brother. He decided to donate his collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum, instead of privately distributing it or disposing of it in a Sales room.\n\nHis will states:\n\n'All my pictures both in oil and water colors and crayon or colored chalks (but subject as to my family portraits to the interest herein before given to my said Wife) and all my etchings drawings and engravings to the South Kensington Museum for the benefit of the nation to be kept there as one separate collection to be called \"The Constantine Alexander Ionides Collection\" and not distributed over the Museum or lent for exhibition. And I desire that the said Etchings Drawings and Engravings shall be framed and glazed by and at the expense of the authorities of the Museum so that Students there can easily see them.'\n\nThe collection bequeathed to the museum in 1901 comprises 1138 pictures, drawing and prints, to which a further 20 items were added on the death of his widow in 1920. The works are listed in the V&A catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection.\n\nHistorical significance: Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and diplomat. He was a versatile and influential Baroque artist employed by the rulers of the southern Netherlands as their ambassador and became painter to the courts of Europe. Rubens blended features of the Italian High Renaissance, with which he became acquainted during an extended visit to Italy, with northern realism and a love of landscape.  CAI.94 appears to be a late 18th or early 19th century circular copy after Rubens' original circular oil sketch composition (on a rectangular panel), dated ca. 1621, for a ceiling decoration, now in the Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna (Oil on panel 63 x 48cm).  In this <i>bozzetto</i>, Rubens rendered the Roman writer Apuleius' tale of Psyche Taken Up into Olympus. Enchanted by Psyche's beauty, mortals forgot to pay homage to Venus. Venus sent her son Cupid to exact revenge, but Psyche immediately fell in love with him. After many travails Cupid eventually weds her and persuades Jupiter to allow Psyche to live in Olympus. The Olympian gods are rendered in foreshortened perspective from below. Mercury, the messenger of the gods, bears Psyche aloft to Jupiter's throne. There Cupid awaits them both with longing. At left, the Three Graces proffer cupid a crown of flowers. Below, Hymen, the genius of bridal couples, flies into the picture carrying a torch. The Liechtenstein sketch was probably painted around 1621 in connection with the ceiling decoration of the Great Hall of the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London, although the final work differs considerably. Although CAI. 94 faithfully reproduces Rubens' composition, the handling is less vigourous and the figures animated. As the original Rubens sketch was acquired Prince Johann Adam Andreas I von Liechtenstein before 1712, the artist of CAI.94 must have seen it in his collection.",

Although, history painting began in the Netherlands in the late 15th and early 16th centuries with such artists as Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516), Jan Mostaert (ca. 1475-1555) and Lucas van Leyden (1494-1533), it had long been overshadowed by the genre painting. Netherlandish artists\u2019 new interest in naturalism transformed distant history into contemporary scenes of everyday life, situating classical and biblical scenes in Netherlandish settings with figures in contemporary costume and sometimes even including historicised portraits.",
