            "public_access_description": "Christopher Wool is a painter who combines the gestural manner of Jackson Pollock with the mechanical and reproductive approach of  Andy Warhol. His works are ambiguous and confuse process and facility: marks which appear to be hand-painted may be printed and elements which appear to be mechanically produced appear, on closer examination, to be hand-painted.\n\nIn this print (and its companions, My House II, and My House III, E.1567-2001 and E.1568-2001) Wool chose to remake one of his own text paintings from the early 1980s, but at several removes. The original was photographed, xeroxed and then re-separated to become the basis of a screenprint. In the paintings of Christopher Wool, word becomes image: fragments of film dialogue or rap lyrics are represented in the admonitory style of signage and advertising as part of a critique of the repetitive patterns and limited perceptions that pop culture tends to reinforce. This process of reiteration is embedded in the making of the prints, layering and blurring the statement \u2018if you don\u2019t like it you can get the fuck out of my house\u2019 which visually reverberates, calling up echoes of the often fractious debate about the nature, purpose and continuing validity of painting. \n\nThis print was published by Counter Editions in 2000 in a portfolio of 14 works by contemporary artists.",
