            "historical_context_note": "Originally acquired as an anonymous English work, the identification of the painting remains unclear. P. Thornton published it as a French bedchamber datable c. 1690. The date is based on the tall backs of the chairs and the form of the feet. The floor is decorated in the new French fashion with parquet set diagonally within squares called parquet de Versailles. The bed appears characteristic of French shape with simple lines and the seat-furniture and table-carpet are en suite with the bed-hangings, all of red velvet with gold fringes. Through the door are shown a series of rooms en enfilade which was typical of French architecture but was later imitated in English country-houses and manors. \n\nThe difficulty in identifying this painting lies in the fact that the type of furniture, although from French origins, was widespread in Europe as well as the use of hanging tapestries on the wall during the cold season to insulate the room from draughts. \n\nThe knocked-over seat and the fact that the bed curtains are tantalisingly slightly ajar imply that some love affair is happening. Moreover the figure leaning against the door frame puts a finger on his lips hinting at secrecy, while the little dog, a traditional symbol of fidelity, is carrying away one of his mistress\u2019 slippers. The tapestry\u2019s corner peeling back above the door adds confusion to the scene, in both literal and figurative ways.",
