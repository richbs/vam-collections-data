Stonaford Toys created the whole series of characters from the poem during the 1930s and issued the poem with its advertising material, invoices and sales slips. The toys are characterized by the carved flat shapes of the body, limbs and head, the large metal painted eyes and the method of attaching all the parts to each other by very small brass screws. The method of attachment allows the parts to individual move and the figure may be posed. The cow represented is white and brown with the plain wood lightish in colour painted with patches of brown. The toy consists of two shaped body parts, four legs, tail and neck all held together with small screws. The body parts are held apart by the tail and the neck and these are separately attached by small screws allowing them to move up and down. Likewise the legs move independently.  The head which is flat backed is mounted on a block which in turn is on a bar set into the top end of the neck. The bar allows the head to move both up and down and to each side. The head is carved with the horns and ears but the eyes are formed from two metal domes painted white with black circles set towards the top half. The nose is indicated by two small black dots near the base of the head.",
