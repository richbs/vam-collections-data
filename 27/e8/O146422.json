            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nThe fascination with gold never ceases. Rejected when the avant-garde was experimenting with alternative materials, gold returned to favour in the 1990s. Innovative concepts in treating gold were developed as never before. \n\nSpeckner is possibly best known for her narrative jewellery in which she incorporates photography. She is a keen photographer and collects 19th century photographs, these are then processed and re-shaped. She adds silver and gold parts, or even gemstones to create a jewel. She refers back to opulent Baroque ornaments. The fragmentary state of this ornament refers to non-retrievable memory.\n\nIn a statement Speckner expresses: 'I never work with the intention to decorate things or make them look prettier, I try to discover the soul of an object or the essence of a photograph and want to shape something new which appeals to me and to the people far beyond the optical appearance\". \n\nBettina Speckner studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Munich, for two years, until she became fascinated with goldsmithing and changed to the jewellery classes under Profs.
