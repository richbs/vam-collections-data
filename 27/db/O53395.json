Jacqmar is written in black in the bottom right. \n\nHead squares were worn widely during and after the Second World War, and a number of creative manufacturers commissioned fine artists as well as textile designers to come up with innovative designs. During war-time shortages, these scarves were often made in a mixture of natural and man-made fibres \u2013 silk and rayon or pure rayon. In the immediate post-war years, Jacqmar advertised its products as being dominated by pure silk, in high fashion magazines such as Vogue in the UK and abroad.\n\nJacqmar was a London-based textile manufacturer who developed a fashion house after the Second World War. The company was listed in commercial directories from 1936 to 1972, firstly as Jacqmar Fabrics (1936) and subsequently as Jacqmar Ltd Fabrics (1942). This branch of the company gained a reputation for quality printed head squares from 1941 and through the 1950s, and was noted for its patriotic scarves illustrating aspects of wartime Britain.",
