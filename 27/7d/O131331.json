He lived and worked there until 1930 but also in London (1899-1905), Paris, Rotterdam and The Hague where he died. He was an autodidact but in contact with Willem Maris (1844-1910) and a member of the Pulchri Studio. Besides being a painter, he worked also as an art dealer. His works are preserved in the Zuiderzee Museum and the Museum Boijmans-van Beuningen.\n\nThis painting is a good example of Moll's seascapes, a genre in which he specialised along with landscape paintings. Moll was particularly interested with harbours' life that he extensively represented in his oeuvre. The present painting shows a crowded harbour with vivid tones that radiate under a bright sunlight.",

Typical characteristics of Moll's work include broken brushwork and the use of pure colours. Moll's work is difficult to date, as his style changed little. \n\nThe great tradition of the Golden Age constituted a real burden for Dutch painters in the 19th century. Many continued to paint in the style of the masters of the 17th century, but a more direct approach to nature emerged. The arrival of the Barbizon school gave new life to a tradition that had been stagnating. Hendrik Mesdag (1831-1915), Anton Mauve (1838-1888), Jozef Isra\u00ebls (1824-1911) and Jacob Maris (1837-1899) were the nucleus of the Hague School, founded in the 1870s. Their subdued colour and sketchy technique puzzled contemporary art critics who then nicknamed this new movement as the 'grey school'. 19th-century Dutch paintings wee popular with British collectors, including James Staats Forbes (1823-1904), Alexander Young and Sir John Charles Frederic Sigismund Day (1826-1908).",
