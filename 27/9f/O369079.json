They have been carved with highly intricate strapwork design in double relief. The panels radiate out from an octagonal panel. These panels are framed by an ivory and ebony border. This border has been carved with a simple floriated design. A secondary star motif design is also evident in the inlay. This secondary star design is based around small ivory and dark wood plaques which punctuate the central octagonal panel design. Small inscription panels frame the main body of inlay.",

It is likely that the plaques were once part of a minbar which was located in the Mosque of Amir Qawsun in Cairo (built in 1329).

            "history_note": "This panel was probably made in Cairo, Egypt. It is a composite object created from 14th century minbar (pulpit) panels placed in a modern (19th century) frame. The minbar panels date from the 14th century- the intricacy of the carved strapwork is very much in keeping with Egyptian Bahri Mamluk inlay (1250- 1382).  The central octagonal shaped plaque is an unusual feature in Mamluk minbar inlay. Some historians have attributed the octagonal panels to a minbar which once stood in the Mosque of Amir Qawsun in Cairo (built in 1329 and destroyed during the nineteenth century). The evidence for this is a drawing by the French art historian \u00c9mile Prisse d\u2019Avennes (1807 -1879) who drew the minbar inlay in situ in Cairo. This drawing can be found in his survey of Islamic Art titled L\u2019Art Arabe d\u2019apr\u00e8s les monuments du Kaire which was published in 1877. The inscription on this panel refers to Sultan al-Nasir Hassan who ruled Egypt twice between 1347-51 and 1354-61. It is possible that the inscription originates from the same minbar as the other inlay elements, however it may originate from another minbar entirely. \n\nThis object was owned by Count Charles Gaston Esmangard de Bournonville de Saint Maurice (1831-1905). The Count lived in Cairo between 1868 and 1883 where he worked as the Grand Equerry for the Khedive. He was a major collector of Islamic Art in Cairo and it is likely that he would have commissioned or purchased this panel. It is also possible that the Count owned the minbar plaques and commissioned the contemporary framing. The Count collected many Islamic objects from the city of Cairo which he used to furnish his home in Cairo. The Count\u2019s home in Cairo was designed by the French architects Ambroise Baudry and built in 1872 in the Neo-Mamluk style. The Neo-Mamluk style was formed from Mamluk architectural motifs such as brown and white striped facades, monumental entranceways and reclaimed mashrabiya windows (turned wood projecting windows). Gaston Saint Maurice\u2019s home was a key example of this style and was located on the newly developed Qasr El- Nil in the modern city centre of Ismailiya the area of Cairo located opposite Gezira island on the east bank of the Nile. The panel would have been used to furnish the interior of the house.\n\nIn 1878 the Count ran into financial difficulties and put both his Cairo home and its contents up for sale. This panel formed part of what would be later known as the Saint Maurice collection \u2013 which was comprised of Middle Eastern objects such as bronze and ivory doors, Persian and Egyptian tiles, mashrabiya windows, wooden inscriptions, clothes and jewellery and a collection of plaster casts. This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. After being placed on display at the 1878 Exposition Universelle, the collection of 200 objects was then lent to the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, from where the South Kensington Museum (V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. The Musee des Arts Decoratifs also purchased nineteen inlaid panels. Together with the Meymar collection (accessioned in 1867), the Saint Maurice collection expanded the collection of \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art \u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517) \u2013 in this museum.",
