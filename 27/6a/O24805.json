His lower garment is  with a girdle at the waist and pleated at the centre. Besides a scarf is tied to the garment above the thighs.  There is a five-hooded snake canopy behind the head of the deity signifying his association with the primordial snake Sesa or Ananta.  He wears various ornaments, such as a crown (kirita), necklaces, bangles, armlets, a sacred thread (upavita) and a long garland of flowers (vanamala) like that of Vasudeva-Krsna or Visnu.  In his two front hands he holds a sankha (right) and a cakra (left).  This as an earlier stage of the sculptural development, that is why his back hands are still lowered down and shown holding a psetle (musala) and a ploughshare (hala), no doubt showing his connection with agriculture. The pitha (pedestal) is plain rectangle with two vertical columns over which is placed  a cross-bar.  Behind his head is given a halo(sirascakra) with a design of flame and having a jewel (mani) at the apex.on the cross-bar comprises of a five-hooded snake canopy encircled by a thick border of flame tips with a mani (jewel) at the apex.  Below at the right corner of the pedestal a tiny figure is shown, perhaps the donor of the image, holding a garland.",
