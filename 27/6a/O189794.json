These 'uncomplicated' sheets are the results of several distinct stages of production. initial <i>Rotring</i> pen 'roughs' on plain paper are submitted for approval before the colouring can begin. Gently-blended hues are introduced into an enlargement of the chosen drawing by way of a silk-screen process involving repeated manual application of selected semi-opaque inks through a limited number of stencils. From a group of these uniquely coloured prints, just one is chosen as the 'camera-ready' art-work. When the image is prepared for offset litho printing, the 'solidity' of colour is maintained by the omission of the lined-screen which, if used would break up the image into tiny regular dots.'",
