English goods, including furniture, were shipped in large quantities to Portugal, especially to Oporto, the centre of the Port wine trade. English cabinet-makers established themselves both in Oporto and Lisbon, and the influence of their styles was strongly felt. Jos\u00e9 Francisco de Paiva (1744-1824), Oporto's leading cabinet-maker, left a collection of 130 sheets of drawings dating from about 1780, now in the Museum of Ancient Art in Lisbon. these include furniture designs that show strong English influences, ranging from Rococo to Neo-Classical. This chair and its pair (W.17-1967) are remarkably similar to one of them.",
