The body has short straight sides with a domed cover and base, it has plain burnished surfaces. The central candle socket on the cover is of Medici form, matt gilded and chased with rosettes and anchors suspended from a bay wreath. The foot is chased with a diagonal motif aaround the rim. It appears to have a mark 'J' on the underside. The pendant finial is modelled as a stylized pine cone and there is a calyx applied to the base of the body of stylised foliage. The sections of the body of the chandelier are assembled on a steel rod. \nBranches modelled as swans with arched necks and outstretched wings gripping the drip pans in their beaks. The drip pans are chased with foliage and each has a pendant berry finial. The candle sockets are vase shaped and chased with repeating diagonal ornament. There is an additional modern section added to each socket to contain the electrical fittings, it is of flaring form and has a similar diangonal chased motif around the sides.\nThe chandelier is suspended by chains of two different designs, hung from a corona in the form of a dish with a central pendant. \nIt has been adapted and restored when converted to electricity in the twentieth century.",
