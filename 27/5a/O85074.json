Founded by Nicholas Sprimont, an extremely gifted goldsmith, modeller and designer from Li\u00e8ge, Chelsea aimed at the top end of the British market, and gained aristocratic and ambassadorial support in its attempts to rival imports from the royal factories of Meissen and S\u00e8vres. Meissen had been the first to make trompe-l'oeil dining wares in vegetable or animal shapes, but it was left to Chelsea (and some of the French tin-glazed earthenware factories) to further explore the idea.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nStrengthened by the acquisition in 1901 of the ceramics collection assembled in the 1850s for the Museum of Practical Geology, the Ceramics Department continued to benefit from individual bequests made with an awareness of the Museum's work on English porcelain factories. This charming tureen was probably the piece offered at the 1755 sale of Chelsea porcelain, where it was described as \"A most beautiful tureen in the shape of a HEN AND CHICKENS, BIG AS THE LIFE in a curious dish adorn'd with sunflowers.\" Although apparently based on a print by the English artist Francis Barlow, the basic idea derives from the naturalistically modelled tablewares made during the 1740s at the great Meissen porcelain factory (founded 1710) near Dresden. The Meissen type is here translated into the English soft-paste material in which the sharpness of detailing characteristic of Meissen is muted, an effect much appreciated by connoisseurs of early English porcelain.\n\nLit.
