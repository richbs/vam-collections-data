One day Imam Reza appeared before a hunter and asked him to allow the mother gazelle, who he was about to kill to return to feed her fawn. Imam Reza promised the hunter that if he did, the gazelle would return a couple of days later and submit to her fate. The hunter did as he was asked and when she did indeed return he refrained from killing her in reverence to Imam Reza.\n\nAs a direct descendent of the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Reza is an important figure for Shi'ite Muslims. In particular Iranian Shi'ites because Imam Reza is buried in Mashad in Iran. His shrine forms part of the biggest mosque complex in the world. Posters celebrating the life of Imam Reza are very popular and displayed in the home, workplace and religious buildings.",
