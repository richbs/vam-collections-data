The presence of the witches in the play was used as an excuse for introducing many special effects. Instead of only three witches appearing at the beginning of the play, a chorus of singing, dancing hags was flown in on ropes and given extra scenes. Catherine 'Kitty' Clive began acting in 1728 aged around 17. She was described as the best 'romp' and 'a mixture of combustibles, passionate, cross and vulgar' but a good actress, particularly in comedy. She was known to be a forthright woman who spoke her mind and Garrick was said to be frightened of her. She was a London celebrity and an argument between her and Susannah Cibber in 1736 over who should play the part of Polly in The Beggar's Opera was reported at length in the press. It seems unlikely that the glamorous Kitty would have played a witch, so the song may have been a party piece of hers.",
