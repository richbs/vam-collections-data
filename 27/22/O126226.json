His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMozart\u2019s comic opera The Abduction from the Seraglio was one of four Mozart operas performed  at Glyndebourne in 1956 to celebrate the bi-centenary of his birth.  Messel\u2019s exuberant designs are inspired by 18th-century Western European art and design and its fascination for the Orient, in harmony with the light-hearted spirit of Mozart\u2019s opera.\n\nMessel borrowed motifs from engravings of Turkish buildings and Oriental style pavilions depicted in English tapestries and Meissen porcelain for the architecture of Selim\u2019s palace and garden.   He used painted acetate to create an effect of intricate lattice work. The platform features a palm tree, paraosl and cushions, indicating the exotic location and air of indolent luxury in the palace garden on the Turkish coast.",
