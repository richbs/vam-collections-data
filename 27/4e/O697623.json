On white wove paper watermarked 1806, full-bound in blue leather, gold tooled, lettered on the spine <i>Designs for Plate etc. by John Flaxman.</i> With the book-plate of John Roland Abbey. Bound by William Wood. English, c.1810-20.\n<i>Pen and ink and wash, with some pencil.</i>     E.70-124-1964 \n\n<i>Note:</i> The goldsmiths who made these pieces of plate for the firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, such as Paul Storr and Philip Rundell, worked from drawings commissioned from a number of artists, but in most cases direct evidence on who originated the design is lacking. For the reasons given below there is evidence that the following designs may be firmly associated with these specific artists: \n \nThomas Stothard     E.110,111-1964\nJohn Flaxman     E.l19-1964 \n\nOn grounds of style E.109-1964 may also be attributed to Stothard.\nOther designers who worked for the firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell\nat the time and whose drawings may be included in the volume are\nWilliam Theed I and Edward Hodges Baily, R.A. \n\nAmong the items of interest are: \n \nDesign, partly sketched in pencil, for a candelabrum with a motif of three female figures dancing, holding hands, on a pedestal with two piping boys. A complete pen and wash drawing by Thomas Stothard for the same candelabrum with a differently designed triangular base, showing young satyrs piping, is in the Department of Prints and Drawings, Dyce Collection, no.882.     E.111-1964\"",
