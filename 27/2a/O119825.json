Strephon is Iolanthe's son, an Arcadian shepherd, who falls in love with Phyllis, and both entered in Act 1 playing on flageolets and wearing these costumes.\n\nSince the D'Oyly Carte was an extremely successful company in the 1920s, new costumes and scenery for their productions were well-publicised    When Norman Wilkinson redesigned the costumes after the dress of 18th century Chelsea porcelain figurines, The Sketch of 13 February 1924 illustrated their front page with an image of Sydney Granville and Winifred Lawson as a piece of china and the headline 'From Dresden to Chelsea: the Re-dressed Phyllis and Strephon in Iolanthe'.  This image may well have been the inspiration for this piece, which was made by Ethel Sleigh and Phyllis Simpson, two potters who worked in the 1920s and 1930s with a group who called themselves the Potters' Guild.  The group included Bernard Leach, and Charles Vyse who had a studio in Chelsea. This was a unique figurine, never reproduced commercially.",
