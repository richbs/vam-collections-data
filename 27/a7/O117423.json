This bust by the English sculptor Edward Onslow Ford portrays him in the title role of Vanderdecken, a poetic drama by Percy Fitzgerald about the phantom sea captain Phillip Vanderdecken, the Flying Dutchman, which Irving staged at the Lyceum in 1878.\n\nIrving was born in Cornwall and spent fifteen years acting in repertory from 1856 until 1871, when he made his name at the Lyceum Theatre in The Bells. In his years in repertory he played over six hundred different roles and for the next 31 years he starred at the Lyceum, holding audiences spellbound, and setting new standards of production and performance that made him a legend.\n\n Edward Onslow Ford (1852-1902) trained abroad but set up a studio in London as a portrait sculptor in marble and terracotta.  He became a Royal Academician in 1885 and sculpted Irving several times, as well as Queen Victoria and many other leading personalities of the day.",
