Opera companies face particular problems as opera is popularly perceived as elitist, only attended by the wealthy in compulsory evening dress. It is not generally viewed as an entertainment for the under 40s. Opera companies have tried to woo young people through eye-catching poster campaigns. In the 1990s English National Opera advertised its productions with black and white images of photogenic members of staff. Opera North's 2007 poster focuses on the audience, represented by a casually dressed young man who is completely absorbed in the on-stage action, and aims to convey both the excitement of performance and suggest that opera is not the preserve of the overdressed and the over privileged.",
