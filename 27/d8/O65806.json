            "public_access_description": "This is one of many panels in the Victoria & Albert Museum's collection of stained glass from the Abbey of Steinfeld in Germany. It was originally in the sixteenth window in the abbey cloister.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Steinfeld was closed down in 1802 but prior to that in 1785 the stained glass windows of the cloister had been taken down. It is believed that they were purchased, probably at the time of the closure in 1802, by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Steinfeld panels to various churches and to private collections. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow, who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nThe scheme of cloister glazing at the Praemonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld was commissioned by its abbot, Johann von Ahrweiler (1517-1538).\n\nWe know the layout of the windows of the cloister glazing at Steinfeld from an illustrated manuscript that was made in 1632 and was housed at Trier. \nAnother manuscript showing the arrangement of the windows is in the state archives in Dusseldorf. This dates from 1719.\n\nThis panel was located in the bottom of the 16th window in Steinfeld Cloister. The V&A has another panel from this window (Museum no. C.285-1928) depicting 'Christ at the House of Simon', although the imagery is confused because of later replacements in the panel.\n \nThe kneeling figure is Peter Blankenheim, priest of Dunwald, shown here with St George, his patron saint. Peter Blankenheim was one of the donors of the glazing scheme at Steinfeld. Donors were sometimes depicted in the windows they helped pay for. St George, seen here in armour with the dragon, was a popular patron saint.\n\n By the end of the Middle Ages, the cult of St George had spread widely from its original centres in the eastern lands of the old Roman Empire. George was most likely martyred during the persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian in 302/3. Evidence suggests that the Emperor Constantine himself promoted the cult of St George in the period 320-340 once he had assumed control over the eastern part of the Roman empire. \n\nIt seems that George's status as a 'warrior of the church' was greatly promoted in the West by the fighting classes in medieval society. Certainly, the Crusaders returning from the Holy Land spread awareness of the saint and the sites associated with his cult, and he quickly became the protective saint of many areas in Western Europe.\n\nGerhard Remisch (or 'Remsich') was a glass painter and head of a prolific stained glass workshop in the Rhineland.",

Cook.\n\nThe glazing programme of the cloister at the Premonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld, in the Eifel region between Cologne and Trier, was executed between about 1522 and 1557. The work was carried out consecutively, window by window, starting at the north-west and running around the cloister, taking in twenty-seven windows in all. With a few exceptions, these were three-light windows with tracery lights above. The three-panelled main lights were invariably divided into two parts, with narrative scenes occupying the middle and upper panels, and donor figures mostly filling the \u2018socle\u2019 zone below. The master glazier responsible for the windows up to about 1537-8 appears to be Gerhard Remisch (or Remsich), whose monogram appears in window no. 13, made in 1534 (see C.211-1928).

The woman who came in to attend to Christ was described as a 'sinner'. Tradition ascribes the sin of adultery to her. The message related here is one of forgiveness of sins - the greater the sin, the greater the repentance.\n\nAlthough the details are confused, the other gospel writers record another story that has many similarities to the one by Luke but has a very different message to tell. In these, Christ and his disciples are in Bethany at Simon the Leper's house or at the house of Lazarus, brother of Martha and Mary Magdalene. In this story, Mary Magdalene washes and annoints Christ's feet with costly ointments. The disciples (especially Judas) object as the money could have been better spent on the poor. Christ informs them that 'the poor will always be with you but I shall not'.\n\nResearch since\n(1913) Schmitz refers to a MS in the city library of Trier (Treves)\n\tdescribes the windows in the Steinfeld cloisters\n\tcopy in C&G\n(1929) Reinartz says the Ashridge glass is not all from Steinfeld (as M.R. James thought) after discussions with the abbot at Mariawald\n\tthinks that Steinfeld and Mariawald glass was all painted by Gerard Remisch\n(1929) Sydney Harrison, Bowes Museum recognised that two Ashridge panels closely corresponded to a painting from an altarpiece at Bowes by the \u2018Master of St. Severin\u2019, of Cologne\n-\tRaising of Lazarus (just shows Christ), Mariawald\n-\tRaising of Lazarus (shows Lazarus), Mariawald\nRackham: altarpiece and glass from same drawing and probably painted by same person\n(1944) Rackham: \n1) Reinartz didn\u2019t recognise that the Ashridge windows come from more than one other souce and have no relation to the two series, from Steinfeld and Mariawald.\n2) Remisch didn\u2019t paint all of the Steinfeld and Mariawald windows\n-\tconfusion over mongrams\n1)\tChrist and his Disciples Crossing the Brook at Cedron, Window XIII, Steinfeld cloisters \u2013 monogram of Gerhard Remsich\n2)\tJacob and Esau (kept by anonymous buyer at this time) \u2013 monogram of someone else\n3)\tMany of the windows painted by Remsich bear dates, ranging from 1527 to 1542. From the style of the architecture, they are Renaissance. [Seems to be saying that Remsich only worked at Steinfeld.]\n4)\tDeduce that Mariawald panels also came from a cloister setting because their size and design are like that of Steinfeld which we know to have come from the cloisters (Trier MS).\n5)\tThe Ashridge Mariawald panels fall into two series \u2013 early and late depending on the style of the architectural surrounds\n-\t(earlier, 1510-20) flanking columns with Gothic capitals and bases; slender shafts decorated either with lozenge pattern or with spiral or boken fluting; sometimes have cusped Gothic spandrels\n-\t(later, 1520-30) show fully developed Renaissance ornament\n6)\tSubjects:\n-\t(Mariawald) Old and New Testaments \n\u2013\tcome from the Biblia Pauperum\nmostly copied from the woodcuts in the blockbook printed by Albrecht Pfister, Bamberg, in 1462/1463\nnot copied in order, the Gothic style panels are copies from later in the story woodcuts\n-\t(Steinfeld) Story of man\u2019s Redemption \u2013 incidents in the Life and Passion of Christ\n\n7)\tMariawald panels (windows of two lights each)\n1)\tearly ones, in order\nElijah and the Widow\u2019s Son (BP)\nThe Raising of Lazarus (St.Severin)- two panels, occupying two lights\nThe Transfiguration (BP)/ The Triumph of David (BP)\nElisha and the Sons of the Prophets (BP) (James thought it was an incident in the life of St. Norbert)\n2)\tlater ones\nGideon and the Fleece (BP)\nThe Nativity\nMoses and the Burning Bush\nsimilar to a woodcut in the Netherlandish edition of the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, printed about 1475-9\nThe Circumcision of Isaac\nThe Presentation in the Temple\nThe Repose on the Way to Egypt (subject not found in BP)\nThe Worship of the Golden Calf\nThe Massacre of the Sons of Ahaziah by order of Queen Athalia\nThe Massacre of the Innocents\n\tsome elements of copied from engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi, after Raphael\nChrist with his Parents on the way to the Passover\nThe Cleansing of Naaman / The Baptism\n\tcoupling of these two events derives from Speculum rather than from Biblia\nThe Temptation in the Wilderness\nJoab murdered by Amasa\nHeinrich von Binsfeld, Abbot of the Imperial Abbey of Cornelimunster (near Aachen) (1491-1532) and his patron St. Cornelius (two separate panels, occupying 2 lights of one window)\t\n\n8)\tSteinfeld panels (windows mostly of 3 lights each)\nMassacre of the Innocents, dated 1528\n\tthe central pair are also after the Marcantonio Raimondi engraving\n9)\tOther Ashridge panels\nLord Mayor\u2019s Chapel, Bristol (Steinfeld)\nMarston Bigot Church, Somerset \u2013 The Return of Jacob to his Country (Mariawald)\n\n\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Steinfeld was closed down in 1802 but prior to that in 1785 the stained glass windows of the cloister had been taken down. It is believed that they were purchased, probably at the time of the closure in 1802, by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Steinfeld panels to various churches and to private collections. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow, who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nAbbot Johann von Ahrweiler (1517-1538) commissioned windows for the cloiser of the Praemonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld in the Eifel.\n\nWe know the layout of the windows of the cloister glazing at Steinfeld from an illustrated manuscript that was made in 1632 and was housed at Trier. \nAnother manuscript showing the arrangement of the windows is in the state archives in Dusseldorf. This dates from 1719.\n\nThe majority of the windows appear to be from the workshop of the glass painter Gerhard Remisch.",
