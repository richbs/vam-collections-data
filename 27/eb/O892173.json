The text is as follows: <i>copies after</i> ZUCCARO, TADDEO 432 A faun playing upon a pipe to three seated men Inscribed in ink in an old hand 'Polidoro da Caravaggio' Pen and ink and wash, heightened with white, on brown or possibly faded blue paper 9 \u00bd x 14 1/8 (242 x 358) PROVENANCE J. Richardson, Jr (Lugt 2170); R. Cosway (Lugt 628); Dalton Bequest 1900 The drawing has many holes and tears and is much faded. It was formerly ascribed to Polidoro on the strength of the old inscription. But as Gere has observed, the style is reminiscent of Taddeo Zuccaro, though the quality is not good enough for him. The drawing may be a copy of one of his facade paintings.",
