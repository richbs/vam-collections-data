On the upper sheet are pencil sketches of caryatids probably intended as alternatives to features shown in the design. On the back of the lower sheet is a pencil sketch of an urn.",

The carved over mantel contains a circular oil-painting of a reclining lion, instead of the bust which was later inserted. On two sheets joined. The upper sheet, containing the drawing of the over mantel and picture, is the work of Kent, but the lower sheet, containing the fire-place, is by John Vardy. On the upper sheet are pencil sketches of caryatids probably intended as alternatives to features shown in the design. On the back of the lower sheet is a pencil sketch of an urn.\n\nKent visited Rome in 1715 where he met Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who became his patron. Boyle encouraged Kent\u2019s interest in architecture when they returned to London together and Kent soon started receiving commissions for buildings and furniture in the classical style. His most famous buildings include Holkham Hall, Norfolk, and the Horse Guards, Whitehall.",
