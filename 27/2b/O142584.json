They can be worn by both men and women, but the extreme bagginess of this pair suggests they were made for a man. They are decorated using a type of embroidery called couching: a thick gold thread is laid on the surface of the fabric in a scrolling pattern, and held in place using small stitches.\n\nThese trousers were owned by the journalist, travel writer and imaginative historian Lesley Blanch (1904-2007), who called herself \"a romantic traveller\". She is shown wearing them in a portrait painted by the French writer Louise de Vilmorin in 1945.",
