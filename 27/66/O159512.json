            "historical_context_note": "At the time this bottle was acquired, it was attributed to Perugia or to Mantua. The attribution to Perugia was broadly based on the heavily carved away decoration which in the 19th and early 20th centuries was attributed to Umbrian wares. The attribution to Mantua was based on a similar drug pot in a Florentine private collection which was stated to have borne the arms of Gonzaga of Mantua.\nSubsequently a dish in the Museo Provinciale, Catanzaro was discovered with similar decoration and was incribed on the back: Sqllci 1654. Rackham then attributed this bottle to Squillace in Calabria.\nTwo bottles, in Rovereto, of the same form and type of decoration but with a much different top and subject matter was recorded by Donatone (see References, 1983)  assigned to Squillace and dated to the middle of the 17th century. Donatone dates the V&A bottle to 'after the middle of the 17th century'. Other bottles with the same shape as the V&A one (in Naples and in Sevres) but with tops like the Rovereto ones are also attributed to Squillace. The Catanzaro dish has apparently disappeared and so this attribution cannot be confirmed.\nThere is a bottle in the British Museum (see References) which has been grouped in with this 'Squillace Ware' in the past but it is very different in form, in decoration and in colour to the V&A bottle, Rovereto ones, Naples and Sevres ones. The attribution to Squillace has been questioned and the BM bottle is now described as 'Origin uncertain'. Alternatively, it was suggested that the BM bottle be attributed to the work of Antonio Maria Cuzio of Pavia (see V&A pieces attributed to him). This attribution would be more likely for the BM bottle than for the V&A bottle. The V&A bottle, as well as the Naples, Sevres and Rovereto ones share a common shape and a lighter, pale amber glaze. The Pavian pieces have a much darker brown amber glaze.\n\nThe V&A bottle is attributed as 'possibly Squillace' based on the Catanzaro dish (although this can no longer be confirmed) and the fact that it differs in decorative style and colour with the pieces attributed to Cuzio of Pavia.",
