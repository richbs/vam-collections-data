The sculptor has used linear perspective to suggest the depth of a room, but the figures are placed in front of the space rather than within it.",

The present relief may be among this group, so could be dated somewhere between 1460-75.  \n\nThe relief shows the Virgin and Child in a room with a recessed coffered ceiling.  Despite this use of perspective, the figures seem somewhat divorced from the space behind them: rather than appearing to be within the room, they seem to be floating in front of it.  This effect is further complicated by the way that the Child's foot rests on the lower edge of the composition.  This device may have been employed to suggest that the figures are occupying the same space as the viewer.",
