The Last Supper is central to the Christian faith, because it was then that Christ instituted the Sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\nThe scene depicted in this panel treats the Last Supper in a traditional way. The Twelve Apostles are gathered around the central figure of Jesus, and the young John the Evangelist lays his head on Christ\u2019s lap. At the Crucifixion, Christ will entrust him with the care of his mother, Mary.\n\nChrist will soon announce that one of the Apostles is going to betray him. We see Judas in the foreground, identified by the red bag he carries. This contains the 30 pieces of silver with which the authorities bribed him to betray Christ.\n\nWhen Judas had departed, Christ took bread and wine and offered it to his followers, declaring that they were his Body and Blood. The Apostles were to do this in his memory. In the central panel Christ holds the chalice filled with wine, and there is bread on the table in front of him.\n\nThese panels originally came from the church of Saint-Jean in Rouen, Normandy. The French Revolutionary authorities closed the church in 1793, and it was destroyed by 1817.",

This event is central to the Christian faith as it is when the institution of the Sacrament of the Eucharist occurs.\n\nThe scene depicted in this panel is a traditional representation of the Last Supper. The twelve Apostles are gathered round the central figure of Jesus Christ. The young John the Evangelist, to whom Christ entrusts the care of his mother after his death, lays his head on Christ\u2019s lap. \n\nChrist will soon announce that one of the apostles will betray him. Judas is visible in the foreground and is identified by the bag he carries containing the thirty pieces of silver he was bribed with by the authorities to betray Christ.\n\nThen Christ took bread and wine and offered it to his followers saying that they were his body and his blood and to partake of them and to do so in memory of him. This is the moment when the Institution of the Eucharist takes place.",
