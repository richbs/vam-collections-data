The engraved lines were often filled with coloured composition to give them greater emphasis.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe main inscribed brass reads: 'Of your charity pray for the soul of Henry Fayrey and Agnes his wife which lyeth buried under this stone, and the said Henry deceased the 28th Day of December 1516'.  The main figures are all depicted wearing shrouds.  The complete brass would have had an additional plate showing a group of daughters and four roundels. \n\nPlaces\nThis group of monumental brasses came from a variety of different sources - some were acquired from a butcher in Derbyshire and others from London dealers. They all came originally from Dunstable Priory Church in Bedfordshire. The elements were probably widely scattered after destruction during the Reformation and the English Civil War of 1642-1646.",
