Registered File number 1986/1130.\n\nAt least two of the small patterns would appear to come from designs by CFA Voysey with others reminiscent of the work of LP Butterfield and the Silver Studio.\n\nThe silks used in the making of this cover are important and, with the exception of some woven silks on the top, show a range of designs, both conventional and fashionable, for a short period in the 1890s. It is likely that all the silks from the lining came from the same retail source as all are printed onto a similar ground and it is possible that the printed and plain satins also included came from the same shop. Whereas Libertys would appear the obvious origin of these, other similar establishments such as Stephens also of Regent Street could also be the source.\n\nBecause of the high standard of workmanship and use of contemporary fabric pieces it is possible that the cover was professionally embroidered and sold through one of the leading fashionable London shops of the period.",
