Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nThis carved wood snuff box in the shape of a miniature pair of bellows has a sliding lid to secure the powder. Fine piqu\u00e9 work (short lengths of metal wire fixed in small holes drilled into the wood) forms the inscription 'My Only Love', so this was probably given as a love token. The small size and weight of the container indicate that it was designed as a portable box for personal use, rather than to be passed around a dinner table.",
