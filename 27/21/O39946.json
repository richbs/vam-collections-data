Most surviving bucklers are thought to have been made in Florence and Venice, and perhaps the finest examples are Caravaggio's Medusa, now in the Uffizi gallery, or Giovanni Stradano's battle of Scannagallo, dated 1574, in the Odesclchi collections in Rome. Although not of the same callibre as these two, this  shield must have been a striking object with a shining glaze and gilding underneath. The battle of the Centaurs and Lapiths represented the triumph of  order over barbarism, and was a suitable theme for a pageant, particularly during the sixteenth century, a time when Italy was prone to invasions from Northern Europe and a prince would want to be seen as a protector of his people and restorer of order.",

On occasions, they served as prizes for victors in jousting tornaments, like one presented by Alessandro dei' Medici, Duke of Tuscany, to Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in 1536. The battle of the Centaurs and Lapiths, was widely known owing to popular translations of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> , which provides a particularly bloodthirsty account, and popular during the Renaissance because it represented the triumph of Order over Barbarism",
