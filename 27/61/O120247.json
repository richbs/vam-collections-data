The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s Staffordshire pottery firms issued countless other royal figures. Although some appeared after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday, however, they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThis figurine is probably modelled on a print of the great Regency clown Joseph Grimaldi  (1779-1837) who made his name in the pantomime Mother Goose in 1806 at Covent Garden Theatre and not in the circus. Grimaldi was an excellent comic singer, a great acrobat and a truly inventive performer.  Countless other clowns who looked similar in make-up and costume followed him, working in both the circus and the theatre, but it was Grimaldi's name that became legendary, and the nickname 'Joey' (meaning a clown) developed in his honour.",
