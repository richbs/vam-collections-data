She died in 1869.\n\nThe Marquis de la Valette was Ambassador to the Vatican from August 1861 to October 1862 while Carpeaux was a student in Rome. Carpeaux wrote to the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, on 21 January 1862, that the Marquis had commissioned him to create a bust of the Marquise. He added: 'It was a stroke of good fortune which will give me, if I succeed, a place beside my masters'. The bust was well received in Rome and the Marquise afterwards introduced Carpeaux to the Princess Mathilde, Napoleon III. \n\nThis is one of several contemporary plaster casts taken from the original plaster model, now in the Louvre, which was used by Carpeaux to create a bust in marble of the Marquise (now in a French private collection).",

She married first in 1816 Samuel Welles Boston, who died in 1841; and second in 1842, Charles Jean Marie F\u00e9lix, Marquis de la Valette (sometime Foreign Minister under Napoleon III and Ambassador in London). She died in 1869.\n\nThe Marquis de la Valette was Ambassador to the Vatican from August 1861 to October 1862 while Carpeaux was a student in Rome. Carpeaux wrote to the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, on 21 January 1862, that the Marquis had commissioned him to create a bust of the Marquise. He added: 'It was a stroke of good fortune which will give me, if I succeed, a place beside my masters'. The bust was well received in Rome and the Marquise afterwards introduced Carpeaux to the Princess Mathilde, Napoleon III. \n\nThis is one of several contemporary plaster casts taken from the original plaster model, now in the Louvre, which was used by Carpeaux to create a bust in marble of the Marquise (now in a French private collection).",
