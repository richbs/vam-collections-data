The view of Bombay Green is seen from the \"bunder\", the landing place on one of the man-made barriers  protecting what was originally the island of Bombay. At the time the painting was done, the city now known as Mumbai was evolving from a group of islands into the peninsula that it is today. \"Bombay Green\", now Horniman Circle, was in the area of the Fort and was  surrounded by buildings erected by the English East India Company as part of the administrative framework of the Bombay Presidency.",
