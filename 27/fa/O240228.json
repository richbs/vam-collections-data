He has taught at the University of New Mexico, the Nova Scotia College of Art & Design, and the Cleveland Institute of Art. Since 1972 he has been at Oberlin College, where he now (status 2008) holds the position as Chair of the Department of Art at Oberlin College.\nHe was a pioneer in using the computer for his art and also works in sculpture, painting and drawing. Pearson's early drawing style reacts to Expressionism and later to Constructivism. He intensely investigates into colour systems and grid systems, often using restricted colour schemes and restricted geometrical shapes (eg. the 'Mondrian Series'). He also transferred his two dimensional work into three dimensional sculpture experiments. From the 1990ies on Pearson stopped using the computer for his art and has been more interested in natural phenomena, especially after having travelled to Japan ('Japan Passage Series').",
