He was a member of the \u2018The Algorists\u2019, a term coined in 1995 to describe a set of artists, who, since the 1960s and 1970s, had been working with a shared interest in the use of bespoke software for generating art using the computer.\n\nVerostko was one of the first artists to incorporate brush work in his computer-generated drawings, adapting a pen plotter to hold a Chinese brush.  This example includes a single plotter-driven brushstroke that uses the same 'gesture' as the numerous smaller pen and ink lines behind it. The three carefully placed rectangular shapes were also created by the pen plotter.",
