            "history_note": "From the 1960s until the 1980s Carl Bonn and Colin Mackenzie were among the leading costume makers in Britain, working for all the major theatre, opera and dance companies. Both began their careers as designers and were responsible for executing the costumes after their own designs. The Bonn and Mackenzie costume designs for The Crazy Gang are the Theatre Museum's only Crazy Gang designs, though many of the shows are recorded photographically in the Houston Rogers collection.  The Gang dominated comedy at the London Palladium in the 1930s, switching to the Victoria Palace in 1947.  Their final show was Young in Heart which opened in 1960.  The Gang were actually three different double acts (Flanagan and Allen, Naughton and Gold, Nervo and Knox), though by the time they moved to the Victoria Palace, Chesney Allen had retired.  In 1956 'Monsewer' Eddie Gray rejoined the Gang (he had been with them in the 1930s). From 1951 they were also assisted by Peter Glaze. Nervo and Knox were famous as acrobatic parodists whose speciality act was a cod ballet sequence, and it was probably their influence that led to the 'drag' sequences which featured in the Victoria Palace shows. Associated production: Clown Jewels. Designer: Carl Bonn and Colin Mackenzie. Producer: Jack Hylton. Performers: The Crazy Gang (Jimmy Gold, Teddy Knox, Bud Flanagan, Charles Naughton, Jimmy Nervo).Victoria Palace, London, 5.3.1959. Performance category: Revue, Female Impersonation & Drag.
