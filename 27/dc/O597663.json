After a painting by Webster. \n\nAnother charming village scene. The showman, a member of a species now extinct, is exhibiting to a cluster of village children, if not the ' 'orrible murder of Maria Martin,' doubtless some other equally thrilling and edifying event. His big drum, used on occasions to beat up the attendance that is otherwise slack, is temporarily receiving the attention of one of his audience. A child, at the house close by, is soliciting a copper from granny to enable him also to see the show. The church is visible in the distance, and on the left a row of stately elms. Strutt, in his ' Sports and Pastimes,' 1831, says : ' In the present day, the puppet showman travels about the streets when the weather will permit, and carries his motions, with the theatre itself, upon his back I The exhibition takes place in the open air ; and the precarious income of the miserable itinerant depends entirely on the voluntary contributions of the spectators, which, as far as one may judge from the squalid appearance he usually makes, is very trifling.'",
