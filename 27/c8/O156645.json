Phillips, Ltd., London, 1982.\n\nHistorical significance: A number of surviving mazers display prints engraved with the sacred monogram IHS, which would have originally have been enamelled, as was this one. It is presumably an indication that this example belonged to a religious or quasi-religious institution, such as a monastery or hospital.
