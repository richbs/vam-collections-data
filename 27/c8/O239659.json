The so-called Raphael Cartoons are seven full size designs for tapestries by the great Italian Renaissance artist Raphael (1483-1520). They illustrate passages from the Bible concerning the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. None of them is smaller than ten feet high by thirteen feet wide. They belong to Her Majesty the Queen and have been on loan to this museum since 1865. The earliest print relating to the Raphael Cartoons dates from 1516, the year in which Raphael received final payment for the commission. It inaugurates an extraordinary case study in the history of printmaking, stretching over more than four hundred and fifty years and across a wide range of printmaking techniques.\n\nThis is the only one of three engravings done in Raphael's lifetime by engravers in his circle, which carries his name. The squared pavement seen in the Cartoon is missing in this print and there are major differences between it and the Cartoon in the two top corners. Differences between the engravings and the Cartoons show that engravers in the sixteenth century were working from preparatory drawings, not the Cartoons themselves. Although there are differences, it is noticeable that the prints produced by engravers associated with Raphael give a much more complete idea of the overall compositions than prints produced by other printmakers later in the sixteenth century who did not have privileged access to the artist.",
