During the Second World War, Drury Lane was the headquarters of ENSA (the Entertainments National Service Association), but this notice marked the theatre's return to commercial productions.\n\nPrince Littler, the managing director, was one of the Littler impresarios. Along with brother and sister Emile and Blanche Littler, the Littlers were, at this time, the most powerful figures in the British theatrical world. Prince Littler produced many successful touring revivals and shows throughout the 1940s, and acquired many theatres from the Stoll chain, following the death of Sir Oswald Stoll. He also became chairman of the Moss Empires company, uniting the two companies and acquiring the Theatre Royal in the process.",
