Triangular brackets, such as this one, were used to finish and embellish the ends of the stair tread.  In smaller houses, such brackets were often painted a plain white.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis stair end was made between 1740 and 1770, when the fashion for Rococo was at its height.  Within this small piece several key elements of  Rococo design can be seen.  Curving scrolls in the shape of a C combine with a naturalistic pattern derived from the spiky, feathery leaves of the acanthus plant.  Equally important, the overall design is not disciplined and symmetrical but spontaneous and exuberant.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPine is an inexpensive softwood that is light, durable and easy to carve. It is therefore highly suitable for a functional yet elaborately carved piece such as a stair end.",
