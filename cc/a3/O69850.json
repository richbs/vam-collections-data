It is one of the best examples of classic Buddhist art in the Museum's collection. The Buddhist religion was introduced to Japan during the 6th century. The earliest Buddhist images were mostly made of bronze, clay or lacquer, but from the late 8th century carved wood became the commonest medium. In the later Heian period (898-1185), a number of religious sects came into being that emphasised personal salvation through faith in Amida, the form of Buddha who rules the Pure Land of the Western Paradise.",
