Rock crystal was favoured for vessels because of its transparency and the belief that it would reveal the presence of poison. The precious mounts of silver and enamel show Gothic ornament and motifs similar to contemporary architecture, such as pointed arches or the spout in the shape of a  dragon- mouthed gargoyle. These were in the latest courtly fashion of the period.\n\nWhether the jug was originally intended for church or secular use is not known. During the 19th century it was generally regarded as ecclesiastical cruet, though it is more likely that it is a secular object used for representation of status at the table.",
