It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Pettitt was on the bill as an item in the musical show Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. His banjo was probably made in America.\n\nThe craze for banjo playing came to Great Britain from the USA in the mid-1880s. At this time thousands of pieces of music for the banjo were published, from marches and dances to arrangements of operatic music. In early 19th-century America the banjo was primarily associated with minstrel groups. By about 1900 it was also appreciated as a versatile solo instrument that could sustain an item on a music hall or variety bill, played by elegantly dressed performers such as Pettitt.",
