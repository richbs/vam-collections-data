He is so fully conscious of the necessity of this remark that he has wrote the names on most on account of the entire want of Minute resemblance and drawing\". Mr Angelo G. K. Hayter, great-grandson of the painter, states that all the titles under the portraits and the note on the beginning are in the autograph of Charles Hayter. Some notes on the artist's sitters have been kindly supplied by Mr A. G. K. Hayter, and are inserted at the end of the volume.",
