Samite woven in colours (white, blue, red and brown) on a red background.  Both pieces have a strip of a border on the right side. It is of colourful floral icons, guilloche on the outer side and rectangles and circles on the inner side.

The smaller piece has only the horseman (head missing) spearing a lion.\n\nSamite (twill woven silk) was thought to originate from Persia under Sassanian rule (AD224-651). It was commonly decorated with pairs of animals and birds and set in pearled lotus roundels. It is often found in Western burials, within church possessions and along the Silk Road. Byzantine weaving workshops took on the samite technique to make it an essential weave of the period.  It was a luxury textile of the Middle Ages brought to Europe when the Crusades opened up direct contact with the East. It was forbidden to the middle classes of France under the sumptuary rules c. 1470.",
