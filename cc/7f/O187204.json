Lithograph, coloured by hand. 12\u00be x 9 5/8 in. (32.4 x 24.4 cm.). E.1429-1962\n\nThe head of Cl\u00e9ment Thomas (1809-71) floats above his tombstone, across which the figure of the Republic lies prostrate. Thomas was Commander of the National Guard from 31 October 1870 to 14 February 1871. He was a particularly unfortunate choice as the working-classes had hated him ever since he had played a brutal part in the crushing of the 1848 Revolution. Retribution was exacted on 18 March when Thomas, along with General Lecomte, met his death at the hands of the frenzied mob, amongst the windmills of Montmartre. Although none of the Red leaders was responsible for the crime, the Comit\u00e9 Central added fire to Thiers' propaganda to the provinces by refusing to repudiate the deed officially. Instead, out of fear of losing the support of the mob, they declared that the Generals had been executed \u2018according to the laws of war\u2019. On 23 May, after the \u2018forces of order\u2019 had retaken Montmartre, 49 communards were marched to the scene of the Generals' murder and shot.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
