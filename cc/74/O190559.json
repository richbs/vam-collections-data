London : Futures Publications, 1991.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'<b>PLATE 3.36 : 12-inch LP record sleeve, Three promotional stickers and compact disc and library case.</b> <i>Between Tides</i>. Roger Eno. Des: Russell Mills (b.1952) and Dave Coppenhall. (The original cement, acrylic and collage paintings by Mills: c.c.60 x 60). Photo: Jeff Veitch. Offset lithography. Land Records. 1988. E.1590-1990. Stickers: 8.6 x 12.0. E.1590 (1), (2), (3)-1990. Disc diameter: 12. Case opens to: 12.4 x 27.5. E.1610 to 1611-1990. The painting emerged after many discussions with Roger Eno. Mills, (appointed art director/consultant of Land records in 1988), became so involved in the music that he even selected the titles for a majority of the compositions. The painting explores the confluence of nature, science and religion.'\nMills, Russell. 'Between Tides' - An Explanation Of The Cover Artwork. <u>Opal</u>. March 1988, no 8. pp.13-16.\nExtracts from the text read as follows: \n\n'\u201cIn the making of the record and the months that followed, Roger had expressed his interest in the relationship between the \u2018Dark\u2019 and \u2018Middle\u2019 Ages. For several reasons this line of comparison coincided with my own thoughts on work at the time. I was reading \u201cTravels in Hyper-Reality\u201d by Umberto Eco and re-reading \u201cAn Unfinished History of the World\u201d by Hugh Thomas. Both books deal with the cross-fertilising effects of industrial, religious, cultural and political changes in societies, and both provided me with valuable triggers towards formulating a conceptually sound visual solution. \n\n[\u2026] \n\nThe cover, both front and back, is based on the idea of light emerging from darkness, night becoming day, enlightenment after ignorance and more specifically, \u2018Dark\u2019 into the \u2018Middle\u2019 Ages. The back cover shows a sheet of lead covered in shellac, representing the early \u2018science\u2019 of alchemy; the central gold square of the front cover (1) in part represents the alchemist\u2019s goal, that of turning lead into gold. It also represents high ideals; the age of discovery; beauty; perfection; growth, etc. \n\n[\u2026] \n\nThe composition of the front is based on the cross and all the symbolism that it evokes, especially religion as it was perceived in the Middle Ages. The central square of gold on a bed of cement texture and acrylic, is penetrated by two snaking lines, the top line (2) is a dark crystallised trail of aniline dyes representing gunpowder. The lower, gentler line (3) is a tree root dusted with black sand from Lanzarote and blue acrylic paint, this represents the gradual interest and refinement of nature as imposed on society. Both lines lead to a cluster of objects on a fragment of a book cover (4) (Gutenberg; printing; knowledge; language). Clock parts and broken fragments of a clock face (5) represent the acceptance of Arab maths; the greater awareness of time; the sophistication of science and the conflict it caused with the Church. An elaborately engraved watch part (6) was introduced to show the marriage of art and science; beauty and usefulness. A red thread cross (7) which embraces the cluster echoes the emerging importance and hold of religion. \n\nAs with every commissioned/applied work that I do, I hope that this painting, whilst fulfilling the function of a record cover, will also have the strength of presence to exist in its own right, separated from its original context\u201d. \n\nRUSSELL MILLS, <i>February 1988</i>.\u2019",
