As court painter to Philip II of Spain, he depicted members of the most powerful ruling \u00e9lite in 16th-century Europe.

Mor succeeded in establishing a distinctive new style that combined austerity and a formality of pose with a penetrating insight into his sitters\u2019 characters. In addition to court portraits he also painted successful merchants in Antwerp and artists and intellectuals in the humanist circles in which he moved. His portraits express his own social prestige as much as that of his distinguished sitters and may be understood as expressions of an ideal artistic and intellectual activity.  P.2-1978 appears to be by an artist working around the same time as Mor and the simple dark ground together with the sitter's austere costume, pose and expression all closely resemble those captured in many of Mor's portraits from around 1560 onwards.

            "historical_context_note": "Dutch and Flemish portraits developed significantly during the 16th-17th centuries. \nReligious and political turmoil in the 1500s split the Low Countries into two nations with differing social values and artistic tastes. Flanders remained Catholic and royalist; Flemish artists such as Rubens and Van Dyck glorified the Church and monarchy with grandiose themes, lively compositions, and vivid colours. The United Netherlands, however, became a republic populated mainly by Calvinists. Dutch Protestants like Rembrandt conveyed morals and religious messages through concealed symbolism in landscapes, still lifes, and scenes of daily life.  In 1568, the northernmost provinces of the Low Countries broke away from Spanish control, eventually to become the Dutch Republic, a center of Protestantism. In the southern provinces, which remained under the rule of Spanish regents, the Catholic church and the court continued to be the most important patrons of the arts. Perhaps most characteristic of late sixteenth-century Flemish court art is the dignified, formal portraiture of Antonis Mor.",
