Jones originally compiled the series for a Sunday Times Magazine article, and controversially titled it 'The Black House', recalling the name the refuge was known by in the media and local community. The house was given this name because of its close proximity to an infamous Black Power commune also called the Black House, led by the British black revolutionary Michael de Freitas or \u2018Michael X\u2019 from 1969 to 1970. Jones was looking to play on the negative associations with black power and youth delinquency that the label of \u2018The Black House\u2019 suggested. His images instead present youth alienation in the black community as a direct result of these stereotypes.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired three of Jone\u2019s historic photographs from The Black House series as part of the Staying Power project. A photograph by Dennis Morris depicting the original Black House associated with Michael X was also acquired as part of the project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
