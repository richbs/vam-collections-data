His report was so highly approved that he was offered the post of director and secretary of what was henceforward to be known as the Victoria and Albert Museum. \n\nHarcourt-Smith took up his duties in 1909, when the new building had just been completed, and remained director until his retirement in 1924. Under his directorship the status, rates of pay and working conditions of the technical staff were raised. Students\u2019 rooms were established in all departments and the publication of guides and catalogues was encouraged. Harcourt-Smith also instituted official guide-lecturers and sponsored special displays such as the Franco-British exhibition of 1921. \n\nHis arrangement of the contents of the museum according to their material was hailed as an innovation. It lasted until after the evacuation of 1939, when it was abandoned in favour of a chronological sequence, subdivided into primary and secondary collections.",
