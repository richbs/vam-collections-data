Its simplicity attracts everybody and the skill and steady nerves acquired by practice make it fascinating to children and adults alike.\n\n`HOPLA' is warmly recommended for amusement at social gatherings and evening parties as it excels many an old favorite game.  When a number of persons engage in the game it is exceedingly amusing to see the celluloid caps fly and nest and as a solitaire amusement it is equally attractive.  It is played as follows:-\n\nThe box is placed in the centre of the table and all the hands an equal distance of 5 inches or more away from the perforated board, with the hands pointing away from the box (see figure 1).  Each player takes an equal number of caps, all of the same colour.  After it is decided who commences, the first player places a cap on the hand and slightly strikes the arm with the forefinger, thus trying to throw the cap into one of the apertures of the board.  In throwing the cellulopid cap it is best to place the hands as shown in figure 2, a finger of the left hand upon the cross bar on which the hand rests while the stroke is made with the forefinger of the right hand.\n\nOne cap is thrown each turn and when all the caps of one of the players are placed in the holes the round is finished and each cap counts as much as the number below indicates.  When a lot of caps have fallen into the same hole the owners of the respective caps all score the number marked on the bottom of the box.  If a cap does not hit the board, the player must miss one turn, but he can use that cap again, when his next turn comes.  If a cap rests on the board without falling into a hole it is the next player's turn and the cap does not count; the cap is left on the board until his owner needs it again; he can leave it there until his supply is exhausted.  If, in the meantime, it is pushed into a hole by the cap of another player, it counts in favour of the owner just the same as if he had thrown it in himself.  This makes the game very exciting as for instance it may happen that a cap is with the point near No. 50 in which case it is advisable for the following plauers to avoid the centre.\n\nThe round of games continues until one of the players scores 100 or any other number agreed upon.\n\nUp to 4 persons can take part in this game.",
