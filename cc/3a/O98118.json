Known especially for their striking black and white ranges, the first of which, the 'Neo Classical' collection, was officially launched in 1985.  To accommodate the rapid expansion of the company's merchandise and services, ranging from the production of fabrics, wallpapers and accessories to specialist design consultancy, the Timney Fowler Design Studio was set up in 1993 as a separate branch of the parent company.",
