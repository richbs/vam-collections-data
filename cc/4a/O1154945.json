The race game appears in all sorts of guises: educational, moral, competitive and fun. A race game involves two or more players competing against each other in order to win.\n\nHowever, this is a co-operative game, which encourages teamwork, creative thinking and problem solving. 'Together' is made by Family Pastimes; a small family business who make the games in small quantities as a labour of love in their farm house in Canada. They believe that children should 'play as friends, not as enemies' so the games they produce help foster the spirit of co-operation. They claim that the initial impulse to play a game is social and believe it is ironic that in most games we spend all our effort competing against one another.",
