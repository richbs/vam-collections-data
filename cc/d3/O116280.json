The most important item was a pair of gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring, with its swirling bands of seed pearls, is typical of the kind worn in the Veneto, the area around Venice.  \n\nHowever, it was described as Dalmatian when it was acquired in 1929, and this is quite possible.  Much of the jewellery worn with traditional costume in the region along the coasts of the north-east Adriatic was strongly influenced by Venetian prototypes, and earrings like these survive in the treasuries of churches in the region.",
