It was then taken to New York and on to Chicago, Boston, Toronto and Philadelphia, and joined the RSC's London season at the Aldwych Theatre on 10 June 1971. It began a world tour in September 1972, first visiting Europe,  then returning for a Christams season at the Aldwych before playing for a week at Stratford and then embarking on a year-long tour to America, Japan and Australia.\n\nHistorical significance: One of the most celebrated and discussed of twentieth-century Shakespeare productions, Peter Brook's A Midsummer Night's Dream used a bare white box set in which the play's magic was created through circus tricks: the fairies wore simple, brightly coloured, costumes suggested by those of Chinese acrobats and swung in on trapezes; Puck confounded the lovers while balanced on stilts amd juggled a spinning plate to represent the magic flower. Brook swept away the theatrical traditions and much of the 'prettiness' that had become associated with the play and, in redefining A Midsummer Night's Dream for the 1970s, exerted an enormous influence on subsequent productions.",
