Both are clearly sympathetic to the King's plight, and there are a further three designs showing the execution itself. Such subjects were evidently popular with the British market. In addition, they would have had a particular relevance to the Staffordshire potters making such wares. Although the great Staffordshire potter and entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood welcomed the 'glorious revolt that has taken place in France' in 1789, he was also aware that the Staffordshire ceramic industry would suffer from the loss of profitable French markets. He added: 'The politicians tell me that as a manufacturer I shall be ruined if France has her liberty, but I am willing to take my chances in that respect' (letter to Dr Erasmus Darwin July 1789). Other Staffordshire potters, however, were crippled by the loss of French markets and the non-payment of French debts.",
