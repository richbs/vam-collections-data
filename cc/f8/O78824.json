All of Morris & Co.'s hand-knotted carpets are called 'Hammersmiths' after the location of his London home, where they were first woven. \n\nThis example is part of the Morris & Co. furnishings for  Bullerswood in Chislehurst in Kent, the home of wool trader John Sanderson.  Built in 1866 the house was later altered by Ernest Newton.  Two Hammersmith carpets were ordered for the house, one for the hall and this one, designed for the drawing room.  Museum records dating from a visit to the house in 1921 state 'it appears that the drawing room was decorated by William Morris under his personal supervision and nothing was allowed to be placed in it in addition to objects executed by himself'.\n\nAlthough Morris believed that Persian carpets were the greatest ever made, he adopted the coarser Turkish (Ghiordes) knot for his own hand-knotted carpet manufacture. They were woven at a thickness of 25 knots to the square inch. The design includes many motif devised by Morris for carpets.  It also shows later, more formal elements characteristic of Henry Dearle's work. There is a strong possibility, therefore, that the carpet was a collaborative project.",
