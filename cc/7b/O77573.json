Below this is a narrow carved moulding with stylised egg and dart ornament.  The four legs are of heavy baluster form, each composed of a modified Ionic capital, a bulbous body carved above with gadroons and below with acanthus and resting on a turned base, with a squared foot on which is simple punched decoration.  They are connected below by four stretchers moulded (identically) on their inner and outer faces, and gently rounded on their upper face, where a moulded surface has been worn away. Both short leaves have been cut with shallow finger-pulls. A dark stain has been over all of the show surfaces. \n\nFor a diagram of the opening mechanism of this type of table, see John C. Rogers, English Furniture, revised and enlarged by Margaret Jourdain. (London, 1950), p.35\n\nConstruction\nThe table consists of two frames - an upper (the rails) and a lower (the stretchers) joined with pegged mortise and tenon joints to four full-height turned baluster legs. The table top is in three separate sections, of mitred \u2018bread board\u2019 construction with four boards arranged longitudily: a long mid-section, \u2018floating\u2019 but supported by a transverse mid-rail into which it is located with two glued tenons (presumably added, one missing 2013); two short draw-leaves, each supported on two long lopers (and fixed to them with modern screws). When one or both short leaves are withdrawn, the ends of the lopers cantilever below the transverse mid-rail and also support the long central top section at its normal height. The transverse mid-rail is supported on a full length longitudinal rail in two sections (apparently replacement), both ends of which sit in a deep notch cut in the side rails of the upper frame. On the lower edge of the rails, the applied moulding is nailed on (some sections replaced). \n\nModification\nFour iron screw bolts added at the top of each leg, which pass through the square top into the long rails. At one end of the table, the capitals of both legs are missing sections on their inner corners. The wear on the rails seems remarkably consistent. The lopers possibly replacement. It seems possible that both shorter table-top panels are replacements or at least refinished. One, possibly both, ends of the transverse mid-rail has a modern facing batten nailed to its face.",

Those at each end slide under the central leaf when the table is closed. To open the table, the end leaves are drawn out and the central leaf occupies the space in the middle, so forming a continuous surface. Draw tables were known in the early 17th century and were sometimes called drawing tables. \n\nDesign & Designing\nThe bulbous legs are of Flemish origin. They were introduced into England through immigrant craftsmen and continental pattern books by designers such as Wendel Dietterlin of Strasbourg (1550-1599) and Hans Vredeman de Vries of Antwerp (1527-?1606).\n\nThe inlay, chequer patterns and diagonal banding are characteristic of work by Dutch and Flemish refugee craftsmen in Southwark, London. The acanthus leaf carving and gadrooning on the vases are typical of draw tables made in England in the period from 1585 to 1630. (The gadrooning is the carved decoration with convex reeds on the edges of the 'apron' and stretchers.)\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe table came from Spains Hall, near Finchling, Essex, the seat of the Kempe family.",

Below this is a narrow carved band of conventional ornament. The four legs are of heavy baluster form, each composed of a modified Ionic capital, a bulbous body carved above with gadroons and below with acanthus and resting on a turned base.

Shapland, Nation\u2019s Treasures, London : Simpkin, Marshall & Co. & Benn Bros., 1910, p. 37, plate 11 \u201c This is an oak draw-table of the seventeenth century with carved bulbous legs. Students will note that the old turners refrained from using an immense block of wood for this bulbous effect, getting over the difficulty by building up the leg on four sides; the joints are clearly discernable in this example. The top of the table is very thick, and the method of framing is worth noting. The carving, though crude, looked at from a modern standpoint, is effective on so bold a piece. The rails underneath the top are elaborately decorated with a black-and-white chequered pattern and diagonal stringing. This table was originally varnished, giving it its rich nut-brown colour. The black-and-white stringing is toned down, the white having assumed a rich yellow, so that the band does not appear too striking, as it might have done when the table was first made\u201d.\nMacquoid, Percy.

He suggests that the majority of surviving Elizabethan table tops are replacement or altered, and that some may have had stone or marble tops (like those illustrated in the Lumley inventory of 1590), possibly evidenced by loper slots being roughly cut, suggestive of 17th century adaptation.\nHe argues that Netherlandish draw-end tables were smaller and lighter than English examples\nMurray Adams-Acton, Early English  Oak tables, I - Observations on  the Long Table, in Connoisseur,  Dec 1936.",
