            "physical_description": "Boarded oak chest with carved front depicting two cusped ogee arches with roses and leaves in the spandrels.\n\nStructure\nThe chest is formed from five sawn oak planks, supplemented by a replacement lid formed from two butted planks of elm, with a deep scratch moulding along the upper surface of the front). Saw marks are visible on the back face of the back board. The front board is carved (about 2mm deep) in the solid with a pair of \u2018panels\u2019 and overlaps the bottom by 3.5cm. The back is a rectangular board 34cm x 108.5cm. The sides are grained top to bottom, the front, back, bottom and lid are grained side to side. The front and back overlap the sides. The bottom sits inside the front and back. To secure the front and back to the sides, four wooden pegs (supplemented by two generations of nails) are driven at each end through the boards into the sides, and along these four joints a shallow section has been cut away from the front and back, to create a half-lap. On the inside face of the sides, front and back a groove has been cut to receive the bottom board. Three pegs are driven through both sides into the bottom board to fix it. \n\nInterior\nAt the left end are grooves in the front and back for a till with pivot lid (now missing).\n\nLater alterations and damage\n\nAs the left side is 49.5cm and the right 50.5cm high, at least one end (but probably both) must have been cut down, probably to remove irregular wear.\n\nBoth sides are warped to a convex profile, causing the joints to open.\n\nAt both sides along its lower edge, the front panel has lost a section of carving, probably about 16cm wide, which would have extended to about the current \u2018floor\u2019 level, and which formed a \u2018bracket\u2019 between the side and the front. The losses expose a broken peg on both sides.\n\nThe lock plate, though old, covers several old nails indicating that it is not the original. Below the lockplate, the plain \u2018muntin\u2019 has several scratches but appears always to have been plain.\n\nThe elm lid displays traces of strap hinges (now missing), attached to its inside (indicating that it came from another, similar chest), and the back displays the remains of iron ring hinges for the original lid, as well as the ring hinges used to secure the current elm lid.",
