NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative. 'Pack Ice' is created from rayon strapping tape, a common material which is easy to tear horizontally but difficult to tear vertically.  The rayon threads are tightly woven into large squares on a background of silk organdie.  These squares are connected by unwoven rayon threads that float between the layers of the background material, suggesting spume among icebergs.",
