Jeffrey & Co. was one of the English manufacturers to perfect a technique for their production, winning a medal at the Paris International Exhibition of 1878 for a \u2018leather\u2019 version of <i>Peacocks and Amorini</i>, designed by Walter Crane. (For descriptions relating to the process see <i>The Building and Engineering Times</i>, 6 Sept. 1884, and NAL 86.HH.13.) \n\nMorris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. had, from about 1862, patterns of real embossed leather and first adopted imitations in 1878. (Unlike the earlier gold-ground papers, the patterns were stamped rather than printed.) This example probably dates from about 1886. Another version (described in the <i>Art Journal</i>, 1893, pp. 139-141) was used in the Antiques Room at 1 Holland Park (see cat.no.I.18). \n\nMorris commended imitation leathers in his and Professor Middleton\u2019s entry \u2018Mural Decoration\u2019, in the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, XVII, 1884.'",
