            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 110, 113, 114\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nProbably a page from a sketch-book, trimmed.  \nThe drawing is mounted on a larger sheet of paper, measuring 6 1/8 x 9 1/8 ins. (154 x 231 mm.) (see also Nos. 149, 151, 152, and 154 [606-1888, 311-1888, 628-1888, 791-1888]).\nOn the back of No. 153 [303-1888] is a pencil drawing showing the interior of the church, with the clergyman in the pulpit.  Inscribed vertically in pencil by the artist <i>Preston Church Sunday Decr. 1st. 1816</i>.\nThe Rev. E.V. Tanner, who has examined the Church Registers, states that the clergyman is almost certainly John Fisher, who undertook most of the work at this church during a period, from March 1816 till December 1817, in which there was no vicar of Preston.\nThis is a page from the same sketch-book as Nos. 148, 149, 151, 152, and 154 [268-1888, 606-1888, 311-1888, 628-1888, 791-1888]).\n\n\nNotes on Nos. 147-154 [823-1888, 268-1888, 606-1888, 613-1888, 311-1888, 628-1888, 303-1888, 791-1888]\n\nNos. 147-154 [see above] were all drawn by Constable on his honeymoon.  He was married by John Fisher at St. Martin\u2019s-in-the-Fields on 2 October, and Fisher has invited the newly-married couple to stay at his vicarage at Osmington on the coast near Weymouth, in Dorsetshire.  The visit to Netley Abbey on 11 October, when Nos. 147 to 149 [823-1888, 268-1888, 606-1888] and probably also No. 150 [613-1888] were made, was probably undertaken from Southampton on the way down.  As Beckett suggests (<i>Connoisseur, loc. cit.</i>) the map on the back of No. 148 [268-1888] would be of use in journeying from Southampton to Osmington, and may also suggest a break of Journey at Ringwood.  The latest recorded date for a drawing made at Osmington is that on the back of our drawing No. 153 [303-1888] of 1 December.  No. 147 [823-1888] is drawn in the smaller sketch-book which Constable had used earlier in the year, from which No. 146 [233-1888] also comes.\nAlthough the hinge marks and the other obvious signs have been trimmed off Nos. 148, 149 [268-1888, 606-1888], and Nos. 151-154 [311-1888, 628-1888, 303-1888, 791-1888], there can be little doubt that these six sheets once formed part of the same sketch-book.  The trimming and cutting up of the sketch-book seems in this instance to have been carried out by the artist himself, since the inscriptions on the larger sketch-book pages on to which some of them are mounted (Nos. 149 [606-1888], 153 [303-1888] and 154 [791-1888]) are almost certainly in his hand.  Among other drawings which may come from the same sketch-book are: \u2018View of Osmington and the Downs with the figure of George III on horseback at Sutton Poyntz\u2019 (4 5/16 x 7 ins.) which was Lot 93 in the Gregory sale, 20 July 1949; \u2018Portland Roads\u2019 (4 7/8 x 7 ins.), then in the collection of R.B. Beckett (<i>Connoisseur, loc. cit., </i>fig. VII).  In the article cited Beckett discusses other drawings and oil sketches made at the time.  See also Beckett, VI, pp. 30-1 and plate 5.  An oil sketch of the coast with Portland Island in the distance, similar to the pencil drawings Nos. 151 [311-1888], 152 [628-1888], 154 [791-1888], and 154a [791-1888], is in the City Art Museum, St. Louis (reproduced in the Bulletin of that Museum, Vol. XIV, 1929, p. 8)",
