It is associated with Lady Stafford partly because St Catherine was her patron saint. Furthermore, another altar frontal (Museum no. 35-1888), acquired at the same time and similar in style, shows the figures of Lady Catherine, her husband and their children. This suggests that the two embroideries may have come from the same original set of church furnishings. \n\nMakers & Making\nThis embroidery was made in a workshop, probably in London. The sumptuous and dramatic effect has been achieved by applying a large-scale figure made of rich materials to a contrasting background material. The original background material has been replaced, but we can assume that it would have been brightly-coloured, quite possibly red velvet. Church furnishings made of rich and expensive materials were often cut up and the parts reused.",
