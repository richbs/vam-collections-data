His photographs epitomised the playful, graphically dynamic style of commercial photography practised in London during the period. Here, Cowan photographs the legendary Grand Prix driver Stirling Moss, probably shortly before the latter\u2019s retirement in 1962. The image is a good example of what one commentator has called Cowan\u2019s \u2018high-octane\u2019 style: by making use of blur and paring the image down to its graphic essentials, he accentuates the thrill and glamour of the racing car and its driver.",
