Eccentric founder Robert Wallace Martin and his siblings Charles, Walter and Edwin epitomised the energy and experimentation of the nineteenth-century art pottery movement. They regarded pottery as a means of artistic expression, rather than a product of industrial manufacture, and were particularly inspired by the rustic flora and fauna forms of the sixteenth-century potter Bernard Palissy as well as Japanese arts. This vase is typical of the Martin Brothers' later work and shows the influence of the emerging European Art Nouveau style, inspired by natural forms such as seeds and plants. \n\nThe incised mark on the base 'London' is typical for the workshop but the framed impressed mark 'MARTIN' on this pot is previously unknown. The material and decoration closely relates to examples illustrated in Malcolm Haslam, The Martin Brothers Potters, London, 1978 (pp.119 and 155).",
