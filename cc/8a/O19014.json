The roundels are mostly confined to the hem and bottom of the sleeves, and there is one each side of the front opening at chest level. The long dollar band is made of a strip of matching material although it is not wide enough to show whole roundels. The rest of the back and front is decorated with the hemp pattern.\nThe garment is lined with scarlet cr\u00eape and it has a small wadded hem. There is a tuck at waist level to shorten the length, and this would be hidden by the <i>obi</i> (belt).",

Red was a popular choice for young women\u2019s kimono because the colour symbolised youth and glamour. The dye, known as beni, was produced from safflowers and was very expensive. The whole garment is decorated using a tie-dyeing technique known as shibori, which was also very costly. The woman who wore this kimono must have come from a very wealthy family. The auspicious design of pine, bamboo and plum on the hem and sleeve ends suggests she wore it for a special occasion. The garment has been shortened at the waist, indicating that it was designed, or later adapted, to be an under-kimono.",
