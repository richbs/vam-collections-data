It was made in Venice at a time when the city was a flourishing centre for the production of brass dishes. Like this example, they were very elaborately decorated but not with traditional European linear ornamentation. The decoration was influenced by the goods Venetian merchants brought back to the city from the Turkish and Arab empires that bordered the Mediterranean. \n\nHere you can see the deep, bold engraved decoration is inlaid with silver wire. This technique is known as damascening and was a speciality of the Venetian Muslim community, who produced many splendid damascened brass vessels, some of which are signed in Arabic by their makers.",
