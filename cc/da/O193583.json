            "public_access_description": "The poster was issued after the first semi-free parliamentary elections in Poland on June 4th 1989. It was produced in order to show Solidarity's gratitude to voters for electing its candidates to the Polish Parliament. The message is clarified by inserting an image of the Polish House of Parliament into the Solidarity logo. The Solidarity logo was designed by Jerzy Janiszewski in August 1980. The word \u2018solidarity\u2019 appeared frequently on the walls of Gdansk Shipyard. It was also the name of the strike newsletter and soon became the official name of the Free Trade Unions. The form of the logo was inspired by slogans written and stenciled on walls during the strike. The letters form the shape of people joined together in a dense crowd. The typical socialist motif of a leader conducting a crowd is replaced by the Polish national flag. The logo of the trade union soon became legible and well-known spreading quickly within the borders of Poland and abroad. The Solidarity logo became the source of a typeface called \u2018Solidarics\u2019 (Solidaryca). Solidarics has become almost a Polish national typeface. It is often used for logos and slogans referring to Poland in general as well as for content relating to nationalism, freedom and democracy.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
