On her right is St. Catherine crowned and holding a book in her right hand and a flower in her left, which she puts out towards the Child.\n\nIt is made of pipeclay, which is a fine white clay used to make tobacco pipes and pottery.\nConveniently situated on a major trading route, Siegburg was a centre of ceramic production with well-organised workshops and kilns in which also  pipe-clay figures were fired.\n\nSaint Catherine of Alexandria, also called St Catherine of the Wheel or the Great Martyr Saint Catherine. She is a Christian Saint and Martyr. Her principal symbol is a spiked wheel and her feast day is 25th November by most Christian churches.\n\nFollowing the Golden Legend she showed great erudition from an early age. She became queen, converted to Christianity and had a vision of marrying Christ. Maxentius, the Roman Emperor desired her and sent out 50 philosophers to try to interfere in her faith. Instead the philosophers were all converted to Christianity themselves.\nThe legend tells that she was to be condemned to death on a torture wheel with iron spikes, which broke, when she touched it. She was then beheaded instead. There is doubt about her historical authenticity.",
