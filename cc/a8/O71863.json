In her right hand she holds the wheel on which she was tortured. In her left hand she holds the sword with which she was beheaded. The border of her halo has an inscription. In translation it reads: 'O Saint Catherine pray for us'.\nThis relief is part of a small group of rectangular plaques. They are made of either red terracotta or white pipeclay.  All four reliefs are of a similar size and very similar in style. The other three, however,  are set in a vaulted chapel-like space or niche.  Such plaques must have been used as objects of personal devotion in monasteries, convents, hospitals and the home. \nSt Catherine was especially revered as the bride of Christ and protectress of the dying. This relief would therefore have been well sited in a hospital. It might also have been used as a travelling icon for those near death.",

Their products were imitated by other workshops in Colonne and Westphalia.

This was already seen in Netherlandish painting in the early 1400s.",
