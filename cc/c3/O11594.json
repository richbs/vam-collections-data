            "history_note": "This design is one of a collection of designs for Shakespeare's As You Like It given to the Theatre Museum by the touring theatre company, Cheek  By Jowl, which staged the  production in 1991-1992 and 1994-1995.\n\nHistorical significance: This collection of designs for As You Like It are a record of an acclaimed production staged by the Cheek By Jowl theatre company and directed by Declan Donnellan, who co-founded the company with the designer, Nick Ormerod.  Cheek By Jowl productions were notable for their simplicity of design and for their focus on the actor as storyteller, and As You Like It was a perfect example of the company's style, using Ormerod's white box set and forest of green hangings to create a simple, unobtrusive location for the action. The play began and ended with the whole acting company on stage. Dressed in basic black trousers and white shirts, they were clearly actors presenting a story to an audience which was required to use its imagination and participate in the illusion. The all-male production was first staged in 1991, toured extensively, and was revived in 1994 and taken on a further world tour which ended in London at the Albery Theatre.  The freshness of the approach, and a fine Rosalind from Adrian Lester, won it critical plaudits. Nicholas de Jongh of the Evening Standard wrote that it would \"define the play for the 1990s\".",
