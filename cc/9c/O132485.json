The seat rails built up at the front corners, and with a curved top profile and without holes (suggesting that either the rails have been replaced, or that the rush type seat is original). There is no obvious evidence that the rails have been replaced however. The legs turned (those at the front with a fluted baluster), and side, middle and rear stretchers also turned, while the pierced carved front stretcher of a scrolling arch form. The caned panel with very tight cane pattern.\n\nThe front stretcher stamped LS (or CS).\nSingle protruding square pegs\nRepairs: top rail broken (2007) at old glue joint; both feet damaged, and metal nails in all four feet. Minor losses to upper edge of front stretcher.",

They were widely recorded in middle-class as well as noble house inventories well into the first half of the eighteenth century. Both the technique and the material (rattan cane or calamus rotang split into long narrow strips) came from Asia. The canes were imported in large quantities by the East India Company to London, where the production of caned furniture was concentrated. Caned chairs were also exported from London in large quantities, so much so that in France they were known as chaises d'anglaise, and in the German states as englische St\u00fchle. They were often used with a light seat cushion. Unlike upholstered chairs, caned chairs seem to have been produced through a subdivision of piece-work labour by journeymen joiners, turners, caners and carvers, who seem often to have stamped their work with initials, as on the front stretcher (CS or LS) of this chair. The rush seat on this chair is probably a replacement for a caned seat.",
