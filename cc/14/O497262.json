            "physical_description": "Vase. with short body, long neck.\nResearch by Maria Fabrizi-FEB. 1988: Decorated vase. This vase is Japanese, and is possibly of 15th century A.D. date (R.K). It has an inset baseplate. Examination in bright light shows that there are at least two patches, or inserts, which have been coloured to march the rest of the vase. Analyses of several parts of the body were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. Several plain and undecorated areas were chosen, and both of the obvious patches were also analysed. The elemental information for the body metal was completely different from that of the patches.\nThe composition of the vase alloy was consistent with manufacture by casting. The proportions of the alloying metals (tin and zinc) were very low, which suggests that the original colour of the metal would have been quite reddish, and not far from the colour of pure copper. The concentration of lead is such that it would have been an intentional addition. It seems unlikely that this amount of lead would have affected the colour very much. It would have lowered the melting point of the metal, and would have given extra fluidity to the melt, probably allowing better definition of detail in the decoration. The body composition is very similar to that of vase 82-1889. Neither of the patches (\u2018Patinabody3\u2019 and \u2018secondpatch\u2019) were matched to standards by the SORT program. This seems to have been because of the very large iron components in the spectra. The three major elements in both cases were copper, iron, and lead. Some tin was also present. The implications are unclear, but it may be that an iron-based pigment was used to cover the patched areas, in order to restore the appearance of the vase. The precise composition of the patches cannot be determined using the EDXRF methods. Only qualitative results were available.",
