Ashbee was one of the earliest Arts and Crafts designers of jewellery, his first jewels dating from 1890.  He contributed one of the key points, that the value of jewellery lay in its design, not in the monetary value of the materials used.  Although this peacock jewel is one of his more sumptuous creations, it would have been modest in price compared with the heavy diamond-set jewellery of its day.  Ashbee admired the Renaissance of the 15th century  when the 'arts and crafts were one and indivisible': Renaissance artists were goldsmiths as well as painters, sculptors or architects.  In 1898 he published a translation of the two treatises of Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1571) on goldsmithing and sculpture.\n\nSubject\nIn 1892 Ashbee wrote on the flyleaf of a bookbinding which D.S. MacColl designed for him that it showed: 'the poor peacock of the Arts and Crafts with its proud tail exploding in fireworks'.  The choice of the peacock seems to have been primarily because it was a bold, proud, bird which stood out against a drab and hostile world.",
