It was drawn by an artist named Gopal at Agra in 1874 and bears a label on both the front and back giving the price as \u00a34; it was acquired by the India Museum soon afterwards and transferred to the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) in 1879. 'Thakur' is the title given to the son of a Rajput ruler who is deceased, but biographical details of the sitter have not been traced.\n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
