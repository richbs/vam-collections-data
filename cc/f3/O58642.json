Known as 'il Drago' (the Dragon), he enjoyed great success and his playing of this instrument was likened to 'a tame lion, which having lost its ferocity retained all its strength and grandeur'. \n\nDragonetti collected snuff boxes and dolls, and he was notorious for his very poor command of English, even after having lived in the country for many years. In about 1830  Dragonetti presented this instrument to the 3rd Duke of Leinster (1791-1874), who in turn presented it to this museum, following the 'Special Exhibition of Ancient Musical Instruments', in 1872.",
