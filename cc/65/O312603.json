The version is virtually reversed and an additional child is looking over Charity's shoulder. It is possibly an earlier version of the final composition for the Royal Exchange drinking fountain group. \n\nDalou (1838-1902) was the son of a glove maker and initially trained in drawing at the Petit \u00c9cole in Paris. There he was encouraged to do sculpture. In 1854 he entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, where he trained for four years. He was known for his left-wing political sympathies and was involved in the establishment of the Paris Commune in 1871. After his overthrow he was forced into exile in London, where he lived from 1871 until his return to Paris in 1879. In London he frequently exhibited at the Royal Academy and he was given a teaching appointment at the National Art Training School in South Kensington (later the Royal College of Art), where he had a profound effect on the development of British sculpture.\n\nMany of his works are of women in intimate domestic situations. Whether reading, sewing or, as here, with small children, they have a remarkable informality and intimacy. Dalou executed a number of versions specifically of Charity 1877-8.",
