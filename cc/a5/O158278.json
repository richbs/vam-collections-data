The characters within the opera follow certain paths that they are expected to follow by society, which result in violence and race riots. Surrealistic and psychedelic episodes occur, in an attempt to address the question of humanity's survival in the universe without intervention from the astral plane. Tippett tackles a very large theme through this production, without offering an easy solution.",
