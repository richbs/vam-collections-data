The furnishings included table covers, upholstery for chairs, loose cushion  covers, and valances to hang above fireplaces, or on beds, together with bed covers. Sometimes a table carpet and upholstered furniture had matching patterns.  \n\nThis tapestry-woven cushion cover depicts a scene from the Old Testament story of Esther and  Ahasuerus.  Esther was the wife of  the King of Persia. The King allowed his chief minister to order the massacre of all Jews in the Persian empire. Esther, who was Jewish,  risked her own death by approaching the King unbidden, to intercede with him to  save her people. In this scene Ahasuerus is shown seated on a throne under a canopy, extending his sceptre to Esther standing before him, to indicate his  approval of her request. The choice of this particular Old Testament story, which is also found on some other tapestry-woven furnishings, may be an allusion to the position of the Dutch Protestants under the Spanish regime.",
