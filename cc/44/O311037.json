It is perhaps influenced by the sculptor Alexander Munro (1825-1871) for whom he had worked in the 1860s or Jean-Charles Cazin (1841-1901), the sculptor and potter who taught Martin during his period at the Lambeth School of Art. \n\nThe Ecce Homo is part of the cycles illustrating the Passion and Life of Christ in art. Normally the representations show Pilate and Christ, the mocking crowd and parts of the city of Jerusalem. From the 15th century representations began to depict only Jesus. Ecce Homo, \u2018Behold the Man!\u2019, were the words of Pontius Pilatus to the Jews outside the judgement hall, after Christ\u2019s scourging.\n\nRobert Wallace Martin (1843-1923), primarily a potter, was active from the 1860s onwards. In 1877 he established his pottery works in partnership with his brothers at Southall under the name of R.W. Martin &amp; Bros, which became chiefly known for its original use of stoneware, branded as 'Martin-ware'. Robert Wallace Martin acted as the sculptor and modeller. The Martin Brothers specialised in ceramics such as jugs and jars.",
