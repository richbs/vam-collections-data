We are not trying to show familiar objects in unfamiliar  ways, but rather to denaturalize the genres of  photography which already consist of fully coded visual signs. Much of our thinking on this has been influenced by reading and seeing the work of Brecht, and by the writings of Augusto Boal in THEATRE OF THE OPPRESSED (Published by Pluto Press, 1979). What we finally hit  upon as a working method was a form of photo-theatre. Here we could use non naturalistic modes of  representation which allowed us to stage and create a  kind of hybrid 'spectacle' whilst drawing upon and  disrupting well known genres of photography which have  been concerned with the representation of aspects of  the female body. In order to do this we have used ourselves both as social actors and as photographers because we wanted to problematize and re-work the  model/photographer relationship which is generally so one-sided.\" Quoted from a text supplied to the museum by the artists.
