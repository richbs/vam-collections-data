            "physical_description": "The oval, cylindrical lampshade is made of paper-thin \"eggshell\" porcelain that transmits light through its walls. The body, which is so thin and translucent that it must have a high kaolin to chinastone proportion, allows the overglaze decoration to be seen through the walls. The hollow base is made of thicker, heavier porcelain, and has an incision at the side of the foot through which an electrical wire can pass. \n\nThe decoration of the base is of a key-fret pattern on the upper section, a wavy linear design derived from archaic bronzes on the central section, and three stylised floral motifs on the lower section. The same key-fret is repeated round the top of the lampshade, together with a \"rococo-style\" floral border similar to that found on 18th century export porcelain. At the bottom of the lampshade is a single loop-and-dot border pattern. All of the above patterns are carried out in overglaze blue, by means of mechanically transferred decals. \n\nThe pattern round the lampshade, however, is hand-painted in <i>gongbi</i> style to show the \"eight horses of King Mu\" in a traditional landscape with water, rocks and trees. It uses overglaze black, brown, blue, green, yellow and red. Above the horses are three simulated sealmarks painted in red on a gold ground: the first large square seal reads: 'san xi tang jing jian xi' (seal of the highest appreciation of the Hall of Three Rarities). The Hall of Three Rarities was a room in the Imperial Palace so named by the Qianlong emperor (1736-95) because if accommodated three of this greatest antique treasures, three pieces of ancient calligraphy; the style of painting on this lantern is meant to copy a Qianlong imperial style. A second large oval seal reads: 'Qianlong yu lan' (treasure for the imperial scrutiny of Qianlong). The third smaller square seal reads 'yi zi xun' (suitable for the descendants). On the reverse side to that decorated with horses is a poem, painted in black: \"It is difficult to meet a Bo le (a man who lived during the Spring and Autumn period, who knew a lot about horses) nowadays. Who would hope for the northern herd (of horses) in vain? The leisurely music of their neighing is borne on the wind. Their constant urge to run carries them high above the clouds.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the poem is a small red-and-gold leaf, and at the end two seals. This convention is observed on other inscriptions on porcelain, e.g. those on 17th and 18th century Dehua ware. The seals read: 'Shining' referring to Lang Shining, the Jesuit Castiglione who worked at Qianlong's court and who painted several famous painting of horses.",
