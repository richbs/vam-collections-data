London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 289-290, cat. no. 359.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nWillem van de VELDE the younger (1633-1707) \nDutch School \nElder brother of Adriaen van de Velde, both sons of Willem van de Velde the elder, he was born at Leyden, the family afterwards settling at Amsterdam. He studied with his father and probably also with Simon de Vlieger. By 1672 he had followed his father to England, where from 1674 they worked for Charles II and where they remained for the rest of their lives. He is known for seascapes with shipping. \n\n359 \nSHIPPING IN A CALM \nSigned and dated, lower right <i> W v Velde 165(8?)</i> \nOak panel \n23 \u00bd X 28 (60 X 71) \nJones Bequest \n482-1882 \n\nThis painting was formerly attributed to Willem van de Velde the elder (c. 1611-93), and it raises the thorny problem of the activities, possibly interrelated, of the two Willem van de Velde in the 1650s. The father painted mainly grisailles in the manner of engravings, and the few oil paintings that are definitely known to be by him are rather different from the picture in question, whereas the works of the son are closely comparable. Nevertheless, the attribution to the father was upheld on the grounds that the form of the signature is more like his than that of the son. In spite of this, several authorities gave the picture to the son (Hofstede de Groot, 1918), and recently the attribution to the younger van de Velde was upheld for a very similar painting dated 165(5 ?), formerly in the collection of Sir Bruce Ingram (Sotheby's, 11 March 1964, lot 38, repr.). M. S. Robinson (oral opinion) has suggested that the father, as head of the workshop, could perhaps have signed the son's paintings in the 1650s, when the latter was in his early twenties. He cites a painting dated 1659 in Major Dent's collection which is signed <i>W v Velde de jonge</i> - the epithet has been squeezed in, perhaps added by the son at a later date, after he became an independent master. This mayor may not prove to be an acceptable hypothesis, but in any case there can be no doubt that the arguments based on style in favour of attributing this group of paintings to Willem van de Velde the younger are very strong. \n\nCondition.

Further to the left is a group of a smalschip and two kaags. In the right foreground is a pont viewed from abaft the starboard beam with her small sprit-sail and foresail set; there is a grey horse amidships and a field gun stowed near the foot of the mast. Close to port, bow view, is a hoeker-rigged Rhine aak, her square mainsail set. A little further away is a States yacht viewed from before the port beam. She has her white sprit-sail and foresail set and she is rigged with a topmast; flags at the main and peak. She is firing a salute to starboard as a ship's boat in the centre, port bow view, pulls away from the yacht. There is a sprit-rigged vessel alongside the yacht's starboard quarter, her dark sail setting off the leech of the yacht's mainsail. In the middle-distance and far into the distance are many vessels of varying types under sail. \nAn assemblage of vessels such as this has usually been connected with expeditions of the Princes of Orange, but in this case there does not seem to be a large military presence and there is only one yacht. In view of its date, probably 1658, it may represent the vessels used for the fitting out with stores and men of a fleet of men-of-war lying perhaps in the Texel. \nThe yacht may be the same one with lion figurehead which is shown in the rather similar picture formerly in the Ingram collection, (cat. no. 157). There were, at this time, several yachts very similar to each other but, with his usual exactitude, the Elder van de Velde would have produced detailed drawings to show the differences. A drawing for the bow view of the yacht has not been found, but one apparently of the same yacht, an unfinished quarter view, is in the Boymans-van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam (MB1866/T434). \n\nLocation \nVICTORIA & ALBERT MUSEUM, LONDON, INV. NO. 482-1882 \nPanel, 60 x 71cm 23 5/8 x 28in \nSigned and dated lower right W. V. Velde 1658, the last figure is doubtful (angular letters) Painted substantially by the Younger for the Van de Velde studio, probably in 1658 \nThis is an example of the Younger's early work, when probably with some assistance, he was working under his father in producing pictures that were in effect his father's grisailles put into colours. The picture is technically very accurate in the drawing of the vessels, but the composition follows the stereotyped pattern of the Elder's work. \n\nProvenance \nThis picture was received in 1882 as ; with other pictures from John Jones by Kensington Museum, later to be known Victoria & Albert Museum. \n\nReferences \nLong, B.S., Catalogue of the Jones Collection, pt 3; repr. pl. 37 \nde Groot, Hofstede, 1918, no. 208a \nKauffmann, <i>Victoriana and Rococo</i> Victoria & Albert Museum, London: \nCatalogue, 1882, no. 482, as by the Elder; [unclear reference- not in Elizabeth James Bibliography of Exhibitions History]\n1972, CM.

Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nRef : Parkinson, Ronald, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</U>.  Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nHistorical significance: Willem van de Velde II (1633-1707) was the son of Willem van de Velde I. Around 1648 Willem II moved to Weesp to study under Simon de Vlieger, whose sombre and atmospheric seascapes were a foil to the more prosaic realism of his father\u2019s work. In 1652 he was back in Amsterdam, and took up work in his father\u2019s studio. His earliest paintings,  inlcuding the V&A picture, were signed by van de Velde the elder as head of the studio.  Willem is celebrated for his exquisitely drawn ships, a careful regard for the placing of each vessel to create a satisfying composition and an atmosphere of serene tranquillity. 482-1882 may represent the vessels used for the fitting out with stores and men of a fleet of men-of-war laying perhaps in the Texel. The States yacht at right middleground is firing a salute to starboard as a ship's boat in the centre, pulls away from the yacht. A drawing for the same yacht, an unfinished quarter view, is in the Boymans-van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam, (MB1866/T434).", 
            "place": "", 
            "production_note": "This painting was formerly attributed to Willem van de Velde the elder (c. 1611-93) (Long, 1923) however, several authorities have convincingly attributed the picture to the son based on style.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Marine paintings present sea subjects with particular attention to ships and shipping. When marine painting emerged as a distinct genre, in the 17th-century Dutch Republic, the initial focus was on large, publicly commissioned history paintings commemorating naval engagements against the Spanish and important political and commercial events. The genre was largely developed by Hendrick Vroom and from the 1620s onwards a market developed for smaller marine paintings, by such artists as Porcellis, de Vlieger, van de Cappelle, and van de Velde the younger, whose interests lay primarily in the depiction of atmospheric effects and the behaviour of the sea in various conditions. The Anglo-Dutch Wars (1652\u201374) revived interest in publicly commissioned historical painting, and after both Willem van de Velde and his son were appointed as painters to Charles II, the market in marine painting moved to London. The early marine paintings of Turner emulated those of the earlier Dutch painters such as van de Cappelle and van de Velde the younger, but Turner's more dramatic vision inspired the next generation of marine artists, and he superseded van de Velde as their model. His influence is apparent in the work of many marine artists, such as Edward William Cooke (1811\u201380), and Clarkson Stanfield (1793\u20131867), who continued to flourish in England throughout the 19th century.",
