It is a highly finished design for a large needlework panel, but now it is considered to be a great watercolour in its own right.

It is a highly finished design for a large needlework panel; Burne-Jones made several such designs, often carried out, like this example, by Frances Graham.  At the time of this painting, Burne-Jones was also working on his famous King Cophetua and the Beggar-maid.  The model for the beggar-maid was Frances Graham, and Burne-Jones had fallen in love with her.  In 1883, to his great dismay, she announced her impending marriage, and he painted in anenomes - the symbol of rejected love and death -  around the figure of the beggar-maid.  Here too, in Love, the colours of anemones predominate, rich scarlets and purples against cobalt and turquoise.  Just as Dante lost his beloved Beatrice, and Rossetti his Lizzie, so Burne-Jones, on more than one occasion, lost his heart to those like Frances who were unable to return his love.",
