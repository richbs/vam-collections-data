People born in the year of the snake have great wisdom, are very determined and hate to fail at anything. As profound thinkers, they prefer to rely on their own intellect rather than the judgement of others. They rarely have to worry about money - they're usually rich! Snake men are handsome, women beautiful: but they can both be vain. They also have the annoying habit of over-doing things - especially helping others.

The company creates corporate identities, brochures and a variety of other materials including posters, conference and exhibition packages, signage, invitations and tickets - aswell as specialising in typography. \n\nEvery year since 1988 Lawrence Cheung has produced a limited edition Chinese New Year's greeting for its clients and friends.\n\nThe Chinese animal signs are a 12-year cycle used for dating the years. They represent a cyclical concept of time, rather than the Western linear concept. The Chinese Lunar Calendar is based on the cycles of the moon and is constructed differently to the Western solar calendar. In the Chinese calendar, the beginning of the year falls somewhere between late January and early February. The Chinese have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year.",
