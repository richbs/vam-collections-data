It has often been suggested that the chair was designed by the Austrian architect and designer Josef Hoffmann (1870\u20131956), whose early work was in a curvilinear Art Nouveau style. There is no direct evidence for this, however, and it may well have been designed by someone working in the company\u2019s in-house studio. By 1905, Gebr\u00fcder Thonet were producing hundreds of designs for domestic use and for restaurants, shops and offices in their famous bentwood technique using solid turned sections of beechwood steamed and then bent into shape.",
