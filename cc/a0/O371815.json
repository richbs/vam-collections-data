It is a Windsor chair, characterised by its construction, with a single solid piece of wood forming the seat, with legs and arm-supports dowelled into it. The seat is carved in a saddle-shape for comfort, in common with many other Windsor chairs. Their name probably derives from the town of Windsor in Berkshire, which is situated on the river Thames and was ideally located as a distribution point for chairs made in the Thames Valley region, where many chairs of this type were made.  \n\nOn loan to Mompesson House.",
