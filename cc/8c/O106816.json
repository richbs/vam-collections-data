It is signed in embroidered stitches by its maker, Maria Papadopoula, and dated 1757.\n\nThe top pleated edge is intended to be worn not around the waist but higher, under the arms, held in place by shoulder straps.  It is constructed from five loom-widths of a mixed cotton and linen. The opening down the middle of the central width would have allowed room for it to be put on, and also facilitated breast-feeding.",
