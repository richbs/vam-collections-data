This particular specimen was presented by the British Museum to the V&amp;A.\n\nBoth sides contain elements of the museum\u2019s past, present and future. \n\nThe obverse shows a pair of open hands in the centre of the Great Court\u2019s ceiling that covers the original library\u2019s Reading room. The hands\u2019 gesture symbolises both openness and accessibility.  Cupped in the form of an open book, the hands also represent having knowledge at one\u2019s fingertips.  The surroundings of the Great Court\u2019s glass roof evoke light and enlightenment. This architectural feature, both iconic and contemporary, expresses a sense of expansiveness, stretching across the  museum and connecting its ten departments. \nThe outer blue ring bears the text \u2018The British Museum 1753 A World of Understanding\u2019 referring to the Museum\u2019s mission. The blue and white enamel colours on silver are a nod to the sky that can be seen through the domed roof. \n\nThe international remit of the British Museum's collection is symbolised by the central motif of a head bearing a globe the reverse. \nRadiating around the field are ten animals, each symbolising one of the British Museum\u2019s  ten departments, namely Coins and Medals (an owl), Conservation and Scientific Research (a snake),  Portable Antiquities and Treasure (a mole), Ancient Egypt and Sudan (a sphinx), Prints and Drawings (a  rhinoceros), Prehistory and Europe (a deer), Asia (a monkey), Africa, Oceania and the Americas (a  leopard), Middle East (a lion) and Greece and Rome (a horse). \nThe fine draughtsmanship, symbolism and clarity of the design (which notably recalls one of the finest designs for a Napoleonic medal, Napoleon on Elba, by Louis Lafitte) exemplify Powell\u2019s learned medallic practice.",
