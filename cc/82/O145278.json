Not only did they succeed like others in elaborating richly decorated surfaces, but they were unique in making bas-relief and even sculpture out of threads.\n\nOvercoming the neglect and the oblivion in which these incomparable works have fallen, Sheila Hicks has retrieved and assimilated their tradition while marrying it felicitously to others such as those of Persia and India. Far from copying them, she has renewed them by original discoveries which appropriate them to the raw materials, the techniques and the aspirations of our time.\n\nHer wall hangings have the living warmth and the thickness of fleece; their complex structure and their shadows seem to chisel out perspectives attributable only to dream palaces; they offer the mellow depth, radiance and mystery of the starry sky.\n\nNothing better than this art could provide altogether the adornment and the antidote for the functional, utilitarian architecture in which we are sentenced to dwell. It enlivens it with the dense, patient work of human hands and the inventive charms of a creative mind constantly stimulated by experiencing the gamut of those new materials which modern industry supplies, experiencing the gamut of those new materials which modern industry supplies, while remaining faithful to the immemorial rules of the most ancient perhaps of all the arts of civilisation.\n\nClaude L\u00e9vi-Strauss\n----------------------------------------\n\nTEXT ON T.504:2-1998\n----------------------------------------\nSheila Hicks:\n1937 born in Hastings, Nebraska. 1953-59, studies at Yale University with Josef Albers and George Kubler.
