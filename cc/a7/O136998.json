Each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  \n\nIn the 1860s, Norwegian silversmiths working in the main towns started to make fashionable jewellery in traditional Norwegian styles.  Jacob Tostrup was one of the leaders of this movement.  This brooch is among the first examples of this new style.  Although it uses traditional techniques and patterns, it is much too fragile to have been worn with traditional costume.  It was probably intended as a souvenir of typical Norwegian craftsmanship.\n\nIt is marked on the back with full silver marks for the period.  13 \u00bc L stands for 828 standard silver, and was used before around 1880.  TOSTRUP 1867 is the maker\u2019s mark and date of manufacture.  CHRISTIANIA is the old name for Oslo, the Norwegian capital.  It was renamed Oslo in 1925.  In the acquisitions register, this brooch is described as bought from Mr Tostrup for \u00a31 8s 6d at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
