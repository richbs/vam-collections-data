The new stretcher is inscribed in ink, perhaps copying an inscription on the original canvas, <i>Church Porch evening J. Constable R.A.</i>\n\nThe moon is rising, or the sun is setting, behind the porch.  Three figures are on the path leading to the porch.  \nA view of the same section of the church, from a viewpoint slightly further to the left, is No. 1245, now in the Tate Gallery, which is believed to have been the picture 'A Churchyard' exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1810, and is almost certainly the picture 'A Church porch' exhibited at the British Institution in 1811 (Davies, pp. 26-27).  The latter showed \"the stillness of a summer afternoon\", and the view held by Davies that No. 99 [138-1888] is \"vaguely connected\" with his No. 1245 is to be preferred to that of Shirley (L. ed. S., p. 37) that it is a study for the latter.  Either consideration leads more or less decisively to a dating of <i>c.</i>1810, which is also arrived at by Holmes, p. 242.\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
