He drew them during a Midland Railway board meeting in Derby. The two sketches show the side elevation and cross section. They are mounted with a telegram that was sent to Paxton's wife confirming acceptance of the plan.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWithin a week, the sketches were converted into proper drawings and presented to the Commission board.  Paxton's design was accepted by the Royal Commissioners for the Great Exhibition partly because all the other architects' schemes had been rejected. Time was running out and Paxton's idea of building a glass and iron structure from prefabricated sections meant that the building could be constructed quickly.\n\nPlace\nPaxton had successfully designed and built glass houses at Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, where he had been head gardener. These sketches for a building made of glass and iron were based on the lines of the Lily House at Chatsworth. Paxton used many of the same principles for both buildings. The Crystal Palace was the first structure to use iron on such a large scale.",
