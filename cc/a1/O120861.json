By the 1750s the skills necessary to re-shape panels of lacquer to create more fashionable objects were finely developed, particularly in Paris. The production of such pieces was controlled by the marchands-merciers who were dealers in luxury goods. These merchants controlled the market in luxury materials such as lacquer and porcelain, which were used in highly inventive ways to create new, highly luxurious pieces of furniture. This piece was probably made under the direction of the marchand mercier Martin Hennebert.",
