The Bedford Master took his name from two outstanding manuscripts made for John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford. John of Lancaster was the brother of Henry V (ruled 1413-22), who won the great victory of Agincourt against the French in 1415. The Bedford Master's style was widely practised in Paris. The Dunois Master appears to have adopted his painting style and models most closely.\n\nThe miniature on this leaf comes from a Book of Hours, a type of prayer book used by lay people. It shows scenes from the life of St Stephen, who was the earliest Christian martyr. His life is described in the New Testament book of the Acts of the Apostles. He was accused of speaking blasphemous words against the God of Moses and was taken in front of the Sanhedrin (the highest court of justice and supreme council in ancient Jerusalem). He was stoned to death.",
