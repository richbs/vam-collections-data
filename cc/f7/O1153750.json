Richard Edgcumbe, Lord William Russell and Lady Caroline Spencer as characters from Philip Massinger's <i>The Guardian</i>. Standing against a backdrop resembling an eighteenth century drawing room with a long, upholstered seat with 'scroll' arms and a swathe of a large heavy curtain visible in the top left hand corner.\nRepresenting the character of Young Clackitt the Hon.R.Edgcumbe is dressed in a dark, three quarter length jacket decorated with lavish embroidery at the front fastenings and wrists, which he wears over a pale, patterned waistcoat. His close fitting breeches appear to be made from a similar fabric with decoration and fastenings at the knee. In his right hand he carries a feather trimmed hat and the pommel of a sword, decorated with ribbon is visible at his left hip. Lord William Rufus stands in the centre dressed in a much plainer and more sober jacket and breeches but with one hand tucked into an equally elaborate waistcoat. Both gentlemen are dressed in dark shoes with large metallic buckles. On the far right of the scene is Lady Caroline Spencer see is dressed in an full length gown with gathered or tassel effect hem and fitted, front lacing, bodice. The elbow length sleeves are trimmed with lace, as are her elbow length gloves. The low neckline of the dress is trimmed with lace and decorated at the centre front with a spray of flowers. She also wears a delicate lace fiche folded in to the top of her bodice. The bodice ends in a deep 'V', trimmed with two hanging tassels and two metallic pedants, these rest against the skirt of the dress which is decorated with a repeat pattern of four petalled flowers. Both men wear wigs with side curls and Lady Caroline's hair is dressed in a high, piled, style on top of which she wears a wide hat, the base of which is trimmed with a circle of feathers and flowers. In her right hand she carries a closed fan whilst her left is grasping the door handle.",

            "public_access_description": "A full length, greyscale mezzotint of the Hon. Richard Edgcumbe, Lord William Russell and Lady Caroline Spencer as characters from Philip Massinger's The Guardian. \nStanding against a backdrop resembling an eighteenth century drawing room with a long, upholstered seat with 'scroll' arms and a swathe of a large heavy curtain visible in the top left hand corner.\nRepresenting the character of Young Clackitt the Hon.R.Edgcumbe is dressed in a dark, three quarter length jacket decorated with lavish embroidery at the front fastenings and wrists, which he wears over a pale, patterned waistcoat. His close fitting breeches appear to be made from a similar fabric with decoration and fastenings at the knee. In his right hand he carries a feather trimmed hat and the pommel of a sword, decorated with ribbon is visible at his left hip. Lord William Rufus stands in the centre dressed in a much plainer and more sober jacket and breeches but with one hand tucked into an equally elaborate waistcoat. Both gentlemen are dressed in dark shoes with large metallic buckles. On the far right of the scene is Lady Caroline Spencer see is dressed in an full length gown with gathered or tassel effect hem and fitted, front lacing, bodice. The elbow length sleeves are trimmed with lace, as are her elbow length gloves. The low neckline of the dress is trimmed with lace and decorated at the centre front with a spray of flowers. She also wears a delicate lace fiche folded in to the top of her bodice. The bodice ends in a deep 'V', trimmed with two hanging tassels and two metallic pedants, these rest against the skirt of the dress which is decorated with a repeat pattern of four petalled flowers. Both men wear wigs with side curls and Lady Caroline's hair is dressed in a high, piled, style on top of which she wears a wide hat, the base of which is trimmed with a circle of feathers and flowers. In her right hand she carries a closed fan whilst her left is grasping the door handle. \n\nThis image is Plate 3 of 3 in the 'Marlborough Theatricals'. The private theatre at Blenheim was opened in September 1787 and the actors were amateurs, mostly the immediate family and friends of the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough.\n\nHarry Beard Collection.",
