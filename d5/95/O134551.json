First exhibited at Royal Institution, Manchester, 1851; his address in the SBA catalogue 1854 was the School of Art, Warrington. Exhibited 31 works at the RA between 1858 and 1890, 10 at the BI 1861-67, 14 (including three watercolours) at the SBA 1854-81/2, and 17 elsewhere. Subjects principally genre and landscape. His 1862 'Ordered on Foreign Service' (RA 1864) was engraved by CA Tomkins 1865; that, and his etching of his 1868 project for the Royal Horticultural Society's buildings, are in the V&A collections. Taught at the Government School of Design, South Kensington, from before 1866 to 1875; elected Member of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts 1881. Ruskin found his 'Sunday Afternoon' (RA 1875) 'extremely delightful'. He does not seem to have been related to the Pre-Raphaelite painter James Collinson. \n\nLIT:  H Ottley <i>A Biographical and Critical Dictionary</i> 1866; J Ruskin <i>Academy Notes</i> 1875 Cook and Wedderburn 14, 1904 \n\n<b>Buildings in the Grounds of the South Kensington Museum in 1862</b> \n117-1865 Neg 78947 \nCanvas, 35.6 x 59.1 cm (14 x 23\u00bc ins) \nPurchased 1865 \n\nThe view is of the front of Brompton Park House seen from the east, on the site of the present main block of the museum (see J Physick <i>The Victoria and Albert Museum: the history of its building</i> 1982, pp22-3, 26, 97). The dome prominently featured behind the museum buildings is of the temporary structure of the 1862 International Exhibition. The figures in the foreground are probably students and teachers of the South Kensington School of Art rather than the staffage of pictorial convention. \n\nA watercolour by Anthony Stannus of 1863 showing the facade from the west is also in the V&A collections (AL2812, repr in colour by Phvsick as pl II facing p32). Plans for redeveloping the site were being made in the early 1860s, and these views may have been painted as records of the old buildings. A replica of the present work, with minor variations in detail, signed and dated 1865, was recorded in a London private collection in 1933.\"",
