Educated St John's College, Cambridge (BA 1810) and was ordained. Designed plates for his father's History of Shrewsbury 1825, and published 'Etchings of Ancient Buildings in Shrewsbury' (1820-1), and other volumes of etchings 1826, 1842, 1855. Travelled in Europe, and in Italy 1840. Exhibited eight works at the BI 1839-53 and four (including a watercolour) at the SBA 1837-40; subjects principally landscapes, also biblical subjects. Died Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, 15 July 1863. \nLIT: Gentleman's Magazine 1863, pp244, 380 \n\nLandscape Composition (attributed to E P OWEN) \nD16 Neg 58213 \n\nCanvas, 64.7 X 90.1 cm (251/2 X 351/2 ins) \nDyce Bequest 1869 \n\nAttributed to Richard Wilson in the 1874 catalogue of the Dyce collection and the 1907 Catalogue of Oil Paintings, the Departmental files show that in 1914 M H Grant, the writer on landscape painting, believed it to be by Sir George Beaumont, but that in 1931 Basil Long finally attributed it to Owen. There seems to be no evidence to either support or challenge this attribution to Owen (about whom very little is known), however it is retained here.  \nThe location of the scene is unknown and may well have been invented; the combination of the ?abbey and the ruins behind, the mountain, and the trees on the rocks on the right, seems very unusual. The clothes worn by the man on the right date from the early 19th century. The rather naive composition is particularly notable for the engaging depiction of the artist and his ?patron with his umbrella. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
