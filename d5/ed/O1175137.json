It shows a full length image of a woman in a costume loosely inspired by Russian 'folk dress'. Her white sleeveless dress is made up of several layers of fabric. The outer layer has a wide collar which finishes in a wide belt striped in gold and orange with a central triangular device, from which a further length of white fabric striped with gold and orange is suspended. This outer tunic finishes just behind her knees, and is decorated with bands of gold and swirling gold motifs. It has a vivid orange lining. Beneath this she wears a tight ankle length white tunic. She also wears white elbow length gloves and an ornate hat with a tight fitting orange and gold base, and wide, behind which is an upstanding white panel decorated in gold and from which a long white veil is suspended. The design is signed Comelli and dated 1920. \n\nThe borders of design are bound in a transparent gauze which is pinned in place. A scrap of gold lame is pinned to this gauze (at the front of the design) whilst a hand drawn chart detailing the measurements of the actress for whom the costume was intended is pinned to the rear.",

The story follows Sybil, a singer from Paris, who arrives in Russia and meets an officer, Petrov who falls in love with her. There follows a case of mistaken identity in which Sybil is thought to be the wife of the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke goes along with this deception and his wife pretends to be Sybil. The Grand Duchess then becomes attracted to Petrov and the Grand Duke tries to attack him. After much confusion everyone's true identity is revealed and the play ends happily.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis production of the play opened at Daly's Theatre, London on 19th February 1921.",
