They were known as 'shopkeepers' bills'. They were generally etched, that is the design was drawn onto a coated metal plate with an etching needle and then etched into the plate by immersion in an acid bath. The plate was then coated with ink, wiped (so that only the ink in the grooves was retained) and then pressed onto a sheet of paper to transfer the image.\n\nPeople\nHenry Copland (died 1753)  was trained to engrave in goldsmiths' workshops, and was therefore able to engrave on gold or silver objects as well as on metal printing plates. During the Rococo period there was a close relationship between the style of trade cards and also pattern books and decorative art objects, such as furniture and metalwork. Copland is seen as particularly influential in the development of a distinctly English Rococo style, and this trade card is one of the earliest examples.  The form of the cartouche recurs in many trade cards and examples of engraved metalwork in the 1740s.\n\n There are two forms of this trade card, which differ in the description of Benjamin Rackstrow's profession. The other card describes him as a 'Cabinet and Picture-frame maker'. Here Rackstrow is described as a sculptor of portrait busts, as well as a creator of plaster decoration for interiors and lead sculptures for gardens.",
