Gold rigging, gilt copper alloy top masts, pennons and poop lantern provide further adornments. The rails are enamelled, and five blue-enamelled sailors with broad-brimmed gold hats can be seen climbing up the rigging. A female figurehead is positioned at the prow, and a small pearl is set at the tip of the mizzen mast. The body of the ship is hollow, chequered holes on the deck suggesting shutters.

They commissioned and collected such objects, displaying them according to the type of material in small rooms set aside for the purpose. This ivory ship, made more precious by the addition of gold, diamonds and enamels, is a rare example of a highly-wrought object made of an imported natural material that would have appealed to such collectors.\nNothing is known of the circumstances in which this model was commissioned. A similar, though larger, ivory and gold model frigate is preserved in the collections of the Dukes of Saxony, in the Green Vault at Dresden. The Dresden example (dated 1620) was made by Jacob Zeller for the Prince Elector Christian II of Saxony. The similarities between the two ships suggest the one now in the V&amp;A may also have originated at Christian's court.",

A similar, though larger, ivory and gold model frigate is preserved in the collections of the Dukes of Saxony, in the Green Vault at Dresden. The Dresden example (dated 1620) was made by Jacob Zeller for the Prince Elector Christian II of Saxony. The similarities between the two ships suggest the one now in the V&amp;A may also have originated at Christian's court.\n\nGiven by Dr W.L. Hildburgh F.S.A. in 1956; formerly on loan from Dr Hildburgh.",
