This example is fitted with candle arms and glass pendants to increase the effect of light.  It combines the use of pollard oak, a native wood, with exotic and Classical decoration, including a Greek key design and inverted lotus leaves.\n\nTime\nImposing candle stands were fashionable in Regency Britain. The Prince Regent, later George IV, included them among the lavish furnishing of his London home, Carlton House, as shown in views of the interiors published by W.H. Pyne in The History of Royal Residences (1819). In 1812, Rudolph Ackermann's Repository of the Arts, a fashionable periodical, illustrated a stand similar to this torch\u00e8re, but with a simpler light fitting. George Bullock's stock in 1819 included several elaborate examples.\n\nPeople\nGeorge Bullock (1782/3-1818) was an innovative designer who moved to London in 1812 from Liverpool, where he had already established a business as a sculptor, modeller and cabinet-maker. His house-furnishing business included commissions from the novelist and antiquary Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford in the Scottish Borders, and from M.R. Boulton of Great Tew Park, Oxfordshire. Bullock's most important commission for furniture was from the British Government for the house on the South Atlantic island of St Helena to which Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled after Waterloo. This torch\u00e8re shows Bullock's innovative use of native woods, and the solid, sculptural quality of his designs.",

Carlos van Zeller inherited the Bullock furniture in 1914 from his parents and married Maria de Lancastre, granddaughter of the Duke of Palmella's daughter, Teresa, and the Count of Alcacovas.
