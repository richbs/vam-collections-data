            "public_access_description": "This object is a smoking set, its light weight and moderate size made it ideal to take on excursions and picnics. Tobacco smoking arrived in Japan around 1549 due to the arrival of Portuguese merchants on Japanese shores. By the late 16th century the Spanish were selling tobacco within Japan from tobacco farms they had developed in the Philippines. Purchasing tobacco was expensive and the substance was used mostly for medicinal purposes. By the beginning of the 17th century pipe smoking had become fashionable and by the second half of the 18th century smoking sets with drawers were made. The compactness and neat functionality of the box is an excellent example of Japanese craftsmanship and design as all the drawers would have contained various implements whilst the interior of the box holds a brazier.  \n\nAutumn grasses, as represented on the box, were a popular cultural motif which replicated the pulse of the seasons and the transience of life on the cusp of change. This is combined with the representation of deer, a motif of autumn. This close-up and naturalistically rendered compositional style developed during the 17th century. Since the Fujiwara period (897-1185), autumnal scenes of stags grazing or standing amongst grasses and maple trees was a popular motif, particularly in Kyoto. Such imagery had many poetic connotations for loneliness and tranquillity. The detailing of the deer is stylized and simplified while mimicking the graceful forms of the animals. By the early Edo period it was common practice for lacquer artists to depict animals in motion in an effort to display their skill.",
