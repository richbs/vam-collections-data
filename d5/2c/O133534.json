            "public_access_description": "This costume was designed by Oliver Messel for a Highlander in the scene 'Piccadilly 1830' in C B Cochran's 1930 Revue.  It was originally worn by the great Russian dancer Serge Lifar, who, from photographs, cut a very dashing, if still very Russian, figure.  \n\nIn 1931, the costume was remade or adapted for Messel to wear at a party in Paris given by Daisy Fellowes, the great society hostess and editor-in-chief of French Harper's Bazaar. Messel's aim was to fool the guests into thinking that he was Lifar, complete with heavy stage make-up, although whether he succeeded is not recorded.    \n\nFancy dress costumes were a feature of high society life for centuries, even into the 1920s and 1930s.  Everyone vied with each other to wear the most striking, creative or simply expensive costume, and several times Messel wore costumes, or remakes of costumes, that he had designed for the theatre. \n\nThe costume is an admirable reduction of full Highland dress, with feathered military headdress.  The 'tartan' in subtle grey and yellow on cream ground, is light and fresh, while the jacket is reduced to bold black and white, with mere indications of frogging (the complex braiding across the front openings), heavy cotton fringing for the epaulettes and the crisp white edging and cuffs.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",
