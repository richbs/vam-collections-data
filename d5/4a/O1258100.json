Associations with the sea inspired these designs by Paddy Killer (1949\u2013) who graduated in Fashion and Textiles (Embroidery) from Birmingham Polytechnic in 1971 and worked as an embroidery designer in major couture houses in London and Montreal. In 1973, she founded her studio in Canada and in 1981 on return to Britain. Killer exhibits with The \u2018 62 Group founded in 1962 to encourage experimental embroidery, use of mixed media, and people to broaden their attitudes to the craft. These designs were part of a private commission in 1993 that included the Waves counterpane and a bed with headboard carved in a wave-like curl covered in bleached and polished fish skin by the London-based designer Cebuan de la Rochette. (pl.164) Free-machine embroidery or 'drawing with the needle' on the Waves counterpane depicts a vermicelli pattern for which Killer is famous. Stars were featuring in her work at the time of, and were requested for, the commission.  The largest drawing is the design for the counterpane and is for machine embroidery that is complemented by drawing, painting and marbling on Antung, Chinese, silk that comprise the actual counterpane.",
