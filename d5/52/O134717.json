He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1847 and 1884. \n\nPaintings of peasant subjects were popular in the later 19th century with an urban audience nostalgic for a largely fictional rural idyll. <u>Peasant Woman of Brittany</u> (1861) is a generalised representation of a pretty young woman rather than a portrait of an individual. The embossed cross on the cover of the book she holds shows it to be a Bible, which adds a moral dimension to the composition - this young woman's beauty is matched by her virtue. \n\nAlthough this painting was not exhibited at the Royal Academy, the following year, 1862, Hughes exhibited a painting entitled <u>An English artist collecting costumes in Brittany</u>. \n\nThis painting was bequeathed to the V&A by Joshua Dixon (1811-1885), a successful cotton merchant. In addition to oil paintings, watercolours and drawings, his collection also included engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture. Born in Dalston, north-east London, Dixon died on his estate of Winslade Park in Somerset and left his collection initially to the Bethnal Green Museum, which is part of the V&A, for the 'benefit of the people of East London.'",
