Two large rectangles of fabric pleated tightly into diamonds at the shoulder edge, and then sewn together at opposite points of pleated diamonds. Outer edge of drape shorter, longest part of drape extends almost full length. No visible fastenings or means of securing while being worn, presumably pleated pieces sat on bared shoulder of wearer.\n[Dress] Miniature evening dress in cream coloured silk jersey, draped Grecian goddess style. Lining of dress is a slender cream silk jersey sheath with fitted bodice and slim skirt, cut with a single shoulder and armhole, leaving wearer's right shoulder bare. Outer drapery of jersey attached to lining at waist and main seams of bodice. Side metal zipper on wearer's left.\n\nThe pleating of the jersey is denser on the bodice back, along the upper edge of bodice (where it extends beyond the shoulder seam into a 100-cm long flowing drape, and around the waist. Bust of bodice is less densely gathered. Floor length skirt falls straight from slightly dropped, assymetrically contoured waist seam in straight Grecian folds.",

She made it into flawlessly draped Grecian goddess evening gowns such as this, which became her signature style.\n\nThese scaled copies use the same fabrics and show the same superb craftsmanship as their full size equivalents. We have four of these miniature dresses which the donor acquired from the archive of the wholesale house of Dorville. Wholesalers would buy the copyrights to couture dresses so that they could sell modified ready-to-wear copies. It is thought that these quarter-scale dresses were sold alongside the patterns to show how the dress looked when made up.",

Her sense of proportion and her taste for strong dramatic statements soon manifested themselves in her designs. After 1939, she started working as Madame Gr\u00e8s. The Gr\u00e8s signature is most clearly seen in her Grecian gowns of pleated jersey. Her column dresses of silk jersey, a challenging fabric to work with, are immaculately pleated, draped, and controlled with a masterly hand. She continued to work in jersey throughout her career, making it her signature fabric. In addition to this example, we have at least three full-size examples of her jersey dresses, including T.250-1974 and T.246-1974, which are both white jersey, the former from 1968, the latter a 1971 Gr\u00e8s replica of a 1955 design. The third dress is a 1977 yellow jersey dress, item T.34-2979. \n\nAccording to donor, these dresses were bought with the toiles by wholesale companies who copied and adapted these dresses for the ready to wear market. During the post-war fabric shortages, items such as this would have provided a way to show a wholesale-purchaser what the dress looked like without the expense of making a full-size dress with all the attendant usage of fabric. The ready to wear houses and representatives would buy couture models to reproduce and copy.\n\nAn early theory was that the dress was intended for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode travelling exhibitions (of 1944 and 1946),but didn't make the final cut. Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode was intended to show the world that Paris still had mastery over dressmaking and couture, and featured quarter-scale dolls dressed in the very best miniature garments that Paris could procure.  A connection is unlikely, as while the dress demonstrates superb couture craftsmanship and perfect miniature scaling, it does not appear it would fit one of the very small-waisted Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode mannikins, making the theory unpalpable. The Maryland Museum, who own the 1946 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode mannikins, have confirmed that these objects are not connected to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode. \n\nWhat is clear is that they are amazingly well-made, beautifully hand-finished, exact scale models of couture dresses, using the same fabrics as their full size equivalents.",
