He moved to Paris in about 1851 as overseer for a stove and tile firm, and in 1855 opened his own studio and, later his own retail shop, with his brother Xavier. He invited many well-known painters of the day to design decorations and also to paint some wares directly.  He specialised in researching glazes and colours, inspired by the ceramics of the Middle and Far East. In 1887, only three years before his death, he became Director of the National Manufactory at S\u00e8vres.",
