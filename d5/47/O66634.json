The incarnation- a human form with boar's head- stands with raised left foot resting on a large lotus flower, beneath which sit a naga and nagini (male and female divinities) with their coils entwined.  His right foot is placed on the back of a tortoise. Of the four arms, one rests on the right hip, the other three hold the symbols of Vishnu, the mace, conch shell and disc. The left elbow supports the earth goddess, who sits gazing at the Boar with hands pressed together in the <i>anjali</i> (adoration) pose. Above the main figure is an inverted lotus-leaf, placed umbrella-wise, indicating that the Boar has  just risen from the depths of the ocean.   Flanking the lotus-halo behind the head are the seated figures of the two other members of the Hindu Trinity, Bhahma (left) and Siva (right). Midway, two celestial worshippers are seated on lotuses and at the bottom are two <i>ayudapurushas</i> (personified symbols), one holding the conch-shell (left), the other the disc of Vishnu (right).\n\nThe central figure of Vahara is carved in the round with the back slab cut completely away from behind and round him, while the surrounding figures are carved in high relief against the sides of the slab.  This has a plain rectangular base which projects forwards under the central figure. It rises to a semi-circular cresting with incised flame motifs emanating from the god's circular nimbus.",

This creation myth is perhaps rooted in a Vedic memory of a Great Flood; certainly Varaha is amongst the oldest of the Visnu avataras and among the first to be celebrated and worshipped in monumental sculptures, as seen at Eran and Udayagiri, both early Gupta-period sites in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nVaraha stands with raised left foot resting on a large lotus flower, beneath which sit a naga and nagini, male and female snake divinities. The right foot is placed on the back of a tortoise, emblematic of the Universe. Of the four arms, one rests on the right hip, the other three hold the symbols of Visnu, the mace (gada), conch shell (sangka) and discus (cakra). On his left elbow Varaha supports the diminutive figure of the earth goddess who gazes at him with hands pressed together in adoration (anjali) and in acknowledgement of her deliverance. Above Varaha\u2019s boar-head is an inverted lotus-leaf, serving both as an honorific umbrella and as an indication of their emergence from the depths of the ocean. Flanking the lotus-halo are the seated figures of Brahma (left) and Siva (right). Midway, two worshippers are seated on lotuses and at the bottom are personifications (ayudapurushas) of Visnu\u2019s conch and discus attributes.",
