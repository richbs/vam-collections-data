They married in 1672, after the death of Elizabeth's first husband in 1669 and John's wife in 1671.  Both were determined and ruthless characters. The Duke had been made Secretary of State for Scotland in 1661 and he was a key member of the 'Cabal', Charles II's inner cabinet. Soon after their marriage Elizabeth began to modernise Ham House, which she had inherited from her father, the 1st Earl of Dysart.  It was highly praised by the diarist John Evelyn, who in 1678 described the house as 'furnished like a Great Prince's'. After the Duke's death in 1682, the Duchess fell deeply into debt and died at Ham in 1698.\n\nThis silver-gilt medal is made by the engraver and medallist John Roettiers (1631-1703), who was the son of Philip Roettiers (1596-1669), a goldsmith and medallist in Antwerp.\n\nCharles II invited the Roettiers brothers John, Joseph and subsequently their third brother Philip to work for the British Royal Mint, where they produced many important medals.",
