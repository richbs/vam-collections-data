            "physical_description": "The top is veneered with an ebony ground, divided into nine primary compartments by broad lines of strapwork in brazilwood (pernambuco), outlined in fine ivory stringing. The central pictorial panels have secondary scenes below and to the left and right, while an armorial cartouche fills the area above. Large areas of scrolling acanthus marquetry fill the space between the pictorial areas and the composition is finished in the corners with further small figure scenes. The marquetry, of European and exotic hardwoods, is supplemented with stained horn, ivory and pewter details. The acanthus areas are embellished with weapons, birds, animals, putti and dwarfs. \n\nThe central subject of a galley containing men firing guns, sailing away from a port city, is based on a print published in Florence in 1608.  It is one of a series of etchings by Remigio Cantagallina after Giulio Parigi, published as a record of a mock-battle held on the River Arno as part of the celebrations for the wedding of Cosimo II de' Medici and Maria Magdalena of Austria.  The specific print on which this table top is based depicts the ship of the army of Chalcis (the print is titled 'Capitana dell'armata di Colco').  The figures are slightly adapted in the table top to give them a more martial and more exotic.  Other elements of the marquetry design are also based on prints: the dwarf figures are based on the <i>Varie Figure Gobbi</i> by Jacques Callot, published in 1616.\n\nThe lower scenes on each table depict a mounted stag hunt while the remaining four scenes depict mounted warfare, one, on the second table, including a fortress defended by cannon. Some of the figures are turbaned and fight with scimitars while one carries a flag bearing three crescents. The figures in the top right corner of the first table and the top left of the second carry scrolls inscribed \u2018LVCIO  D\u2019LVCCI FECE\u2019. The figures in the other two top corners smoke long pipes. \n \nThe boxwood bases comprise four massive scrolling legs joined with scrolled x-form stretchers. The legs and stretchers are profusely carved with acanthus foliage, fruit and flowers while the deep friezes bear trophies of helmets, arms and trumpets. The bases have undergone restoration on a number of occasions with some sections of carving replaced and the structure reenforced with hidden metal straps. The tops have also been restored more than once and on both tables the arms of the Duke of Buccleuch, on ivory, have been inserted in place of the arms of the original owner.",

            "public_access_description": "This table is one of a group of six that are thought to relate to the wars between Venice and the Ottoman Empire in the Peloponnese in the 1680s-90s.  They seem to celebrate the Venetian conquest of the Morea (as the Peleponnese was then known) in 1685-88.  This is suggested by the subjects depicted in their marquetry tops: this table shows a gallery of warriors leaving a sea port, with smaller scenes depicting warfare between European and Ottoman troops.  Other table tops from the group depict Vienna and Nafplio (then called Napoli di Romania): two cities that were subject to sieges during the wars.  It is possible that the tables were commissioned by Francesco Morosini, the commander of the Venetian troops, who was responsible for the capture of Nafplio in 1686 and later became Doge of Venice.\n\nThis table and its pair, now in the National Museums of Scotland, are the only ones that seem to retain their original bases.  Vigorously carved in boxwood, these echo, in sculptural form, the scrolling acanthus motifs of the marquetry top, as well as the martial subject matter, reflected in carved military trophies.\n\nThe tops of the tables are all signed by either Antonio or Lucio De Lucci.  As yet, liittle is known about the De Lucci, but their workshop must have been significant.",

On acquisition W.6-2012 was lent to the NMS before arrival at the V&amp;A in November 2012, (RF. 2012/436) and both tables were displayed in the NMS from June 19th 2012 until October 22, 2012.\n\nThe tables were previously in the collection of Walter John Mantagu-Douglas-Scott, 8th Duke of Buccleuch and 10th Duke of Queensberry, KT, PC, GCVO, until they were sold as a pair at Christie's, London, on 11th March, 1971 (lot 53).  They were again sold at Christie's in London on 7th December 2006.\n\nThey are thought to have been acquired through Edward Holmes Baldock by Walter Francis Montagu-Douglas-Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch and 7th Duke of Queensberry (1806-84) in around 1830-40.  It is likely that the ivory cartouche bearing the arms of the Duke of Buccleuch was added or altered at this time. \n\nIt is possible that Baldock's supplier was an Italian dealer, Signor Gasparoni.  Gasparoni is documented as having bought up the entire contents of the Doge's Palace in 1833 or 1834, subsequently chartering a vessel to ship them to England.  He offered the furniture to several dealers, namely Colnaghi, Baldock and Town &amp; Emanuel.",
