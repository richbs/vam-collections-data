            "history_note": "This watercolour was attributed to John Webber when it was first acquired by the museum in the late 19th century.  It was thought to show a scene from Captain Cook\u2019s voyage.  It was only re-attributed to Julius Caesar Ibbetson in 1950:\n\n<i>The National Gallery of British Art, Victoria and Albert Museum, Part II, Catalogue of Water Colour Paintings by British Artists and Foreigners working in Great Britain</i>, 1908, p.382.  The watercolour was catalogued as: \u201cJohn Webber RA: \u2018An Incident in Captain Cook\u2019s Voyage\u2019 (In circulation).\u201d\n\n<i>Victoria and Albert Museum, Catalogue of Water Colour Paintings by British Artists and Foreigners working in Great Britain, Revised Edition</i>, 1927, p.569. The watercolour is catalogued as: \u201cJohn Webber RA: \u2018An Incident in Captain Cook\u2019s Voyage\u2019.  Reproduced in colour as Plate XIX. In B. Lubbock\u2019s \u2018Adventures by Sea from Art of the Old Time\u2019, 1925.\u201d\n\nReynolds, Graham: \u2018British Artists Abroad, 1. Captain Cook's Draughtsmen\u2019, in: <i>Geographical Magazine,</i> xix, no. 10, Feb. 1947, 457-466 (see page 466). Here it is illustrated as \u2018From original water-colour by Webber in the Victoria & Albert Museum\u2019.  It is described as \u201c\u2018An incident in Captain Cook\u2019s Voyages.\u2019 The coffin of a member of the crew (perhaps William Watman, the gunner) is brought ashore for burial while natives watch respectfully from a distance\u201d.  Reynolds comments in the text that it presumably shows the funeral of William Watman in Hawaii (Owhyhee).\n\nThe Dept. file for this watercolour (indexed under Ibbetson) shows that the museum was informed in 1950 by Rotha Mary Clay of the existence of a \u201cpen and wash sketch done on the spot\u201d (belonging to J. Stewart Nicoll), and of the oil painting by Ibbetson exhibited at the RA in 1789, no.188. The Landing of the remains of the Honourable Col. Cathcart for internment at Angere Point in the Island of Java, in the collection of Lord Cathcart.  The V&A's watercolour was observed to be \u201cclose to the original sketch, the figures being dispersed almost identically in all three versions\u201d.  \n\nThere is a press-cutting on the file of a letter from Rotha Mary Clay in C<i>ountry Life</i>, 14 Dec 1951:\n\u201cIBBETSON IN THE EAST INDIES.  Sir, - When I was writing my life of Julius Caesar Ibbetson, published by <i>Country Life</i> in 1948, I was unable to find his drawing or painting known to have been exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1789 under the title \u2018Landing the Remains of the Honble. Colonel Cathcart for Interment at Angus [sic] Point in the Isle of Java\u2019, which is mentioned in my chapter on Ibbetson\u2019s work in the East Indies.\n\nA reader, Mr. J. Stewart Nicoll, then drew my attention to a drawing in his possession \u2013 an outline sketch of the incident, made on the spot.  Next, Lord Cathcart told me that the finished picture was hanging in his home, after many years in store.  Then the intermediate stage came to light: a finished water-colour in the Victoria and Albert Museum, long hidden under an attribution to John Webber and twice published under the title of \u2018Incident in a Voyage of Captain Cook.\u2019  Lord Cathcart\u2019s painting, of which I send you a photograph, is now on view at the Winter Exhibition at Burlington House. \u2013 ROTHA MARY CLAY, Southampton, Bristol.\u201d",
