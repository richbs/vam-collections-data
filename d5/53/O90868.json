The chair back is set with four baluster-shaped spindles and has a decorative cresting rail; the seat is set on two lyre-shaped wooden frames with turned stretchers, above the metal mechanism for converting the chair into rocking mode (operated by two wooden handles).  The lower half of the chair has four legs, each of curved tear-drop shape with a voided centre, and linked in pairs at the side with a metal bar and meshed cogs: when the chair is lowered into the rocking position, these curved legs become the rockers.  The chair when in high chair mode is mounted on four metal wheels.  It has an adjustable tray which can be swung over to the back when not in use (or to lift a child in or out more easily), and a wooden foot rest.",

It has an adjustable tray that can be swung over to the back when not in use, or to lift a child in or out more easily. Manufacturers added feeding trays to the basic design of the high chair in the 19th century. Before this, an adult would push the high chair as close as possible to the edge of the table where the child\u2019s food was placed. The feeding tray serves several purposes: it restricts spillages to a small area, helps to hold the child more safely in the chair, and provides the child with a play surface.\n\nUnder the seat is a metal mechanism operated by two wooden handles, by which the chair can be converted into rocking mode. The four curved, teardrop-shaped legs are linked in pairs at the sides with a metal bar, and when the chair is lowered into the rocking position, these legs become the rockers.",
