'Buster and the Musical Avolos' were a xylophone playing comedy act which was popular in British variety theatre in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The act was also successful in the USA in the 1920s.\n\nBuster's real name was Charles Wincott and his stage name came from his similarity to the famous silent film star, Buster Keaton. Charles Wincott came from a theatrical family. His mother Lily was a high wire artist and Renee Houston was a cousin.",
