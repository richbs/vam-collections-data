Precious bindings such as this were reserved for the liturgical manuscripts used in services.Made of gold or silver, their decoration usually included the figure of Christ or the Crucifixion and the Evangelists, the whole often lavishly encrusted with gems.\n\nWhile the enamels and outer border are probably contemporary with the manuscript, the seated figure of Christ and the surrounding strips of stamped work are likely to be later in date, perhaps twelfth-century. Few of the larger stones are original as they differ considerably from those described in a fourteenth-century note on the first page of the book.There has bee 19th century restoration to some of of the enamels.",

There is however very good reason to suppose that it was originally made for the ancient church of Notre Dame de Val\u00e8re, in the same canton, to which, according to an inscription, it belonged in the seventeenth-century. It afterwards became the property of the Cathedral of Sion in the valley below. In 1851 it was sold by the chapter to a dealer of Geneva, by whom it was sold to the Marquis de Ganay. Towards the end of the nineteenth-century, it passed into the Spitzer Collection, where various restorations were made and it was subsequently sold in Paris in 1893 when it was bought for the South Kensington Museum.\n\nThe enamels and the outer border are probably contemporary with the manuscript , but the seated figure of Christ and the surrounding strips can hardly be earlier than the twelfth century.Few of the larger stones can be original as they differ considerably from the those described in a fourteenth-century note on the first page of the book. The enamels were considerably restored in the nineteenth century.",
