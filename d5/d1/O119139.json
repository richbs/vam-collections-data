This border is itself richly painted with two narrow bands  filled with jewels and scroll patterns which sandwich a wider band of floral  decoration. The corners resulting from enclosing the circle in the square are also ornately painted. One of them has two half-human creatures fighting and the other has a creature, not easily identifiable, within it.",

They date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas). \n\nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves. This is one of the approximately 300 paintings they produced.",

They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the jatakas) and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is an example.",
