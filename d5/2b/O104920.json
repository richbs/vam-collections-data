The handles, on either side of the central drum, are of kingwood, square in cross section and curved to the same radius as the vessel.  They are attached to the body by a flat strip of silver at either end in the form of a T shaped section and secured by a pin.  The opposite end of the connecting strip is perpendicular to the curved wall.\n[Lid (from a tea service)] The lid is a curved strip of silver which follows the radius of the body.

In 1913 he established his own workshop in London.  From 1907, alongside running his own workshop, he taught at the Royal College of Art and later at the Central School.  He was the first silversmith to be appointed Principal of the Central School.\n\nThis service was published in Design for Today Vol.II, p.300, (London 1934) with the following commentary:\n\nDESIGN IN SILVER\n\nThe exhibition of English silversmiths' work at the Victoria and Albert Museum arranged by the Museum Authorities and the Council for Art and Industry, traces the development of design as shown in silver by examples of ancient and modern side by side.  The modern examples, with some exceptions, are of traditional form shorn of embellishement.  Here and there the designer has wavered, adding a little beading along the rim or a little engraving.\n\nWe illustrate a tea set designed by H.G. Murphy, of 58 Weymouth Street, which won the highest award at the Milan Exhibition of 1933.  The design may at first sight seem deliberately eccentric, but its shape is in fact dictated by the method of machine manufacture.  It cost \u00a320, which we understand is much less than a corresponding set manufactured by old methods would cost.  The lids lift off completely thus dispensing with hinges which must be hand-made.  The hand can be inserted for cleaning.  The handles are in kingwood.",

The modern examples, with some exceptions, are of traditional form shorn of embellishement.  Here and there the designer has wavered, adding a little beading along the rim or a little engraving.\n\nWe illustrate a tea set designed by H.G. Murphy, of 58 Weymouth Street, which won the highest award at the Milan Exhibition of 1933.  The design may at first sight seem deliberately eccentric, but its shape is in fact dictated by the method of machine manufacture.  It cost \u00a320, which we understand is much less than a corresponding set manufactured by old methods would cost.  The lids lift off completely thus dispensing with hinges which must be hand-made.  The hand can be inserted for cleaning.  The handles are in kingwood.\n\nGoldsmiths' Company Exhibition RF.2004/844",
