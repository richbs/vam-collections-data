            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 69, 73, 74\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"The turrets of the west end of the cathedral are seen beyond the chapter house.\n\nNotes on Nos. 105-108 [292-1888, 825-1888, 832-1888, 614-1888]\n\nNos. 105 [292-1888] and 106 [825-1888] were made during Constable's first visit to Salisbury, and Nos. 107 [832-1888] and 108 [614-1888] are so similar in technique, size and subject-matter that they were almost certainly drawn at the same time.  The zig-zag diagonal scribble which represents foliage is characteristic of Constable's pencil drawings at this period (see No. 114 [842-1888]).  On this visit Constable was the guest of his early mentor and patron, Dr. John Fisher, Bishop of Salisbury.  He told Farington (Greig, Vol. VII, p. 70) that he stayed three weeks.  It was probably at this time that he first met the Bishop's nephew, John Fisher, recently ordained deacon at Salisbury (Beckett, VI, pp. 11-14).\nIn his letter of 12 November 1811 to Miss Bicknell, Constable says, after the extract quoted in the note to No. 103 [135-1888], \"Salisbury has afforded some sketches.  Mr. Stothard admired them and one in particular (a general view of Sarum) he recommends me to paint, and of a respectable size\" (L. ed. S., pp. 47 and 48).  This in due course became one of Constable's exhibits at the Royal Academy in 1812, 'Salisbury: Morning'.  Other drawings made by the artist on the same visit are known, for example 'Old Sarum', dated 14 September 1811, in the Oldham Art Gallery and 'St. Anne's Gate, Salisbury', dated 17 September 1811, shown at Messrs.  Spink's, 1947.  A drawing of the west end of Salisbury Cathedral in the Beckett collection, of the same type as Nos. 106-108 [825-1888, 832-1888, 614-1888], and measuring 5 7/8 and 3 \u00bc ins., was No. 101 [128-1888] in the exhibition of the work of Constable in the Manchester City Art Gallery, 1956.  A drawing of the gardens of Sir Richard Colt Hoare at Stourhead, dated 2 October 1811, now in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, U.S.A., is reproduced from the collection of Sir Robert Witt in L. ed. S.

He visited Suffolk in the spring and paid his first visit to Salisbury in the autumn: this was probably the occasion of his first meeting with John Fisher, who was to become his closest friend.  His attachment to Maria Bicknell became known during this year, and he received her father's permission to write to her in October.'\n\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 69]",
