The bust of God the Father is shown in the upper left corner with hands clasped together surrounded by ribbon-like clouds. From his mouth emenate three rays of light from which the dove descends towards the Virgin. The cast is blurred and rubbed in some areas. A circular hole has been drilled at the top.",

This sequence is itself probably based on single leaf woodcuts of about 1430.\n\nThe iconographic scheme seen here seems to have been widely popular in Germany throughout the 15th century and the early 16th centuries, and was used as early as 1443 for the silver relief of The Annunciation on the right wing of a triptych in the church of Mariapfarr in the Salzburg district.",
