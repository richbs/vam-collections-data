This is interrupted by a repeated abstract leaf motif in white and red, which cuts into the border from alternate sides. The bowl of the dish is covered with an all-over textural design resembling fish-scales. There is a central red flower motif which forms the middle of a six pointed star filled with green 'fish-scales', or imbrication. A large hexagon delimits the decoration on the flat of the bowl's interior from its sides. Inside the hexagon is decorated with blue imbrication; outside it is in green and red. The exterior of the dish is mostly left white, with a simple ring of small blue flowers.",

The first Iznik tiles were produced, and a bright red was added to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, tiles of high quality were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds.\n\nBy the 1530s, small sprays of tulips and other recognisable flowers were a common motif, but from the 1550s these were replaced by compositions on a larger scale, as seen on this dish with a fish-scale ground.",
