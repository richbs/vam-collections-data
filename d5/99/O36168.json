It is tan; yellow; dark brown and white with a black plastic tail. The integral key protrudes from the left side of the body which houses the clockwork mechanism. When wound the horse rears; drops down and appears to run. At the same time the tail spins. \n*The mark is DAIYA in a diamond shape with MADE IN JAPAN. It is on the end of the horse. The rider is of moulded vinyl in the shape of a cowboy; pink; red; blue; yellow and black. \n*The whole is a smaller and possibly later version; of the Bucking Broncho; especially because of the crimped edges",
