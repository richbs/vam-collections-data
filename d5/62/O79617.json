Fine arts and scientific inventions and discoveries remained central display themes but each exhibition presented different aspects of manufacture. In 1872 one emphasis was on jewellery, including \u2018peasant jewellery\u2019. The Exhibition Commissioners arranged with the South Kensington Museum (later V&A) to make a collection of peasant jewellery from \u2018all parts of the world, which should become public property, for exhibition in the Museum after the close of the Exhibition\u2019. A letter was sent by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to British representatives overseas asking for their help in securing pieces of jewellery, particularly examples with \u2018a direct connection with the native instinctive art, which has been handed down by a long tradition\u2019. The outcome was considered to be \u2018most satisfactory \u2026 a collection of characteristic ornaments never before equalled was obtained\u2019. \n\nThese pins are part of this collection. Described as \u2018Moorish\u2019 at the time, the marks show that they were made in Morocco. The name tizerza\u00ef is a generic one for fibulae.  They were worn upside down, with the pins pointing upwards and the decorative heads hanging down, fastened at either side of the dress just below the shoulders.  They cost \u00a35 in 1872.",
