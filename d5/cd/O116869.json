It may have been in her home originally, or donated to her local church.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century, new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass, similar to painting onto a canvas. To produce the colours, metallic oxides were added to a glass frit mixture. The resulting colour range included delicate blues and greens, as we see here in this panel.\n\nMost of what we know of the life of St Mary of Egypt comes from the Golden Legend, a compilation of the stories of saints' lives written about 1260. However, Mary appears in church art as early as the 9th century. She was, it seems, a prostitute who lived in Alexandria in Egypt, probably in the 5th century. Mary joined a group of pilgrims who were going to Jerusalem, but she was unable to enter the church of the Holy Sepulchre there because of her sins. She swore an oath to forsake her former life and live in the desert as a hermit. She is often depicted clothed only by her hair and with three loaves of bread, which fed her for 47 years in the desert.",
