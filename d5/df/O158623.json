There is a cotton interlining.\nThe central area has a pointed mihrab arch form outlined in small pendant reciprocal trefoil shapes, and small touching squares while the spandrels are decorated with 6 diagonal lines of inscription not fully vowelled. A large pendant rectangle containing 3 lines of inscription is placed at the apex of the arch, and between this 2 lines of small lozenges [representing the rosary] and a bowl shaped motif [which might represent the comb?] holding two lines of inscription.  The rest of the central field is decorated with a regular pattern of intersecting lozenge forms each holding a stylized flowering stem, or the small lozenges and 8-pointed star/flowerhead.\nThis central area is framed by a row of lozenges each containing 8 triangles of straight stitch so forming a smaller lozenge form while the remaining spaces in between are filled with stylized plant motifs.  This leads into another inscription band on all four sides containing the date: 1257.\n\nSilk Thread: cannot determine twist.\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\n\nBacking: roller printed plain weave cotton; white ground with a grid of large curved rectangles alternating with small rectangles, each framed with a chevron stripe of red, purple and yellow, and each holding a flowering spray in blue, green, red, yellow and black.\nFacing: bias cut, woollen twill with narrow stripes of white, dark blue, yellow, pink, green and red, holding either a ribbon meander or an isolated stylized form in the other colours.",
