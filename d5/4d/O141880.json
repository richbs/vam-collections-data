Their name probably derives from the town of Windsor in Berkshire, which is situated on the river Thames and was ideally located as a distribution point for chairs made in the Thames Valley region, where many  chairs of this type were made.  Windsor chairs were, however, also produced in many other areas of Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries. The back and legs of the chair are made of yew, with an elm seat carved in a saddle shape. Better-quality 18th-century Windsor chairs often had cabriole (S-shaped) front legs, as in this example. The back-splat is carved to resemble the tracery of a Gothic church window.",
