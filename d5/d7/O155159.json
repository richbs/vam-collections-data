The theatre club was started in 1979 by the American director and writer Lou Stein in a room above the Prince Albert Pub in Pembridge Road. Dedicated to producing the best works of foreign writers, by 1981 the Gate established itself as one of London's best fringe venues, along with the King's Head and the Bush. In 1982 the club expanded to include a brand-new custom-built studio theatre above the Latchmere Pub in Battersea.\n\nThe French playwright, author, songwriter and singer Boris Vian is perhaps best-known for his 1947 novel L'Ecume des Jours. He also wrote plays in a proto-Absurdist vein, notably this darkly comic play dealing with the culture of fear Les B\u00e2tisseurs d'Empire (1959), about a family and their maid pursued by a terrifying noise within their own home.",
