Each image is captioned and many show stage hands preparing props and painting backdrops. The illustrations were drawn by the artist Ralph Cleaver and his signature appears in the bottom right hand corner. Another on the rear indicates that the sketches were commissioned for the Illustrated London News on the 24th of December 1898.\n\nPantomime rose in popularity during the Victorian period and as audience numbers increased the productions became increasingly complex and spectacular, featuring beautiful costume and dramatic special effects. The most elaborate Victorian pantomimes were staged at Drury Lane Theatre in London. The lavish pantomimes presented by its manager Augustus Harris in the 1880s and 1890s cost vast sums of money, had hundreds of performers, and lasted for up to five hours. Many of the elements of today's pantomimes can be traced back to these Drury Lane pantomimes.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",

Founded by Sir William Ingram\u2019s father, Herbert Ingram, in 1842 the first edition was sold on 14th May 1842 at a cost of sixpence per copy. Building from an original circulation of 26,000 to in excess of 300,000 at its peak, The Illustrated London News remained in print until 2003 and commissioned illustrations from many of the leading artists of the late nineteenth century. Photographs were used alongside illustrations from the late 19th century onwards but illustrations were a major feature of paper until after the end of the First World War.",
