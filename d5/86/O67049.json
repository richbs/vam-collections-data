However, by comparison with other frames in the series, it is likely that the tiles would have been mounted in a frame of nine tiles in a 3x3 formation, with these three tiles at one end, the frame being completed by a block of six tiles of another of the designs unnaccounted for in any of the known frames. This is likely to have been C.82-1998, as this design is represented on six tiles in the group, and all other designs where exactly six tiles are present are accounted for in frames for which documentary evidence exists of their arrangement.",
