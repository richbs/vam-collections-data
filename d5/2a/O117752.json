She spent some time at the studio of the German sculptor Professor Lederer who persuaded her to let a German factory in Thuringia fire her work in porcelain.\n\nBorn in St Petersburg in 1881, Pavlova trained at the Imperial Theatre School but by 1906 she was associated with the revolutionary ideas of Mikhail Fokine, who choreographed the famous Dying Swan for her. In 1909 Pavlova danced with Diaghilev\u2019s group in Paris, featuring on the poster advertising the season. Her first appearance in London was a year later and in 1912 she appeared in the first Royal Variety Performance. She formed her own company in 1913 and made ballet a widely popular entertainment, touring the world more than any other dancer in the days before air travel. Worn out by touring and the stress of performing, she died of pneumonia in 1931, aged 51. According to legend, her last words were to her dresser telling her to get her Dying Swan costume ready.",
