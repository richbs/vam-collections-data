The firm was founded in 1865 and had 55 employees until it closed in 1917. Examples of the enamel work was shown at a number of international exhibitions, including the Chicago World fair of 1893. These enamel products were very popular with the conservative middle and merchant classes from the mid nineteenth century until the revolution in 1917. They all follow the same formula of geometrically arranged foliage in brilliant opaque colours. It was through firm's like Gustav Klingert that the fame of Russian enamel work spread throughout Europe.\n\nCloisonn\u00e9 decoration used enamel on a metal base.The design is outlined by metal fillets (Cloisons) secured to the metal and the enclosed spaces are filled with coloured enamels which are then fired.",

The firm was founded in 1865 and ran until 1917, with 55 employees at the height of its success.  Work was exhibited at international exhibitions including the Chicago World Fair of 1893.

The resulting cells (cloisons) are filled with the enamel. This style was popular with the conservative middle and merchant classes in Russia during the second half of the century until the Revolution of 1917. It was symptomatic of a Russian trend towards traditional, 'national' styles in the decorative arts. Klingert's workshop was one of the most prominent of the Moscow enamelling firms. They had an international outlook, exhibiting at exhibitions such as the Chicago World Fair of 1893. It was through the exports of firms such as Klingert's that the fame of Russia's enamel ware spread through Europe.",
