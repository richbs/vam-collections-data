Since tea caddies were placed on the table as tea was served, they were often highly decorative.  A great variety of wooden caddies were made between 1780 and 1810 as tea became cheaper and more widely used.  A. Hepplewhite & Co. published designs for both \u2018tea caddies\u2019 and \u2018tea chests\u2019, which were usually larger, in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer\u2019s Guide, 1788 (2nd edition 1789, 3rd Edition 1794).  This caddy is decorated with rolled paperwork, a technique known as 'filigree' in the 18th century, and is inset with coloured prints. Rolled paperwork was a popular amateur craft from about 1780 to 1830. Strips of coloured paper, often with gilt edges, were tightly coiled and glued to a flat surface, producing an effect similar to metal filigree. Cabinet-makers supplied plain boxes with raised edges specifically for this type of work.",
