Also with the names and titles of the gentlemen of the retinue. \nBody-colour and gold. Five sheets of vellum joined.</i></i><i>\n</i>E.241-1947\n\nNote: According to the tradition of the family which formerly owned these pageant rolls, they were given to an ancestor by the Empress Palatine herself, on her return to England in 1661. This information would seem to support the evidence afforded by the inscriptions that these rolls do in fact depict part of the celebrations held at Heidelberg from 8 to 13 June 1613 in honour of the arrival there of the Elector Palatine, Frederick V, and his bride the Princess Elizabeth of England, daughter of James I. The accounts of the celebrations however, do not, however, describe any festivities which can positively be identified with those illustrated by these rolls. A description of the journey of the Princess across Holland and Germany, and of the festivities held at Heidelberg is given in English in <i>The Magnificent Princely, and most Royall Entertainments given to the High and Mightie Prince, and Princesse... Together with a true Relation of all the Gifts, Presentations, Showes,.... </i>etc printed by Nathaniel Butter, London, 1613. The festivities are also described and illustrated in <i>Beschreibung der Reiss: Empfahung des Ritterlichen Ordens: Volbringung des Heyraths: und gl\u00fccklicher Heimf\u00fchrung: .........des........Friederichen dess F\u00fcnften......mit der.......Princessin Elisabethen</i>, printed by Gotthardt Vogelin at Heidelberg in 1613, the illustrations being in part by Johann Theodor de Bry, but nothing resembling the contents of these rolls appears there.
