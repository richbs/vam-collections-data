The panels are organised in a complex geometric pattern, formed by four ten-pointed stars with radiating lines. Each tiny panel is carved with minute curling scrolls and leaf-shapes. The inlaid doors belonged to Count Gaston de Saint Maurice, a prolific collector of Islamic art objects, who was based in Egypt. The doors were most probably installed and used in his Cairo home, which was built in the neo-Mamluk style made popular during the 1860s and 1870s.",

            "history_note": "These doors are nineteenth-century replicas of minbar doors from Mamluk Egypt, but the small inset ivory panels are genuinely Mamluk objects, dating from the early fourteenth century.\n\nThe doors belonged to Count Charles Gaston Esmangard de Bournonville de Saint Maurice (1831-1905), who lived in Cairo between 1868 and 1883. He was a major collector of Islamic art and he probably commissioned the new door-panels in order to support and display the older carved ivory panels. The doors would have been installed in the Count's Cairo home, which was designed by the French architect Ambroise Baudry and built in 1872 in the Neo-Mamluk style. The Neo-Mamluk style was formed from Mamluk architectural motifs such as striped masonry facades and reclaimed mashrabiya windows (wooden projecting windows). Gaston Saint Maurice\u2019s home was a key example of this style. It was located in the newly developed city centre of Ismailiya on the east bank of the Nile. \n\nThe doors were purchased by the Museum in 1878, when the Count ran into financial difficulties and put both his Cairo home and its contents up for sale. They were therefore part of what was later referred to as the Saint Maurice collection \u2013  comprised of Middle Eastern art objects such as ivory-inlaid doors, tiles from Iran as well as Egypt, wooden mashrabiya windows, wooden inscription panels, clothes and jewellery and a collection of plastercasts. This collection was displayed at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. Following the Exposition, the collection of 200 objects was then loaned to the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, from where the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. The Musee des Arts Decoratifs also purchased nineteen inlaid panels. Together with the Meymar collection (accessioned in 1867), the Saint Maurice collection transformed the Museum's holdings of the art of the Mamluk Egypt and Syria.",
