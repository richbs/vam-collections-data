The drawing shows an exterior well lit from the left hand side by a bright daylight. A comparable play of light can be found in another drawing of similar subject: <i>Le d\u00e9part du train</i> (The train is leaving) in a private collection (Maison D-310).\n\nGenerally dated around 1865-1866, this watercolour looks like a re-elaboration of an earlier composition: <i>Une salle d\u2019attente</i> (an oil on paper in the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo (64:12). \n \nDaumier executed many lithographs on this thematic and the first lithograph of this series seems to be the one published in the satirical journal Le Charivari on the 8 September 1858. He comparatively did fairly few drawings and paintings on the same subject.",
