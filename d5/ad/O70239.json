The design is drawn on to the printing surface and the areas to be printed are covered with grease while the blank ones are moistened with water. When greasy ink is applied to the printing surface it clings to the greasy areas, but not to the wet ones. The inked printing surface is then pressed on to the paper to transfer the  image.\n\nKarl Friedrich Schinkel was an architect and designer. He was one of the first German artists to experiment with the new technique of lithography.",
