The earliest playbills were handwritten, but by 1700 bills were usually printed. Playbills of the 18th and early 19th centuries were produced for each day and usually give the date, the cast and any necessary information about tickets and might mention forthcoming performances. Often a play's author would not be credited.\n\nSarah Siddons (1755-1831) appeared in Liverpool in 1778 for the actor-manager Joseph Younger. She had made her London debut in 1775 at Drury Lane but her first  performances were not well received and she left London for a time to appear in short seasons at major British cities. She went on to become the most admired actress of the day. Mr Kemble who played Joseph Surface was her brother John Philip Kemble (1757-1823). The playbill advertises a farce which has yet to be chosen. The ink annotation names it as The Virgin Unmask'd, a one-act musical entertainment by Henry Fielding.",
