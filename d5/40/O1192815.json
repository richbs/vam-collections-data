The majority of Iran\u2019s population are Shi'ia Muslims, for whom Ali is an important figure. The years following Muhammad's death were marked with rival claims to  power. Ali's followers believed that the leader of the Muslim people should be from within Muhammad's family. Others disagreed and this resulted in an eventual split between the Sunni and Shi'ite sects.\n\nPosters like this are designed to affirm the Shi'ite faith and are commonly displayed in Iranian homes, workplaces and religious buildings. In this example Ali is depicted with symbols of his authority: he is shown holding the double pointed sword or zul fiqr, said to have been given to Ali by Muhammad and at his feet is a lion; symbolising his given name Asadullah, meaning 'Lion of God'.",
