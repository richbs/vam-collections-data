The head is of squarish form, but well-rounded, and in the front has a triangular pointed base which suggests it is in imitation of a beard.  The eyes and mouth are faintly suggested by the slight incisions.  From the shoulders its form tapers gently toward the blunt point and incorporates the robes, and the folded hands which are also obscured by the draperies--the folds of which are indicated by relatively coarse curved lines.  The figure is carved from a darkish green jade with grey tones, and on the reverse the deterioration of the stone has caused considerable brownish calcification.",
