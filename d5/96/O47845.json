Green and red wool thread are used to depict its mane and tail as well as the long fur on its legs. It is further decorated with pearls and gold thread.\n\nTwo narrow borders (1.5 cm each), of a bead and stripe design made of silver spangles and yellow and brown wool twisted with gilt thread, flank the main border (3.7 cm). A leafy scroll pattern interspersed with flower heads is worked with cords of brown, black and gold threads. The borders of the innermost section (2.8 cm) encompass a leafy design at the corners. They are worked with glass beads, cord of brown wool and gilt thread, gilt rick-rack, cord of purple wool and silver thread and silver sequins.",

Worked on a ground of black velvet, the fur of the chinthe is rendered in silver gilt sequins. Green and red wool thread is used for its mane, tail and the long fur on its legs. It is further decorated with pearls and gold thread. \n\nThis is an example of the late 20th-century revival in the art of making kalagas, and was produced by the Mandalay master craftsman U Sein Myint in about 1980. Such kalagas are favourite tourist purchases and are increasingly exported.",
