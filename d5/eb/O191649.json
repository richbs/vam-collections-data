The paper is torn into the shape of a cross, the centre of which bears the print. The arms of the cross are folded along the margins of the image to fold optionally over it. The lower arm of the cross contains a torn-out swastika shape, which reveals part of the printed image when folded over it. The enigmatic qualities of Elizabeth I led to speculation on the nature of her sex which may have been disguised or exploited to help gain extreme political and economic power. The swastika may refer to the latter. When the portrait is viewed through it, it is not fully visible but the eyes can be seen and other parts of the image, including the back-to-front caption: \"Look for the twinkle..in the eyes....\" The paper was made by the artist.",
