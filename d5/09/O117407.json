Though she is not aboriginal herself, her work manifests a deep affinity with the Australian landscape and natural world. \n\nThis print is one of series inspired also by the tapestries in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, Paris, in which a unicorn, symbolising Christ, is loved and protected by a lady in a beautiful garden but is also victim and sacrifice. Bot knits this myth with her own experience of maternity and loss and the Australian landscape. \n\nThe overall image is of a maternal figure, criss-crossed with patterns suggesting fine needlework, but also the mark-making of aboriginal artists. Sometimes these patterns suggest fields, cracked and dried, with the occasional leafless tree or shrub. The figure is at once part of the landscape, a kind of monument within it, and separate, standing outside it.",
