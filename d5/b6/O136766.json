Beth had no formal training but was able to hire the industry's top craftsmen to work for her. With an uncanny knack for predicting trends and a healthy appreciation of the ironic, Levine was prepared to experiment with unexpected materials and launched daring designs. These white perforated suede and cream patent leather Oxfords are reminiscent of styles of the late 1930s. Then, two-tone sports shoes offered a flamboyant alternative to traditional Oxford and Derby styles and by the late 1930s a wider variety of colours and designs was available. Women's shoes also followed this trend. A Lilley & Skinner advertisement of May 1935 proclaimed: 'They can even make you look spring-like in your old pleated skirt and jumper, and are invaluable later on to wear with light-weighted frocks.' This pair were part of an ensemble donated by Catharina Tinniswood, a Geoffrey Beene model of the late 1960s and early 1970s who wore these shoes with a white cotton twill pyjama trouser suit from 'The Beene Bag' collection of summer 1974.",
