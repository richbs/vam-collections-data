His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nUnder the Sycamore Tree, a satire on the human condition, was performed at the Aldwych Theatre, London in 1952 and directed by Peter Glenville, with Alec Guinness and Diana Churchill playing the leading roles.   Glenville recalled that the play was meant to be set in a modern hotel,  but Messel only agreed to work on the production if, instead of a hotel, the action could take place in an underground ant colony, and if the characters could be dressed as humanised ants.  \n\nThis set model for the Queen Ant\u2019s throne room in an underground ant colony shows the Surrealist side of Messel\u2019s imagination.  He uses pipe cleaners, plasticine, wire and painted gauze to create strange organic structures deep underground.   Insects features as furniture and accessories, including a centipede settee.",
