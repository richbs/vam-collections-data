By the 19th century most examples took the traditional shape shown here, usually being made of silver but sometimes of hardwood. \n\nThis kovsch is decorated using a technique known as niello, which dates from the medieval period. A mixture of silver, lead, copper and sulphur, which has a low melting point, is used to infill incised decorations on silver, the black compound creating a dramatic contrast with the silver. In the 19th century Russian silversmiths were the acknowledged masters of this technique. \n\nThis kovsch was bought from the Moscow-based firm of Sazikov at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867.",
