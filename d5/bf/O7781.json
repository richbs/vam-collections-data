            "public_access_description": "In contrast to traditional stained glass, which was coloured with metallic oxides when molten, this fragment was decorated using a technique introduced to England in the early part of the 14th century. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in the kiln, the silver compound would turn yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown-black pigment. Since the technique reduced the amount of leading required, it allowed greater freedom of composition.\n\nThis fragment shows an angel playing what is most likely a rebec rather than a viol. The bow is very arched which is the type associated with playing rebecs. Angels are often depicted playing musical instruments. They form part of the heavenly choir and often accompany scenes related to the Passion of Jesus Christ, such as His crucifixion. The depiction of the angel playing the rebec here is somewhat odd. The angel is playing the instrument as a left-handed person would but his right fingers are positioned as a right-handed person's would be. We do not know where this fragment was originally positioned but it is likely that it formed part of a larger panel in a church.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church. Much of the medieval stained glass in churches and cathedrals was damaged and only survives in a fragmentary state.",
