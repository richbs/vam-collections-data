The two pieces of dowel are, in turn, slotted into a short length of wood near the base and secured by metal bolts. The ends of the dowel rods rest in two circular holes in a round turned wooden base. When the toy is removed from the base and the ends of the dowel lightly pressed in the palm of the hand, the acrobat turns a somersault around the taut card.",
