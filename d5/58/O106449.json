The embroidery is in the style of Cantonese work made for export. The colour scheme is also more typical of those favoured by a European market in the eighteenth and nineteenth century (the pink, vermillion and pastel blue hues would have been a more vibrant shade of reds and blues when new). Finally, there would have been very little use in a Chinese interior for a wall hanging such as this example, while on the other hand, the dimensions of this panel hanging suggests that it might have been made to fit the floor to ceiling height of a European home.",
