The emperor's memoirs show him to have been keenly interested in all aspects of the natural world. He kept a pair of saras cranes for at least five years, studying them carefully and interspersing his account of the events of courtly life with details about the birds' nesting habits.\n\nAn 18th century copy of a lost 17th century painting of cranes by Mansur is in the V&A (IM.122A-1921), and its composition is close to this drawing. In other cases, where copies and the original work have survived, the signatures or attributions on the originals have been included in the copy. Mansur was given the title \"Nadir al-asr\", or Wonder of the Age, by Jahangir, and was renowned for his studies of birds, animals and flowers.",
