She launched the Vernier/Franka label in London in 1967. Working from her premises in Mayfair she operates as one of a small number of London-based couturiers. She is well known for her luxurious, formal evening wear, which often combines rich jewel colours with black, like the evening dress shown here. This full-skirted dress with a lace bodice is intricately decorated with beads and pastes and is representative of Franka\u2019s elaborate designs.",
