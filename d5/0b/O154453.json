In the spring of 1993 Sue travelled down the Amazon River in a dug-out canoe. The plant forms she saw were very beautiful and their impact was enhanced by the way they grew together and intertwined. The visual experience inspired her Jungle series. The boldness of this server\u2019s outline brings to mind the striking images of Karl Blossfeldt (1865-1932), whose black-and-white photographs of plants were such an inspiration to art metal-founders and modellers. This server captures the delicate form of an exotic bloom, bringing surprise and delight to the table. In the Renaissance it was customary to strew the tablecloth at lavish banquets with flowers. Perhaps this highly unusual server has appropriated some of that historical precedent.",
