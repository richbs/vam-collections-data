The City Varieties is one of only a few Victorian era Music Halls, along with Hoxton Hall and Wilton's Music Hall (both in London), to survive from the 1850s. The interior is largely unaltered and usually plays host to a mix of comedy and music shows, much as it would have done in the heyday of Music Hall. More recently, pop bands looking for an interesting venue to perform at have been booked there. As a reminder of this particular performance the promoters of the gig, Futuresound Ltd, had this special limited edition poster commissioned. \n\nThe poster's motif was inspired by the designs of Hapshash and the Coloured Coat and also Bob Masse, creator of memorable concert posters since the 1960s. While attending art school in Vancouver, Masse started making posters for the folk acts passing through his city, bearing strong Art Nouveau influences crossed with the psychedelic palette of the era.",
