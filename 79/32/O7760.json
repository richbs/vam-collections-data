The base is embossed and chased above an x-punched strip with variant lion masks in burnished cartouches between fruit clusters on a matted ground. At the corners 3/4 columns made up of 3 shaped sections are pegged through the base plate and soldered at the top. Attached to each are vertical strips which hold in place rectangular glass panels. The panels are painted on the reverse with devices or emblems and mottoes within guilloche borders: 'PRUDENTE VINO ABSTINENT' a fruiting vine entwined around a tree; 'AVARITIAE STIPENDIUM' Tantalus in the sea gazing at a tree of golden apples (panel cracked); 'LATET ANGUIS IN HERBA' a snake in a strawberry plant with butterflies and a snail (panel cracked); and  'VITAE A(UT MORTI)' red roses with bees and a spider (a third of this panel is missing). Above the panels is a convex stage embossed and chased as on the foot with fruit replacing the lion masks, and an x-punched strip. The upper face of the horizontal rim is die-struck as on the foot; a plain inner strip supports the cover. The vertical wall of the salt-well is crudely engraved with linked circles and the four corner arcs are crudely engraved with pairs of leaf sprays. The lower part of the cover rises to an angled strip struck with pairs of formalized blooms.\nAt each corner cast scrolls with applied serpent heads above four-petal rosettes are soldered inside a plain 4-square frame of white silver. The upper part of the cover rises from 4 vertical strips, crudely engraved with joined circles. Each corner is broken off, indicating that the scrolls originally met the cover frame at this point. The die-struck outer rim is soldered to a square plate engraved in each corner with a draped vase containing pairs of flowering branches. The cover is embossed and chased with fruit between 4 burnished circular panels, each enclosing a glass disc within a rubbed-over mount. The 4 discs are painted on the reverse with portrait heads, lettered in gilt 'CYRUS MAIOR', 'NINUS', 'ALEXANDAR G.', C. IVLIUS CAESAR'. Crowning the hemisphere is a vertical x-punched ring supporting a spool lightly engraved with 3 stylized flowers. To this are soldered 3 s-shaped scrolls, supporting a slightly domed and engraved button with an x-punched ring and burron. On this stands the cast and chased figure of Justice.",

Salts were among the most important pieces of metalwork in a Tudor or Stuart household. They could be made in a variety of styles and sizes and use different materials such as gems, pearls, enamels or crystal and can be used to show wealth and status.\n\nThe glass panels are made of verre eglomis\u00e9 which is a process in which the image is painted on the reverse of the glass and backed with silver or gold foil to make it reflective.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe panels are painted with images from emblem books such as Geoffrey Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes (1586) and Paradin's Devises h\u00e9ro\u00efques. Emblem books were very popular in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. They combine pictures and text to present a striking message or moral admonition. The designs shown on this salt include a fruiting vine around a tree, a snake in a strawberry plant and red roses with bees and spiders. Each picture was symbolic: for example, the image of the snake and the strawberry plant warned against flattery and sugared words. \n\nThe glass panels are also decorated with portrait heads of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Ninus and Cyrus. A figure of Justice acts as the finial.\n\nPeople\nThis salt has been passed down through the Vyvyan family of Trelowarren House, Cornwall since the early 17th century.",

This extraordinary salt combines certain well-established elements of Elizabethan design, such as the cast animal feet, the canopy and the architectural conception, with an unusually careful execution (for English silver). In addition the inclusion of <font -i>verre eglomis\u00e9</font> panels painted with themes from emblem books (G. Whitney <font -u>Emblems</font> (1586) and Paradin <font -u>Devises heroiques</font>) further distinguishes the salt as exceptional in surviving English silver, although emblems are found on Sheldon tapestries and in wall paintings, and the Nine Worthies (whose members varied) had been part of English popular art since the mid-fifteenth century, when they occur in a civic pageant at York.\nA great salt 'with pictures' at Hardwick in 1601 may have been comparable, but other references to <font -i>verre eglomis\u00e9</font> in English silver are few, although painted glass occurs in several entries in the 1574 royal inventory. Some of these royal pieces were contemporary or near-contemporary acquisitions; others had been in the Jewel House since the time of Henry VIII. This is, however, a decorative technique far more characteristic of Swiss or German goldsmiths' work. (P. Glanville, <font -u>Silver in Tudor and Early Stuart England</font>, No. 91.)",
