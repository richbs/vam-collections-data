Since No. 279 [191-1888] may be definitely identified as a scene at Brighton, it follows that the other beach scenes represent places in that neighbourhood and that the drawings were made in 1824 or subsequent years. Similar drawings dated from Brighton on 1 and 13 September 1824, and from Worthing on 22 September 1824, were in the collection of Capt. Charles Constable. Constable tells Fisher in his letter of 17 December 1824 that Arrowsmith the French dealer has engaged him to make twelve drawings to be engraved by S. W. Reynolds in London and published in Paris from one of his sketch-books of Brighton. The plates were to be of the same size as the drawings, about 10 or 12 ins. He describes the sketch-book itself- \"This book is larger than my others-and does not contain odds, and ends (I wish it did), but all complete compositions-all of boats, or beach scenes-and there may be about 30 of them\" (<u>Beckett,</u> VI, p. 184). This letter might refer to Nos. 273-277 [605-1888, 198-1888, 171-1888, 340-1888, 245-1888] (and perhaps No. 278 [259-1888]); alternatively, some of the sketches Nos. 279-284 [see above] may be connected with Arrowsmith's scheme. As far as is known the engravings were not made (S.: L., pp. 2, 3).\"",
