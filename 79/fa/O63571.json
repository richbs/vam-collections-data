Betty was diabetic and died the year before insulin was announced as a treatment: in her lifetime the disease could only be treated by experimental manipulation of diet, and the outlook for diabetes patients was poor.   The donor suggests that it was probably a present from Lydia and Harold Greenhalgh, his and his sister's maternal aunt and her husband, who lived in the Wirral.  The ring was not given to the museum with the other items associated with Betty: it had been given to another relative as a keepsake, but has recently been returned to the donor.",
