            "public_access_description": "Beatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators.   She wrote the majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913.  The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.\n\nThe Roly-Poly Pudding (1908) was the second of Potter's books to be issued in a large format (the first large-format book, The Pie and the Patty-Pan, was published in 1905). The larger format allowed for more illustrations, in particular sepia line drawings as well as colour illustrations. In her line drawings, such as this unfinished sketch of Mrs. Ribby poking the hearth with her umbrella, Potter suggests movement and expression in just a few lines. Blank spaces are never redundant - like Randolph Caldecott, an artist she claimed to copy, Potter mastered the 'art of leaving out', regarding space and line as equal components in her illustrations.     \n\nPotter drew inspiration for her story of the two rats, Samuel Whiskers and Anna Maria, from her Lake District farmhouse, Hill Top. A year after purchasing the house, she wrote to her friend, Millie Warne, 'The rats have come back in great force; two big ones were trapped in the shed here, besides turning out a nest of eight baby rats in the cucumber frame opposite the door' (4 October 1906). Whilst renovating the house Potter decided to keep the fireplace, 'wanted for the next book'. Hill Top became the setting for the story and can still be identified in her book illustrations today.\n\nPotter presented her finished manuscript of  The Roly-Poly Pudding to Winifred Warne (the daughter of her publisher, Fruing Warne) for Christmas in 1906.  The book was finally published in 1908 and dedicated to Potter's pet white rat, Sammy.  In 1926 the book was re-issued in the small format to complement the other books in the series. The finished version of this illustration appears on page 16 of Warne's 2002 edition, alongside the text:\n\n\"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help \nyou to find him; and whip him too! \nWhat is all that soot in the fender?\"",
