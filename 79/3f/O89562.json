If you wish to exhibit the same by candle light, be particular to hold the candle in a direct line with the print and as near as you please, otherwise the light will form a disagreeable Shadow, and to prevent the frame soiled, as it would be more particularly by being took down often from the wall, it will be better to choose a hook or broad headed nail that will not slip the Ring, whereby the print remain a fixture and shifted or exhibited at pleasure.\n\nOrders will be received by the Patentee at No.31, Wellclose Square, where specimens may be seen and the work of the most esteemed Artists, elegantly finished, for five to twenty Guineas per pair.",
