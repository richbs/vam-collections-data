These ewers were very popular in the medieval period and took forms such as lions, knights on horseback, dragons and birds (in Latin the word aqua means water and manus means hand).\n\nThis aquamanile is expertly crafted. In the skill of the design, such as the detail of the lion's mane and the beautifully depicted dragon handle, it can be regarded as a forerunner of the Renaissance small bronze, which was designed to be appreciated from all sides.\n\nThis piece bears a close similarity to the large bronze lion cast for Henry the Lion (1129-1195), Duke of Brunswick in 1166. It has closer stylistic similarities to the lion head on the symbol of John the Evangelist on the font in Hildesheim Cathedral, cast around 1215-20. It is likely that both the font and the aquamanile were cast at Hildesheim around this time.",
