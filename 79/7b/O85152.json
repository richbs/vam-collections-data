She was billed as \u2018England\u2019s Brightest and Best Comedienne\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nBorn in Leeds in 1874, Vesta Victoria made her first professional stage appearance at the age of four with her father. He was a black-faced performer billed as \u2018The Upside-Down Comedian\u2019 because he sang songs standing on his head. In 1893 \u2018Daddy Wouldn\u2019t Buy Me a Bow Wow\u2019 established her at the top of the bill as a music hall singer and comedienne, both at home and in the USA, where she toured in vaudeville for six years. \u2018Waiting at the Church\u2019 was another song that she made famous. Her stage character was the prototype \u2018dumb blonde\u2019, unlucky in love. Vesta Victoria died in 1951.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall singer and comedienne Vesta Victoria (1874-1951), performing in 1904. The prototype of the 'dumb blonde', unlucky in love, she was born in Leeds, the daughter of a black-faced performer who sang songs on his head, billed as 'The Upside Down Comedian'. She first appeared on stage with her father when she was four, and in 1893 'Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Bow' established her at the top of the bill at home and in the USA where she toured in vaudeville for six years. 'Waiting at the Church' was another song made famous by Vesta Victoria who appeared in the 1932 Royal Variety Performance. The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
