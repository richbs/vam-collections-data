The Dennis the Menace Fan Club was started in 1974, and now has 1.2 million members, a considerable number of whom are adults who also form a large part of the comic's readership. 1988 was the 50th anniversary of the Beano, and to celebrated DC Thomson licensed the characters, over which they keep a strict control. Hornsea Pottery produce a boxed set of mug and two plates with Dennis the Menace, while Coloroll producced the budget line. In 1989 Dakin Pottery produced a series of 20 mugs with Beano characters.\n\nPart of a large collection of mugs acquired in 1991. This group [C.84 to 105-1991] were brought together from various sources and were presented by the donors - the Curator and Deputy Curators of the Ceramics and Glass Section. The collection aims to illustrate the various uses of the 'Mug as bearer of message' over the past decade.",
