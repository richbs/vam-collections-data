The small group of designers that formed its nucleus aimed to produce high quality designs in sterling. San Lorenzo implemented a select band of products in batch production runs. There was strong emphasis on finely detailed quality, both in design and workmanship.\n\nTobia Scarpa, son of the architect Carlo Scarpa, and Afra Bianchin both studied architecture in Venice. They married, and from 1957 to 1961 Tobia worked as a glass designer at the Murano glassworks of Venini. From time to time he collaborated with Afra. In 1960 the couple began to design furniture for Gavina. Their designs were informed by a deep understanding of materials and empathy for traditional Italian craftsmanship. They also designed furniture for other companies, as well as lighting for Flos and cutlery for San Lorenzo. They carried out commissions for showrooms and factories, including one for Benetton (1964). All these were characterised by a sense of modesty and a highly refined use of space. In the 1980s the Scarpas restored squares in the Italian provinces of Veneto and Emilia.",
