By the 19th century, tea had become a popular beverage and was often served with milk and sugar. A wide choice of material, including cheaper ceramics and glass as well as inexpensive metal products such as Sheffield plate, from which this jug is made, and tinned copper, expanded the market for tea wares.  \n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
