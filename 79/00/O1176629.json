This unique work is part of a series of six pieces by the artists based on the harmonograph, a Victorian scientific device used to record the beats and rhythms of harmonic or musical intervals in direct ratios as line drawings. The artists have created their own contemporary version of the device by swinging a light suspended on a cable above a rotating base-board to which photographic paper was attached in a darkroom.  The two elliptical movements of the light and the base-board combine, tracing a drawing with light directly on to the paper.\n\nWhen the two movements coincide at different speeds but in direct ratios, the patterns traced have distinctive visual characteristics.  This particular work represents the harmonic interval of 2:1 - or an octave.  Harmonograph VI  is a good example of camera-less photography in its purest form, made without the use of lenses or negative and relying on paper and light alone.",
