Voysey and woven in Scotland by the firm of Alexander Morton & Co of Darval.\n\nThe design of the fabric is typical of Voysey's style at the turn of the 20th century, when he produced his most original and characteristic work, often dominated by silhouettes of birds, flowers and trees. Many of these designs were first used for wallpaper and later adapted for woven textiles. Voysey was under contract to Alexander Morton, the maker of this fabric, to produce a number of designs per year. Morton's used Voysey's patterns for many different types of textiles including machine-woven and hand-knotted carpets, woven gauzes and various woven furnishings in wool, silk and cotton.\n\nAlexander Morton's company was founded in 1867, based on the established muslin industry in Darvel in Scotland. In 1881 he began producing woven textiles which he sold to retailers in Glasgow and London. Morton became one of the most innovative entrepreneurs of his day, using new designs in innovative techniques and colours.\n\nMany of Voysey's furnishing fabrics were sold through Liberty's shop in Regent Street. By the end of the 19th century the shop created what was described as a 'new English period' establishing a reputation as the main retailer of British Arts and Crafts goods.",
