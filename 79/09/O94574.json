Publications like Vivant Denon's Voyages dans la basse et haute Egypte (1802) stimulated an appetite for Egyptian-inspired design which lasted through the century. Egyptian antiquities were illustrated in many periodicals, and it is probable that Smith based his design on one of these. The jug is decorated with the disc and serpents of the sun god, Ra.",
