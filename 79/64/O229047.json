A Snowy Glen.'  The corps de ballet are wearing white tutus and hold white 'snow hoops' above their heads, while four dancers in the foreground are dressed as swallows, in burlesque-style corset costumes with black wings and 'tails' and red muffs. Two other dancers wear white corset-type costumes with red panels at the front and white wings. One of those, billed as Aenea the Flying Dove, is depicted in the sky, her arms outstretched,  being flown on wires.",

            "public_access_description": "The Snow Ballet was the spectacular finale of Act III in the comic opera with music by Offenbach A Trip To The Moon,choreographed by Henri Justamant and premiered in Paris on 28 October 1875 at the Gaiet\u00e9 theatre. It was first seen in England in an English version by Henry Leigh, at the Alhambra Theatre in 1876, with choreography again by Justamant. It was revived at Her Majesty's Theatre in March 1883 with choreography by Aim\u00e9 Bertrand, probably drawing heavily on the original. Set in a snowy glen, it starred the 'premiere danceuse assoluta' Mlle. Consuela de la Brujere as Anea the Flying Dove, with Mlles Gerrish, Hemmings, Patti and Sismondi as the Four Swallows. Mlles. Sampietro, Powell and Theodora de Gillert were also billed as 'premieres danseuses'.\n\nThe operetta was loosely based on Jules Verne's humorous science fiction novel From The Earth To The Moon.Lionel Rignold starred as King Cosmos, with other favourite stars of the day including Fannie Leslie as Prince Caprice and Letty Lind as Phebe.\n\nAnea the Flying Dove was an innovative aerial dancer who, with her husband the machinist Dando, developed the means to flit above the stage in all directions, rather than just from side to side. It was said she: 'seemed to swim in ether, and she descended feather-like to the uncomplaining ground.'",
