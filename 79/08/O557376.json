STUDY FOR A CLOAKED FIGURE, SEATED, FACING LEFT AND WRITING OR DRAWING LEFT-HANDED UPON A TABLET HELD IN THE RIGHT HAND.  c. 1835-8.\nThere is another and smaller figure faintly indicated to the left.  It was probably after the floods of 1928 that this drawing was given the tentative N.G. No. 2190 obviously by error, and, as will be seen, questioned at the time.  The drawing is, I belive, very much earlier in date than can be ascribed to any studies for the Parmigiano painting.  It is probably from one of the Italian portfolios, and from the use of a peculiar paper and the manner of drawing of an early date even for that period.\nPencil.  22.2 X 28.9 (cm).\nPurchased out of the Lewis Fund, 1907, from W. W. Bagshawe, whose father acquired it in 1877 at the sale of the death of Stevens.\nN.g. No. 5808\n\nE. 357-1975\"\n",
