It is a typical example of the Alliance of Young Democrats\u2019 campaign which was characterised by spontaneity and informality. One of the party logos was the hand-written, graffiti-like rendering of FIDESZ (the abbreviation of the party name - Fiatal Democrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge). FIDESZ sounded like the Latin word fides (meaning trust) and this association was consciously played on.  \n\nThe cheap photocopy method of printing the poster has bleached the photographic image but has not diminished the elementary effect of the message which proclaims a young hero for a new era.  The photograph is captioned with the date and place it was taken: 15th of March 1989, Kossuth Square.  Viewers at the time would have known that this referred to a political rally that had taken place in 1989 on the day when Hungarians celebrate the 1848 revolution. This rally was the first occasion on which opposition parties openly demonstrated their strength and stated their fundamental political claims for free elections and the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Viktor Orban, president of FIDESZ, had been of the speakers and the dynamism of the bold young orator had won an audience at once.",
