With a thin red leather lining.\n\nRectangular form.  Shut-over cap and embushment (opening) with thumb cut-outs by which to grip the volume for which the case was made.\n\nOn top of the cap, paired lilies enclosed within spirally coiled stems.  At the ends of the cap, paired lilies enclosed within spirally coiled stems. At the ends of the cap, a pair of loops corresponding with eyes on the container, for a missing strap.\n\nOn obverse and reverse, within a Gothic cartouche, shields of arms identified as Ch\u00e2tillon impaling Vergy, all enclosed within a pattern of six spirally coiled stems, each enclosing a flower, alternately lily and sunflower.\n\nOn the ends, formal patterns.  On the base, diagonals, and compartments each containing three cinquefoil leaves.\n\nInterior of cap, and of container, including both sides of the embushment lined throughout in the original soft red leather (considerably worn).\n\nTraces of red sealing wax. A pasted label [red printed numerals] '1542'\n\nEDXRF analysis (October 2006) by Dr Lucia Burgio:\nRed and white  paint traces on various areas of the missal case were analysed non-destructively and in situ by EDXRF.  The elements found (mercury and  lead) are in agreement with the use of traditional pigments such as vermilion and lead white. No metals suggesting the presence of modern pigments (such as cadmium, chromium, titanium and zinc) were detected.",

The high value of personal possessions such as books, documents or knives encouraged the use of protective cases which could be carried on a belt for convenience. These were moulded and stitched in leather, and were close-fitting and light-weight. They are exceptionally durable, and have often outlasted the contents. Integral loops allowed the lids to be secured with a cord or thong. Such cases are sometimes depicted in 15th-century paintings and manuscript illuminations. They could be intricately decorated with fashionable ornament, personalised inscriptions and colour.",

The suggestion was in consequence made that this case was a forgery.  The exterior surface of the leather and its workmanship and condition, as well as the fabric and worn (not distressed) condition of the lining, put it beyond question that this suggestion was erroneous.   It is, however, possible that the cartouches, originally left blank for legend or device, were subsequently completed by an adventitious coat of arms.\n\nSalting Bequest\n\nMuseum Negative: 55597 (frontal elevation)\n\nGeorge Salting and leather\n\n\nOnly one reference to leather was found among Salting\u2019s (incomplete) papers at the Guildhall Library.

This case may have contained a missal or prayer book, while other similar cases are recorded likely tohave contained a medical text of some sort (catalogue no.190). The integral loops on the case and lid of this one would probably have been used to fasten them together, and by which to carry it on a belt.\n\nP81. Etui in medieval inventories and accounts was a general term for storage or travel containers of various materials and sizes\u2026 A large leather case, ordered from a coffret-maker and referred to as an etui de cuir bouilli, was purchased to hold a painting by Jehan d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, painter to King Charles VI of France\u2026References are also made to small etui of cuir bouilli which were designed specifically to be attached to one\u2019s costume. Used to carry quill pens, ink wells, books, cutlery, and other personal possessions, these objects are frequently depicted in 15th century paintings and manuscript illuminations.\n\nNotes on the manufacture of medieval leather containers:\n\nWaterer (and following him, Cherry) summarise the medieval techniques for making leather containers for dry-goods:\n\nStitching is the most common technique, with holes made in leather by awls. Thread is made from flax or hemp yarn rolled with beeswax. The other principal assembly technique is sticking to a wooden structure. The traditional adhesive for box covering is hot animal glue, which was often created as a by-product of the fleshings taken by the tanner from the skins or hides. \n\nLeather objects can also be created by moulding. The traditional medieval term was cuir bouilli, though Waterer suggests that boiling could not have been used. The technique is quite simple, and consists of soaking  the (vegetable-tanned) leather in cold water until it is thoroughly saturated. The leather is then very plastic and can be modelled over formers in moulds of plaster, wood or metal. If the surface is to be ornamented by tooling, stamping or punching, this must be done while the leather is damp.The leather is then dried gradually (to avoid brittleness), supported by its mould or filling which can be removed later.\n\nThe most common processes of decorating smooth-surfaced leather are:\n\nIncising with blunt or sharp tools\nPunching to give a texture to the background of incised designs, using a variety of small iron or bronze punches (also used in book binding).\nModelling, to leave important features in low relief\nEmbossing, performed with a ball tool from the flesh side of leather that has been previously dampened.\nCarving, which is done from the grain side with a special knife that can be inserted more orless horizontally and partially raises up a thin layer until the form appears to lie on the surface\n\nFinally the object is decorated with coloured dyes, usually with some paint (tempera). Red seems a common colour (little work on medieval dyes). Some leather was gilded using glaire (white of an egg) or gold size to attach gold leaf which adhered under the heat and pressure of book-binding tools.\n\nHowever, Davies argues that the multiple techniques of cuir bouilli have never actually been very clearly established. Cuir bouilli differs from other supported leathers in that after treatment it is rigid (without a support) and water resistant, indicating that the structure of the leather has been altered through a chemical reaction. Otherwise leather would remain flexible unless coated with a stiffening medium or mounted on a backing material. She suggests that all true cuir bouilli was made by taking vegetable-tanned leather and saturating it with water, then heating it to a temperature just before it starts to shrink, removing it from the hot water and moulding it immediately, and if necessary stitching it while wet. In this way the molecular bonding of the leather is weakened but not fully released allowing limited realignment of its molecular structure to take place in a more controlled manner. Alternatively, if the heat source application is limited to only the surface of the wet leather then it is possible that the shrinkage solely occurs in the outer layer of the leather, producing a surface hardening effect and reinforcing the structure. She speculates that by impregnating oils, resins and waxes, it may be possible to mould the structure of the leather when hot, and to produce more detailed surface decoration because otherwise this decoration would be distorted by shrinkage after tooling. \n\n\nBibliography\nEnglish medieval Industries (ed John Blair and Nigel Ramsay, London) \u2018Leather\u2019 chapter 12 by John Cherry, pp. 295-318\nConservation of Leather and related materials (ed.
