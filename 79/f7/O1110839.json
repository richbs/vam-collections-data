He set up his first London studio in Conduit Street in 1883 and moved to 164 Regent Street in 1886 after a successful sitting with Queen Victoria, which accounts for the crown, VR symbol, and note on the mount: 'Photographer to the Queen'.\n\nThe subject is Oscar Barrett (1847-1941), the London theatrical producer determined to produce pantomimes of the highest quality using the leading designers, composers and actors of the day. As reported in the New York Times,24 April 1894, he said: 'I consider that we can do with what we call our pantomime from an art point of view as much as, or even more than, can be done with a Shakespearean play... The work of the costumes, and in fact, every element of the spectacular, can be utilised to a far greater extent in our Christmas pantomimes than in any other form of entertainment.'\n\nDuring his career Oscar Barrett had a great deal of  pantomime experience, in 1892 producing pantomimes at both the Crystal Palace and the Olympic Theatre. He was originally a musical director who composed for shows at Drury Lane Theatre. In 1896 he took over as manager of Drury Lane after the death of Sir Augustus Harris. His son Oscar Barrett jnr. (1875-1943) became a theatre and cinema manager and Secretary of the Green Room Club.",
