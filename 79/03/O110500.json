            "production_note": "Attribution note: There are some features found in a number of the figures of this collection. The relief of the carving and modelling of heads is fairly pronounced and there is a stylistic similarity between most of them. A number also have protruding lips and have visible teeth. Eyes are often painted dowelling balls inserted into the head (whether wood or papier m\u00e2che). They are painted with gloss paint and probably intended to simulate glass eyes.  The shoulder yokes vary from a simple disk to a more shaped torso, and, in the case of dancers, shaped breasts. There is usually a slight hollow for the neck. The pelvises also vary from a simple disk to quite a deep and shaped wooden piece.\n\nTo decrease the weight of the legs, the top of the thigh is foreshortened and the top section is a cloth tube with 2-4 cms of stuffing before being tacked onto the pelvis. The most common knee joint is a carved rounded wooden top to the lower leg, which fits into a scooped-out hollow at the bottom of the thigh ('classic' knee joint - many figures of the Clowes-Tiller collection have a reverse of this with a tongue  of wood from the thigh going into a hollow at the top of the lower leg - in these cases the knee is usually shaped at the top of the lower leg.\nAnkle joints are sometimes wire staples, but in many cases there is a tongue of wood at the bottom of the leg, and this is reinforced with wire).  Many of the costumes appear to have been made when the show was revived by Jim Tiller in the 1950s (synthetic fabrics etc.). Most figures have the 2-bar control with 7 strings (including one for speaking placed centre back between the shoulders). These controls and the string are mostly 1950s replacements of the older similar ones.",
