It has two long sleeves,  two vertical pockets on the front and fastens with four buttons. There is a blue spandex trimming around the collar, the upper part of the coat, the pockets and the sleeves.  The back of the coat shows a slit from waist down to the hem, covered with a panel.  All the seams are double.\nThe dress is short, and has a triangular shape. It is sleeveless.  There are two buttons on the front, six at the back and two vertical pockets on the front.  There is a blue spandex trimming around the neckline, the shoulders, the pockets and the hem.\nAndr\u00e9 Courreges was born in France in 1923. After a brief career in engineering, he turned to fashion and worked with Balenciaga from 1949 to 1961. From Balenciaga he learned to search for a pure, simple and sharp line which, mixed with his taste for white and pure colours, allowed him to create designs for a younger generation.  This ensemble shows Courr\u00e8ge's architectural approach to fashion : the use of geometrical shapes, minimalist details and colour. The use of white, underlined here with plastic blue, and the use of heavy worsted, make the shape of this ensemble stand out almost as an architectural object.  The choice of blue and white, refers to the \"matelot\" style popular amongst youth in France during the mid 1960s.",
