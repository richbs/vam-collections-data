Sample 15291, called \u2018En Vacances\u2019, was designed by Alberto-Fabio Lorenzi. It is dated 17/03/1921 (17 March 1921). The design, a detail of a larger repeat, is of a child skipping in a garden. Lorenzi was also a graphic artist known for his fashion plates. \n\nSample 15292, called \u2018Venise f\u00eate de nuit\u2019, was designed by Georges Barbier on 23/03/1921 (23 March 1921). It shows figures playing musical instruments on board gondolas with the buildings of Venice in the background. Barbier was also a fashion illustrator.\n\nThe name of the designer of sample 15240 is unknown. It shows a biplane among clouds.\n\nThe Lyon-based silk manufacturer Bianchini-F\u00e9rier was known for its innovative and lively fabrics in bright colours. In 1909 Charles Bianchini, one of the partners in the firm, had visited Vienna, a leading city for textile design. He subsequently established an office in Paris. This enabled him to cultivate good relations with the top Parisian couturiers, such as Lanvin, Patou and Poiret, who all bought dress fabrics from him. He also employed chic illustrators like Paul Iribe (1883-1935), Charles Martin (1848-1934) and Georges Barbier (1882-1932) to design textiles for the firm.",
