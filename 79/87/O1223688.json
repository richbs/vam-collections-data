It was designed in 1988 and launched at the NEC, Birmingham, in February 1989. The earliest plates were produced without footrings. This plate, which has a footring, was probably made slightly later at Brixworth, near Northampton.\n\nHoldenby Designs was established by Suzanne Katkhuda and Jim Powell in 1987 to manufacture and sell Katkhuda's designs. The company was first based in the stable yard of Holdenby House, a stately home in Northamptonshire. These premises were rapidly outgrown, and at the end of 1991 the company moved to the nearby village of Brixworth. In 1993, further premises were acquired in Parsonage Street, Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, where white earthenware was produced.",
