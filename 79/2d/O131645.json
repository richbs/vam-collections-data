The RA exhibit was accompanied in the catalogue by the following quotation from Thomas Parnell's narrative poem <i>The Hermit</i> (published posthumously in 1721):\n\n'Far in a wild, unknown to public view, \nFrom youth to age a reverend hermit grew; \nThe moss his bed, the cave his humble cell, \nHis food the fruits, his drink the crystal well.\nRemote from men, with God he passed the days,\nPrayer all his business, all his pleasures praise.' \n\nA painting of the same title, stated in the sale catalogue as exhibited at the RA in 1841, was sold at Christie's 16 April 1880 (525), bought Grindlay \u00a37 7s. \n\nIt was suggested in 1925 by David Lucas, grandson of the engraver of the same name, that this painting represented his grandfather. Lucas was for time employed at the Cremorne Gardens as a hermit and fortune-teller, wearing a long dressing-gown and false beard. Landseer's hermit may be compared with the lithographed portrait of Lucas in the British Museum.\n\nEXH: ?RA 1841 (90)\"",
