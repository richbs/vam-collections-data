It depicts the accidental explosion of mines during the Mughal attack on the Rajput fortress of Chitor in 1567. Mughal sappers are shown preparing covered paths to enable the army to approach the fortress, while their opponents fiercely defend themselves.\nThe Akbarnama was commissioned by the emperor Akbar as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written by Abu'l Fazl between 1590 and 1596 and is thought to have been illustrated between about 1592 and 1594 by at least 49 different artists from Akbar's studio. After Akbar's death in 1605, the manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r. 1605-1627) and later that of  Shah Jahan (r.1628-1658). The  Museum purchased it in 1896 from Mrs Frances Clarke, the widow of Major-General John Clarke who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.",
