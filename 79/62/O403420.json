They are rendered in the following order - read from right to left:\nThe demon king of Ceylon\nRavana instructs Maricha to assume the form of a Phantom deer at Sita's request.\nRama sets out in pursuit of the Golden Deer.\nOn the point of capture by Rama, the Phantom Deer calls to Lakshmana, to lure him from the Sita.\nRama upbraids Lakshmnana for leaving Sita unprotected.\nRavana abducts Sita in his aerial chariot.\nThe captive at Lanka, guarded by a Rakshasi.\n\nIncised and punched on the bottom is a six pointed star with a crouching deer at the centre and the letters M.S.Y. below it. (A Signature and logo of maker - invariably an animal or bird which were in some cases the maker's zodiac sign).\n\"Example of peak and complete mastery of silversmith's art.  Superb borders.  Exhibition quality.  Very high relief work slowly developed to suit European taste\"  R. Isaacs 5/8/92",
