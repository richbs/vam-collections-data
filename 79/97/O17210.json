The group relates stylistically to figures produced around 1545 by Niccol\u00f2 Tribolo and Pierino da Vinci, who were both specialists at modelling children.  However, it was made by a reproductive technique, and tests indicated that the sculpture was fired less than 150 years ago, probably not long before it was acquired and sketched by Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898).  This type of image has clearly appealed to different western cultures over an extensive period.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe group was made from moulded clay, which was then fired to form the more permanent terracotta. This method of production allows replicas to be made quickly and comparatively easily. Expansion of air or water during firing can cause breakage, so the clay group was first left to dry as much as possible. The even thickness of the wall of this hollow sculpture also helped to regulate water loss, further reducing the risk of breakage.  Cast-lines were removed and details sharpened in the 'leather-hard' clay before firing.",
