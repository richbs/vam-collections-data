Below are arabesques.\nThroughout the ages artists and craftsmen have made virtuoso carvings as a display of their skill and ingenuity. Ivory combs, together with mirror cases, boxes and gravoirs for parting the hair, formed an essential part of the trousse de toilette or \u00e9tui (dressing case) of the typical wealthy lady or gentleman in the period. The two leading cities for ivory carving were Paris and Dieppe. Luxury items, such as combs were often made in Paris, especially during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During the seventeenth century Dieppe became increasingly significant for small-scale sculpture in ivory, perhaps because it was a port. Vulcan is the Roman god of fire and blacksmithing who forged the weapons of many gods. He was the son of Jupiter and Juno. Jupiter threw him down to earth from the Olympus in anger, which made him crippled. He was married to Venus who made a cuckold of him. His chariot is drawn by dogs.",
