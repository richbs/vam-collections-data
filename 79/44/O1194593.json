The image shows a pantomime curtain-call, immediately after the wedding of the principal girl and boy, which in this case may well have been a double wedding since the Dame appears to be in bridal costume, with her top-hatted groom by her side. Although there is no identification of the photographer or subject on the photograph, it is likely that it is of another pantomime on which Fletcher and Tiller collaborated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and that the girl dancers were trained by Tiller.\n\nJohn Tiller (1854-1925) made a significant contribution to dance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, changing the face of British dance by streamlining the presentation of dancers and making popular dance a commercial venture. Tiller was the director of the Comedy Theatre, Manchester in 1885 but established a dance school in Manchester and a parallel organisation in London famous for its rigorous standards and ability to provide dancers as required for any production. By the late 19th century his troupes were performing in ballets and pantomimes all over the world.",
