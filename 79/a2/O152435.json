A floral stem emerges from a vase in each corner, pointing towards the centre in which there is a small flower head. A small border with a yellow ground patterned with a green meander contains alternating red and mauve flowers with a small section in blue and red. This is followed by a wider white border containing isolated floral stems pointing inward. Around the outermost edge is a yellow border filled with a green foliate meander bearing alternate red and mauve flower heads, including identifiable irises and carnations. This border pattern is repeated down each side so forming corner lozenges with a long rectangle between. On the white ground of each corner lozenge is a floral spray coming from a vase.  The white ground of each long rectangle contains a green foliate meander bearing many small and four large flower heads, alternately red and mauve.\nColours:  two shades of red, blue, mauve, purple, yellow, green with two shades of a dark outline, probably black.\nThe backing: roller-printed plain weave cotton  made from three pieces, with a red ground patterned with a spiky meander in green edged with white dots and bearing  bunches of three boteh-shaped leaves in green with white and red details.  There are stitches in red silk thread holding the backing in place.\nThe facing is bias cut dark blue plain weave silk.",
