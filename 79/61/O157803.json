The cover is set with a plaque decorated with a scene from Jean La Fontaine's fable of the fox and crane. La Fontaine (1621-95) became famous for his moral fables, still popular in France to this day. \n\nInside the lid, an inscription records that the box was once owned by John Zephaniah Holwell (1711-98). Governor of Bengal, he was responsible for the collection of taxes from the Twenty-four Villages at Calcutta. He defended the town against an uprising led by Suraj-ud-Dowlah, the nawab of Bengal but had to surrender the garrison on June 20, 1756. Holwell and another 145 prisoners were imprisoned in a guardroom, measuring only 14 by 18 feet, despite the stifling heat. When the guardroom, later known as the infamous 'Black Hole' of Calcutta, was opened the following day, Holwell was one of only 23 survivors.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
