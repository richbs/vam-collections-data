The sisters Florence Elsie Waters (1893-1990) and Doris Waters (1904-1978) received OBEs in 1946. They appeared in three Gert and Daisy films, two made in 1942 and one in 1944, and a Gert and Daisy television programme in 1959.\n\nAs well as the individual Variety turns, the evening's entertainment included the floor show Why Go To Paris, a song and dance routine advertised as coming 'direct from the Kit-Kat', the Regent Street restaurant famous for its entertainment.  Since this was a 'twice-nightly' programme there were two separate performances each evening, at 6.15pm and 8.30pm, and on Sundays there were feature films.",
