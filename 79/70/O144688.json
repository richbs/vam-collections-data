            "physical_description": "Two portions of an oak screen; one portion (485A) consists of a framework within which are three baluster-shaped columns and two half-columns supporting round arches filled in with open tracery. The columns and half columns have square bases and capitals, and are uniformly decorated with floral scrollwork, flutings, gadroons, masks and leaf ornament. In the centre of one side is a flat pilaster with a capital, and a panel carved with a riband, by which are suspended floral scrollwork trophies of arms and a cartouche and on the other side is a baluster-shaped half-column larger than the other columns, but similarly decorated. The bases of the columns and the central half-column have lozenge shaped compartments inlaid with rosettes. The other portion no longer exists (2011) in its framework, and consists of four columns and one half column, a section of arcade and some fragments.\n\nThe intact portion of screen\nEach column-baluster is a single length of wood, turned to the basic profile and then carved, and the tenons cut. The central turned  baluster is more finely  carved than the two  flanking. There is some evidence of cross-grain shrinkage, indicating that the turning took place while the wood was part-seasoned. The half columns were made by glueing two planks togetherwith a slip divider, before turning the basic profile, then splitting them before (or possibly after) carving. Evidence for this technique as opposed to sawing a single piece column is traces of glue on the back of half columns, and the fact that the thickness of the half column is slightly less than half its diameter.\n\nInset on each external  face of the three baluster  bases, was a lozenge of  walnut (with dark mastic?) to create a flower head  design). One of these survives.\n\nThe more substantial of  the two stiles is  composed of a half  baluster mounted on flat  oak board (original?),  which is itself mounted to  (using nails?) the shaped  upright. This shaped  upright is large enough to  accomodate a double- mortise (to receive the  double-tenoned bottom  rail with deep ogee  moulding ), and to house  two vertical hinges (now  missing) at an angle. The  other, less substantial,  stile has spaces for three  vertical hinges (now  missing).\n\nInterventions and losses\nA section of softwood has  been added along the  bottom rail, where the  original oak has decayed  and worn away. Cubing is visible along top rail. A hand-wrought iron right angle reinforcer has been nailed (18 nails) across one top corner.",

It can be dated on the basis of its renaissance ornament to the first half of the sixteenth-century, and may have formed part of the fixed furnishings of a chapel. Traditional associations with the Ch\u00e2teau d'Assier in the Midi-Pyrenees have not been proven, but the high quality of design and carving indicates that it was made for an important building. \n\nThe uprights were first turned on a lathe to create the varied profile, then carved detail was worked at the bench using a range of chisels. The toughness of oak when fully dry meant that partly seasoned, \u2018green\u2019 wood was used. As the wood dried, it shrank across the grain to a slightly oval section.",

(London, 1896), pl.XXII (inverted) \"PLATE XXII, a balustrade or door carved in walnut-wood, is a fine example of wood carving towards the end of Francis I.'s reign. It is said to have belonged either to the Ch\u00e2teau d'Assier, begun in 1534, or the Chapelle d'Assier, begun in 1545, from plans prepared by Bachelier of Toulouse for Galiot de Genouilhac, Governor of Languedoc under Francis I. Whether the design of the carving may be attributed to Bachelier is at present a mere speculation, but the beauty of the work cannot be denied, and is far finer than any of the other specimens attributed to him in the South Kensington Museum. The ch\u00e2teau is completely in ruins, only part of the outer walls still standing. The chapel is intact, and therefore it is most probable that the balustrade came from the former. It is said to bear a strong resemblance to the 'grille' in the small chapel, in which is placed the tomb of Genouilhac, for which Bachelier received the commission in 1555. The arches at the top are recessed about an inch and a half; the acanthus leaves on the balusters, the ribbons and small festoons have a relief of a quarter of an inch, rising to three-eights of an inch on the centre column. (The Plate gives only half of the original.) The base of the small columns is three and three-quarters of an inch square, whilst the base of the central column projects three and five-eighths of an inch beyond...\"",

Emile Peyre \u00a3300.\n\nRecorded on acquisition as being from the Chateau or Chapelle d'Assier (Department Le Lot), built by Guillot de Genouillac, Grand Master of Artillery under Francois I.\n\nThis screen, composed of two similar sections each with three baluster-shaped columns, was acquired from Emile Peyre of 146 Avenue Malakoff, Paris. It was listed in Peyre's house as no. 20 'Renaissance screen with fine carved balusters - 6 whole, 3 halves and centre pilaster' in the 'Inventory of the contents rooms [sic] containing that part of Monsieur Peyre's Collection, iron-work and wood-work which he is willing to sell. The rooms are all on the ground floor of the house.' (In Thomas Armstrong's (Director for Art 1881-98) handwriting, numbered 1-329, description and price, arranged by room.) It was located with numerous other pieces of medieval and Renaissance woodwork, sculpture and metalwork, in the largest room on the ground floor which overlooked the courtyard(?). This is the room marked G in an annotated sketch plan of the ground floor of Peyre's house, which apparently accompanied a letter dated 28/2/1895 from Armstrong to Major General Sir John Donnelly, secretary of the Science and Art Department.\n\nThe associations with the Chateau or Chapelle d'Assier have been refuted by local historians, in correspondence with the Furniture department (2010) - Mme Marie-Rose Prunet Tricaud (who completed her ph.d on the Ch\u00e2teau d'Assier, M. Michel Vaginay (DRAC Midi-Pyrenees), and Dominique Watin-Grandchamp (DRAC Midi-Pyrenees), on the following grounds: ornamental carving is more decorated than and does not match other 16th century carving firmly provenanced to Assier; no likely location for the balustrades was found in the chapel (except the Chapelle Crussol built after 1567 and therefore too late in style, and which in any case shows no evidence of missing woodwork).",
