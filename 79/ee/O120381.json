Fath would frequently design by draping and pinning directly onto the mannequin resulting in folds, panels or volants (as seen here).\n\nLady Alexandra Trevor-Roper donated a great deal of her wardrobe (mainly Jacques Fath) to the V&A as part of the Cecil Beaton gift in 1971.\n\nThe dress was originally worn with a wide-brimmed white hat.  The hat, which was incorrectly numbered as part of ensemble T.174-1974, was worn with this dress as per Lady Alexandra's (5 Nov 1971) letter in the Beaton registered papers which contextualises it with this blue white-spot day dress and not a white blue/black-spot evening dress:\n\"A box of Jacques Fath day dresses - 1. mauve crepe, 2. yellow cotton with sash, 3. blue and white spot foulard, 4. green and black print on white... I have also found verious hats which I am also leaving.  The large white Jacques Fath (boat shaped) was the one I wore with the blue and white spot dress.  It has become yellow with age but it might be of interest to have the shape copeid to show it with the dress.\"",
