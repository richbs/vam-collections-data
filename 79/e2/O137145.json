This dress from her last couture collection uses a simple cream silk gauze with sea-green satin stripes. The design relies on fabric manipulation for impact. The pleats of the full skirt are gauged so that each green stripe merges at the waist, and the cream gauze is revealed as the skirt swirls out. The bodice fabric has been pleated diagonally to create a wide swathe of solid green, with the stripes eased gently to create a three dimensional fit over the figure beneath. The effect is light and airy, though the delicate gauze is mounted on a robust boned foundation lining, and there is an underskirt of cream silk.\n\nThis dress, with the evocative name of 'Spinning Crystal', featured in Matilda Etches' last couture show. She divided her time between England and America, and her final show was held in Los Angeles.",

The names of the dresses are so amusing and imaginative, such as Spinning Crystal for the cream and turquoise striped silk ball dress, and Second Wedding for the rose-point and satin dress. My friends in California (who helped name the dresses), writers and painters, would like copies.\"\n\n(Note: Second Wedding, with other pieces, was part of a group of pieces passed on to the Museum of Costume, Bath, at Matilda Etches-Homan's request)\n\nHistorical significance: A well-documented and named dress from this little-known but extremely talented Anglo-American couturier's final collection.",
