His trademark style derives from his appropriation of comic strip imagery and method of production. In the latter, 'dot' patterns, known as 'Benday' dots, used to provide colour and tonal variations in the printing process, often obtrude visibly into the image and it was their patterns which Lichtenstein adopted and transformed. Much loved for his 'cartoon' images of 'boy meets girl' romance, or martial heroes, Lichtenstein extended his repertoire much beyond these types, as here, where he transforms still life, a staple of traditional easel painting, by using the language and technique of advertising and modern American life.",
