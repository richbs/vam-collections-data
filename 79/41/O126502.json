Studied at Sass's Academy from 1835; entered RA Schools. In a long, prolific, and highly successful career, exhibited 107 works at the RA between 1840 and 1906, 13 at the BI 1838-1857, and 12 at the Society of British Artists 1838-1883. Subjects predominantly literary, historical, and - most notably - scenes of contemporary life, with which he achieved his greatest popular fame, amplified by many engraved reproductions, beginning with <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> (exh RA 1854 and bought by Queen Victoria). In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>The Bride of Lammermoor</b> \n514-1882 Neg 53002 \nPanel, 36.8 x 28 cm (14\u00bd x 11 ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nPainted about 1852, when it was engraved for an edition of Scott's works (see below). The subject is taken from chapter 20 of Sir Waiter Scott's novel <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>, first published in 1819. In the novel, which takes place in the late seventeenth century, the Master of Ravenswood falls in love with, and becomes secretly betrothed to, Lucy, the daughter of his late father's greatest enemy Sir William Ashton: 'They broke between them the thin broadpiece of gold which Alice had refused to receive from Ravenswood. \"And never shall this leave my bosom\", said Lucy, as she hung the piece of gold round his neck, and concealed it in her handkerchief, \"until you, Edgar Ravenswood, ask me to resign it to you - and, while I wear it, never shall my heart acknowledge another love than yours\". With like protestations, Ravenswood placed his portion of the coin opposite to his heart'. Frith follows Scott's description of the landscape ('the bubbling murmur of the clear fountain, the waving of the trees, the profusion of grass and wildflowers') although not the description of Lucy ('her long hair, escaping partly from the snood and falling upon her silver neck'), and includes the raven in the tree which is to be killed by an arrow shot by Lucy's brother immediately after the engagement scene. \n\nAnother, larger version of the present work was exhibited at the RA in 1886 (178) as <i>The troth plight</i>, with the passage quoted above appended to the title in the catalogue; it was lent by Mrs London to the 1851 Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition (45, 30\u00be x 20\u00bd, signed and dated 1886). Another <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i> subject, 'The love token', taken from chapter 33 in which the engagement is annulled and the gold coin returned, was exhibited at the RA in 1854 (468); both the figures of Lucy and Ravenswood are clearly taken from the same models as in the present work. That painting was exhibited at the International Exhibition of 1862 (662, as 'Scene from the Bride of Lammermoor', sold Christie's 23 May 1873 (306), lent by L Butters to the RA winter exhibition 1911 (48), in the sale of Mrs J Butter's collection at Christie's 28 March 1930 (46, bought Pawsey-Payne \u00a333-12-0), and is now in the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield (17\u00bd x 13\u00bd, signed 'W P Frith' bottom left). \n\nScott's novels were extremely popular sources of subject-matter for British painters in the first half of the nineteenth century (see C Gordon 'Scott's Impact on Art' <i>Apollo</i> July 1973, pp36-9); a series of engravings published by Charles Heath in 1841, <i>The Waverley Gallery of the Principal Female Characters in Sir Walter Scott's Romances</i>, included the Bride of Lammermoor among the heroines - 'whose heart does not bleed for the cruel wrongs of the gentle Lucy Ashton'. Scott's work had already provided a source for Romantic opera composers, notably Rossini's <i>La Donna del Lago</i> (1819) and Donizetti's <i>Elisabetta al Castello di Kenilworth </i> (1829; Frith exhibited a Kenilworth subject at the RA in 1841); Carafa's <i>Le Nozze di Lammermoor</i> was first performed in Paris in 1829, Bredal's <i>A bruden fra Lammermoor</i> (adapted by Hans Christian Andersen) was written in 1832, and Mazzucato's <i>La Fidenzata di Lammermoor</i> was staged in 1834. The most famous <i>Lucia</i> opera, which re-aroused British interest in the subject, was written of course by Donizetti, first performed in Naples 1835, and in London at Covent Garden on 15 April 1838. \n\nENGR: Lumb Stocks, for the title page of the Black edition of the Waverley novels, vol VIII, Edinburgh 1852 (the only other illustration in the volume was Lumb Stocks's engraving after the Sheffield painting of the <i>Love Token</i>).\"",
