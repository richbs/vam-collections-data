They were mainly used as furnishings such as bed covers, hangings and floor-spreads. This long, narrow piece would have been used as a curtain or decorative hanging.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe designs on this cotton cloth were achieved by a combination of printing with wooden blocks and hand-painting with a tool called a   kalam (Persian for 'pen'), giving this type of textile the generic name of kalamkari  ('pen work'). The blue would be the product of immersion in an indigo vat, but it is likely that by the early 20th century when this piece was made, the other colours would have been chemical dyes. \n\nTrading\nThis hanging was probably made for local use rather than export, but it includes elements of kalamkaris made for external markets: both the stylised cypress tree in the centre and the scrolling floral design in the borders are typical of textiles made around Masulipatam in South-East India for the Iranian market. However, we have first-hand evidence from the donor that that this piece was made in Lahore, in today's Pakistan, and the colour palette is typical of that region's block-prints rather than the strong reds and blues of South-East India.",
