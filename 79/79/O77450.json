They were made from thin paper which was first coated with a mixture of whisked egg white and salt, then sensitized with silver nitrate. This print was made from a glass negative.\n\nPeople\nBedford Lemere & Co. was one of the most prolific firms of architectural photographers working from the 1880s through the turn of the century. Their work is characterised by a straightforward, evenly lit recording style.\n\nPlaces \nThis interior is filled with what appears to be 18th-century French furniture and a decorative plaster ceiling in the style of the 18th-century Scottish architect, Robert Adam.",
