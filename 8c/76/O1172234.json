It was owned by Samantha (b. 08/01/1978) and her brother when she was seven years old. Amsoft, the company that made the game, was based in Brentwood Essex and was owned by Amstrad. The company published games between 1984 and 1989 for Amstrad's range of 8-bit computers, the Amstrad CPC. The software for this game was developed by Ocean who was one of the biggest European game developers/publishers in the 1980s. The company published games for various systems such as Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. This game is an arcade type developed by Century Electronics in 1983. The player controls the character Quasimodo, from the Victor Hugo novel \u2018The Hunchback of Notre Dame\u2019. The game is set on a castle wall. The player must cross the screen from left to right avoiding obstacles in order to ring the bell at the far right. Obstacles include pits which must be swung over on a long rope, ramparts which must be jumped (some of which contain knights with spears) and flying fireballs and arrows (to be ducked or jumped). Eventually, after completing a number of screens, the player must rescue Esmeralda. If this final screen is completed, the game begins again at a faster speed.",
