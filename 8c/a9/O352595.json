There is a background design of scrolling leaves and stems worked in gold threads, graded floss silks and Japanese gold thread. The angels each hold a sign of the Passion or Celebration of the Resurrection including a palm leaf, a harp and bindings from the tomb. One angel holds aloft either bells or a crown-like object.\n\nThe motifs are applied to the velvet ground and there is an outline couching in brown silk. Some areas (angel wings, lettering and some leaves) are padded from beneath. The central scrolling stem is worked in gold thread with a silk core and background floral design and the angels are embroidered in polychrome silks in long and short and stem stitches with laid and couched work, and couched Japanese gold thread. The inscribed panels show pale blue silk lettering worked in satin stitches over a brown and cream silk ground covered in couched filling stitches. All sections of the design are outlined in couched Japanese gold thread except for the figures. The silk embroidery uses shades of blue, yellow or gold, cream, green, red, pink and orange.\n\nThe superfrontal has a wide brown linen border and lining onto which are sewn two sets of hooks and eyes on either end of the embroidered panel. The sides and top edge of the embroidered superfrontal are edged with a dark red twisted cord and the lower edge has a manufactured fringed border with gold and purple headings. The fringing comprises various coloured tassels in shades of green, gold, pink, red, cream and blue.\n\nThe back of the linen is inscribed in ink 'S. Peter's Convent, Maybury Hill, Woking'. Two attached labels read 'High Altar Best' and 'RED high Altar'.",
