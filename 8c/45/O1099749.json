Inscribed in graphite on the back: <i>My Father / Rosse -</i>; and above, truncated by the cutting of the card to the oval, the descending loop of (possibly) the long 5 in the artist's signature or of her initials. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> From <i>The Pocket Book</i>; see Cooper, Cat. No. 87. [460-1892]\n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Presumably some early history shared with the Coopers (Cat. Nos 88-91), in the Rosse or Priestman families; eventually purchased by Edwin [Durning] Lawrence before 1862, and sold by him to the Museum, 1892. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> South Kensington 1862, no. 2531 (the set, as by Cooper); BFAC 1889, p. 133, Case XLI, nos. 1-15 (again the set, as by Cooper). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> For general references to <i>The Pocket Book</i> miniatures see Cat.

I, pl, xxvii, no. 2; Reynolds 1975, no. 8, pl. 22 (dated c.1685); Los Angeles and Nottingham 1976-7 [catalogue], p. 157; Reynolds 1988, p. 78. \n\nSee in general the entry for <i>The Pocket Book</i> under Samuel Cooper (Cat. No. 87). \n\nReynolds's dating of c.1685 produces a problem with the identification of the sitter, who should be, as Reynolds agrees, the artist's father-in-law, Christopher Rosse (d. October 1701). \n\nIt was normal seventeenth-century usage to refer to parents-in-law in this way, and the inscription, like the others on this group of miniatures by Rosse, clearly does identify the sitter. But Christopher Rosse was married on 19 April 1636, so was presumably born by 1616 at the latest, which would make him nearly seventy at Reynolds's suggested date for this portrait. The correct date is surely earlier. The sitter wears a fairly flat-topped, full-bottomed wig, with a neckcloth of raised Venetian needle-lace. This combination would normally suggest 1675-80. In 1676-7, Michael Rosse became a poor-rate payer as a separate householder in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, so it was probably about then that he was married to Susannah-Penelope. It might have been about then also that she painted this portrait of her new father-in-law, showing him in his early sixties.\u201d",
