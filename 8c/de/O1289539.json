Blue and white costume consisting of all-over body-tights and bolero decorated with Picasso\u2019s swirls and plain blue trunks. Blue ballet shoes and blue hair ribbon. The costume is annotated \u2018Electric Blue & White\u2019. \u2018Costume tights & bodice made of white stockinette, Short coat over (illegible possibly breast) Trousers are satin.\u2019 Separate drawing of long hair annotated dark brown-black\u2019\n\nThe Female acrobat in Parade was a last minute addition as the choreographer, L\u00e9onide Massine., wanted one act to be a duet rather than three solos. Picasso originally painted the blue decoration on the white costumes for three acrobats with the dancers wearing them. The bolero was added to the costume as Lydia Lopokova considered it too revealing of her figure. The costume as shown here with the long loose hair and ribbon is very similar to that shown in photographs of Vera Nemchinova in the photographs by Victor du Bont in the souvenir programme for the season by the Ballets Russes at the Gaite Lyrique, Paris, June 1923 although she does not wear the bolero. A bolero was sold with the costume at the Sotheby's auction in 1967.\n\nParade was created by Jean Cocteau (who had the idea and wrote the libretto), Pablo Picasso (designing his first ballet), Erik Satie (composer), with choreography by L\u00e9onide Massine. It received its premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris on 18 May 1917. \n\nFrom 1915 Cyril Beaumont commissioned a series of wooden figures of dancers in costumes from a range of artists. As yet no female acrobat from Parade has been located and it is uncertain if she was created.",
