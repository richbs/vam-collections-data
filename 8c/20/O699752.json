He first met Keene in 1852 and many of the sketches in this album refer to Keene's visits to him in Scotland in 1869, 1871 and again in the early 1870s, and to their mutual interest in the bagpipes.  Like others of Keene's fiends, Sands sent him suggestions for humorous drawings.  His recollections of Keene are quoted by G.S.
