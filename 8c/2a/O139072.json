Purchased for \u00a3450 from Mr George von Pirch (7 Arundel Mansions, Fulham), who had removed them from the farm, probably acting for Sir Charles Lawes of St. Albans. Recommended by the architect T.G. Jackson and the artist Walter Crane.\n\nFrom Tracy:\n'Described in Oliver 1912, fig.22 as 'A thoroughly East Anglian example, typical of hundreds which formerly existed in all three counties'. The mixture of styles used in the decoration is noticeable. In the door-heads spandrels the leaf motif is typical of the fifteenth century, as are also the buttresses on either side of the cartway (cat. 247). Yet the spandrel carving of the cartway is pure Renaissance in design.",
