They were associated with weddings and often included the arms of the married couple. By about 1550, it had become more fashionable to carve rather than paint cassoni.  They were decorated with mythological themes, often derived from murals by Raphael, Michelangelo and Giulio Romano in the palaces and villas of cardinals and noblemen in or near Rome. This example is decorated with winged amorini pulled in chariots by mythical animals, probably representing the Roman Gods, like those in the decorations of the Villa Lante, painted by Giulio Romano (1499 - 1546) in about 1520.",
