This summer dress, 'Carnival'  was designed by Sally Tuffin and featured in the last Foale and Tuffin collection, 'Coco Frills' in 1972. It shows her love of bold colour combinations. The long dress, in blue and red cotton seersucker with printed polka dots, is teamed with a striped cotton bolero covered in polka dot frills. It could be worn from day to evening, from beach to informal party.",
