The constrictions in the neck are intended to limit the amount of liquid that can be sprinkled, and to form fine droplets rather than a stream.\n\nTrade\nIn the 18th tand 19th centuries British lead glass was superior to anything made in India or the Near East. Furthermore, the material could be elaborately cut or produced in colours and gilt in styles to appeal to foreign markets. But although the glass trade between Britain and India and elsewhere was extensive, few details are known. As early as 1752, however, the glass dealer Jerome Johnson of London was advertising 'Turkish and Indian Fashion, Hubble-Bubbles, Springel Glasses for Exportation'. In the early 19th century, John Blades of Ludgate Hill, London, captured the export market for cut glass, eventually having his own warehouse in Calcutta. Towards the mid-19th century, this lucrative trade was taken over by the Osler firm in Birmingham.",
