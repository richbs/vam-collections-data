The ballet, with music by William Walton, was originally performed by the Camargo Society at the Cambridge Theatre, London, 26th April 1931.  The ballet almost immeadiately entered the repertoire of Ballet Rambert, and was later revived by the Vic-Wells (now Royal) Ballet at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, 8th October 1935.  The Vic-Wells production was designed by the artist John Armstrong.  Armstrong redesigned the ballet in 1940 after the original scenery and costumes were left in Holland when the Vic-Wells Ballet were trapped by the German invasion.  This popular work remains in repertoire of many ballet companies around the world.",
