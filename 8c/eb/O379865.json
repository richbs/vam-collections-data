Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nSwedish rings were usually made of a band of thin sheet silver.  In Sk\u00e5ne, this band was often stamped with geometric or floral patterns, and was sometimes also decorated with coloured glass or pendants.  These rings were generally given at marriage, but were part of the dowry wealth, not true wedding rings.  The bride and groom did not exchange rings in Sweden until the late 19th century.",
