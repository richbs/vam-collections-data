The balance of the server has been artfully adjusted so that it presents itself to the viewer when laid on a flat surface.  Its fabrication is best described by the artist's own explanation:  \"I knew that I wanted to enamel the server because the word, fish, fills my head with blues, greens, lavenders and silver grays.  But it was also important that the server functions well and fitted comfortably in the hand.  I wanted it to sit nicely on the table when not in use and the shape and the weight of the handle were critical to this design.  A drawing was first made and then transferred to the sterling silver with a resist, before etching in acid.  The recessed surfaces were then carved so that after enamelling reflections from the carving would be seen through the surface (basse taille).  After the fish piece was formed with hammers, the handle was designed, etched and fabricated from fine silver sheet.  The sterling was then depletion gilded in acid, leaving the fine silver to be seen through the enamel.  The fish body was inlaid with successive thin layers of transparent enamel with firing between layers at 1500 degrees.  The piece was ground smooth and even with diamond sticks and sandpaper.  It was hand polished under water using finer grit papers until the satin finish was achieved.  The handle was enamelled in the same way.  The cap and connection pieces were fabricated.  The 'fin' piece was made from sterling that was formed and chased to create the fit and texture.  All three pieces were finally joined together with threaded rods and rivets.\"",

I am inspired by places and people, gardens, wooded paths, the dense foliage of the Florida and North Carolina landscapes.  I like to work in silver for its elegance and the sense of preciousness it imparts and to make pieces which function and add celebration to everyday rituals.  Graphic details are often etched, creating recesses for rich, soft surfaces of colour.  Enamelling allows me to create these surfaces using familiar drawing and painting techniques.  The velvety glass surface seems limitless in its possibilities for re-creating nature's palette.  I am always astonished at the diverse effects that can be achieved.  It is important to me that the pieces I make function in a useful way, adding beauty to everyday rituals, or ceremony to special occasions.  My work celebrates my memories.\"",
