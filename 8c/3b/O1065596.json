The artist\u2019s method was to paint non-representational form and colour onto strips of acetate and then to film these as they were slowly drawn across the surface of a television screen. The image on that screen consists of the picture filmed by the video camera, so that a feedback loop producing chance effects is introduced into an otherwise controlled situation. Historically the admissibility or inadmissibility of any kind of photographic manipulation has been strongly contested. The lens has traditionally been a tool of impartial, descriptive vision. During the last quarter of the nineteenth-century however, it was put to expressive, poetic use in the hands of the Photo-Secessionist and related photographers. As part of a general move towards functionalism, early this century automatic, non-manipulative photography returned the lens to its customary use. This view, (perhaps surprisingly in the context of developments in other forms of image making) has dominated photographic thinking for nearly eighty years. Certain photographers have explored other possibilities, Man Ray and Moholy-Nagy for instance making rayograms (basically a form of photogenic drawing) but even here the fundamental 1:1 relationship between an object and its image was preserved. Study for Koto has no such imitative relationship with the objective world; the artist is the sole agent by which light is arranged and coloured on his paper.\n\nThe video film is not edited and unlike conventional film technique in which time is compressed in the interest of narrative, events are shown in real time. Colour is Stefan Dowsing\u2019s chief agent of expression. By using a T.V. screen he is able to control colour-intensity, brightness and contrast with great ease. Ultimately his work is founded upon our ability to experience line and colour as having physiognomic expression; the closest analogy being the non-representational language of music.\n\nDowsing\u2019s determination to use these materials and techniques comes from a desire to invent an imaginary world from which \u2018events\u2019 may be extracted to form the Cibachromes.
