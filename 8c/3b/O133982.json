He studied at D\u00fcsseldorf, Brussels, Munich and Paris (under Carolus Duran), and exhibited in London from 1879 and at Paris. He was a member of the Newlyn School, an English group of around 20 figural landscape painters based in the coastal town of Newlyn, Cornwall, many of whom, like Detmold, had studied on the Continent. \n\n'The Archeologist' shows an interior of the Mus\u00e9e Calvet in Avignon with a man examining a display of ancient Roman sculpture. As the museum was founded in 1810, if the painting were to be regarded as topographical the man's 18th-century costume would be an anachronism. \n\nThis painting was bequeathed to the V&A in 1916 by Henry L. Florence of Prince's Gate, South Kensington, London. The bequest also included paintings by Brangwyn, Clausen, Corot, Leighton and Fantin-Latour.",
