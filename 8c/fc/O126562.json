Many Portuguese and Spanish traditional earrings were based on 17th and 18th century patterns, but over time local differences became fixed, and patterns became characteristic of a particular place.  \n\t \nThis earring, called \u2018a rainha\u2019, comes from the north of Portugal.  The name \u2018a rainha\u2019 means \u2018of the queen\u2019.  Its shape, of a pendant hanging from a stylised bow, derives from a late 17th-century design common throughout Europe, but the details of the design and decoration are specific to that region.  \u2018A rainha\u2019 earrings are traditionally made of gold and are still being made today in the north of Portugal, although now more usually of silver-gilt rather than gold.",
