His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nRobert Helpmann (1909-1986) asked Messel to design costumes and sets for his first ballet as a choreographer, Comus, presented by the Sadler's Wells Ballet at the New Theatre, London, in January 1942.   Messel had designed Helpmann\u2019s costume as Oberon in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in 1937.   Messel\u2019s feel for period style made him a suitable designer for a ballet based on a seventeenth century masque by John Milton (1645).  \n\nCritics highlighted the painterly quality of Messel\u2019s costumes and sets; the Dancing Times reported \u2018The colours are rich and subdued, like the patina of an old painting\u2019 (Dancing Times, February 1942). This set model shows Scene 2, Comus\u2019 palace, in which Comus, the Greek god of festivities and revelry, attempts to enchant a lady and transform her into one of his half-bestial creatures.",
