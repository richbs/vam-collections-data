The jodhpurs have \nturn-ups and inset pockets, and fasten at the waist with a fall front which \ncloses with brown buttons and stitched buttonholes.   Mrs. Willis states  \n\"...They were made in 1939 by an ex-Army tailor who opened a \nworkshop in a seaside resort: Horsegor, on the South West Coast of \nFrance.  Maybe he was not used to creating children's outfits and that is \nwhy they look strange.  I was wearing them with a sweater and boots...\"   \nHer reference to their looking strange may be because they have a fall \nfront, which is associated with boys' and men's clothing, and which was \nprobably a cut which the tailor had been used to in a military context: \ngirls' jodhpurs would normally have been side-fastening at that date.",
