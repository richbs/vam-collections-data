The majority of wooden chairs and stools were not upholstered, and in more prosperous homes decorative cushions were widely used both for comfort and for the attraction of their appearance. Lady Clapham's cushion is thought to have been intended for the doll's back. However, placed at her back it is very difficult to position the doll in her chair, so the cushion is usually put under her feet.\n\n\n\nMaterials & Making\n\nThe cushion is made of ivory silk damask exported from China for the European market. The seam is overlaid with pink silk thread and couched in blue silk thread. Normally cushions were stuffed with wool, but in this example it was filled with sawdust.",

The daughter of Pepys' nephew John Jackson(son of his sister, Pauline) married a Cockerell.  The doll and its partner were named 'Lord' and 'Lady' of the family home in Clapham.\n\nHistorical significance: The doll and its partner are costume documents; their clothes being, in style, cut and material, perfect miniatures of the fashions of the late 17th century.  Their importance is underlined by the almost total lack of other good visual source material for this period, whether pictorial or in the form of surviving garments.  In particular the survival of accessories and the informal garments is extremely rare.",

It is most unlikely that these particular examples were the playthings of children.  Their production is of a high quality; almost all the accessories survive and there is little wear and tear on the dolls and their garments.  The dolls were most probably purchased for the amusement of adults, and as a decorative accessory to a home.",
