This bust represents Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834), who was a poet and philosophical writer.\n\nFelix Martin Miller was active between 1842 and 1880. In 'Sculptors of the Day', published in 1880, Miller is recorded as being at the Art School, South Kensington Museum: he was Master in the Modelling Class from about 1860 to 1880. Mentioned in the obituary of the sculptor Henry Foley in the 'Art Journal' of 1874, Miller was described as 'one of the few sculptors whose genius is manifest and who has produced works, chiefly bas-reliefs, that are unsurpassed by any production of their class in modern Art: Foley thought so well of Miller that he commissioned more than one of his works in marble: indeed the great artist was the principal patron of his struggling brother-artist'.",
