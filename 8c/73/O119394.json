It represents a siren, a mythical creature which in the medieval period was depicted either as half woman, half bird or as half woman, half fish. This siren combines the two variations. It has the wings of a bird and the tail of a fish. Sirens were believed to tempt sailors into the sea with their beautiful song, only to let them drown in the depths of the ocean. This story was used to remind Christians that if they are enticed by the beauty of material things they may meet disaster.",

Former Loan no.5199.\n\nHistorical significance: This object is made from base metal, which was a popular material for candlesticks in the medieval period. Its pricket demonstrates how the medieval candlestick functioned; candle holders or sockets did not come into use until the 13th century. The design of this candlestick is in keeping with an apparent fashion at this time for representing animals and fantastical creatures on candlesticks.\n\nSirens are mythical creatures said to be half woman, half bird. These creatures originated from ancient sources such as Homer's Odyssey, which greatly influenced medieval depictions and descriptions of the creatures. Classical depictions always showed the siren as part woman, part bird. In the early medieval period however, some bestiaries decribed the creature as half human and half fish as sirens were said to live in the sea. By the central middle ages, some depictions of the siren included the torso of a woman, the wings of a bird and the tail of a fish. It is this hybrid that we see here.\n\nThe siren was popular for its exoticism and was often linked with the centaur (half man half horse). Depictions of the creature could also have a moral significance. Sirens were believed to tempt sailors into the sea with their beautiful song, only to let them drown. Thus the creatures reminded medieval christians that those who are preoccupied by beauty and material things may eventually meet disaster.",
