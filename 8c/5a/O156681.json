Beakers called 'Satzbecher' (stacking beakers) were often made in sets, sometimes supplied with a single cover for the topmost beaker.  Such beakers are often distinguished by moulding beneath the lip, designed to prevent the beakers from becoming too tightly stacked, and by the relative absence of ornament on the lower part of the body.  \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.

He appears to have moved to Nuremberg already as a married man. While Kellner worked on his masterpiece (from February 1582) his first wife died. In response to this personal tragedy he was given more time to complete his masterpiece. The following year, Hans Kellner remarried.\n\nThis beaker was probably once part of a set of Satzbecher (stacking beakers) and dates from the early Seventeenth-century when Kellner was a well-established goldsmith. He is recorded to have been commissioned by the Council of the Imperial City of Nuremberg as well as princes and prince bishops. He also enjoyed the patronage of the wealthy privileged merchant families of Nuremberg known as patricians. Only members of these families were ratsf\u00e4hig, that is eligible to become members of the City Council.\n\nThis stacking beaker is decorated with the coat of arms of the families L\u00f6ffelholtz von Colberg and Sitzinger and was possibly part of a set created for a marriage between the two families. The L\u00f6ffelholtz family were aldermen in Nuremberg continuously between 1440 and the end of the independence of Nuremberg as Imperial City in 1806.\nA stacking beaker with the same combination of coats of arms was once part of the Pringsheim Collection in Munich, and on display at the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum.",
