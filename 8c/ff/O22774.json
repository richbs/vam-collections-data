He was an architect and furniture designer, working in both Europe and America. During a brief period in England, Breuer worked on private commissions and as a designer for the furniture manufacturer, Isokon.\n\nThe most important achievement of Breuer's two year union with Isokon was the Long Chair. In 1936 it cost over \u00a36 and relatively few were made. Initially the seats were sent from Estonia and attached to London-made frames. Isokon would upholster the chair in fabric of the client's choice, but the loose cover on this example is a later replacement.\n\nAlthough the chair's design derives from a Breuer aluminium chair of 1932-33, the use of plywood is influenced by the moulded furniture of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The British taste for Modernism favoured the soft curves and warm appearance of wood rather than the harsher aesthetic of metal furniture.",

Initially the seats were sent from Estonia and attached to London-made frames. Isokon would upholster the chair in fabric of the client's choice but this loose cover is thought to be later.\n\nAlthough the chair's design derives from a Breuer aluminium chair of 1932-33, the use of plywood is influenced by the moulded furniture of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The British taste for Modernism favoured the soft curves and warm appearance of wood rather than the harsher aesthetic of metal furniture.\n\n[Gareth Williams, 'British Design at Home', p.117]",
