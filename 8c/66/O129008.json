Lintel supports of this kind , known as telamoni, were locally popular in Emilia in Italy from about 1120 onwards and may be seen at Piacenza, Castellarquato and Cadeo . The present example is closest to the figures at Cadeo, which are dated by Francovich to 1165-1170. Francovich's dating of this group has been disputed, principally by Quintavalle, who considered the sculptures to date from the first half of the century. The present telamone can hardly date before 1140, its style being closer to the art of Niccolo that of Wiligelmo. The inscription affords an interesting illustration of early Italian vernacular, and presumably refers to the weight of the lintel which the telamone is carrying.",
