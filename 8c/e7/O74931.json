They were produced by first painting an image onto woven but uncut velvet.  Some areas were then cut, producing tufted pile, but most areas were left as horizontal ridges. This velvet picture is of the Yomei-mon gate of the T\u00f4sh\u00f4g\u00fb shrine at Nikk\u00f4.  The shrine is dedicated to Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542-1616), the first Tokugawa sh\u00f4gun, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Japan.",
