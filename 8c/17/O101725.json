A linen kerchief was an essential part of the seventeenth century wardrobe.  Women wore them for modesty, to fill in a low-necked bodice or waistcoat.  \n\nIn the days before disposable paper tissues, a linen handkerchief was an essential accessory for men and women.   This example measures approximately 69 cm x 67 cm and could have been used for either purpose.  \n\nVery few historical garments of plain linen survive. When no longer wearable, anything made of linen was sold to a rag merchant and recycled into writing paper.",

In the 19th c. a female successor married into the Troyte Bullock family. \n\nAccording to family tradition the handkerchief was thought to have belonged to Charles I, but there is no crown with the embroidered 'C' or 'R' &  'I'.  Such an attribution without more concrete documentation is dubious and the kerchief has been acquired solely for its intrinsic value as fine and rare example of 17th century dress.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a rare example of an undecorated 17th century kerchief.",
