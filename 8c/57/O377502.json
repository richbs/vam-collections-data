They were originally used to hide the signs of goitre, a disfiguring disease caused by lack of iodine, which was endemic in the high Alps. \n\nIn Switzerland these necklaces, called Halsb\u00e4tti, were usually made of rows of garnet (or garnet-coloured glass) or coral beads, interspersed with silver or silver-gilt filigree plaques.  The designs varied from valley to valley, but most had a three-part clasp, like this one.  They were worn over a thin scarf of black silk.  The name Halsb\u00e4tti means a rosary worn on the neck, because the beads resembled rosary beads.  It never had any religious meaning.\n\nThis necklace was described as an 18th century piece from Zug when it was acquired at Lausanne in 1870, but it is much more likely to date from the 19th century.  Although the shape is old, the filigree parts have been cast from filigree originals, and are not true filigree themselves.",
