            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is a forehead cloth from a set of lace intended for a swaddled baby. The swaddling of babies -  wrapping them firmly in strips of cloth -  was once the prevailing custom in many parts of the world, including this country.  The custom dates from ancient times, and is protective in origin.  A swaddled baby would be warm, and its lack of movement kept it safe from accidents such as falling out of the cradle or into the fire.  Swaddling was also thought to prevent the limbs from growing crooked. Swaddling bands were usually undecorated. The baby could be dressed for a special occasions  by laying lace over the bands.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe lace has been made up into a set, probably at home from lengths of lace that had been purchased.  The lower layer of the bib is composed of a piece of lace of different pattern and quality, which has been patched in. This was to fit around the neck, and would not normally be clearly visible.  In contrast, the visible areas have been carefully finished, particularly the mittens. These have deep cuffs, in imitation of adult style. The  linen to enclose the fingers and thumb is immaculately constructed and stitched, with a geometric pattern stamped onto it. Babies were often swaddled with their arms bound to their sides and enclosed within the bundle, but the mittens indicate that in this case the baby's arms would have been allowed to remain outside. Covering the baby's head was considered crucial for its warmth and therefore health. It may have worn an inner cap underneath this one, as well as the forehead cloth.\n\nOwnership & Use\nIn the second half of the 17th century both men and women increasingly used the wearing of extravagant displays of lace as a mark of wealth and status, as well as of fashionable taste. Christening sets such as this show how its use extended even to the adornment of babies.",
