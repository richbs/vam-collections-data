Churchill, a notable soldier, was raised to the English peerage as Baron Churchill in 1685, and was subsequently created 1st Duke of Marlborough.  When Churchill met Sarah Jennings, she was working as an attendant to Princess Anne (1650-1714), the future Queen.  The friendship between Sarah and Anne, who nicknamed themselves Mrs Morley and Mrs Freeman, played a crucial part in the fortunes of the Churchills. Churchill  had his most famous victory at Blenheim in 1704, two years after Anne ascended the throne. By 1710, however, the Churchills were out of favour with the Queen, due to a quarrel between Anne and Sarah.  This portrait, probably a copy of an oil painting, celebrates the Churchill's famous marriage through the inclusion of a miniature of the Duke worn on the Duchess's wrist.\n\nFrame\nThe 19th-century owner of this miniature put it in an ornate gold frame.  But Bernard Lens III, the younger (1681-1740), who painted this miniature, was famed for his simple pearwood frames that were stained black (they are still called 'Lens frames').  The present frame on this miniature is a recreation of a Lens frame.",
