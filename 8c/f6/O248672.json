A scheme for the decorations, including a fully worked and coloured design for the paper (held at the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow) was submitted to the Board of Works on 24 October 1880 and approved by the Queen on 2 November. \n\nThis design shows a great deal of working, particularly on the central motif; the upright stem meander. In his <i>c</i>.1879 lecture \u2018Making the Best Of It\u2019, Morris said \u2018\u2026 no amount of delicacy is too great in drawing the curves of a pattern, no amount of care in getting the leading lines right from the first, can be thrown away, for beauty of detail cannot afterwards cure any shortcomings in this\u2019 \n\nAs befitting the grandeur and size of the space, the <i>St James\u2019s</i> is very large. The formality of the treatment of the acanthus leaves and flowerheads in the foreground is, however, relieved by the more domestic handling of the roses, leaves and small flowers in the underlay. Two widths of paper are needed to complete the pattern horizontally, while the vertical repeat of 119.4 cm requires two blocks to print each colour. Sixty-eight blocks are needed to complete the pattern. The cutting and printing must have been a gigantic task, carried out at speed. Only four months separated the approval of the plan and its completion. The blocks were destroyed in a fire at Jeffrey\u2019s on 22 November 1881. The printing for the Palace was complete by this time but the blocks were recut for future use. \n\nThis colouring was used for the Queen\u2019s Staircase, the Grand Staircase (fig.88) \u2013 where it was used in conjunction with an imitation leather paper, <i>Peacocks and Amorini</i>, designed by Walter Crane and issued by Jeffrey & Co. \u2013 and the Ambassador\u2019s Staircase where it was teamed with another Jeffrey\u2019s \u2018leather\u2019, the <i>Cupid</i>, designed by Bruce Talbert. \n\nThe successful completion of the decoration of the entrances was followed by a commission for the main suite of State Apartments, including the Banqueting or waterloo Room. This was hung with a red re-colouring of the <i>St James\u2019s</i>, varnished as on the staircases. \n\nBoth colourings were included in Morris & Co.\u2019s stock range, priced at 32s. 6d. a roll.'",
