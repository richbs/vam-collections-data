They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome.  Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical or devotional purposes, such as decorations for caskets, ink-stands and paxes. \n\nBelli spent the most important part of his career in Rome, working for two successive popes.  Almost all of his bronze plaquettes are cast from his engravings in rock crystal or hardstone. This signed plaquette is cast from a rock crystal plaque that formed part of Belli's masterpiece, a casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, completed for Pope Clement VII in 1537.  The bronze would have been cast from a plaster or brass mould deriving from the original hardstone engraving.",

They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome.  Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical or devotional purposes, such as decorations for caskets, ink-stands and paxes. Belli spent the most important part of his career in Rome, working for two successive popes.  Almost all of his bronze plaquettes are cast from his engravings in rock crystal or hardstone. This signed plaquette is cast from a rock crystal plaque that formed part of Belli's masterpiece, a casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, completed for Pope Clement VII in 1537.  The bronze would have been cast from a plaster or brass mould deriving from the original hardstone engraving.",
