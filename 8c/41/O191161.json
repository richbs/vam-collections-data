Among them calendars were very popular. This calendar depicts a caricature of Lech Walesa, the leader of Solidarity. The trade union's logo is also featured being built by a worker using red bricks. The calendar is one of the numerous spontaneous productions which supported Solidarity from its very beginning.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
