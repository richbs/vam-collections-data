It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe actress and singer Marie Burke studied in Italy for an operatic career and made her first stage appearance in September 1919 at the London Pavilion as Isilde in Afgar.  She made her debut on Broadway in April 1922 at the Winter Garden Theatre in Make It Snappy with Eddie Cantor. She went on to play a wide variety of roles in musical comedy, including Julie in Show Boat, Drury Lane, May 1928, and Princess Margaret in The Student Prince, Drury Lane, January 1931.  She was principal boy in pantomime in the 1930s and appeared in the 1932 film After The Ball.",
