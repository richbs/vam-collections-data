The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe poster depicts a caricatured street scene and a house, the 'House of Fools'. The accompanying text states: 'So ein Staat ist mit uns nicht zu machen - wir haben eigene Rezepte!', meaning: 'Such a state is not possible with us - we have our own recipes!'\n\nThe German Independent Women's Union was founded on the 17th of February 1990. The Union was at first a reservoir for different women's movements, with the intention of distancing themselves from the state-directed 'Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands' ('Democratic Women's Federation of Germany'). In September 1991 the Union changed into an association (society), which eventually disbanded in 1998. The political impact of the party remained limited, nevertheless, some of their election posters are of particular importance.",
