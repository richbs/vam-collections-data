In  her right hand she holds a hollowed-out lily stem and in her left the half-naked Christ-Child; He blesses with His right hand and holds a small bird, which turns its neck to peck His hand. This is presumably a goldfinch, a symbol of the Passion of Christ (because it likes to eat thistles and is thus linked with the Crown of Thorns), The sculpture has been fully polychromed, although  much of what is now visible was later overpainted.",

In this case it is the goldfinch that Jesus holds. The finch was believed to eat thistles and thorns. This linked it to the Crown of Thorns placed on Christ's head.\nLife-size statues of the Virgin and Child abounded in the 13th and 14th centuries. They were set in niches in private chapels, placed under canopies and displayed on the piers of great churches.",
