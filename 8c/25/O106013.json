Its story was even more preposterous than most Romantic ballets - the heroine, murdered with a poisoned bouquet, haunts her former lover to prevent him marrying another.  The plot was nothing more than excuse for Taglioni to display her ethereal lightness and elevation and the ballet was not a particular success.  \nWhat made it worth recording, was the sequence where Taglioni sprang from rose bush to rose bush, alighting on pointe in the centre of each.  Hidden in each rose was a metal plate, about 8cm in diameter, set on springs to absorb her landing and provide a lift off as she jumped to the next.  Few other dancers could have achievwed such precision and balance and Taglioni always consdered one of her most amazing technical feats.  \nMany Romantic ballet prints record dancers drifting on clouds, flying through the air or posed on flowers, all of which were, with the aid of technology, introduced into ballets to heighten the impression of ethereality and otherworldliness.",

            "history_note": "L'Ombre was originally choreographed by Filippo Taglioni for his daughter Marie and danced by her at the Bolshoi in St Petersburg in 1839; it was revived Her Majesty's Theatre in London in 1840.  \nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering over 130 items, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Although it is often referred to as the Rambert-Dukes collection of Romantic Ballet prints, it includes important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
