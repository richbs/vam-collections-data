These are small globes of glass fixed in with wax. The surface of the terracotta appears never to have been painted , and this combined with the inserted glass eyes is strange; it may imply that the piece is unfinished. St John of God (1495-1550) was born in Portugal, but went to Andalusia in the 1530ies having served in the Spanish army as a young man. He was to settle in Granada.\nBought by John Charles Robinson from Baur in Paris for \u00a34.",
