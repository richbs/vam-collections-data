It was bought directly from the maker who called the technique 'cloisonn\u00e9', attracting criticism for the inaccurate application of this term.  Nevertheless, Collinot was able to control the flow of enamels to produce encapsulated colours in cloisonn\u00e9 style. This vase and pedestal was made in other colours, including one with a yellow ground instead of the white of this example. A rival of Th\u00e9odore Deck, Collinot's chief collaborator was Adalbert de Beaumont (d.1869), a Persian expert with whom Collinot issued publications on designs based on oriental motifs.\n\nEug\u00e8ne-Victor Collinot (d.1882) was born at R\u00f6hrbach, Moselle, and studied ceramics in Algeria and the east while serving in the French army. A practical chemist he established a pottery in partnership with Adalbert de Beaumont, an artist and traveller at Boulevard d'Auteuil, Parc-aux-Princes, Boulonge-sur-Seine (now Boulogne-Billaincourt) in 1863. De Beaumont had travelled widely in the Far and Near East and had been resident in Paris for seven years. Their first joint work was the publication of  Recuiel de dessins pour l'Art et l'Industrie published in 1859, providing designs for their own pottery. Collinot was created a Chevalier de Legion d'Honneur in 1882",
