It notably labels all of the churches of the city and is emblazoned with the lion on the coat of arms for the city.  The map also emphaises the importance of ship building and sea faring to the Venetians as thousands of boats of all kinds crowd the lagoon.  De Wit made many maps of European cities to include in his townbook first produced in the 1690s.  This map was not intended to be used as a way to guide oneself around Venice, the elevated buildings and busy crowded design not drawn exactly to scale would hinder you in that activity, rather it is intended to remind one of a visit to Venice, to help one familiarise oneself with the city, its people and its customs.",
