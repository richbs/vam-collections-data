Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \nAncona and the Arch of Trajan \nF34 Neg 73785 \nCanvas, 90.2 X 156.2 cm (35 \u00bd X 61 \u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'C Stanfield. RA. 1851' bl \nForster Bequest 1876 \nExhibited at the RA in 1851 as 'Arco de Trajano, Ancona'. Stanfield had visited Ancona, on the north-east coast of Italy, in October 1838, and exhibited three earlier paintings of the subject at the RA: 'Ancona on the Adriatic' (1840), 'The Mole at Ancona, with Trajan's Arch' (1845), and 'Ancona' (1848). Of the 1848 painting, the Art Journal critic commented (p176): \nThis view, or one very like it of the same locality, was exhibited by Mr Stanfield a few years ago. The point of view is from the beach near the triumphal arch, which is taken in profile, raising it against the sky. The material, in the nearest part of the picture, consists of pieces of rock, and sea-beach incidents - beyond that the sea opens and the sea-shore extends on the left. The whole painted and coloured with much sweetness' . \n\nThis description suggests that the 1848 painting, and the earlier one (presumably the 1845 exhibit), were similar in composition to the present work. The Art Journal critic also noticed the similarity in 1851: \n\nThis is rather a large picture of a subject, which the artist we believe once before painted - that is nearly the same view - the arch rises on the left of the spectator, which with the immediate objects is finished so carefully, that the inscription at the top is legible. The high and rocky coast trending round to the right, affords a beautiful piece of composition, with the near figures, craft, and other material, all of which is painted with a fine feeling for surface. \nVan der Merwe notes: \nThe picture is a good example of the 'scenic' composition and atmospheric clarity that particularly marked Stanfield's stage work. A general aspect of Stanfield's landscape paintings justifies mention here particularly in connection with the present picture; namely, his employment and painting of figures. One of the manifestations of the fashion for the Picturesque was a general, almost theatrical, prediliction for works peopled with figures in detailed, 'appropriate' and brightly coloured costume; this particularly applied when a picture sprang from the antiquarian fascinations of history, or appealed to the taste for quaint domesticity ... Though the landscape or seascape itself was always Stanfield's first interest, the carefully planned figure groupings which he put into much of his work show the extent to which he was catering to the fashion for human interest in landscape painting. While able to draw a striking caricature ... Stanfield's figures, like those of many of his contemporaries, are not often saved from a wooden Swiss doll appearance. The figures in Ancona are no exception to this rule but they form lively, picturesque groups of a kind which evidently greatly pleased his public. \n\nThe artist presented another large picture of Trajan's Arch, painted on paper laid on canvas, to the Garrick Club in 1847; van der Merwe records that this is now much deteriorated, while the present work has retained much of its original appearance. \nEXH: \tRA 1851 (435); Clarkson Stanfield Sunderland Museum and Art Gallery 1979 (223) \n\nLIT: \tArt Journal 1851, p158; van der Merwe exhibition catalogue 1979, p133 (cat no 223) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
