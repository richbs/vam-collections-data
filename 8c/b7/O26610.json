Twelve of the cards, with descriptive letter press, are then to be taken from the box, and laid picture parts upwards upon any of the pictures round Grandmamma.  Each player in turn to take one of the first named plain backed cards and if one of its counterpart in the margin of the pictures sheet a card of the other sort lies, such is to be taken up, read aloud and retained.  When all the plain backed cards are used, whoever holds most of the descriptive ones wins the game, which must then be recommenced by taking more of the latter cards from the box, and playing with them as at first; and so on, till no more (each round being a game).  The game may also be played by requiring that something should be named about each card before turning it over.",
