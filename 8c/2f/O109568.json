It became one of his most admired roles, along with Macbeth and Iago. Kean's natural passion and fiery spirit suited a melodramatic style of acting, but he nevertheless made his name playing in Shakespeare.  He was said to be at his best in death scenes, and scenes that required intensity of feeling or violent transitions from one mood to another, prompting the poet Coleridge to note that watching Kean act was like 'reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning'.\n\nKean's private life was as colourful as that of many of his stage characters.  The son of a strolling player Anne Carey, he started his career as an 'infant prodigy' performing at fairs. When he made his Drury Lane debut as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice in 1814, Kean replaced Kemble as the darling of the London stage. Despite scandals in his own life, Kean educated his son Charles at Eton in an unsuccessful attempt to deter him too from a stage career.",
