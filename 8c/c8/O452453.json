Many combination weapons combined the growing popularity of firearms with an already proven and familiar weapon design, in this case a mace. \n\nIn Europe and Asia from the 1500s there was an explosion of innovative and unusual designs produced to incorporate this new technology, often sponsored by heads of state, but their popularity seems to have been universal.  \n\nThis weapon incorporates a robust but simple matchlock mechanism into the haft of the mace. Pistol axes and maces were popular with cavalrymen in Eastern Europe in the 16th to 18th centuries. The firearm component is typically considered a secondary weapon designed to be an addition to the main weapon, rather than the other way round.",
