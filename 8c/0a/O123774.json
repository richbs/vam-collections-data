It regulated the use by manufacturers of raw materials such as wood and petrol, that were in great demand during the Second World War. Furniture manufacturers were permitted to make furniture only according to specific approved designs. The original 1942 catalogue of Utility furniture included this sideboard. \n\nThis particular example was purchased in 1946 by the parents of the donor. The sideboard was available in light, medium or dark oak finish. They chose light oak. The design illustrates the principles of the Utility scheme, that furniture should be solid, durable and appropriate to wartime. It should be well-designed in terms of construction and appearance, and should look distinctly modern.",

The Scheme was an historically unprecedented example of government regulation of furniture design and production. It represented what many saw as a practical effort to regulate the use by manufacturers of basic raw materials, wood and petrol especially, that would be in great demand during the war. In terms of consumption it ordered the priority by which members of the public would be allowed to purchase furniture; only those who needed furniture would be allowed to buy. The Scheme evolved into an attempt by members of its Design Panel - especially Gordon Russell - to raise what they saw as the low level of design in Britain. The idea was to produce pieces that were well designed in terms of construction and appearance: solid, durable furniture that would be distinctly modern but appropriate to wartime. Utility furniture production was officially ended in 1952.",
