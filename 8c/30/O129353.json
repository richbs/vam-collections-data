While he lacked Adam's business skills, some contemporaries considered him a more accomplished designer. His drawing for this pattern of chair survives, and several sets were made to the same design. This one may be part of a large set from the dining room of Sheffield Park, Sussex - a house that Wyatt remodelled in the 1770s for the Anglo-Irish politician James Baker Holroyd (later Lord Sheffield). The architecture was mostly in the Gothic style, but the dining room was Neo-classical. The decorative motif in the back of the chair was repeated in the frieze of the room. \n\nDining chairs of this period were typically covered in haircloth or leather, so that any spilt food could easily be wiped off. The present leather cover is a modern recreation based on 18th-century upholstery.",
