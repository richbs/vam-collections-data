Blue and white, and a reciprocal line of rose pink and light green forms. This is framed by two zigzag lines, one in white silk, the other in crimson red and light green.  This frame leads into another of small alternating squares of drawn work forming a grid net and small irregular sized squares delineated by red and green, or pink and light green reciprocal triangles.\nA narrow band [a] of small pink lozenges on a green field follows with 2 or 3 lines of 'ribbon' meander in white silk, and then a repeat band [a].  However the corners are patterned with triangular motif containing a square or rectangle in repeat colours but including light blue, dark blue and yellow in a haphazard manner.\nThere are two selvedges. The non-selvedge ends have been pulled apart to form a fringe. \nCotton: Z-spun\nSilk: white, S-twist; red, light green, green, light blue, blue, dark blue, pink, yellow, 2S.",
