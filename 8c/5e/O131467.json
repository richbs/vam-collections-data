Both his father and his uncle, Sidney and Ernest Barnsley, were cabinet-makers inspired by the Arts and Crafts ideals of William Morris. Edward Barnsley continued the family tradition and trained at Geoffrey Lupton\u2019s workshop near Froxfield, Hampshire. Lupton emigrated in 1923 and Barnsley took over the workshop, where he worked until his death in 1987.  \n\nThis wardrobe was designed by the architect W.F. Troup (1859\u20131941) for use in his own home. It is thought that the sliding handles which conceal keyholes on the cupboard doors were probably his idea. However, the form and materials of the wardrobe are characteristic of Barnsley\u2019s work. In particular, the framed-panel construction of the wardrobe doors and sides, the use of light-coloured wood, and the inclusion of graduated drawers (increasing in depth towards the bottom) are all features commonly found in Barnsley's work.",
