The open setting of the stone is a technique which came to India from Europe during the colonial period. Although the ring was probably copied from a slightly earlier European type, it was made by an Indian craftsman. The European prototype would probably date from the 1830s, during the revival of rococo swirling motifs. It is quite close to the source examples, but slightly heavier and less precisely made.",
