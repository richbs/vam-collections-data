It was made for an exhibition at the London Print Studio in 2002.\n\nIn this image, an outline of an open suitcase floats over a mountain range in the night sky. Some of the pixellated dots of the original photographic image of the landscape are enlarged and joined together by drawn lines to form the outlines of the suitcase. The outline looks like a constellation of stars, or a children's 'join the dots' puzzle. The theme explores ideas of travel, or escape, both literal and in the mind.",
