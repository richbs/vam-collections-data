See part numbers for full-detailed description of each component and measurements\n[Skirt] The skirt is comprised of two panels of red woollen cloth and is flared to the hem.  The fabric is gathered and pleated to create folds in the centre front. The back is gathered and pleated at the waist and is slightly trained.  A deep pocket on the right back is lined with red satin.  The skirt is not lined.  Internal tapes made of cotton and elastic are attached to the inside to create gathers and extra fullness at the back.  The skirt would probably have been worn over some kind of bustle structure or pad.\nThe waistband is reinforced with cotton tape.  The back of the waistband is fastened with two sets of metal hooks and eyes. it also has a brass ring for attachment to the bodice. The deep opening slit  is secured with a ring and hook fastening.  Silk loops are attached on either side of the waistband for suspension.\n[Jacket] Made in the style of a double-breasted frock coat with a high stand collar, lapels and a false waistcoat front.  The jacket bodice is comprised of two panels of red woollen cloth and five panels on the reverse. There are two darts up the centre front panels and the middle seam on the centre back panel has a dart which flows into the skirt of the coat.  The skirts on the front are stitched on separately. At the back the skirt is comprised of five separate pieces, two of which are decorated with scalloped edges. The sleeves are made of two pieces of woollen cloth and the deep cuffs are separately attached and are trimmed with machine lace. The bodice has two false frock coat-style pockets decorated with two brass buttons, on either side. The coat has six decorative brass buttons at the front on either side, and two at the centre back waist. The hem, edges of the jacket, collar and cuffs are decorated with a double row of machine stitching and red silk braid.  The high stand collar is reinforced with rows of similar stitching.  The false waistcoat front is made of cream grosgrain.  It has a round neckline, two false pockets near the hem and is fastened with twenty one covered buttons - the button at the bottom is a replacement.  The bodice is lined with white satin and the skirts of the jacket as well as the sleeves are lined with red silk satin.  The bodice is supported by twelve pieces of covered whalebone.

It will fit very well into the theme of historical influence and reinterpretation which we are developing in the collection.  It is also in excellent condition and will make an interesting comparitive piece to an original 1770s red riding habit in the collection.\n\nThe riding habit is also significant because it is particularly good example of fancy dress. Fancy dress balls were very popular in the late 19th century and to some extent were a continuation of the 18th century masquerade.  People enjoyed the experience of being able to change their identity or status for a short period of time.  Dressing up as a character from history or as an exotic foreigner created an aura of glamour and romance which modern dress could never impart.  The 18th century was a particularly popular period and there was nostalgic yearning for this age of elegance.  Many people altered original garments adding new lace trimmings to make them even more flamboyant.",

            "historical_context_note": "This re-interpretation of an 18th century riding habit has been constructed using the same dressmaking techniques that would have been used for 19th century fashionable dress. The skirt is cut in the fashionable style of the late 1880s with internal tapes to create fullness at the back.  The boned bodice and false waistcoat front were all features found in fashionable dress of the period.  The reinforced stitched collar and machine-stitched borders were also common on men's and women's late 19th century tailored garments.  The riding habit also bears the dressmaker's label, Mrs Grindley of Liverpool E.  Although riding habits of woollen cloth had been made throughout the 19th century it was not until the 1880s that women started wearing heavier tailored garments as part of fashionable dress",
