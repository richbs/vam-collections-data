It began by making stoneware in local Hungarian styles. Its economically produced decorative wares were popular at the international exhibitions of the 1870s. Technical experiments led to the mastery of a wide range of glazes, including lustres copied from Italian Renaissance maiolica. Thse lustred wares were brilliantly successful at the Paris 1900 International Exhibition.",
