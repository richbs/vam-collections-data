            "public_access_description": "Casino in Marino House, County Dublin, for the 1st Earl of Charlemont by leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). Plans, on one sheet, of the principal and cellar storeys. It is likely that Chambers started work on the Casino in 1758. Work was still being carried out in 1771 although the building seems to have been habitable from 1765. The Casino was restored between 1974 and 1984; all but eight acres of its parkland setting have been swallowed by recent development. This design is from a relatively early stage of the creation of the Casino. The drawing is presented as if it were to be engraved, but the omission of the steps and area suggest that it is part of a developing process.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
