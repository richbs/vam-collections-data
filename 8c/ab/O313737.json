Her father agreed to sacrifice her on Diana's altar to appease the goddess, who kept the Achaean fleet from leaving Aulis for Troy. At the crucial moment Diana substituted her for a deer. She subsequently became one of her priestesses.\nPlaquettes are small plaques or reliefs made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440ies with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to book-bindings.",
