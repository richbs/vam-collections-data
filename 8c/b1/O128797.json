            "public_access_description": "Barry Martin (born 1943) is a graduate of Goldsmith's College and of St Martin's School of Art, both especially influential in the 1960s when he was studying there. He has worked in various media - including kinetic sculpture, film, performance, and the making of environments - but the constant in his work has been drawing, either as a working tool, as a means of recording and observing, or as an end in itself. For Martin, drawing is a system of signs analogous to those of language, and also an intellectual process of enquiry, analysis and proposition. \n\nHis gift of drawings spans his career from the time he was a student in the 1960s, until the 1990s. His performance work is represented by this drawing, \u2018Environment for Sensory Deprivation\u2019, 1976, which relates to an event he staged at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, where he created an environment which the participants were obliged to enter and experience blindfolded. This work is in the Tate Gallery Archives, and was featured in 2004 in the BBC TV series ' Art of the Sixties: From Bronze to Beans'. For other drawings by Martin in the V&A collection see E.315-321-2006.",
