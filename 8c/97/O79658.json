The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThis chain was described as a znak, when it was acquired by the Museum. This is a generic Arabic name in the region for chains worn under the chin to hold various kinds of headdress in place.  The hooks at the ends were fastened into the cloth of the headdress at either side of the face, so that the long chains in the centre fell down over the wearer\u2019s chest.  It was bought for eight shillings at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.",
