The paper support is then rubbed off and the remaining image is made translucent with oil or wax (and may be enhanced with additional painting). Lastly, backing is added, giving the appearance of a painting upon glass. This process was popular from the mid 1850s until the early twentieth century, and was often used to reproduce \u2018romantic\u2019 illustrations in colour.\n\nThis image was said to have been displayed outside the Alhambra music hall in Leicester Square, London ca. 1878.",
