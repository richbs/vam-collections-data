Men often wore these in extravagant quantities with traditional costume.     \n\nThis hollow, silver-gilt button comes from Salamanca, in Spain.  Men in that region wore a large variety of buttons, both flat and hollow, as was common throughout Spain, but the pattern on this one, of a star made from a mass of tiny applied granules and rings of twisted wire, is unique to Salamanca, and to the village of La Alberca in particular.  Originally, it would probably have been worn to fasten the collar of a man's shirt, linked to a matching pair by an oval loop.  It was bought, with two others, for eight shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.\n\nSimilar buttons were worn by men in the Zeeland region of the Netherlands, but there the stars always have six points, and the links between the buttons are usually round.",
