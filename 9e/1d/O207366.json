The chair is\na very unconventional piece of furniture, in which\ndraped upholstery plays the major design role. An\nexample is in the Department of Furniture and\nWoodwork, museum number W.11-1994. Mary Little\nbegan the process of the design by making a small\nmodel, which is represented here by photographs, as\nthe original is still in the designer's possession.\n As many of the patterns and templates are\nirregular in shape, the dimensions given of many of\nthe drawings are only approximate.\nThe designer worked by trying various shapes,\ncutting out and draping fabrics, sketching, drawing\nand redrawing, refining the contours, sometimes\nabandoning one line of development and going back\nto an earlier stage. Several chairs were evolved\nat the same time, which Mary Little eventually\nformally named after friends. In this series of\ndrawings, prototypes are only provisionally named\nas: Mark I-IV; D &amp; H; Tilted-arm chair; 3-Arm\nchair; Double curve arm chair; Split back chair.\nThe last named became the Margret chair. Other\nchairs, after much modification, evolved finally\ninto the Rudolph, Lily, Harold and Liz. Sometimes\ntwo chairs began by sharing the same basic frames,\nbut the anthropomorphic padding, shaping and\ndraping, the 'flesh' of the chairs, gave them quite\ndistinct appearances.\nFor a description of Mary Little's techniques and\ninfluences, see a transcript entitled <u>Interview\nwith Mary Little at Gallery Valerie</u>, 26 May 1994,\nby Christopher Wilk, Curator of the Furniture &amp;\nWoodwork Department, V&amp;A. A copy is also held in\nthe Designs Section of the Department of Prints,\nDrawings and Paintings.\n...\n     Template for split back\n     Dated in ball point pen <u>27.7.93 </u>\n     Inscribed with title\n     Pencil on glossy paper\n     20.4 x 4.3 cm                                    E.1226.57-1995'",
