No.189 [George Salting; according to a note by Long in the department files, Salting recorded in his notebook  (now lost) that the set was from the collection of the Duke of Leeds (presumably George, 10th Duke, b.1862);  bequeathed by Salting to the Museum, 1910].\n\n<b>Literature:</b> As for Cat.

No. 191 on the basis of their Salting identifications as, respectively, James II and Charles II: 'absurd in view of costume'. His relabelling of 1924 adopted the wording 'formerly supposed to be\u2026\u2019. \n\nFor matters of date and attribution see Cat. No.189 [P.141-1910].\"",
