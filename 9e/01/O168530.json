Other patterns were 'Camping' and 'Kokvr\u00e5' (Kitchenette). It was K\u00e5ge's contribution to the functionalist style, as the latest modernism was termed in Sweden. Made in a practical high-fired earthenware for strength, the range was first shown at an exhibition mounted by the Svenska Sl\u00f6jf\u00f6reningen in Oslo, 1933, where it was acclaimed by the critics. Like the 'Arbetarservis' (cat. no. 334) [C.190&A&B-1986] before it. 'Praktika' was not a success with the ordinary customer but, eventually, its basic usefulness ensured its acceptance. Its space-saving stacking capability and easily cleaned simple shapes were regarded as pioneering concepts in the early 1930s. Additions to the range,  'Praktika II', were made in 1945.\nChristopher Wilk (ed.). <u>Modernism 1914-1939: designing a new world</u>. London: V&A Publications, 2006. cat. no. 239, p. 370.",
