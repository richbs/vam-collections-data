London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>John Thomson   British   1837-1921\nLondon Nomades   1876\nWoodburytype\n109 X 83 mm (reproduced same size)  Mus. no. Ph. 315-1982   Given by Mrs Dorothy Crisp</i>\n\nWalter Woodbury's Woodburytype process was a variation on the carbon process in which a relief image in gelatin was pressed into a lead block to form a mould.  Gelatinous ink applied to the mould could be transferred to paper to give a continuous tone, permanent image.  The usual image colour was a chocolate brown, but as with the carbon process, almost any pigment colour could be used.  This example is typical.  Woodburytype images often show clear signs of the relief image, especially at the edges between dark and light areas.  They were always mounted on book or journal pages, or on card mounts, usually with a process credit beneath the print or at least on the title page or elsewhere in the book.  Unlike the carbon process, the Woodburytype was not used by amateurs, because of the need for presses to form and print from the lead moulds.\nThis picture inaugurated one of the most famous photographic part-works of the 19th century, <i>Street Life in London</i>.  The series began in February 1877 and 36 monthly installments appeared.  Each contained one photograph, printed by the Woodburytype method, plus a three page essay written by Adolphe Smith, a journalist, or by Thomson himself.  Mayhew's <i>London Labour and the London Poor</i> (1851) was illustrated by woodcuts, some based on Daguerreotypes.  Thomson noted that 'The precision and accuracy of photography enables us to present true types of the London poor and shield us from the accusation of wither underrating or exaggerating individual peculiarities of appearance'.\nThomson wrote of the 'Nomades' that they were allied to but distinct from true gipsies.  The photograph was taken on waste ground in Battersea and represents 'a friendly group gathered around the caravan of William Hampton, a man who enjoys the reputation among his fellows of being \"a fair-spoken, honest gentleman\".'  A few weeks later Thomson returned to Battersea with his photograph of the group which he presented to Hampton: '\"Bless ye! he exclaimed, that's old Mary Pradd, sitting on the steps of the wan [sic], wot was murdered in the Borough, middle of last month\"'.  The precise manner of her apparently violent death was not established.  Thomson noted that, 'Clean and respectable in her dress, she might in her youth have been even of comely appearance, but now she wore the indelible stamp of a woman who had been dulled and deadened by a hard life' (and had taken to drink).  <i>Street Life in London </i>stands at the beginning of photo-journalism and, perhaps inevitably, begins with a sensational death.\"",
