(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 69, 76, 77\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"This is a sketch for No. 184 [F.A. 34], of 1820.  Holmes, p. 242, dates No. 113 [145-1888] <i>c.</i>1812, and he is probably correct in thinking that it is some years earlier than the finished picture.  It may be compared with the sketch for the 'Mill Stream' (Tate Gallery No. 1816) discussed in the note to No. 110 [166-1888], a comparison which helps to support a dating of <i>c.</i>1810-15 for this sketch.\nMr. Gilbert Davis has a pencil drawing of the subject seen from an almost identical viewpoint, but showing the water-wheel.  Beckett (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. XCVII, 1955, pp. 52-5) suggests that it may have been made in 1817,  Probably the drawing and No. 113 [145-1888] are independent studies from nature of the same scene.\nFor further notes on the finished composition, variants and replicas, see note to No. 184 [F.A. 34].\n\nNote on Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888]\n\nNos. 109-113 form a miscellaneous and somewhat unhomogeneous group.  Most of them have either been assigned to a date near 1811 or may be compared with another oil sketch assigned to that date.  Accordingly, though their general character hardly warrants a dating more exact than <i>c.</i>1810-15 or within even wider limits, they are grouped together here.  Their relationship to Nos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888], the earliest oil sketches in the Museum to show the full effect of the revolution in Constable's style, helps to justify this grouping.\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
