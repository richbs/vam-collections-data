            "public_access_description": "In its strict sense, the word \u2018miniature\u2019 describes a technique of painting in watercolour rather than the size of a painting. Miniature painting developed as a separate art in the 16th century and in Britain it became predominantly a portrait art. In Continental Europe, however, the taste for portraits small enough to be carried on the person was often met by artists working within very different artistic traditions. One type of \u2018miniature\u2019 (as all such small works are now known), produced more on the Continent than in Britain, was the oil miniature, usually painted on metal. Most of these oil miniatures are anonymous, since the art of painting small portraits in oil on metal was not one in which leading artists specialised. More often it was part of a repertoire of portrait styles offered by less well-known oil painters. \n\nThis oil miniature is unusual in that it is by a named artist working in England. John Zachary Kneller was born in L\u00fcbeck on 6 October 1644 and was the brother of Sir Godfrey Kneller, with whom he came to England after travelling in Italy. John Zachary painted mostly architectural decoration and still lifes. The market for his miniature works in oil relied on his brother\u2019s successful portrait business as they were mostly small, portable copies of Sir Godfrey\u2019s portraits. He died at Covent Garden in 1702.\n\nThe miniature is signed \u2018I.Z.K.\u2019 on the background on the right. On the back of the copper is written in ink, in an apparently old hand, \u2018The Dutchefs of Manchester\u2019 (sic). The piece is also inscribed in ink on the backboard \u2018Her Grace The Duchefs of Manchester\u2019. The Duchess of Manchester was Doddington Greville, daughter of Robert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke, and Anne Doddington. She married Charles Montagu, 1st Duke of Manchester (d. 1721-1722), son of Sir Robert Montagu and Anne Yelverton, on 19 February 1690. She died on 16 February 1720.\n\nOne problem with oil miniatures, which probably became apparent quite quickly, is that the varnish often discolours, which results in a darkened effect, as seen in this oil miniature.",
