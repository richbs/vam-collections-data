It was found buried between Bina and Ujjain in Jhansi District (Uttar Pradesh) when excavations were being made for the construction of a light railway from Jhansi to the village of Ujjain, in 1897. The vendor's letter stated that the head had been 'found buried with many other mascots and some remains of a village.'\nThe head was described on its accession on 1922 as representing the Hindu river-goddess Ganga, and as having been used for ceremonial purposes as a staff head or for planting on a pile of Brahmanical books. Although it has also been described as representing Saraswati it is also possible that the head represents the goddess Gauri, as the form corresponds to a form of Gauri head worshipped especially in Maharashtra.",
