A graduate of the Royal College of Art\u2019s millinery course (founded in 1988), he began his career as one of a new generation of innovative, art school trained designers who, during the 1980s, revitalised the British hatmaking industry by reworking traditional hat shapes and materials. Treacy designs occasion and daywear hats for established fashion houses, such as Chanel, as well as for his own couture and diffusion ranges. His most flamboyant creations are popular with women attending \u2018Ladies\u2019 Day\u2019 at Royal Ascot, the world's most famous race meeting, where extravagant millinery is as much a part of the occasion as the horseracing. \nThis hat was made by Philip Treacy for the fashion historian Madeleine Ginsburg, whilst he was still a student at the Royal College of Art.",
