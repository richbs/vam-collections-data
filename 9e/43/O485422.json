            "physical_description": "White, warp-dominated plain weave silk square shawl with white silk fringe. The warp threads have no twist while the weft threads are Z-twisted. The shawl is made from one piece of cloth with no seams. There are two selvedges on two sides and these are left as they are, while the other two sides are turn in and sewn down with the thread that forms the fringe. The fringe is silk inter knotting to a depth of 13 cm and the rest, about 20 cm, is left as tassels. This trimming is white silk, two-ply, Z-twist.\nThe shawl is embroidered in white twisted silk thread with a design of fantastic flowers. The pattern is aligned diagonally so that when the shawl is folded into a triangle for wearing across the shoulders, the floral design is seen to the best advantage.\nAlthough the shawl as a garment is practically unknown among Chinese people, they were, and are still, made in several centres throughout China for export to Europe and America.\nThis particular shawl is remarkable as it seems almost certain that it was displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851. The V&A has no written proof now of this but it was loaned to the commemorative exhibition in 1951 and it appears in the catalogue to the latter exhibition as being from 1851.",
