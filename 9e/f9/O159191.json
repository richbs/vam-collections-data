There is a composite border: reciprocal triangles, an embroidered border of V-shaped lines, some forming diamonds, a repeat of the reciprocal triangles [this combination = a]. The main border has embroidered stepped triangles forming star-like lozenges within a lattice. There is a square in each corner containing an outward pointing stylized floral sprig - each one is slightly different. Borders [a] are repeated. The central panel contains a pointed arch formed by a line of embroidered stepped triangles between lines of pulled thread work.  The spandrels contain a square grid of stepped triangles. The inside edge of the arched panel is edged with reciprocal diamond -heads.  There is a smaller arch within and the space between the two contains isolated rigid floral stems and stepped lozenges.  The inner arch-shape is divided into two sections: the lower one contains a V-shaped embroidered band, a lozenge, 2 floral sprigs and an embroidered roundel in the lower right with an embroidered square in the lower left. The upper section contains floral stems and isolated motifs, a stylized comb and rosary and an embroidered roundel.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\nBacking: white cotton ground with a printed pattern of small floral sprigs and undulating stems with tiny flowers which together create a lattice.  The diamond shaped spaces contain six variations of a floral spray of three flowers.  The colours are red, light blue, purple, green.  The width of the printed fabric runs the length of the embroidered panel.\nFacing: bias cut; woven stripes in woollen twill: red stripe with a boteh or flower, white stripe with a meander, dark blue stripe with red flower, wider white stripe and wider yellow stripe both with a floral pattern.",
