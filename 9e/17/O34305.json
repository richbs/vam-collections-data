The majority of its tapestries are large-scale coporate and public commissions, but there has also been a demand from individual clients keen to own small examples of work.  In order to make its tapestries more widely available, the workshop put together a collection of specially designed small tapestries, to be woven in limited editions.\nJimmy Pike was an Aboriginal artist who lived in a bushcamp on the edge of the remote Great Sandy Desert of North Western Australia.  A member of the Walmajarri people, one of the last group to leave the desert in the 1950s, Pike spent his childhood as a nomad.  Pike's work has been inspired by the landscape and its ancient culture.  In his early career, Pike supplemented his income by selling hand carved artefacts, but in 1981 he was introduced to the Western style of painting and he continued to work in this medium.  However, the subjects and themes of his work remained entirely rooted in his aboriginal heritage, as he explored the desert landscape and the spirituality of his people.",

Registered File number 1994/1388.\n\nHistorical significance: This series of miniature tapestries was created by the Victorian Tapestry Workshop as a way of widening access to and ownership of their work. A number of artists, such as Stephen Benwell, the ceramic artist, or Jimmy Pike agreed to collaborate on the project. Several of them spent time at the Workshop as artists in residence. \nThis project differed from the usual large scale long-term work of the Workshop and provided individual, short-term and intimate challenges for the weavers.",

The majority of the Workshop's tapestries are large-scale commissions, for display in venues such as arts complexes, schools and universities, corporate foyers and boardrooms. Between 1983 and 1988 the Workshop collaborated with Australian artist Arthur Boyd to produce a monumental tapestry for permanent display in the new Parliament House n Canberra.  There has always been a demand from individual clients eager to own small examples of work and, in order to make their tapestries more widely available, the Workshop put together a collection of specially designed small tapestries to be woven in limited editions.  Designs were commissioned from a number of Australian artists, several of whom spent time with the weavers as artists in residence.",
