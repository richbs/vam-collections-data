The former include the swan-necked pediment, the composite capitals (in which Ionic volutes are combined with the features of a Corinthian capital), the Vitruvian scroll frieze (with repeated volutes) at the base and a Venus mask set in a shell at the apron. These architectural features are inspired by the work of the British  architect James Gibbs  (1682-1754). The lively Rococo detail includes the asymmetrical, eagle-mounted lion cartouche at the top and the shell-like foliage brackets beneath the columns.\n\nPeople\nFrancis and John Booker succeeded to the family business when their father John died in 1749. The elder John Booker  was working as a 'Looking Glass merchant' when he married early in 1711 or 1712. In 1728 he was described as a 'glass-grinder'.  The brothers are listed in the Dublin trade directories from 1761 until 1772.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe fleurs-de-lis in the foliage in the upper frieze (in the upper corners) may provide a clue to the original owners of the mirror. This heraldic flower features in the crest of Edward Clifford of Castle Annesley, Co. Wexford.",
