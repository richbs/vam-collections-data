            "public_access_description": "This armchair is part of a set of four armchairs and a settee that were made in France between 1780 and 1800.  The design of the frames was a very popular one and was made by a number of menuisiers, as the makers of carved furniture were called.  Some made highly carved versions, but these are simply moulded.  The tapestry covers were made some years earlier, for the kind of larger chairs that were fashionable in the 1750s and 1760s. They were only put on to these frames in the nineteenth century, when such tapestries became highly fashionable amongst antique collectors.  The back panels are woven with Chinoiseries, figures in Chinese-style dress in fanciful settings, while the seats are woven with scenes of animals from La Fontaine's 'Fables'.\n\nOn loan to Abbot Hall, Kendal.",

More recently (2009) we have come to think that they do in fact date from ca. 1780-1800, very simple versions of a pattern produced by a number of different Parisian <i>menuisiers</i> or makers of carved furniture. The covers were probably added to the set in the second half of the 19th century.",
