The body is made of moulded carton and wood covered with a dense piled fur fabric; more like a thick velvet. The eyes are pale green and black glass and the mouth and nose pink card glued on. Inside the mouth the teeth are indicated by white dots of paint. The shape has two separate front legs with the back ones and haunches moulded as one unit; the tail is a length of the fabric. The body contains a clockwork mechanism with the winder protruding from the left side (there is no key). When wound the head nods and the mouth appears to open and close; the sound made by the mechanism represents a purr. There are wear marks along the seams of the fabric and in the creases of the tail. The nose area is also worn and the fabric on the left ear is torn.",
