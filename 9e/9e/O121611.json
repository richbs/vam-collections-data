The fringe is a maximum of 10 cms long and is formed from warp loops with one thick shoot of weft at the lower end of the loops. \nUpper: maximum of 12.5 cms. deep. As the lower end but the central band is narrower and the stepped diamonds have red centres. The fringe is made from groups of 7 warp threads secured by a single knot.\n\nDESIGN: Field with a very light brown ground, in wool for the lowest 15 cms and the rest in silk. There is a thick floral sprig rising into a six-sided niche, with four pairs of stems each bearing a stylised carnation in dark blue, dark red, red and light red; there are four rows of stylised floral sprigs with two blue hooked crosses on the lower two corners; the ground is scattered with S-motifs and is edged by a line of inward-facing blue hooks. The two spandrels have a dark red ground filled with simple floral sprigs.\n\nBorders (from the inside): \n(1) very light brown ground with central black line across which are paired triangles outlined in black and filled in dark red, red, blue and brown.\n(2) interlocking halves of stepped lozenges in the reds, blues and brown, all with contrasting centres.\n(3) very light brown ground with a thick central line of alternating red and blue knots and supporting pairs of diagonal lines.\n(4) light red ground with motif of 3 linked diamonds with a half diamond to either side of the middle one which has a blue crescent at each diagonal along the border and in the first motif on the sides; the remaining crescents include pairs in red and dark red. These motifs are separated by brown triangles, their points meeting in the centre and with angular indentations along the border edges. \nOn either side of the niche and between borders (3) and (4) there is a long rectangular panel with a very light brown ground on which a thick stem with closely packed pairs of leaves is predominantly dark red and black.",
