Towards the end of the 19th century, when illustrated souvenir booklets were produced by some of the wealthier managements, some extended the practice to silk or satin-covered souvenir booklets such as this, containing many pages and photographs.\n\nThis was issued for a grand charity performance during the First World War, on October 1913 at the London Coliseum, the variety theatre designed by Frank Matcham which opened in 1904. The great French actress Sarah Bernhardt, performing at the Coliseum that autumn in a season of plays, was the patron of the event. It was in aid of funds for the French Hospital in London where Bernhardt herself had been a patient in 1879. The evening featured some of the greatest stars of the day from all walks of entertainment including Ellen Terry, George Robey, Cicely Courtneidge, Lydia Kyasht, Sir Edward Elgar and Sir Henry J. Wood, as well as Bernhardt herself. The flower-garlanded royal box was full for the occasion, with Prince Arthur of Connaught, the Duchess of Fife, Princess Victoria, King George, the Princess Royal and Queen Mary all in attendance.",
