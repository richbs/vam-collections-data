On the lowest scene the Buddha stands in the centre in frontal position.  Two worshippers  approach from both side: the one on the right is destroyed but for the outline of his head.   Between this figure and the Buddha the bust of Vajrapani appears in the background.   In the second scene the Buddha is seated in meditation on the base decorated with saw-tooth moulding, and again flanked by two worshippers.  The top scene is badly damaged and shows Buddha  standing between two worshippers.\nThe lateral frieze on the right, which is divided into small units, shows naked Erotes alternately standing or kneeling turning to the left in anjalimudra.  In the top field there is Budha seated in meditation.  The margin is adorned with  a leaf moulding.",
