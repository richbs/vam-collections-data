They could be worn to show loyalty, and may also have been given as rewards.\n\nPeople\nThis medal portrays Sir James Harrington (b.1609), a Member of Parliament for the county of Rutland. He commanded part of the Parliamentary army at the battle of Newbury in 1644, an event recorded on the reverse of the medal. He is portrayed on the obverse (front), long-haired and wearing armour, in profile facing left. The reverse is inscribed with his offices and the date of the battle.\n\nAbraham Simon (1617-1692) and his brother Thomas (1618-1665) were the most distinguished native-born medallists working in 17th-century England. They were also responsible for coinage minted under the Commonwealth. In this medal, the portrait was modelled in wax by Abraham and  then cast in silver by  Thomas. Although admired by Thomas Cromwell, who described him as 'ingenious and worthy of incouragement', Thomas Simon later worked for Charles II at the Royal Mint.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe medal was either 'struck' or cast. Struck medals were produced from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. A flat disc was placed between the dies, which were then compressed, so that the design was reproduced on the metal. This technique meant that a high number of medals could be made using the same dies over and over, whereas the technique of casting medals was generally more complex and therefore usually suitable only for smaller numbers.",

Abraham worked for Queen Christina of Sweden and in Holland before returning to England ca. 1643. He was a skillful wax-modeller, as revealed by his self-portrait in that medium (London, BM). \nIn 1645 he was appointed jointly with his brother Engraver of Coins and Seals at the Royal Mint. From around this time they produced many cast and chased portrait medals of distinguished contemporaries. According to Vertue (1780), the medals were cast from Abraham's wax portraits; they were then chased and often signed by Thomas. However, the possibility that Abraham's role also included casting and chasing is suggested by the appearance of his initials on some of the medals. Moreover, as Thomas was an ardent Parliamentarian, it is unlikely that he was involved in the production of those medals that portray noted Royalists. \nMany of the medals thought to be collaborative efforts are of a particular size; they have no legend accompanying the portrait on the obverse, and a reverse consisting solely of a horizontally placed inscription. The earliest of these are either unsigned or signed by Abraham. Signed examples include the medals of John Campbell of Lawers, 1st Earl of Loudoun and William Pope (both 1645) and those of Albert Joachim, Sir Sydenham Poyntz and John Maitland, 2nd Earl of Dunfermline and Charles Seton, 2nd Earl of Lauderdale (all 1646).\nAbraham continued working throughout the period of the Commonwealth: he produced a medallic portrait of Henry Cromwell in 1654. After the Restoration, he modelled a wax portrait of Charles II, but his personality became increasingly difficult, and, failing to obtain commissions, he ended his days in obscurity. \n\nPhilip Attwood: \"Simon\" Grove Art Online.
