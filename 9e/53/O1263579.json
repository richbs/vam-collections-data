He is best known for his invention of the mobile, a term devised by Marcel Duchamp in response to Calder\u2019s innovative kinetic sculptures in the early 1930s. \n\nBy his own account, his first jewellery was made for his sister\u2019s dolls when he was aged 8, out of discarded copper wire. Wire remained an important element in his larger work and his preferred material for jewellery. He worked in both silver and brass, either hammering or twisting the wire to achieve strong, simple forms. \n\nThis pair of cufflinks, each made from a single length of brass wire which has been coiled and beaten, was made for Calder\u2019s friend the architect and writer Stamo Papadaki. Papadaki \u2013 who worked with Le Corbusier and Niemeyer \u2013 had first met Calder in Paris in the 1930s. Some years later when Papadaki and his wife, the artist Audrey Skaling, were looking to move their young family out of Manhattan, Calder suggested a neighbouring property to his own which became their home. Both families moved in the same artistic circles and the friendship lasted over many decades.",
