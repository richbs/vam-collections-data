The collection also includes a full-size version of the hat, which leads to the tempting speculation that the two were made for a young girl and her doll, although the black/white contrast would probably have been considered too noticeable for a well-bred late Victorian-Edwardian child. With the strong contrast of white painted straw and black trims is striking enough to be theatrical, though whether designed by Messel or acquired by him from another production is not known.   \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
