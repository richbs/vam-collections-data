Its original setting is not yet known, but after being dismantled, this panel and nine others (Museum Nos: 207 to 216 - 1894) were bought in Paris by M. Stanislas Baron, a dealer-cum-collector, who was based in Rue Grange-Bateli\u00e8re 28 (Paris), and specialised in Medieval Arabic, Spanish and Sicilian textiles. Baron subsequently sold these panels to the South Kensington in May 1894 for 100 francs. This item was entered in the Registered descriptions as costing eight shillings.\n\nHistorical significance: Ceilings with painted beams and panels are more often associated with Christian Spain, and this included Catalonia, whose coats of arms are emblazoned on No. 216-1894 of this set. The main motifs of the panel, the queens' heads, are Christian but the treatment of their features, particularly their large eyes, and the moresques in the background denote Islamic influence. Although somewhat crudely executed, this panel is a good example of the Islamic style of decoration found in interiors of houses even in the predominantly Christian parts of Spain.",

Examples include the ceiling over the cloister walk of the Monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos, south of Burgos, and the one over the Chapel of Santa Ag\u00fceda in Barcelona. Just as complex geometrical ceilings, supported by box-core pendants and inscribed with Arabic calligraphy, were an example of buildings belonging to Moors, those with painted beams and panels were more often owned by Christians and found in to larger rooms, such as banqueting halls.",
