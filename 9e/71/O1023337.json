London : Published under the authority of the Board of Education, 1926. Publication No. 178 E.I.D.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'DRAWINGS BY SAMUEL PALMER\u2019S FRIENDS, AND HISTORICAL EXHIBITS \n\n[ \u2026 ] \n\nEDWARD CALVERT (c. 1803-1883) \n\nIt is perhaps well to remember that the following little engravings and lithographs (Nos. 31-38) were done form 1827 to 1829, and that Calvert did not arrive in London from the West of England till the close of 1824, when Palmer had already filled and was filling book after book with small designs for pastoral and poetic subjects. Calvert, therefore, was familiar with the chief features of those designs for three years before he made his own. This may account for a resemblance here and there to be found. The distance and middle distance of the small design reproduced on the title-page of Calvert\u2019s <i>Memoir</i> might have been Palmer\u2019s own. By the close of 1824 Palmer had exhibited no fewer than eight works at the Royal Academy and secen at the British Institution. He was six years younger than Calvert, who was a well-trained artist before he settled in London. The exquisite charm and sentiment of his engravings baffles all analysis. \nThe numbers in brackets, <i>e.g.</i> (IX) refer to \u201cEdward Calvert, Ten Spiritual Designs, Enlarged from Proofs of the Originals on Copper, Wood and Stone,\u201d 1913. \n\n[\u2026] \n\n38. The Ploughman (1st state). \n<i>Inscribed on Mount</i> To Samuel Palmer from Edward Calvert. Proof of the block in its first state when only six impressions were taken. \n<i>Cut to</i> (3 \u00bc x 5).  E.660-1920.'",
