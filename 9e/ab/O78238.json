Printed borders were used to conceal the heads of the tacks and to give a neat and finished appearance to the papered wall. The fashion for using borders continued even when methods of hanging wallpapers changed and borders were no longer strictly necessary.  By the early 19th century borders were available in elaborate designs to use as a frieze decoration around the upper part of the room.\n\nUse\nSome wallpaper borders were designed to be used vertically. They would have been pasted over each vertical join between the sheets of wallpaper, giving the effect of a room decorated with a succession of framed panels. The design of this border is appropriate to this kind of use because the pattern shows ivy growing up around a rod or staff. It would probably have been used with a matching wallpaper with a pattern of scattered sprigs of ivy.\n\nPeople\nThis wallpaper comes from the stock of Messrs Cowtan & Sons Ltd, an important interior decorating company based in Oxford Street London, from the 1830s to the 1930s. They succeeded two other well-known wallpaper suppliers, J. Duppa  and J.G. Crace. Cowtan supplied wallpapers to customers all over the country.",
