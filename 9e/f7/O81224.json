It is from the artist's Constellations series of eight digital prints made in 2002 for his exhibition at the London Print Studio. The imagery was derived from interiors, and from groups of Coldwell's recent sculptures. Coldwell explained that the series explored 'that sense of being in two places, a place of the body and a place of the mind'. \n\nThose two spaces are layered in this image. A still life consisting of everyday objects - a shoe, a picture frame, an iron, toilet cleaner, a kettle, bottles and vases - is printed with black dots, left by the inkjet machine used to produce this screenprint. White dots on the pixelated surface form constellations, which are marked up as Leo, Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The mundane objects in the background represent the familiar world, whereas the stars are an unknown space, far removed from the practical reality of ironing and boiling a kettle. The mind escapes the physical environment, reaching far corners of the universe.",
