On 27 May he had written to Miss Bicknell \"My friend John Fisher is half angry with me because I will not pass a little time with him at Salisbury: but I am determined not to friter away the summer, if I can help it\" (L. ed. S., p. 51).  In his letter of 9 August 1812 to Maria Bicknell, Constable says nothing of such a visit and only mentions news of East Bergholt (Beckett, III, p. 83).  Since he was apt to miswrite dates it seems probable that Constable meant to put <i>1821</i> or <i>1820</i>.  The style of drawing would be consistent with one or other of the sketch-books used in 1820; as may be seen from Nos. 190, 191, Constable was near Salisbury on 2 August 1820.",
