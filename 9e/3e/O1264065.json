The dating is based on the cut of the gentleman's coat, even though the wig he wears is somewhat old-fashioned for the period.  Unfortunately his identity is unknown.\nIt is a rather unusual object as, although the basic design is transfer-printed, the coloured enamelling appears to have been done by hand, using the miniaturist technique of stippling.  The underlying transfer-printing would have to have been professionally done, whether at a factory or an independent decorator's workshop.  However, it is possible that the enamelling was done by a professional artist rather than a ceramics painter.",

However, the underlying transfer-printing would have to have been professionally done, whether at a factory or an independent decorator's workshop.  The sitter is unknown and enquiries at the National Portrait Gallery have drawn a blank.\nWith regards the dating of the plaque based on the portrait the following information was received from Susan North, Curator of Fashion:\nDating portraits of the 18th century is always slightly tricky as, once past the age of about 30, they have a distressing tendency to cling to the fashions of their youth for decades!  The key elements here are the wig with queue and double curls (old-fashioned), the high-neck, turned down collar on the coat, along with large plain buttons (all quite fashionable).  David Allan's <i>The Connoisseurs</i> of 1780-81 comes to mind; indeed the older gentleman on the left is very similarly attired.  It's possible that the subject here continued to wear his wig for several more years, so I would say 1780s.",
