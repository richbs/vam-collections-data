Paper\ntissues are a common form of advertising in Japan.\nPackets printed with promotional material are\ndistributed free to passers-by. Although much of\nthe latter is for somewhat dubious services -\ndating agencies and loan sharks for example - many\naccept the tissues and keep them for future use.\nFukuda's tissues were handed out on the streets of\nShinjuku Kabukicho, one of the busiest amusement\nareas of Tokyo. She has appropriated a famous\npainting by Velasquez, 'Las Meninas', shifted its\nviewpoint and then reproduced her version in the \ncontext of give-away tissues.

            "history_note": "This pack was a free gift, one of many issued as part of an installation by Fukuda in the exhibition 'Make Believe', Royal College of Art, 1995. Paper tissues are a common form of advertising in Japan. Packets printed with promotional material are distributed free to passers-by. Although much of the latter is for somewhat dubious services - dating agencies and loan sharks for example - many accept the tissues and keep them for future use. Fukuda's tissues were handed out on the streets of Shinjuku Kabukicho, one of the busiest amusement areas of Tokyo. She has appropriated a famous painting by Velasquez, 'Las Meninas', shifted its viewpoint and then reproduced her version in the context of give-away tissues. She not only alters the associations of the pocket tissues but questions the values of the masterpiece.",
