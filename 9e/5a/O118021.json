There are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian, and each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  Ring brooches differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  \n\nA slanges\u00f8lje is a flat brooch with six openwork crescents surrounding the central hole.  It probably developed from the roses\u00f8lje, and is found in the same region centred on Telemark.  It is called slanges\u00f8lje because the central loops, covered with filigree rings, look like the coils of a snake.  They are usually made of cast silver, imitating filigree, or of real filigree on a cast back plate, as here.  \n\nThis slanges\u00f8lje has the mark of J\u00f8rgen \u00d8sterdal of Seljord stamped three times on the back.  J\u00f8rgen \u00d8sterdal was one of the leading makers of traditional jewellery in Telemark in the nineteenth century.",
