            "physical_description": "A four-armed, three eyed figure dancing with the right foot on the prostrate demon, Apasmara or Muyalaka, signifying ignorance, the destruction of which brings enlightenment.  The figure is surrounded by a circular aureole of flames (jvala mala), symbolising the life of the universe. The front right hand is in abhaya mudra (giving assurance), and  a cobra, bestowing protection, is coiled round the forearm; the rear right hand holds the drum (damaru: symbol of creation) by means of a cord which binds it to the back of the second finger; the rear left hand holds the flame (agni: the element by which the universe will be finally destroyed); the front left arm is stretched across the body in the dancing gesture, gaja or danda hasta.  The hair is dressed close to the crown and surmounted by a fan-shaped headdress of Kondrai leaves (Cassia fistula L.) bearing a crescent moon, Datura flower, skull and cobra.  Behind the head there is a flower-like siras cakra (disc for hanging garlands).  The braided locks which originally flowed out to the sides are broken off and missing.  A thin sash twisted round the waist has its ends flowing to one side.  The costume consists of tiger-skin drawers worn with a girdle, the latter with beaded festoons.   Other details include a multi-threaded sacred cord (one thread of which is divided at the chest); spiral keyura armlets; ear-pendants (makara kundala on the right, patra kundala on the left); padasaras on the feet, and a garter with bell above the right ankle.   The image is mounted on a lotus pedestal with holes for attachment to a processional carrier.  Traces of encrusted carbonate matter in crevices indicate a former period of earth burial.",
