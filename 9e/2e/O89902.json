This illustration of a kneeling mullah holding a book and facing to the right is a pair with its opposite image on page 52A in the album.  The figure is rendered mainly as a line drawing.  Emphasis is achieved on the face by his beard being picked out in white and with a dark line outlining the profile of his nose and forehead under his turban. The folds in his clothing of turban, shawl and robe are lightly shaded with a thin wash.  The mullah is seated in the lower part of the painting on the ground which is rendered in broad strokes of brownish-grey wash which are repeated at the top representing a notional sky.\n      The painting is mounted in a narrow inner border consisting of an inner gold line edged in black rulings, strips of buff-coloured paper with a white inner outline and another narrower gold line with black rulings. A further white outline marks the inner edge of a narrow blueish-grey marbled border picked out with a scrolling floral pattern, which, in turn is edged with a third gold line with black rulings and another white outline.  This inner border is completed by a blue outline which sits on the inner edge of the main border.  This ivory-coloured border is ornamented with a row of stylised flowers painted in blue and grey tones in a marbled effect with gold outlines.  The outer margins of the page have beige coloured strips of paper with an inner white outline with traces of red colouring underneath.  A strip of pinkish-buff paper has been added as a gutter for the album binding.",

The binding is covered with an Indian silk brocade that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799-1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, London, 16-18 January 1956, lot 332A",
