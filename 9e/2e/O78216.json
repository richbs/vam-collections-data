The relief images have been created by embossing and piercing the paper, that is die-stamping the dampened paper.\n\nDesign & Designing\nJ.T. Wood & Co was one of the leading makers of lace paper from the 1840s to 1870s, and issued a large number of greetings cards and memorial cards. After 1850 some manufacturers, such as George Meek, J.T. Wood and Millord Brothers began making cards with 'cameo embossing', that is with larger figurative scenes embossed on to the paper. Here the card takes the shape of a sarcophagus, with the lettering taking the form of a carved inscription. Another impression of this card, unpierced, is E.1506-1987. Another memorial card for Prince Albert by the same maker but a different pierced design is E.1505-1987.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nQueen Victoria was devoted to her husband and when Prince Albert died young, at the age of 42, the Queen's long and deep mourning affected the general public. This memorial card contains the symbols of mourning in the figures of angels and symbolic plants. The later 19th century books of 'The Language of Flowers' were widely used for cards. In this case, however, the symbolism was particularly pertinent to the feelings of the widow Queen. Here ivy symbolises fidelity and mourning while the dog rose symbolises love, in particular the pleasure and pain that love brings, as well as the more general patriotic significance of the Rose of England, the Queen.",
