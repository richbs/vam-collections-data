            "public_access_description": "Photographer Neil Kenlock (born 1950) moved to London from Jamaica in 1963 and became determined to document black pride in the face of racial prejudice. Building on his background in protest photography, Kenlock brought the same sense of confidence to the colour photographs he took of British Caribbean people at home in the 1970s.\n\nThis photograph depicts Kenlock\u2019s future wife Judith on her 21st birthday, as she poses proudly next to her birthday cards and the traditional present of a key. Photographs like this were taken to send to relatives still living in Jamaica, and so it was important to showcase the family\u2019s array of home furnishings and other modern conveniences. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Kenlock alongside work by his contemporaries Charlie Phillips and Armet Francis as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
