The left hand is extended in pataka hasta as though touching the tail of the serpent, and the right hand is in abhaya mudra.  The hair is dressed high into a sort of kesabandha with a conical kirita-mukuta.  Behind the head there is a flower-like siras cakra (disc for hanging gardlands).  Above the right breast is a srivatsa symbol.  The body is naked except for the beaded harness (channavira) and very simple girdle which leaves the genitals exposed.   Other details include patra-kundala ear pendants, keyura armlets, bangles anklets, and padasaras on the feet.  The figure is fixed to a circular lotus pedestal cast in one piece with a square base, the latter with upright tenons for the support of an arched surround or torana, now missing.  The surface of the pedestal is encrusted with carbonate matter indicating former earth-burial.  Examined under a stereo-binocular magnifier, the surface of the figure shows pitting due to corrosion.",
