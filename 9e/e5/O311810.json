Groom Napier, who laid claim to the title of Prince of Mantua and Montferrat through his mother's family, wrote about and promoted teetotalism, vegetarianism, evangelism and the natural and applied sciences. He was evidently also a fantasist on a grand scale. This medal forms part of a series issued for him in 1879, which he bestowed (by post) on various eminent men. These medals are identical except for the name of the recipient: some including Gladstone, refused the honour. \nThe present medal was evidently intended for John Ruskin, but his reaction is unknown. Groom Napier claimed that he was reviving a 'Mantua & Montferrat Medal Fund' which had been created by his ancestor Lodovico Gonzaga in the 14th century, to confer recognition on men eminent in arts, letters and science.",
