This bookwork was produced at the beginning of his artistic career at a time when he was undergoing treatment for cancer. Bichard uses this experience as a source of inspiration for his work. 'X-ray song' is a book containing a fold-out poem in three parts and a silk-screened photo collage recounting an experience with radiotherapy. The book is presented in a deluxe box inlaid with a copy of the C.A.T. scan of the artist's thorax and abdomen and a portion of a stitch from the surgery he underwent. The use of highly personal material brings the viewer very close to his own harrowing experience of living with and overcoming this illness.",
