The coat has been decorated using three techniques: patchwork, embroidery and appliqu\u00e9. A strip of blue leather, embroidered with a meandering stem of leaves and flower heads, has been inserted into the natural brown leather that forms the cloak. Sprays of stylised flowers and leaves have been embroidered onto the brown leather using satin-stitch, with the silk thread taken all the way through the leather and back again. The scalloped band of leather running across the lower end of the image has been applied on top of the brown leather actually covering part of the embroidery. The garment has been finished with tabs and tassels. Its decoration demonstrates how skilfully tough leather can be worked. This occupation requires great strength and was always the preserve of men.\n\nThe ravages of wear and time have changed the appearance of this cloak. Many of the coloured skins have faded from their original rather acid tones and most of the wool has decayed and fallen out, although part of a deep border of black lambskin can be seen at the very bottom of the image.",
