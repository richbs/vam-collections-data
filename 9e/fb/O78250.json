In this technique, the design is marked out by drawing with an etching needle into a thin waxy layer - known as 'the ground' - coating a metal printing plate. The channels drawn into the wax expose the metal beneath. The waxed plate is then dipped in acid, which eats into the metal not protected by 'the ground', and so creates the grooves that hold the ink from which the image is to be printed.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis print is an illustration to a poem by Peter Coxe, The Social Day, published in 1822. This poem was inspired by daily life at Highgrove, a country house in Gloucestershire, now home to the Prince of Wales.\n\nThe poem celebrates the benefits of passing leisure time constructively. This print is an illustration to the following lines:\n\nShould chess allure, the board is spread\nAnd intellectual contest fed ...\n\nThe print shows several adults studiously occupied. The couple on the left play chess, while the others sew, read or appreciate a painting. The children follow the example of the adults and involve themselves in instructive activities. The two elder children look at a globe, while the smaller child plays with letters on the floor.\n\nPeople\nHenry Singleton was a painter and illustrator. He produced illustrations for books and periodicals, including The Spectator and The Tatler. He was especially noted for his paintings inspired by the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.",
