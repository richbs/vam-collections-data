The text is as follows: VANNI, FRANCESCO (1563-1610) 402 St Francis of Assis receiving the Child from the Virgin Mary Red chalk heightened with white on pale brown paper 10 3/8 x 8 3/8 (264 x 213) Dyce 182 PROVENANCE Pierre crozat (sale, Paris, 1741); ? Marquis de Calivi\u00e8re d\u2019Avignon (sale, Paris, 1779); ? De Saint-Yves (sale, Paris, 1805); ? Rossi (sale, London, 1844); Dyce Bequest 1869; see the note below for a discussion of this provenance LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no 1 82 (as by Vanni); Bernice Davidson, \u2018A painting and a drawing by Francesco Vanni\u2019 in Bulletin of Rhode Island School of Design (Providence, Rhode Island), December 1958, p. 4 and p. 14, fig. 7 A large oil painting by Vnni and two engravings reproduce the same composition. The picture, dated 1599, was painted for the church of N\u00f4tre-Dame-des-Anges, Lyon. It is now in the Art Museum of the Rhode Island School of Design (B. Davidson, loc. Cit. fig. 6). One of the two engravings is by Cornelis Galle the Elder (Le Blanc, 2, p. 262, no. 20). It is in the same direction as the drawing. The other, by an unknown engraver, was published by Francesco Salini and dedicated to Marchese Guido Pepoli. It is in the reversed direction; there is an impression in the Department (Dyce 1516). Our drawing is probably the one described in P. J. Mariette\u2019s catalogue of Crozat\u2019s drawings (1741) as \u2018le S. Fran\u00e7ois don\u2019t le tableau est a Lyon\u2019 (lot 90). Mariette refers to Crozat\u2019s drawing again in his Abecedario (Archives de l\u2019art fran\u00e7ais) 6, 1859-60, p. 29, where he suggests that it was made by Vanni expressly to be engraved. \u2018Vanni etait curieux de faire luy m\u00eame des dessins tr\u00e8s ar\u00eates de ses tableaux qu\u2019il faisait graver.\u2019 Some of the outlines of our drawing have been incised with a stilus. Mireur (Dictionnaire des Ventes d\u2019Art, 7, 1912, pp. 277-78) quotes descriptions of the same drawing or of other similar drawings by Vanni in the three last sale catalogues listed here under \u2018Provenance\u2019. In the Saint-Yves catalogue the Saint is named as St Fran\u00e7ois de Paule, obviously a mistake by the complier that does not prove that the drwawing was not the one now in our collection. The Dyce Catalogue states, without giving reasons, that our drawing was in the Lnaone and St Ive collections. Neither of these names occurs in F. Lugt, Repertoire des catalogues de vente publique, covering the period for 1600-1900. St Ive may be a corruption of Saint-Yves. Lanone may be a corruption of La Noue: but the well known collector Desneux de la Noue (see Lugt 661) died before 1657, and a provenance going so far back in time can hardly be accepted without more evidence than this.",
