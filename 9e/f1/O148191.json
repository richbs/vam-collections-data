He died sometime after 1706. Born in Ostia (near Rome), he travelled to Venice aged 22 and on to Paris. He was private secretary to Nicolas Fouquet, Minister of Finances in France 1653-61 under Louis XIV, for whom it has been suggested that he worked in a diplomatic role, perhaps even as a secret agent. Fouquet fell from favour and was imprisoned by the King from 1661 until he died. Bertinet was also imprisoned for eight years due to his association with Fouquet. \n\nBetween 1671 and 1687 Bertinetti made several bronze portrait medals of Louis XIV, one of them during his time in prison. There are several examples in the National collection of medals in France (Cabinet des Medailles de la Bibliotheque Nationale de France, rue Richelieu, Paris). The V&A medal features the best known of Bertinet\u2019s portraits of the King, wearing a most impressive large wig. It exists in a number of versions, and sometimes these medals were incorporated into objects of a later date (for example on a clock in the V&A collection, M.4-1903).\n\nThe reverse of this medal shows the Royal cipher and crown in very low relief.",
