W. Godwin. The department became known for its brand of 'Aesthetic' dress, inspired by costumes of the past, and made in beautiful silks, some made in India, dyed in vibrant but natural colours.\n\nThe remarkable 'rainbow' lining is a type of fabric known as a stri\u00e9 or dip-dyed silk. A similarly-constructed coat appears in a Liberty catalogue of 1907 priced at 7 guineas. A seamstress at the time would struggle to earn 2 guineas a week, a comparison which indicates the wealthy, upper middle-class character of the typical Liberty customer.",

The embroidery on the coat is very typical of the 'aesthetic' style and the pomegranate motif can be found in contemporary Liberty prints. There is very little doubt that the coat was made in the Liberty work-rooms.",
