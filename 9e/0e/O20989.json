The border has a pattern of leaves and leaf-scrolls in similar colours.  Three stilt marks on the front (9 cms point to point).  On the back the date 1657 is painted boldly in blue within the foot-rim and again just outside it.\nBody colour: Mid buff.\nGlaze: White.  Dull pinkish white tin-glaze, possibly over a pale slip, covers the entire back.  The foot-rim has been wiped virtually entirely clean of glaze.\nShape: Shape A.

            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is a typical delftware (tin-glazed earthenware) display dish of the mid-17th century. The wide rim painted with an elaborate floral border serves as a frame for the comparatively small central well, which depicts an imaginary urban landscape.\n\nCollectors & Owners\nCollectors did not take delftware seriously until the supply of slipware (wares of coarse red clay decorated with a white liquid clay known as slip) and other pre-industrial earthenware began to dry up in the early 20th century. This neglect was partly because delftware was completely unrelated to fashionable Staffordshire pottery. Its status continued to rise, especially after the publication of ProfessorFrederick Horace Garner's English Delftware in 1948. Even as late as the 1960s, however, it was still  plentiful and fairly inexpensive. This enabled obsessive collectors such as the architect and ceramic historian Louis Lipski (1914-1979)  to amass huge collections with a comparatively small outlay. \n\nFrom that time onwards, collectors began to search for early pieces made for the mass market  that had descended through families and been long forgotten. This dish, for example, was bought by a dealer at a country sale in 1970 and initially offered to the V&A for \u015380. The Museum declined, after which it passed through Sotheby's auction house and was later acquired by the V&A for a somewhat higher market value. Since then, research into the early London potteries has firmly placed this unpretentious dish at the heart of a group of delftwares. They were probably made at the first Southwark pottery at Pickleherring Quay, when it was under the management of Richard Newnham (between  about 1645 to about 1684),  whose initials this dish bears. The various forms and types of decoration encompassed by this group now provide an invaluable repertoire of clues for the identification of other Pickleherring products.",
