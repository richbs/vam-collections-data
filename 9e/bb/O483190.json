The wooden base is lacquered to a dark brown colour on which is painted floral patterns in gold and silver( now tarnished). In the centre is a medallion formed by four stylished pomegranates and a 'double happiness' character. Round the edges are leafy meandering stems.\nThe pomegranate is a symbol of 'many sons'. With the double happiness character it is very likely that the tray was used on the occasion of a wedding, when the bride went round to offer tea to senior members of guests.\n(Ming W 29/9/98)",
