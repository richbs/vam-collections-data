It was probably drawn backstage when he was appearing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 29 August 1904. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums. This drawing shows Stanley relaxing in a smoking jacket. Cooke also depicted him at the same time in a comical stage outfit of baggy brown trousers and a brown bowler hat, which more accurately reflected his act as a comedian.",
