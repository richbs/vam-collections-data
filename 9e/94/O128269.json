Settling in Madrid in the early 1850s, Clifford became court photographer to Isabella II and accompanied the Queen on a number of royal tours within the country. \nClifford specialised in the photography of architectural subjects and industrial projects and his work is particularly notable for his technical mastery of the large format view. His unusual treatment of architectural spaces has made him one of the most famous 19th century photographers in Spain. He belonged to both the Soci\u00e9te Fran\u00e7aise de Photographie and the Architectural Photographic Association.",
