They are said to  have been made by the foundry at Lamberhurst, Sussex. (See, E. Straker, Wealden  Iron, p.272). According to the accounts in the Cathedral Library they were delivered between  September 13th 1710 and June 10th 1714, and payment was made to, \"Richard Jones  Smith, of a sum of \u00a311,202 0s 6d, being for 200 tons 2 quarters 25lbs, at 6d per lb\". (See, E. Straker, p.207). Wren, the cathedral's architect, apparently wanted neither a fence around the building, nor if there had to be one, that it should be of cast rather than wrought iron. He was however, over-ruled by the Whig-biased Rebuilding Commission, at whose suggestion  Richard Jones had tendered. On September 20th, 1710, Jones was paid \u00a31,000 on account for the fence; Wren attended no further meetings of the Commission. (See, Judith Hook, The Baroque Age in England\", p.101, and The Wren Society, xvi, p.149).",
