Even the largest pieces weigh only a few grams.\n\nHuge pendants and earrings like this were worn throughout northern and central Italy in the first half of the 19th century.  The design is based on older aristocratic jewellery, but the execution is uniquely Italian.\n\nThis earring was bought for \u00a33 12s.
