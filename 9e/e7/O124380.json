His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMozart\u2019s comic opera The Abduction from the Seraglio was one of four Mozart operas performed  at Glyndebourne in 1956 to celebrate the bi-centenary of his birth.  Messel\u2019s exuberant designs are inspired by eighteenth century Western European art and design and its fascination for the Orient, in harmony with the spirit of Mozart\u2019s opera.\n\nMessel created numerous scaled drawings on tracing paper for the architectural details of Bassa Selim's palace.  He  borrowed motifs from Oriental style pavilions depicted in eighteenth century English tapestries and Meissen porcelain for the arches, domes and lattice windows.",
