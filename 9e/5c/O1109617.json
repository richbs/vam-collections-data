Inscribed on the backboard in black paint: <i>689E</i> [truncated?]. A nearly illegible early ink inscription: possibly <i>P[ ...  Anne[ ... ]/ Gr[ ... ]</i>; and on an old paper label, in ink: <i>C</i> or possibly <i>E</i>, and a flourish in graphite. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> As for Cat. No. 200 [Acquired by John Jones from an unrecorded source, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, February 1882]. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> As for Cat. No. 200 [Long 1923, p. 117, no. 690 (as 'Unknown British artist after Wissing'); Long 1930, p. 84; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 66]. \n\nLike its companion, Cat. No. 200, this miniature seems to derive from Lely rather than from Wissing - Wissing's Mary of 1685 (1) is very clearly distinct from this image. Lely's <i>Mary</i> of 1677 (2) should be the source, but in that case it would be a looser adaptation of its model in pose and accompaniments than Cat. No. 200, with the likeness less firmly realised. Long in fact doubted whether the sitter was Mary at all. Having seen a full-size version of the portrait at Christie's in 1933, (3) catalogued as <i>Countess of Sunderland</i> by Lely, he considered the three wives of Charles, 3rd Earl of Sunderland: (4) Arabella Cavendish (m. 1694/5),Anne Churchill (m. 1699/1700) and Judith Tichborne (m. 1717) but rejected them all, partly because they were too late. Because he linked both Cat. No. 200 and this miniature with Wissing, Long's tendency anyway had been to look later rather than earlier for a sitter, but, in correspondence with Ian Richardson in Oxford (14 June 1933) in connection with an apparently similar (but actually later and unrelated) miniature at the Ashmolean, he showed that he had come round to thinking of Lely as the source for this miniature, though he still had no settled ideas as to the sitter. \n\nThe iconography of Mary has been confused, as Oliver Millar shows, even in the records of the Royal Collection. She is often confused with Mary of Modena, (5) and especially of course with her younger sister Anne (1665-1714). Possibly the inscription on the back board here indicates a similar confusion. \n\n1 Millar 1963, vol. I, no. 323, vol. II, pl. 136. \n2 Ibid., no. 250, vol.II, pl. 105. \n3 31 March 1933, lot 74. \n4 Long would have known that there was no resemblance to the famous Lely image of Anne Digby, the 2nd Earl's Countess, painted in 1666, at Althorp. \n5 Millar 1963, vol. I, no. 250.\" \n",
