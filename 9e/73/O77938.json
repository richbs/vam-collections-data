Such objects were often intended as 'cabinet' pieces to display the owner's taste and wealth, although this example may also have been used.\n\nPeople\nAfter his failed porcelain venture at Nantgarw, in 1814 the much-travelled ceramic decorator William Billingsley was invited by Lewis Weston Dillwyn of the Cambrian Pottery at Swansea to add prestigious porcelain to their manufacture. When the partnership was dissolved in 1817, many of the stockpiled porcelain blanks were sold to independent decorators such as the talented John Powell in London, where the market for such costly pieces lay. Powell alternated between decorating and dealing in china, and teaching his craft to others, notably to members of the Royal Family.\n\nTime\nAlthough Paris hard-paste porcelain remained popular in Britain during the Napoleonic Wars, it was the soft-paste porcelain of the S\u00e9vres factory which the British really craved, and which the factory had abandoned in 1802. When sales of factory blanks proved insufficient to satisfy the demand, English entrepreneurs such as William Billingsley perfected a glassy frit porcelain body with which they could imitate the S\u00e9vres paste as a perfect background for enamelling in the French or English style.",
