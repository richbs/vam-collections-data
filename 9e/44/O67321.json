Although this particular piece is signed and dated 1863, an exhibition of 'Mr Lough's sculptures' held at his studio in July 1847 confirms that he had already produced a figure of Titania by that time, and he also exhibited a version at the International Exhibition of 1851. The architectural journal The Builder also reviewed a display of Shakespearean works by Lough held at the British Institution in 1850, which it said 'was particularly successful, and did honour to the sculptor, to whom England may point with great satisfaction'.\n\nThe model for this figure (which no longer survives) was among those bequeathed by the sculptor to the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, displayed at Elswick Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne, from 1877.",
