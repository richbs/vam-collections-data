Her light brown crepe hair wig, decorated with yellow ribbons, is attached over carved hair, and her right hand is closed as if to hold props. She wears a green and cream striped cotton skirt (probably modern), a green belt (possibly new) and a three-quarter length cream cotton over-tunic with drawn thread-work at the chest and on the sleeves (possibly originally a table-cloth), hooked at the back as a fastening - possibly an original garment.  She wears blue wool knitted stockings,  pink cotton knickers (original) under a petticoat with tucks and lace edging (possibly a recycled 19th century petticoat or christening robe).\n\nOval flat wood pelvis and yoke, with head hollow.  Stuffed body, but flexible.  Legs attached with leather loops; upper arms constructed of stuffed cloth tubes, tacked on to the shoulders.\n\nTwo control bars; the 5-notch bar having traces of being equipped with a head-rod, and therefore not necessarily used originally with this figure. There is an eyelet between the shoulders for a string.",

Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This peasant girl who would have been a stock character, used in any play requiring a simple, hard-working girl. Her right hand is carved in a closed position, made to hold a prop, and some of her clothes were probably made from items belonging to the troupe, such as a drawn thread-work tablecloth for her tunic, and a Christening robe for her petticoat.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, an expert puppet carver, manipulator and puppet historian, whose widow sold them to the Museum after his death in 1998.",

It is possible, however, to distinguish distinct types, and therefore groups, made by different makers, due to the type of carving.  The carver of this object has been distinguished as Maker B because of  the standard size of the head.",
