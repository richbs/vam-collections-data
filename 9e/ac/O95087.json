Catalogue entry 236 describes 'An Electro-Plated and Parcel-Gilt Candlestick' of 'German silver, cast in sand moulds and afterwards plated and gilt by the electro-processes.' In 1861 Alexander Parkes, Elkingtons' chief metallurgist, described his 1845 patent for gilding with electricity: 'This I effect by pencilling by hand or by printing from plates or rolls upon paper the required design in any suitable stopping varnish or colour. This I place on the article to be embellished and gently press or rub the same and allow it to dry for an hour or so, when the gold design may be given to the article by any known Electro-process of gilding. After the design is gilt, the stopping out varnish or colour is removed by turpentine or alkalis or acids and the design may be left dead or it may be burnished as required.' Elkingtons' pattern books suggest the company sold the candlestick in a variety of finishes including gilt and oxid\u00e9 (oxidized).",
