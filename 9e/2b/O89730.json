M\u00e9tivet was a painter and an illustrator, and he contributed illustrations to humorous periodicals. His posters, including this one, are recognised as classics. Eug\u00e9nie Buffet sang in Paris at the Ambassadeurs caf\u00e9-concert and projected the persona of a Parisian working girl in her performances. This poster supports that image. It shows her walking down a street, a wintery wind blowing her skirt and scarf, her hands stuffed deep in her pockets to shield them from the cold. She gazes intensely at the viewer. Tones of grey dominate the poster, and the eye is drawn to Buffet's face, with her red scarf and rosy cheeks.",
