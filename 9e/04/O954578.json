He was a major figure in natural sciences research during the early 19th century. He devloped on the work of Linnaeus, Buffon and Hunter, undertaking comprehensive research into the comparative anatomy of animals. His most renowned work was the <i>Le R\u00e8gne animal destribu\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s son organisation</i>' ('The Animal Kingdom Arranged in Conformity with Its Organization'), which first appeared as four volumes in 1817 and was expanded and revised in the following years.\n\nEdward Griffith (1790-1858), a solicitor and amateur naturalist, translated the work into English for publication in London by G. B. Whittaker in 1827. Griffith was a member of the Zoological Society and a fellow of the Linnaean and Royal Societies. He appended much new material to Cuvier\u2019s work, expanding it to fifteen volumes. \n\nPlates used to illustrate the work were mainly by Griffith or his artist wife, Harriet, but more accomplished illustrations were provided by the printmaker Thomas Landseer, who reproduced many of the wildlife paintings of his brother, Sir Edwin Landseer.\n\nWritten with reference to:\n<i>\"All Nature is so full\": Man and other animals</i>, an electronic format of a Special Collections exhibition at Kings College London.\nSee: http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iss/archivespec/learn-exhib/exhibitions/sc/allnature/ \nAccessed: 13/10/2010",
