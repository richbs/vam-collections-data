It was designed by Marjorie Field in the 1940s for the haute couture firm Field Rhoades which was registered in the London street directories at 77, South Audley Street, London W1 from 1948 to 1949.  \n\nThree smaller pencil sketches show details of the front and back views of the dress without the jacket, and back of the jacket. The design is inscribed with the name of the fabrics ('crepe' and 'printed crepe') out of which the dress is intended to be made. This design would have been used as a presentation drawing, for the client to decide which model they wanted to have made, as is evident from the note 'Reserved for Mrs Cosmo Russell.'  This design was for a garment to be made to measure exclusively for this particular client.",
