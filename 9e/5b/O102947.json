            "public_access_description": "This ivory comb is made in France in ca. 1550. Ivory combs, together with mirror cases and gravoirs for parting the hair, formed an essential part of the trousse de toilette or \u00e9tui (dressing case) of the typical wealthy lady or gentleman in the period. The two leading cities for ivory carving were Paris and Dieppe. Luxury items, such as combs were often made in Paris, especially during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During the seventeenth century Dieppe became increasingly significant for small-scale sculpture in ivory, perhaps because it was a port. There are commentators that have noted that the subject matter implies a Netherlandish, rather than a French origin, but that the ornamental details of scrolls and masks correspond with known French examples.",
