            "physical_description": "Panelled oak chest with three front panels, each one containing an inlay chevron within a rectangular channel moulding.\n\nOak chest of joined construction, with three decorated panels on the front below a top rail carved with fluting, three plain panels at the back, and both ends with two narrow panels. The front with two moulded muntins separating three similar panels. On the front and ends each stile has a scratch ovolo moulding where it borders a panel. The lower front rail with an ovolo scratch moulding along its bottom arris. Each panel contains a chevron of two colour inlay set within a rectangular border formed by a concave channel which runs out to the edge of the panel at 12, 3, 6  and 9 o'clock (the channel is formed by a series of scratch mouldings that flank a wide cavetto set with punchmarks). On the front the top rail (internal face) is fitted with a lock, apparently of relatively recent date, which covers the area that would have been occupied by an earlier lock, and exterior keyhole with metal sleeve. Each end has a moulded muntin dividing two tall, narrow plain panels. The back with undecorated muntins and stiles enclosing three panels, roughly chamfered. The rear stiles are cut back at the top by 3cm, apparently so that the rear edge of the lid turns on its hinges freely when it is fully opened. The lid is formed from two butted planks (which appear to have been reglued and supported at one time by nailed blocks now missing), and is moulded along its front and ends. It is held by two modern strap hinges which appear to be replacements for hinges of similar form. The interior of the chest fitted with a lidded till at the left (PR) end. The bottom formed by 4 wide and 1 narrow oak boards running front to back, which meet at V joints, and are nailed up (with cut nails) into the lower rails.\n\nWith a pigmented varnish over the front, ends and lid. The interior with pale, bare wood. Bruising in places and some deterioaration of the wood on the rear feet. The left rear upright has an unusual split across its width. There are several areas of tear-out in the surface of the oak that seem unlikely to have been produced with hand-tools, possibly indicating the use of power tools, alongside hand-tools to create an authentic surface quality. The 3 decorated front panels display noticeably wobbly scratch-moulded lines and inlay of crude quality (particularly when compared to the care over the structural elements).\n\nThe lack of wear ( noticeably on the feet, till, and bottom boards), very pale colour of timber other than where a heavy pigmented varnish has been applied, and metalwork of traditional pattern but recent date suggest that this chest may date not c1600-50, as it purports to be, but later, perhaps c.1900. Although it was acquired as 17th-cetury, it may have been made as a replica rather than a fake, given the care with which it has been made using traditional techniques and that minimal distressing is evident on its surface. Another possibility is that the lid and top rail of the back (and probably parts of the till) have been replaced, the process of which caused damage to the left back upright.",
