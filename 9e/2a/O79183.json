Pilgrims to the Holy Land frequently passed through Cyprus, and the Cypriot goldsmiths absorbed influences from Western Europe as well as Ottoman Turkey.  Their work is similar to jewellery from elsewhere in the region, but the quality is often higher.  For their finest work they used niello or filigree.  The goldsmiths of Cyprus were famous for their filigree, often enriched with coloured enamels.  \n\nThese beads are typical of Cypriot filigree, and this precise pattern is not found elsewhere.  They were called toutounia, which probably derives from an Italian word for buttons or beads.  They would have been worn as a necklace, alternating with coral beads and with a pendent filigree and coral cross hanging from the centre.",
