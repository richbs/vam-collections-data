It marks a departure from an explicit referencing of the two cultures, but it shares the exuberant decoration of the earlier works, with use of gold pigment and with the addition of collage elements. The subject matter here is political in a broad sense, addressing the issue of climate change which has implications for all of us. By including scraps of the Financial Times newspaper, and images of aircraft, Shonibare suggests that globalisation, the increasing interdependency of national economies, and the growth of air travel and trade (air-lifting flowers and vegetables from Africa to the UK, for example) are all parts of the bigger picture behind the manifestations of climate change.",
