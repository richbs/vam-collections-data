He stands against a plain buff-coloured background on a washed-in band of green.  He is bearded and wears a green and gold turban with a feathered and jewelled <i>sarpeche</i>.  He is dressed in a mauve jama sprigged with gold flowers and a fall of green lappets under his right arm.  He wears a short orange <i>patka</i> with golden end-borders decorated with red stylised flowers and a fringe.  His <i>paijama</i> below has green and gold stripes and he is shod with crimson shoes patterned in gold.  He has an ornamented dagger (<i>katar</i>) at his waist and he bears a round shield hanging from a red and white cord from his right shoulder.  He is further armed with a curved sword and decorated scabbard and hilt, both of which have white grounds and a meandering foliated design.\nThe face is delicately modelled and shaded,and appears to have been painted over an initial attempt which has been blocked out with paint.\n      The painting is framed with two strips of pale brown and navy blue paper picked out with scrolling designs in gold and accented with black, white and blue lines together with narrow strips of gold paper.  The painting is pasted onto a border with an ivory-coloured ground painted with alternate red poppies and pink lilies outlined in gold.  The outer edges of the border have strips of pale brown paper highlighted with a white line. A pinkish-beige paper strip has been added to the inner edge of the page as a gutter for the binding of the album. The edges of the page have been gilded.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal paintings, drawings and flower studies on both sides. The album is covered with a striped Indian brocade, patterned with rows of floral sprigs, possibly made in southern India.  The silk may have been cut from a length brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.
