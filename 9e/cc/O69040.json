It was previously known as the Ladies Society for the Relief of Negro Slaves.  The bag was probably intended as a sewing work-bag.Abolitionist women set up sewing circles where objects decorated with abolitionist emblems were produced. The image of the black slave mother with her child printed on the front of this bag was one of a series commissioned specifically by the Society for distribution in albums and on their propaganda merchandise. Another bag in the V&A's collection is printed with another image from the series. The significance of this image of a mother is that it countered the common stereotype of the time of black women as licentious and lustful, and therefore tempters of owners and overseers, or at least the architects of their own abuse at the hands of owners and overseers.  These images were very successful in encouraging an emotional enagagement with the plight of slave women, but in the long term passive stereotypes such as these were very detrimental in the struggle against racism.",

Women were particularly involved in the dissemination of abolitionist material culture, such as bags, pin-cushions, jewellery, prints and pamphlets, particularly in the late 1820s when women became increasingly significant in the movement.\nBritain officially ended participation in the slave trade in 1807, though British banks continued to provide credit to foreign traders and the institution of slavery remained intact in the British Empire. Slavery was not abolished in British territories until 1834 (the Emancipation Act was passed in 1833), though slaves were required to serve a further 7 years as apprentices to their masters.",
