            "public_access_description": "Sir William Henry Bragg and his son William were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915 for the invention of X-ray crystallography. This new science enabled the first drawings of the arrangement of atoms within molecules. It was particularly developed as one of the most significant and exciting branches of science during the late 1940s and put Britain at the cutting edge of international research. In 1946 Dr Helen Megaw, a Crystallographer (Crystallography \u2013 a study of the structure of matter) suggested that the patterns made by X-ray crystallography could be used as a fresh source of inspiration for wallpaper and fabric designers. The patterns were considered particularly appropriate for use in textile design because of their repetitive symmetry and natural beauty.\n\nThis sample pattern, based on China Clay, has been printed on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheeting. It was produced by the Dunlop Rubber Company for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Printed PVC sheeting was a new experimental product and the development of this material was Dunlop\u2019s main focus at that time. Prototypes were shown in the Regatta Restaurant and Dome of Discovery at the festival, but the products themselves were not commercially available. The idea of patterns inspired by science was perfect for the theme of the festival, which had been planned as a \u2018combined exhibition of science, technology and industrial design\u2019.",

            "history_note": "X-ray crystallography involved projecting a narrow beam of X-rays on to crystalline material. Photographs were then taken of the diffracted X-rays, and the resulting lines or spots were used to plot 'maps' indicating the relationships between atoms. For the first time ever it enabled scientist to work out the structure of atoms within molecules. Britain was a world leader in the field of crystallography and during the post war period this was one of the most significant and stimulating branches of science.",
