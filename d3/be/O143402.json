F Talbot's photographic discoveries in the late 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produced a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\n\nIn 1853, Jones moved to Belgium and remained there until the death of his wife in 1856. Several of the photographs from this section of the album were made in Boulogne and it is likely that Jones used the Channel crossing to this port.",
