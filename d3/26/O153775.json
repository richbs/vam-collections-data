The bust represents an unknown man wearing a robe or gown of rich diapered stuff. This bust was originally acquired from the University of Padua. In type the portrait is related to works by Alessandro Vittoria, but it is more rigid in pose and tight in handling. These characteristics relate it to the bust of Sperone Speroni in the Cathedral of Padua which was commissioned about 1588 from Francesco Segala but completed and signed by Girolamo Pagliari, who may also have been responsible for this bust.",
