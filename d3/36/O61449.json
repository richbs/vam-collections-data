Designed by the architect, Richard Norman Shaw, the inn was furnished with a set of settles and chairs, including this example. The shape of the chair, with its back splat and shaped arms, shows the influence of eighteenth-century furniture designs on Arts and Crafts makers. It may have been made by Morris & Co., who illustrated a very similar chair in their early twentieth-century catalogue, or by William Birch, a firm of chair-makers in High Wycombe, who produced an upholstered version of the chair for dining rooms.",

She recommended the acquisition of this chair, one of several examples, from the licensees, Messrs. Patrick & Macgregor.\n\nWhen originally acquired, the chair was thought to have been possibly designed in the office of the architect, Richard Norman Shaw, who designed the Tabard Inn 1879-1880. In 2008 Andrew Saint, author of the standard work on Shaw, confirmed that it was unlikely that Shaw's office were responsible as there is no evidence to support this theory. The chair might have been made by Morris & Co. who illustrated a similar design, 'Hampton Court', for an armchair, price 53s 6d (\u00a32 92p), and a single chair, price 32s (\u00a31 60p), in their catalogue c. 1912. A much closer design, with an upholstered seat instead of the rush drop in seat on Circ. 24-1958, was illustrated by William Birch & Son, High Wycombe, in their catalogue of Dining Room chairs, n.d., page 16, no. 2766 (photocopy in Craftsmen file, FTF Information Section), and it is possible that this firm was actually responsible for the Tabard Inn chairs.",
