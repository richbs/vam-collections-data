Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of an ox.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed with the carver\u2019s name. This example is signed \u2018Tomotada\u2019. Izumiya Tomotada was one of three great netsuke carvers active in Kyoto during the late 18th century. Works by Masanao and Yoshinaga, the other two Kyoto carvers, are comparatively rare. However, there is a large group of netsuke signed \u2018Tomotada\u2019 that are of good or exceptional quality. It is known that even in Tomotada\u2019s lifetime there were many forgeries of his work, so identification of genuine signatures is difficult.\n\nTomotada specialised in animal subjects, especially tigers and oxen. There are numerous examples of reclining oxen or of an ox with its young that have a Tomotada signature. This particular netsuke is one of the best examples of the subject and is probably by the master himself.",
