The seat consists of two crossed beams mounted on four dowel posts glued into the runners (2 per runner) and of two outer slats which extend to slot into the tops of the runners and two shorter inner slats. The slats are nailed to the cross beams. The cross beams form the base from which four further dowel posts are glued to hold the seat back. The posts each have a deep cut at the top into which slots a semicircular thin wooden length forming the back. Where the wood passes through the slots in the posts there are small nails. At the front between the runners and below the slats is nailed a wooden bar which has a hole in its centre through which a pulling string would have been passed.",
