It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe  musical Rose Marie by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II with music by Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart, was a great success when it originally opened at London's Drury Lane Theatre in London in 1925.  It was still sufficiently popular for Tom Arnold to bring a version of it on ice to the New Theatre Oxford for two weeks, opening on 15 June 1953.  With a company of  70, a corps de ballet of 50 and an augmented orchestra, it was described as 'the world's first and most glamorous musical on ice'.",

            "history_note": "The artist of these caricatures, Gilbert Sommerlad, was by profession a musician who was born into a family that had a long tradition of professional musicians.   In 1936 he moved to the recently built New Theatre, Oxford, to join his brother Roy (violin and clarinet) as resident pianist.\n\nGilbert was an exceptionally good and popular rehearsal pianist, and visiting companies and individual performers used to make sure that he would be available.  He became well-known in the profession and his ability as a caricaturist became common knowledge.  The volume that includes this drawing contains sketches mostly of musical directors and conductors working at the Oxford New Theatre with Gilbert Sommerlad.\n\n<i>Rose Marie on Ice</i> produced by Tom Armold opened at the New Theatre Oxford for a two-week run commencing Monday 15th June 1953.",
