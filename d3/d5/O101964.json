The costume itself dates from 1981, when it was remade for the singer Eric Shilling.  \nAlthough the costume followed Walker's design, or was copied from the original costume, different makers have different solutions to making up a costume or creating decorative effects - thus a pattern can be painted, embroidered or appliqu\u00e9d; the original fabric and trims may no longer be available; the new singer may be a completely different shape.  Thus it is possible to have two costumes made to the same design that look quite different.  \nBetween them this costume has six different names on the labels in the coat and breeches.  Costumes will be worn by different performers of often very different shapes over the years - and have to be altered accordingly.  \nThe costume is extremely heavy and, while this can help the singer achieve the correct stance and dignity for the role, it must have been exhausting, hot and uncomfortable to wear under the powerful stage lights, let alone cope with the extreme physical demands of singing opera.",
