The front shows three children with a puppy, playing Cowboys and Indians: a girl wearing a blue dress and feathered headdress, a boy in a cowboy outfit, and a boy in a striped shirt with brown shorts and a feathered headband, who is visible through the cut-out opening of the teepee.  The card opens to show the boy with the striped shirt beneath a tree, accompanied by the puppy and a girl in a yellow dress and a feathered headband, and a bid with a feathered headband flying away; the wording reads \nHAPPY DAYS 4 YEAR OLD\nwith the large figure four embossed with a textured pattern and printed in gold.  The verse reads:\nTake a peep inside this tent,\nAnd you will see what I have sent,\nAn Indian Chieftain and his squaw\nAnd a little pup who waves a paw,\n\"It's Happy Birthday' Time\" they cry,\nAnd that's the jolly reason why,\nWe wish you luck and shout \"HOORAY !\nYou're FOUR exciting years today\".",
