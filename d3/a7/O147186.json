The colours are blue, green, yellow, red, white and shades of purple. At the top of the main cypress tree are two irregular areas of yellow onto which confronting peacocks have been drawn in blue, white, red and green pigment.  The red ground ends in a pointed arch with purple spandrels each decorated with a painted sun-face on an irregular patch of yellow.  The face is female, has dark hair and a dark mono-brow; the shading and eyelashes are very delicately drawn and each face as a small cross-shaped tattoo on the forehead.\nDown either side of the central panel are ikat stripes separated by narrow, plain stripes using the same colours as the central panel.\nThere are three yellow bands across the upper and lower edge.\nThe backing is plain weave red ground with a twin-boteh motif framed by a floral arch, in off-set rows. Colours: green, red and cream.  Probably machine woven; pieced.",
