He was imprisoned for six  months in 1831 for the offence of  caricaturing King Louis-Philippe.   On the occassions where the  King censored the press Daumier  turned to everyday subjects and  bourgeois society for his  inspiration.  Here is a study of  two men in conversation, one sitting, one leaning on a mound.  The  vigorous line is typical of his work and the  simplicity of line is credit to his  fine observational skills and his humanity for  the subject.",

Daumier became increasingly interested with depicting everyday life.  He is more famous, however,  for his satirical work about the monarchy and the law courts and he first became familiar with the Palace of Justice at the age of just 13 where he worked as a bailiff's assistant.   As a lithogrpaher, from the early 1830s, he drew on average 2 illustrations a week.  \n\nWhilst working at one publication <i> Le Charivari </i> under Phillipon, he was imprisoned by King Louis-Philippe for his depiction of him as a Gargantua sitting on a commode.  Phillipon, the printer Delaporte and the publisher Aubert were all imprisoned for their part in satirising the King.  Censorship of the press was brought into force on several occassions, finally forcing Daumier to aim his satire at Bourgeois society instead and the recording of everyday life as seen in this study.",
