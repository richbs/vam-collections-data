British and French potters were primarily attracted to the brilliant red glaze of pieces such as this, though the form would have had an additional appeal as something from the exotic East.\n\nThe red glaze so admired by European ceramicists took a long time to develop. The red colour was derived from copper, but copper as a colourant was highly unstable and difficult to control. Of all Chinese glazes copper red had the highest failure rate. It was only in the 18th century, when the technique was finally mastered, that copper-red porcelain was produced in substantial quantities.\n\nGeorge Salting (1835-1909) was a passionate collector who bequeathed to the V&A a very large number of Chinese ceramics. When he bought this vase it was already more than 100 years old. The Chinese had always treasured ancient ceramics, but with the opening up of China to the West after 1840 antique items also became available to European collectors. The appearance of these hitherto unknown objects on the British art market inspired potters to create new forms and glazes.",
