The prints he made in the early 1980s seem to relate volcanic landscapes with the atmosphere of Berlin during the Cold War. \n\nThe scale of this work is miniature, suggesting a games board or toy or a kind of three-dimensional map. The image conveys an eerie emptiness and mystery, suggesting the landscapes produced much later for virtual-reality computer games, in which secret intelligence as well as actual warfare again play fundamental roles.",
