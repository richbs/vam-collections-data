To the left is a sleeping soldier and to the right another one looking upwards in astonishment. In the background is  a rocky cliff and distant hills.\n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.",
