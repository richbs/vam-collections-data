He ran a studio specialising in the production of small-scale devotional statues in marble, wood, terracotta and ivory. Many of the sculptures associated with his name must be studio productions due to variations in quality.\nThe figure is a model for a monumental garden sculpture. The composition is based on the so-called Cesarini Venus by Giambologna (1529-1608), a large-scale marble which was reproduced by Giambologna as a bronze statuette, and which would have been known to Pompe in that form. The scale on the back of the sculpture was used by Pompe's assistant to transfer the composition to the marble. Giambologna also made wax and clay models for his assistants to work from, and this figure illustrates the continuation of this common workshop practice.\nCampaspe was the favourite concubine of Alexander. Apelles was commissioned by Alexander to paint the naked Campaspe and fell in love with her. Alexander gaver her to Apelles as a present.",
