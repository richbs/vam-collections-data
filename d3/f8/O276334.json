The elaborate design imitates Qajar enamelwork on gold. The design is complex and carefully ordered consisting of a series of pictorial and floral themes vertically aligned from top to bottom:-\n\nThis square tile depicts a stylised moon face based on the ideals of Qajar female beauty, featuring a single black brow,  kohl- rimmed eyes, a small red mouth, curled and fringed black hair. The face is framed within a nimbus of pointed leaves and is inverted above a bouquet of roses in a bowl in a similar nimbus, against a partial golden yellow ground strewn with flowers and a deep blue ground strewn with red flowers outlined in white. There is a narrow border pattern with a continuous repeat of medallions with European buildings alternating with  flowerheads on a deep blue ground.\n\nMounted on a wood frame with three other tiles in an ebonized wood and gold lined frame.",

The rich design reflects Qajar court taste of the period of Fath Ali Shah. There is a gold dish with colourful champleve and basse-taille enamels with the same motifs of the sun with a face of a Qajar beauty above a seated lion and floral designs in the V&amp;A (M.97-1922). The dish was a gift from Fath Ali Shah to the British East India Company and made by Muhammad Ja'far in 1233 AH/1817-1818 AD. The Shah had chosen the auspicious astrological symbol of the Sun in Leo, seen in the centre of the dish, as the official emblem  of Iran. It matched the official emblems of the Western powers with whom he tried to  establish equal standing.\n\nFath Ali Shah was the second ruler of \tthe Qajar dynasty, which reunited the country in  the 1790s. He commissioned art on a grand scale during his reign from 1797 to 1834. Iran  had been isolated for a long period. As a result, the works he commissioned mix richness  with a certain na\u00efvet\u00e9.",
