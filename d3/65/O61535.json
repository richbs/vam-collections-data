They were first mentioned in France in 1587, where they were fitted with four single strings or more. This example has six and may well have been tuned liked a lute. It is dated 1640 and signed by Boissart, an otherwise unknown but highly skilled maker. The back of the peg box is decorated with the head of Medusa, and the back of the body with the Judgement of Paris, a popular decorative theme which depicted the mythical beauty contest between the goddesses Juno, Minerva and Venus.",
