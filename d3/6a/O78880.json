The square toe characteristic of the 1670s had evolved into a pointed toe by 1710. In the late 17th century the sides of the shoe were open, but they were closed by the beginning of the 18th.  However,  the distinctive white rand (the narrow band of white kid around the edge of the sole) characteristic of the late 17th century remains.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe upper of this shoe is composed of green silk, which envelops the heel as well. The shoe is lined with white leather and beige silk.  A narrow braid of green silk covers the upper in parallel lines. The decoration is very similar to a shoe in the V&A made in the 1670s.  However, the design here is more rectilinear and geometric.",
