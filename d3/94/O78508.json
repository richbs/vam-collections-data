These were attached by split-rings to the ends of the chains.\n\nMaker\nThis chatelaine was made at the Soho Manufactory of Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) between about 1775 and his retirement in 1800, when he was in partnership with John Fothergill (died 1782) and the engineer James Watt (1736-1819).\n\nManufacture\nBoulton specialised in the production of small attractive wares made in cut and polished steel, such as buttons and chatelaines. He was able to produce them cheaply because he used mass-production methods. For example, large brushes driven by cranks powered by a water-wheel were used to polish the steel wares, which, in the words of a contemporary, 'effected a considerable saving of human labour'.\n\nDesign\nDesigns for chatelaines similar to this one are shown on several plates from the Boulton Pattern Book, now in Birmingham City Library. Some plates are dated 1775, but the general style of the chatelaines suggest that they were made closer to 1800. Each individual design is numbered. Some of the sword-hilts made by Boulton in the Soho Manufactory are mounted with ceramic beads very similar in style and colour to those used on this chatelaine.\n\n",
