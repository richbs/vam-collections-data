There is a series of geometric forms based on an inverted U-shape mainly in white, pink and green with touches of light blue and yellow with extended dark red and yellow 'arms'. The semi-circular 'hollows' each contain a composite rectangular form in mainly light and dark blue, white, yellow and touches of very light green and pink.  All were originally outlined in black cross stitch.\nThe border is dark red patterned with S-shaped yellow leaf motifs, with details in pink and green, alternating with a simple quatrefoil in light blue.  This blue is repeated in the outer and inner border edges.  All originally outlined in black cross stitch.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; white, light and dark blue, yellow, faded red, dark red, very light green and very light pink, black.\nBacking: six pieces of printed cotton from two similar fabrics: multi-stemmed curving flowering stem with small red, blue and yellow flowers and green leaves.\nFacing: two fabrics: red silk joined with red silk with a fine yellow stripe.",
