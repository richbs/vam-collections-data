The Society's symbol was the pug dog (or Mops in German) which stood for loyalty, fidelity and steadfastness.  Unlike the Masons at the time, it was also notable in that they allowed women to become members, providing they were Catholics.  \n\nAlthough the Order was supposed to be a secret society, the Meissen modeller K\u00e4ndler made many different models of pugs and figures holding pug dogs, presumably reflecting its popularity during the 1740s.",
