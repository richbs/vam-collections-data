Craftsmen exploited the motifs for their intrinsic decorative qualities, although it was the information that they conveyed about the status and wealth of the owner that was most important. This panel would have originally formed part of a richly painted and gilded scheme of carved wall decoration.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDuring Henry VIII's reign (1509-1547) legislation was passed relating to the use of armorial devices. In order to ensure that they used the correct forms, carvers and painters are known to have owned and consulted pattern books. Unfortunately, no such patterns survive. However, there are surviving royal records of arms and heraldic beasts, for example those by Sir Thomas Wriothesley (died 1534), Henry VIII's Garter King of Arms. These records would have been used to give advice to painters involved in the decoration of the royal palaces.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe panel is carved with the arms of Jane Seymour as Queen.  She married Henry VIII in 1536 and their alliance is represented by the combination of Seymour family arms with those of Henry VIII.  The top left hand 'quarter' of the lozenge comprises three lion guards, Henry's heraldic 'supporters', and a repeated fleur-de-lis motif. The fleur-de-lis was one of several badges used by the King. The crown and Tudor roses above the lozenge also represent Jane's royal status.",

He explains that Seymour's arms are shown impaled with those of Henry VIII in a stained glass roundel dated 1537 in the Museum.  He notes that the Museum also has a carving showing the Tudor Rose and Crown and the pomegranate of Catherine of Aragon, \"but the work is coarse compared with \u2026your panel\".\nThe quarterings on the shield (which read from left to right) are given on the back of the panel\", save that the 4th quarter should be Esturmy, and the 6th Coker\".\n\n21 October 1925 Miss Legge's loan\nbecomes a gift.
