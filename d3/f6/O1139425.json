            "public_access_description": "This illuminated manuscript belonged to Pauline Chase (1881-1962) who kept it framed. It may have been presented to her, or she may have bought it because of her long association with Peter in J.M. Barrie's play Peter Pan. Pauline Chase, born Ellen Pauline Matthew Bliss in Washington is 1881, took the part of a Lost Boy in the original 1904 production of the play and its first revival, taking the lead for the second revival in 1906 and playing the part annually and on tour until her retirement at the end of the 1913 revival.\n\nPan, the Greek god of Nature is seen here piping to a sunset, reflecting his original description in Greek legend as: \u2018formed in the likeness of nature with horns to resemble the rays of the sun and the horns of the moon; his face is ruddy in the imitation of ether; he wears a spotted fawn skin resembling the stars in the sky; his lower limbs are hairy because of the trees and the wild beasts; he has the feet of a goat to resemble the stability of the earth; his pipe has seven reeds in accordance with the harmony of heaven.\u2019 Barrie took Peter's last name from Pan and this manuscript links the two creations, quoting Peter\u2019s famous line from Barrie\u2019s play: \u2018To die will be an awfully big adventure\u2019.",
