His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMozart\u2019s opera Idomeneo (1781) outlines Idomeneo, the King of Crete\u2019s attempts to escape from the consequences of a vow to the God Neptune.  Oliver Messel\u2019s 1951 Glyndebourne production was the first time this opera was staged in England, and was revived in 1956.   Messel produced baroque style sets inspired by Italian 18th-century artists and designers.\n\nA supporting group of Cretan ladies wear the same red and violet costume, accessorized with gold jewellery and a gold headdress.  The Cretan ladies carry laurel branches, a symbol of victory.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed at Glyndebourne by Glyndebourne Festival Opera on 15 June, 1951.  It was directed by Carl Ebert with choreography by Sigurd Leeder and featured Richard Lewis as Idomeneo and Sena Jurinac as Ilia.   This was the first time this production was staged in England.  It was revived in 1952, 1956, 1959 and 1964 at Glydenbourne; and in 1953 at the Edinburgh Festival. \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: At the height of his career, Messel created theatre designs for Glyndebourne, 1951-1959.",
