He has a particular interest in historic photography techniques. \n\nThis print, a view from an installation also entitled In Praise of Shadows, is made with the aid of a camera obscura, or a pin-hole camera. This installation was on display at the Serpentine Gallery, where Sugimoto had an  exhibition in 2003-2004. Sugimoto constructed a dark room, representing a camera obscura, at the centre of the gallery. A single candle was lit in the room, casting a flickering shadow through a photographic transparency of a candle on the wall behind. \n\nThis candle flame, burning over a period of time, is also the subject of this lithograph which was made on the occasion of the Serpentine exhibition. The installation and its photographic record is concerned with the essence of photography; the passing of time recorded by the action of light. This is captured in turn by the printmaking technique of lithography, creating a layering of image-making techniques in a single object. The fragile candle flame, burning itself out over a short space of time, is clearly intended as a reference to human mortality and vulnerability.",
