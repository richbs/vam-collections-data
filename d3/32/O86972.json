It was used in a game which started in China in the 6th century BC. The game involved throwing arrows into a pot, and different scores were awarded to the player depending on whether the arrows landed in the wider mouth opening or in the lugs on the side. Although we know from literary sources that this game was played in the 6th century BC no pitch pots from such early periods have survived, so it is not known whether the shape of pitch pots have changed over time.\nA similar vase in the BM, ex Eumorfopoulos collection, in Jessica Harrison-Hall, Ming Ceramics, no.14:5.",
