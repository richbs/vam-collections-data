If so, the group would have been used to decorate a dining table during a very grand evening meal. Porcelain figures were first made in the 1740s for use as table ornaments during the dessert, but they were soon widely used in interior decoration.\n\nTwo versions of this group are known. One of these was probably the group offered at auction in London in 1756. This was described as 'A most magnificent LUSTRE in the Chinese taste, beautifully ornamented with flowers, and a large groupe of Chinese figures playing on music.'\n\nPeople\nThe group was designed and modelled by the Fleming Joseph Willems (1716-1766), one of the most accomplished modellers working in the English porcelain industry.  Willems worked in England between 1749 and 1766, when he returned to Flanders  to become Director of the Imperial Royal Academy of Drawing and Modelling at Tournai.",
