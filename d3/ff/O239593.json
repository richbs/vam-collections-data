The image was subsequently included in a book published to coincide with Cybernetic Serendipity, an exhibition held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. The book of the exhibition includes the following information about the artwork: \n\n\"A computer algorithm converts a running man into a bottle of cola, which in turn is converted into the map of Africa. \nIdea by Masao Komura, data by Makato Ohtake, programme by Koji Fujino (CTG)\" (p.75-76)\n\nThis screen-printed version of the image is signed by Masao Kohmura, one of the leading members of CTG. Early references to the group include the English-language spelling Komura, but the artist himself prefers the spelling Kohmura. \n\nThe same image was also included in a set of seven lithographs by different artists, published by Motif Editions in connection with the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition. The portfolio includes two works by the Computer Technique Group, plus single works by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer, William Fetter, Maughan S. Mason, Donald K. Robbins, and Kerry Strand. The complete set was acquired by the Museum in 1969, at a cost of \u00a35.",
