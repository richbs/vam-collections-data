Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>124 Called Abraham Cowley</b>\n(b.1618d.1667) \n<b>1663-7</b> \nEvans 21 \n\n<b>Oval 66 x 54 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in loose, rapid, crossing strokes of brown, sanguine and blue-grey; dark blue and pink in the eyes with black and touches of white; the warts in raised sanguine spots; on a pale carnation ground; hair in long, loose strokes of pale brown and off-white over a paler brown wash, and modelled in grey; robe in a solid blue wash, modelled with darker colour and with the lights in white; background to the left a solid brown wash and to the right a sky in pale blue wash heavily hatched with grey and brown, and with touches of white in the clouds; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Excellent; a hair from the brush adhering to the paint used for the sitter's nose. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Centre left, in ochre: <i>TF</i> (see F in Appendix 2). Inscribed on the back in impressed metal-point, erased and only dubiously legible, possibly the word <i>... Thomas ...</i> ; also some small sketches with the brush in grey wash, and a diagram of the structure of a head, with another head in three-quarter front view. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century oval gold locket, convex back and straight sides with a broad central channel flaring out to the bezel, which holds the shallowly convex glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger of broad flattened section, channelled down the middle and bifurcating into diminishing spirals of flat wire of four turns; below the base of the hanger, the back is engraved with scroll-and-leaf ornament which is arranged to continue the line downwards of the hanger. A label on the back of the locket is inscribed in Wallop's hand: <i>T.Flatman/ Abraham Cowley / c.1665.</i> \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> By 1889, Sir Francis Cook, Bart; acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop before 1927; lent to the V&A 1927-49; ownership transferred to Alan Evans, June 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b>BFAC 1889, p. 72, no. 23, pl, 14; Grosvenor Place 1932, no. 130; RA 1934, no. 1000. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 112, no. 49 (as 'a Gentleman'); Reynolds 1952, pp. 75-6 (as Cowley); Foskett 1979, p. 113, pl. 9f (as Cowley); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 22 (called Abraham Cowley'): Murdoch 1981, pp. 151-2, pl. 26a (may be incorrectly identified' as Cowley); Reynolds 1988, p. 70, pl. XIII (as Cowley). \n\nWhen in the possession of Sir Francis Cook, this miniature was called Portrait of a Gentleman. Identification of it as Abraham Cowley (1618-1667), a key figure in relation to Flatman's mentality, seems to have been due to Wallop, who would have compared it to the painting in the NPG, a copy after Lely of c. I 660. The latter is the standard image of Cowley as an adult, providing the basis for the authoritative engravings by Faithorne used in the publication of Cowley's <i>Poemata Latina</i> and a collected <i>Works</i>, both of 1668. Cowley was corpulent and double-chinned, with deep lines running from his nostrils to the corners of his mouth; he had a cleft chin, apparently darkened by stubble, and soft brown hair dividing in long waves from a parting just right of centre, and passing over the outer edges of the eyebrows. There is some similarity, therefore, between the Lely image and the present miniature, but there are discrepancies. \n\nOn stylistic grounds the miniature should be dated to the early or mid-1660s, probably later therefore than the Lely.Yet the sitter looks distinctly younger. His chin is uncleft and unshadowed by a beard. His jaw is longer and narrower, and he has numerous prominent pink moles - in particular, one at the side of his nose, another just below the jaw and another on the neck. Cowley seems to have had no such marks. \n\nCowley - a follower of Francis Bacon and, as an essayist, one of the theoreticians of the experimenting societies which bore fruit in 1660 with the founding of the Royal Society - was the most fashionable poet of the age of Marvell and Milton. He introduced into English prosody the free-verse form of the Pindaric ode, a conversational 'undress' measure, highly suitable for the urbane satires of the Restoration West End. Flatman was his follower both in membership of the Royal Society and in the adoption of the Pindaric for his mock-heroic odes addressed to the great men of the 1660s and 1670s.\u201d",
