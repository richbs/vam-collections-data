He may well have been the David Evans who was employed as harpist to George III (reigned 1760 - 1820).  This type of harp was developed in Italy and Spain from about 1580 and was used in Wales until the 1890s. It was known as the triple harp, because it had three rows of strings, the outer two being tuned identically and the middle one chromatically. Messrs Kirckman & Sons, the most famous makers of English harpsichords in the previous century, presented this instrument to this museum in 1869.",
