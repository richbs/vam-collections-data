This was the fourth of a series of quinquennial World conferences on Women, (Mexico 1980, Copenhagen 1985, Nairobi, 1990). The posters were exhibited in Beijing at the time of the Conference and in London at the 'What Women Want' Festival at the Royal Festival Hall, in August the same year. They were then distributed across Europe by the United Nations Environmental Programme and also shown in Nairobi  in January 1997. This particular combination of text and image suggests the discrepancies in expectations of  married life. While the shop window projects the fantasy of  'happily ever after', the quotation illustrates how women have grown to expect violation from men, particularly within marriage. The implication of the poster is that if men and women respect and care for each other, they are also more likely to respect and care for the environment.",
