Ideas around musical notation and the crossover elements of chance and structure, which seem evident in works such as this print, may have come directly or indirectly from Cage.  In the 1960s Poons painting devolved toward painting coloured dots floating on a contrasting field of colour \u2013 a technique which spearheaded the  \u2018op\u2019art movement, but this was soon superseded by  more his more expressionistic handling of paint.",
