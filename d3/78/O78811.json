It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public.\n\nOwnership & Use\nIn Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.  In literature and paintings, to be bareheaded often signified emotional distress or even insanity.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nThis coif is a fine example of blackwork, a style of needlework popular in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  It was worked with a single colour of silk (usually black, but also blue, red or green) on linen, and often highlighted with precious metal threads.",
