A printing plate was then created from this image from which offset lithographic prints could be produced.\nThe Dead Kennedys were an American punk band  formed in San Francisco in 1978, known for the ascerbity of their lyrics. California \u00fcber alles was their first single, released 1979, and alludes to the first stanza of the national anthem of Germany. During the Third Reich, anti-German political propaganda claimed the anthem as a Nazi expression of racial superiority. The Dead Kennedys used this meaning as a way of attacking Jerry Brown, the then Governor of California.\nJamie Reid (b. 1947) developed his cut-and-paste aesthetic from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren (1946-2010), later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols, for whom Reid created his most famous work.",
