John Moyr Smith supplied designs for Cox & Son, including some called <i>The Winds</i> for their range of tiles and the same designs are used for the painted roundels along the top of the sideboard. The two panels on the doors in the centre of the top, depicting Morning and Night, relate to designs by Moyr Smith for tile panels by Minton. The two larger painted panels on the lower doors are attributed to Charles Rossiter, who also supplied figurative designs for Cox & Son.\n\nCox & Son may have made other examples of the sideboard with the same arrangement of figurative and decorative painted panels. One, with the lower doors painted with a design of a flowering bush in a pot, was illustrated by Elizabeth Aslin, <i>Nineteenth Century English Furniture</i>, 1962, pl. 72. The other sideboard had glazed rather than mirrored lower doors and was illustrated by Annamarie Stapleton, <i>John Moyr Smith 1839-1912 A Victorian Designer</i>, 2002, p. 27, fig. 33.",
