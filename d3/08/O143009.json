From about 1890 this instrument was resurrected, largely through the efforts of Arnold Dolmetsch (1858-1940), a friend of William Morris and a leading pioneer of the Early Music Revival. His son Carl Dolmetsch (1911-1997) continued this tradition, both as a musician and as a maker of musical instruments at the family workshop in Haslemere, Surrey. Through Carl Dolmetsch's efforts, the recorder has been widely used in schools since the early 1960s as a means of teaching music at elementary level. This example was made in about 1945 for Professor Patrick Lawther, C.B.E. (1921-2008), a founding member of the Goble Recorder Trio and later an eminent physician.",
