The films captured their imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and toy guns were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis is a figure of the character C-3PO, in the film he is built by Anakin Skywalker, when he was a young child. He was protocol droid designed to serve humans and can communicate in over six million languages.  He appears in all six films along side his main companion R2-D2.",
