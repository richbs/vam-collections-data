The complete outfit consisted of a black Kangol hat; this cardigan; a silk shirt; a gold necklace with a Neferetti head pendant; crimplene Farah trousers and Bally leather shoes. The outfit reflected a 'yardie' style of dress worn by some British men in the early 1980s.\n\nThe term 'Yardie' derives from the slang name given to occupants of government yards in Trenchtown, a neighbourhood in West Kingston, Jamaica. Trenchtown was originally built as a housing project following devastation caused by Hurricane Charlie in 1951. The poverty and crime experienced by many residents led to them becoming known as 'yardies', a stigma which yardie style sought to challenge.\n\nEmigration in the 1960s brought yardie style to the UK where it grew increasingly label conscious. Desirable and much worn items include Farah trousers, Gabicci cardigans ('Yardie cardies'), and shoes by Bally and Pierre Cardin. Jewellery was central to the style, and thick gold rope chains with Neferetti heads, cannabis leaves, onyx medallions and sovereigns were favourite pieces.",
