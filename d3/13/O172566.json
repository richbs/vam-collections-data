It is similar to the mask ornament on the frieze of a chimneypiece designed by Stevens during his stay in Sheffield.\n\nA sculptor, designer and painter, Alfred Stevens rejected contemporary distinctions between fine art and design. From 1850 to 1857 he was chief designer to Hoole & Co., Sheffield, where he produced award-winning designs for metalwork, majolica, terracotta ornaments and chimney-pieces. Perhaps his two greatest works were the decorations for the dining-room at Dorchester House, London (about 1856), for which he made countless drawings inspired by the Italian High Renaissance style, in particular the work of Michelangelo and the monument to the Duke of Wellington for St Paul's Cathedral, London, which was completed after his death. The two allegorical groups from this monument made a lasting impact on the New Sculpture movement.",

This model was included in a large purchase of material by Stevens in the possession of Stannus, a former pupil of Stevens who wrote a monograph on the sculptor in 1891.\n\nThe purpose of the original model is unknown, but it may be part of a fireplace designed for Messrs Henry E. Hoole and Co Ltd. It is similar to the mask ornament on the frieze of a chimneypiece designed by Stevens during his stay in Sheffield.",
