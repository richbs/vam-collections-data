When Henry VIII (r. 1509-47) took possession of Cardinal Wolsey's palace, he superimposed his own arms and motto over Wolsey's.  The Cardinal's arms remained concealed until the early 19th century, when the royal arms were taken down for restoration. Wolsey's Latin motto, 'DOMINVS MICHI ADIVTOR' (Lord be my helper) is incised beneath his heraldic device. The terracotta must have been produced by one of the Florentine artists who had come over to work in Britain in the 16th century. The plaster cast was commissioned by the Museum relatively late in the formation of the cast collection, after it was recommended in 1904. The cast itself, also made by an Italian craftsman in London, cost \u00a315, and in addition \u00a34 10s. was paid for scaffolding to be erected at Hampton Court.",

When Henry VIII (reigned 1509-47) took possession of Wolsey's palace, he superimposed his own arms and motto over Wolsey's.  The latter's arms remained concealed until the early 19th century (pre 1845), when the king's arms were taken down for restoration. At the time of their discovery, the arms were surmounted by a lunette containing the monogram of TW with a cord and tassels and the date 1525, shown in the engraving (from the Gentleman's Magazine, XXIV, 1845, facing page 593). This lunette disappeared at some time before 1894.",
