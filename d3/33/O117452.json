Irving ensured that the sets, costumes and accessories of his productions at the Lyceum Theatre were designed by the best designers of his day.  He would have liked this scarab ring for its antique associations, and because its large polished turquoise body would have been visible on stage, gleaming in the stage lights.\n\nScarabs are associated with Egyptian jewellery, and were widely used as seals. Since scarabs had a mystical quality they were regarded as a charm against evil for the living when worn strung on a cord, and harbingers of a good journey to the Afterworld when sewn to mummy wrappings.",
