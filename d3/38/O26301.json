PRINTED BY H BRYER, BRIDGE STREET, BLACKFRIARS, LONDON.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe utility and tendency of this Game must be obvious at first sight; for surly there cannot be a more agreeable study than History, and none more improving to Youth, than that which conveys to them, in a pleasing and comprehensive manner, the Events which have occurred in their own country.\nThe little Prints, which are regularly numbered from 1 to 158, represent either Portraits of the principal Personages who have signalised themselves as Kings, Statesmen, Churchman, Generals, Poets &c., &c. or some remarkable Occurrence in our country. -This will naturally excite a curiosity in the youthful mind; and that curiosity will be gratified in to short account of each reign subjoined. -On the whole, the writer flatters himself, that the public approbation will convince him, that the hours he has devoted to the formation of this little Scheme, have not been spent in vain.\n\nRULES AND REGULATIONS FOR PLAYING THE HISTORICAL GAME\nThis game comprehends nearly one hundred and sixty of the principal circumstances in the History of England, commencing with the Battle of Hastings and ending with the Accession of George the Third, with appropriate Fines or Rewards, to most of the subjects.  It is played with a teetotum, numbered from 1 to 8.  Each player proceeds in the Game according to the number he turns, and receives the Reward or pays the Fine appointed.\nThere are likewise twelve Letters, one of which each player must draw; and he who draws the earliest in the Alphabet, takes the privilege of turning first, and the others in rotation.\nEach player must place his Letter on the circumstance to which he turns, to show his situation in the Game.\nIf any player turns to the subject on which another has his Letter, he takes that place and the other moves one forward, except at the Holy Land, where as many may be placed as chance may send.\nEach player advances in the Game by adding the Figure that he turns to the Number on which his Letter stands.\nAny number of persons may play; and he who arrives first at the Treasury, wins the Games, takes the Stakes and all forfeits that remain.\n\nEXAMPLE\nSuppose George, Charles and James play the Game, George draws B, Charles F, James H, they each put a stake into the Treasury. George having the earliest letter in the alphabet, spins first No. 3, places his Letter on the Briton, and pays a fine of one to the Norman.-Charles turns next No. 6, from which he derives no advantage, because every player must enter Doom'sDay Book before he can proceed.-James next turns No. 4, takes the fine from the Norman, and passes to Doom'sDay Book.-George then plays again, and turns No. 2, takes his letter from the Briton, and places it on Doom's Day Book; in consequence, James passes his Letter one forward, to the forest and pays a fine to the king.\n\n*Reducing the period covered allowed the publishers to go into greater detail about the history that they and the buying public felt had determined their country..\n\nRules placement: booklet, printed by  H Bryer Bridge Street, Blackfriars, London, 1810",
