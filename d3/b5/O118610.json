Sadler experimented with transfer-printing on white glazed delftware tiles, transferring images from engraved copper plates to tiles, using enamel colours fixed in low-temperature firing.\n\nActors and actresses could become big stars in the 18th century, when theatres, concert halls and pleasure gardens were the major forms of public entertainment.  Engravers regularly produced images of paintings of the most popular performers, so the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear on the tiles in reverse.\n\nBorn and educated in Bath, Ann Barry became an actress in York and in 1754 married William Dancer, an actor in York. In the 1758-1759 season they were engaged by the actor Spranger Barry at his Crow Street Theatre in Dublin and became a star there within a year. She embarked on a relationship with Barry whom she married, probably in 1768, after her husband's death. Garrick employed Spranger and Ann Barry at Drury Lane Theatre where she became known as one of the finest actresses of her day, rivalling the supremacy of even the great Sarah Siddons.",
