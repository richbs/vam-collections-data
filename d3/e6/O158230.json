            "public_access_description": "Oliver! is one of the most successful post-war British musicals. The book, lyrics and music were written by Lionel Bart (1930-1999) and the musical opened on 30 June 1960 and ran for 2,618 performances, closing on 10 September 1966. Based on Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, the musical was the first adaptation of a Dickens novel to become a stage hit; the subsequent film version in 1968 became a global box office hit, winning five Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Music for Lionel Bart. The show's musical numbers and scenes have passed into household legend, 'Food Glorious Food', 'I'd Do Anything', 'Who Will Buy?' and 'Consider Yourself'  have been used for TV adverts, pop videos and poster campaigns. Part of the success of the show was credited to the architect turned designer Sean Kenny (1932-1973), whose huge revolving stage dwarfed the young actor playing Oliver with the outsize decor of winding stairways, beams and doorways on various levels depicting Dickensian London. The costume design by Sean Kenny depicts Widow Corney which was played by Hope Jackman in the original production and subsequently by Olwen Griffiths and Brenda Scaife in later productions.",
