From 1900 until his death in 1912 he supplied 140 designs to Sanderson. All these designs were in styles from different periods in history. This was his speciality. The design you see here is based on a type of decoration used by the architect Robert Adam in the 18th century. In fact this design is sometimes wrongly called 'Adam'.",
