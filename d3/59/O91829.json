This scene refers to the four years he spent as a hermit in the Syrian desert where he studied Hebrew and had 'only the scorpions and the wild beasts for company'.  He described in his letters how he would beat his breast to drive out feverish thoughts and this goldsmith follows a later artistic tradition by including a stone for the purpose. Above him is a cardinal's hat, an anachronistic detail as the office did not exist during the saint's lifetime, but it was often included by artists in reference to an appointment he held under Pope Damasus I. In the background St Jerome can be seen followed by a lion, a reference to a popular fable which told how he made a devoted friend by pulling a thorn from a lion's paw. \nThe high relief embossing dates it to the second half of the 17th century, when sculptural, theatrical silver was highly fashionable."
