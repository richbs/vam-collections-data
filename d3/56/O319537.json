The pattern consists of scrolling stems bearing rows of foxglove and borage, repeating with strawberries and pansies.  There is a cornflower in the centre of the design and centipedes worked at the sides.  The shape of the embroidery is curved at the neckline, with a 9.0 cm opening at the front outined with silver thread in twisted chain stitch.  The lower edge of the embroidery is shaped for a curved neckline.  The partlet is unlined; a backing of gauze has been added later. The thread count is 80 x 80 threads per inch, approximately.  Almost identical in design to sleeve panels, T.327&amp;A-1980.",

It served to fill in the low-cut front of a gown, a style that was only appropriate for formal and court dress.  Middle-class women\u2019s clothing and aristocratic women\u2019s informal dress always kept the bosom and neck well covered with smocks or partlets. \n\nSimilar to other linen dress accessories, such as coifs, forehead cloths and stomachers, the partlet was frequently embroidered with coloured silks and precious metal threads in naturalistic designs.  The embroidery design of this partlet is very similar to that of two sleeve panels in the V&amp;A collection, T.327&amp;A-1980.",
