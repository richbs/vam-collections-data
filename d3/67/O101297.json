A tribal people controlled by village chiefs assisted by the priest-shaman. The name Muhso/Muser means \"hunter\" and suggests their skill in the chase. The Lahus are divided into a number of related sub-groups, including the Black Lahu and the Red Lahu. They are great weavers and are famed for their intricate basketwork. Practicing slash and burn agriculture the Lahus cultivate rice, and chilli and opium, which they smoke themselves or sell as a cash crop.\n\nTo complete her costume the Lahu woman using this shoulder bag would have worn a  long coat (see IM 145-1929) over either a pair of pants or a sarong together with a black turban.",
