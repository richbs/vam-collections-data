The solid wooden seat is contained within a railed frame, the horizontal elements of which are turned in a repeating reel and bobbin pattern; the back and front stays are in barley-sugar twist, and the uprights between are cut in a flat serpentine pattern.  The arms are finished at the front ends with a motif of a disc and concentric circles on each of the two end blocks; a hole has been bored through the end block immediately behind each of them to take a restraining bar or tape.  The back stays have footed globular finials which echo the spherical baluster shapes of the frame.  The slightly splayed legs continue the pattern of repeating balusters between corner blocks; there is a single stretcher on all four sides just above floor level, and there were originally another four approximately halfway up the legs.\n[Arm-Chair for a child; of walnut.  The back, arms, and framework of the seat are formed of horizontal rails with ball and reel turning, spiral uprights and splats of wavy outline; the back uprights are surmounted by knobs.  The legs and double stretchers are of ball and reel turning.\nFrom:  H. Clifford Smith, Catalogue of English Furniture & Woodwork \n(London 1930), 537, Plate II.]",
