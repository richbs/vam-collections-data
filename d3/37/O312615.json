It represents a naked nymph leaning forward to part the stems of a thicket. Behind her are two cupids, one standing and one crouching. It has been suggested that this may be a model for a group of figures designed to decorate the cover of a cup.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. He epitomised the movement known as the \u201cNew Sculpture\u201d, with a new focus on naturalistic forms. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.",
