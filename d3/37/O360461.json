Yellow watered silk brocaded with a design in silver thread of vertical leafy and undulating trails, and with detached butterflies and flower baskets and floral sprigs on the ground.\n\nThe gown has a wide-pleated sack back with an open front. The neck is square and continues into two pleated robings at the waist, and each with fabric arranged to show the vertical trail. The skirt is bordered by plain graduated angled robings of self material. The sides are double pleated into the angle of the waist and there is no pocket slit. The cuffs of the elbow length sleeves are double-gathered, graduated, and with a scalloped pinked edge. The bodice is lined with white linen with two bones placed at the centre back sides, and white tape ties inside the front robings, which may be partly original, to fasten. The skirt is lined with glazed yellow wool and the hem is faced back with a braid.\n\nThe petticoat is of matching fabric and comprises the front only. The sides are pleated away from a straight centre front panel and the yellow silk binding ribbon extends into two tying strings. The petticoat is trimmed at knee length and again below with two deeply dentilated flounces, the edges are scalloped and pinked and a series of diamond shaped holes are punched in the bottom of each dentilation. Lined with a thin grey-brown watered silk.",
