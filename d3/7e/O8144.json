Morris's wife Jane is depicted as the Princess.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis cabinet demonstrates a  lack of co-ordination between physical structure and painted decoration; the five scenes of St George are unequally divided over the three doors. Contemporary criticism of the design commented on this immature, idealistic rendition of Medieval painted furniture. The interior's decoration indicates  Morris's early interest in pattern design, a skill he was to develop with great expertise in his wallpapers and textiles. The decorative motifs and the copper handles derive from a combination of Oriental and Medieval sources.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique used for the interior decoration (layers of tinted varnish on a ground of silver leaf) was a Medieval method revived by William Burges, seen on  the cabinet commissioned by H.G. Yatman of 1858 (museum no. Circ.217-1961).\n\nRelated Museum Objects\nSome of  Morris's designs for the painted panels are held in the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department of the Museum (museum nos. E.2787-1927, E.2788-1927, E.2789-1927, E.2790-1927).",

            "history_note": "The cabinet was designed by Philip Webb for the stand of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. at the London International Exhibition of 1862. Webb charged the firm \u00a31 10s (\u00a31 50p) for the design and William Morris produced four preliminary sketches for the narrative panels (E.2787-1927, E.2788-1927, E.2789-1927, E.2790-1927). One of the partners in the firm,  D.G. Rossetti described the preparation of the cabinet for display in a letter to Charles Eliot Norton, 9 January 1862, 'I wish you could see a painted cabinet, with the history of St. George, and other furniture of great beauty which we have in hand. We have bespoke space at the Great Exhibition...' <u>Letters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</u>,edited by Oswald Doughty and John Robert Walsh, Vol. II, Oxford 1965, page 436.\n\nPriced at \u00a350 at the 1862 Exhibition, the cabinet did not sell and was still recorded in the firm's stock in 1864. Its subsequent history is unclear until the sale of Laurence Hodson's collection in 1906. Hodson (1864-1933)  inherited Compton Hall, near Wolverhampton, from his father in 1890 and may have acquired the cabinet when he commissioned Morris & Co. to decorate the Hall, 1895-6. Morris's last wallpaper, <i>Compton</i> was designed for this commission. Hodson also owned three of the Holy Grail tapestries designed by Edward Burne-Jones (Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) as well as two other pieces of furniture by Morris & Co.\n\nThe cabinet was purchased by the Museum from Hodson's sale (Christies, 6 July 1906, Lot 96), on the recommendation of Charles Fairfax Murray (who had owned Morris's sketches for the narrative panels). The firm of Durlacher Brothers, 142, New Bond Street, bid on behalf of the Museum and the purchase price of \u00a366 3s included their commission of \u00a33 3s. The cabinet was sent to Bethnal Green Museum on 24th July 1906, where many pieces of furniture were on display in order to educate the local furniture-making trades. It was returned to the Department of  Woodwork in 1931 and exhibited in the <u>William Morris Centenary</u> Exhibition in 1934.\n\nThe interior of the cabinet is fitted with shelves and drawers with copper handles. The drawer fronts are decorated with layers of tinted varnishes on silver leaf, a medieval technique described in Theophilus's <u>De diversis artibus</u>, published in 1847 by John Murray as <u>An Essay upon Various Arts</u>. Morris may have known of William Burges's use of this technique on his Yatman cabinet of 1858.\n\nWhen the cabinet was acquired in 1906, a polished mahogany board had been fixed on top of the stand and the upper cupboard section was placed on this board. This arrangement is recorded in a black and white photograph, Neg. No. 32498. Examination of the cabinet in preparation for the Morris Exhibition in 1996 indicated that the board was a later addition. The removal of the board enabled the upper cupboard section to be positioned on the stand between the mouldings at either end of the horizontal rail. This follows medieval prototypes and may be a more likely interpretation of the original intentions of Morris and Webb.\n\nHistorical significance: The cabinet is a rare example of Morris's painted work and is typical of the large pieces of furniture, medieval in form and crude in construction, associated with Morris and his circle from 1858.The theme of the cabinet epitomises Morris's youthful enthusiasm for mediaeval romance and literature. Morris's wife, Jane, was the model for the princess.\n\nBoth the cabinet and another early painted piece on which Morris, Webb and Burne-Jones collaborated, The Prioress's Wardrobe (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) shows the same lack of co-ordination between structure and painted decoration. In this cabinet the five scenes of the story of St. George's rescue of the princess from the dragon are unequally divided between the three doors.\n\nThe decoration of the interior is, however, a startling reminder of Morris's early interest in pattern design. The decorative motifs, particularly the flowers, and the abstract form of the copper handles, derive from a variety of sources, possibly a combination of oriental and mediaeval.",

            "production_note": "The maker of the St. George cabinet, and other furniture exhibited by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. in 1862, has not yet been identified. It is possible that the cabinet was made in the workshop of Tommy Baker, a cabinet maker of Christopher Street, Hatton Garden, London. One of his employees, Henry Price, described making furniture in medieval style, probably for the rooms shared by Morris and Edward Burne-Jones at Red Lion Square, London, in 1856. For a discussion of Price's furniture, see Pat Kirkham, 'William Morris's Early Furniture, <u>The William Morris Society Journal</u>, Vol. IV, No. 3, Spring 1987, pp. 25-28.",
