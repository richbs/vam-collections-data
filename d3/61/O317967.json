The lower scalloped edge is outlined with large flower heads, scrolling leaves and small cartouches containing decorative meshes. Vertical columns rise at intervals into the centre of the flounce, they rise from large scrolls entwined with lilies and are topped with leafy C-shaped scrolls. The shape between the columns is bridged alternately with delicately linked C-shaped scrolls with floral sprays at the apex, and elaborate double arches of leaf-entwined bars and flower-filled cornucopia. The space beneath the elaborate arches contains a bouquet of roses, lilies, carnations, marigolds and wheat ears. A single smaller floral spray stands within each alternate arch with flying birds above it.\n\nThe upper part of the valance is decorated with two horizontal lines of ribbon with loops at intervals from which depend leafy scrolls and sprays of flowers. The top 2.75 inches is of plain net. The repeat, excluding the variant on the flying bird, is 19 inches.\n\nThe flounce is attached to a simple bobbin-made footing. The flounce still has its original raw edges  down either side.",
