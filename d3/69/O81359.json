Worked first as a bank clerk, then studied at the Munich Academy 1829 and soon after in Venice for two years. Lived for a time in Rome, toured in the East, and Hungary and Transylvania, before settling in London. Exhibited 87 works at the RA between 1836 and 1880, 86 at the BI 1837-67, and ten at the SBA 1836-4l. Most were Italian landscapes, particularly lake scenes, where he visited regularly. Published 'Sketches on the Danube ... ' (1838) and 20 lithographs in 'The Mountains and Lakes of Switzerland, the Tyrol, and Italy' (1847). Drew illustrations for his friend John Paget's <i>Hungary and Transylvania</i> ... (1839). Died St John's Wood, London, 18 December 1879. His wife was also an artist, exhibiting similar subjects at the RA and BI between 1840 and 1858. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1861, pp73-5; <i>Athenaeum</i> 27 December 1879, p856 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1880, pp83-4 (obit) \n\n<b>Arona and the Castle of Angera, Lago Maggiore, Italy</b> \n1828-1888 Neg GF704 \nCanvas, 72.3 x 128.2 cm (28\u00bd x 50\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'G E Hering 1856' bl \nGiven by Mrs Charles Rivaz 1888 \n\nHering exhibited several paintings of Lake Maggiore at the RA and BI between 1856 and 1866. The present work is possibly the first of these, 'Arona and Angera, Lago Maggiore', judging from the title, shown at the RA in 1856. The <i>Art Journal</i> critic wrote (1861, p75) that 'his pictures are not crowded with material, for in the selection of subject he looks after pictorial quality rather than quantity; a bit of mountain scenery, a quiet lake, with a few adjuncts, oftentimes suffice for his purpose'. \n\nArona is at the southern end of the lake, on the western side. The view is looking north-east across the lake to the castle owned by the Borromeo family which stands on a rocky hill above Angera. A similar view, but seen from further back, by James Baker Pyne and dated 1868, was sold at Sotheby's 18 March 1987 (3). \n\nEXH: ?RA 1856 (741)\"",
