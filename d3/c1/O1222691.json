In Alan Bennett's The Wind in the Willows at the National Theatre in 1990, all the characters, while recognisably animals, were also human types and Mark Thompson's witty costumes blended animal with human characteristics.  There was no use of 3-D heads; the animals were defined by make-up and evocative costumes - the ferrets en brosse, the sideburns shaping the face, the studded braces, gloves and tail-hole, paws indicated by the gloves but with the fingers free - which, with the merest colour change of nails, became paws and claws.  The thin pencil moustaches for stoats made them look like spivs, slick city types in country wear, with thin brimmed bowler hats.  There is a disturbing impression of creatures trying to hide their true selves.  \n\nThe squaring of the top quarter of the design frames and focuses the characters.",
