White, rather than black, enamel generally denotes that the deceased was a child, a spinster or a bachelor.\n\nMatthew Arnold was possibly the son of Matthew Arnold (born 1711) and his wife Charity.  The elder Matthew was a merchant, an owner of boats, and a lighterman in Lowestoft in Suffolk, who moved his business to Wapping in London.  Family records suggest that he was prominent in the re-building of Wapping Church.\n\nThere was possibly a distant relationship between the Arnolds of Wapping and Lowestoft and the family of Matthew Arnold,  the 19th century poet, whose family also had its origins in Lowestoft.",

Matthew Arnold was possibly the son of Matthew Arnold (born 1711) and his wife Charity.  The elder Matthew was a merchant, an owner of boats, and a lighterman in Lowestoft in Suffolk, who moved his business to Wapping in London.  Family records suggest that he was prominent in the re-building of Wapping Church.\nThere was possibly a distant relationship between the Arnolds of Wapping and Lowestoft and the family of Matthew Arnold,  the 19th century poet, whose family also had its origins in Lowestoft.\nThe ring was later owned by Emily Mary Rivers Arnold who married Dr Leonard Boor, and emigrated to New Zealand with her husband in the 1860s.  She was the great-grandmother of Shirley Mary Olson, who has bequeathed the ring.",
