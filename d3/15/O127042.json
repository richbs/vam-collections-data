His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRing Round the Moon, a translation of Jean Anouilh's play L'Invitation au Ch\u00e2teau by Christopher Fry, was first performed at the Globe  Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre), in 1950.  It enjoyed a substantial run in the West End before moving to New York. Peter Brook, the director, suggested that the setting should be a winter garden or hothouse with plants and trees.  Although untypical of Messel\u2019s style, the set is one of his most memorable designs, and complemented the elegance and fantasy of Fry\u2019s poetic drama.  \n\nThis design shows ferns, part of the vegetation in the Winter garden.",

The production, presented by H. M. Tennent Productions Ltd, was directed by Peter Brook, with a cast that included Paul Scofield, Claire Bloom and Margaret Rutherford.  \n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: The set for <i>Ring Round the Moon</i> is one of Messel's most famed set designs.",
