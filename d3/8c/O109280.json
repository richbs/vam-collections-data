            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides.\n\nThis inro is decorated with Aridoshi, one of the One Hundred Poets. He is shown during a rain shower at night in front of a torii gate. The design is closely based on a little-known, undated print by the print designer Shigemasa (1739-1820). \nLacquer was most commonly used in the manufacture of inro since it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material.  The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. This inro is decorated in multi-colour togidashie (brought out by polishing) lacquer. The technique produces a surface that is completely flat. Lacquer workers often used it for designs based on full-colour woodblock prints as it could be made to look like the original print.",
