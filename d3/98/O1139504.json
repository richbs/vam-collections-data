It contained many illustrations, over 250 prints and a number of vignettes, partly drawn and executed by Bernard Picart. Picart\u2019s method of creating these illustrations is noteworthy as he had no first-hand experience of some of the ceremonies and costumes he depicted, for example those of India. However, living in Amsterdam, he had access to diverse sources of information, namely illustrations from Western travel books and Indian miniatures. By compiling these sources to create his engravings, Picart created a visual record of the early-18th century European view of India and other countires.",
