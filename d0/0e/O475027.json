The school, in Jaipur, Rajasthan, produced pottery in the late 19th century after one of the pupils of Bhola, who was a leading artist who made fritware in Delhi, introduced the technique.  As the pieces were made of a mixture of feldspar and starch they could not be thrown on a wheel but were either raised by hand or shaped in a mould.  Vessels of this kind were known locally as 'martaban' jars, after the fort on the coast of Burma through which they were imported into India/ They were first copied in Delhi and later at Jaipur, where their designs were heavily influenced by contemporary European taste.",

            "history_note": "Jaipur School of Art produced pottery in the late 19th century after one of the pupils of Bhola, who was a chief artist of Delhi fritware, introduced the technique.  As the pieces were made of a mixture of feldspar and starch they could not be thrown on a wheel but were either raised by hand or in a mould.  Pickle jars or <i>martabans,</i> as they were locally known, owing to the fort on the coast of Burma through which they were imported into India, were first copied in Delhi and later at Jaipur, where they were decorated in response to European taste.
