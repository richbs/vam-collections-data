Its supposed simplicity is contrasted by the colourful vibrancy of the interior with a swirling floral design in gold maki-e (sprinkled picture) and togidashi-e (polished out picture) and inlaid mother-of-pearl (raden). The exterior in ro-iro (high quality black lacquer), depicting three raised mandarin ducks, is a difficult, expensive and time consuming process where successive layers of high-quality black lacquer are applied. After each layer has dried it is polished and ground down to create a high glossy sheen as illustrated on this box. \nDuring the Meiji period, when this box was produced, lacquer production went into decline and many artisans had to seek other modes of employment. The impact of westernisation upon Japanese society had caused lacquerware to be considered unfashionable by the general populace. Lacquerers that continued in the industry had to find other creative means of promoting interest in their wares, often by modernising and improving old techniques through a glossier finish or greater range and vibrancy in colour, as illustrated upon this box. Both the interior and exterior surfaces display great technical skill and a dazzling visual contrast.",
