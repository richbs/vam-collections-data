            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 233, 234, 236\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\u201cThis drawing was formerly in the collection of Eustace Constable. It is an enlarged and tinted copy of the engraving after the fresco by Paolo Uccello in the Chiostro Verde, S. Maria Novella, Florence, which is Plate XXXIII of W. Y. Ottley's <i>Early Florentine School</i>, 1826. In his account of Constable's first lecture on 'The History of Landscape Painting' at the Royal Institution on 26 May 1836, Leslie remarks (L. ed. S., p. 387) \"Near the commencement of this lecture, Constable exhibited a drawing from a very grand and simple composition by Paolo Uccello, of Noah and his family kneeling round an altar, while the birds and beasts are leaving the ark, the whole arched by the rainbow. 'Uccello was either the inventor or the perfector of parallel perspective, and this new art is beautifully shown in the flight of the birds. Titian's Comaro family somewhat resembles this picture'.\" \n\n\nNote on Nos. 397-400 [D.1876-1908, D.1877-1908, D.1875-1908, D.1874-1908]\n\nFor the reasons given above, Nos. 397 and 398 [D.1876-1908 and D.1877-1908] can be identified with the drawings mentioned by Leslie as having been shown by Constable at his first lecture to the Royal Institution in 1836; and, on the assumption that those lectures (on which Leslie's notes are confessedly incomplete) incorporated all the material in his previous lectures and notes, Nos. 399 and 400 [D.1875-1908 and D.1874-1908] were probably shown at the same lecture. There is no direct evidence that he showed any of the drawings at the earlier lectures, for example, those at Worcester in 1835, though he is known to have shown a diagram of dates and names of the principal painters, and copies of pictures, on that occasion. Nos. 397 [D. 1876-1908], 399 [D.1875-1908] and 400 [D. 1874-1908] are virtually mechanical enlargements from the engravings, and are probably the work of an assistant. In a letter of April 1836 to Leslie (Beckett, Ill, p. 137) Constable says: \"<i>Nixon</i> is helping me with my tables for my lectures\". In the case of the Worcester lectures, the tables were literally the lists of painters, but in this context they may well be the copies of engravings which he showed at the Royal Institution. J. M. Nixon was a glass painter and the heavy 'leaded' outline of Nos. 397, 399 and 400 [D.1876-1908, D.1875-1908, and D.1874-1908] might be due to him. No. 398 [D.1877-1908] is in a freer style, more likely to be Constable's own. \nWhen giving the drawings to the Museum, Mr. Lindo S. Myers wrote on 23 May \n1902: \"They were purchased by me directly from Mr. Eustace Constable, together with many hundred later drawings and books of sketches by John Constable, and the whole of which (including these two) came from the Court of Chancery where they had been locked up in the will of Miss Isabella Constable\". Although the letter only refers to two drawings all four were in fact received from the donor at this time. Mr. Myers was under the impression that they were early works done by Constable as a boy under Dunthome's instructions: hence his reference to 'later' drawings in the above quotation. \nEustace Constable was the son of Capt. Charles Constable, the artist's second son. \nA collection of some 70 paintings and 200 drawings by Constable belonging to him was sold at Messrs. Christie's on 16 April 1896.\u201d",

He gave four lectures on 'The History of Landscape Painting' at the Royal Institution in May and June of this year and his last lecture, at Hampstead, on 25 July. Constable died on 31 March 1837. His almost completed painting 'Arundel Mill and Castle' (now in the Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio; see No. 379 [260-1888]) was exhibited posthumously at the Royal Academy.' \n                                 \t\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 233]",
