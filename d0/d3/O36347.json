The top is flat and it appears that something else had been glued to it. The body is pale grey with a clear plastic sliding side which opens to reveal the inner. The inner is moulded mid blue plastic with two orange plastic straps (one has a buckle). It is shaped to show a seat and control panels. On the front is a decal of silver paper marked in blue UNITED STATES with the red, white and blue stars and stripes flag. This panel is scratched.  Where the bottom part has been broken it seems that an attempt has been made to remove the bottom. This is not possible without further damage and it may be assumed that the damage was caused by such an attempt.",
