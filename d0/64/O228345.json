Tourists loved to buy coral jewellery in fashionable shapes, but it was also very popular with Italian women, who valued it for its colour and amuletic qualities.  Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces were always shaped, as here.  Although this necklace looks as if it has been made from lumps of natural coral, each of the beads is carefully carved into a shape like a tiny diabolo, gradually increasing in size from the clasp to the front of the necklace.  The cord passes through a hole in the narrowest part, forcing each bead to lie at right angles to its neighbour, forming a natural pattern.\n\nThis necklace was acquired in Genoa as a piece of traditional Italian jewellery, but it is more typical of the kind of fashionable jewellery which was worn all over Europe in the 19th century.  It was bought for \u00a31 4s as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
