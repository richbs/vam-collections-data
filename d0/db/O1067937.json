Unknown Man, aged 22</b> \n<b>c.1616</b> \nEvans 338  \n\n<b>Oval about 97 x 78 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in dark grey-brown, hatched and stippled on the bare vellum; hair, collar and costume lined and hatched in pale brown; in the background broken lines of pale brown 'ruled' to produce the illusion of the niche; on unsupported vellum. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> The vellum roughly cut to the oval, dearly truncating the 'architectural' surround, and filled out with spurious wash to the margins of the modern support card; otherwise apparently sound. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Lower centre: BG [interlaced] Gerbier Fecit /1616. Inscribed: Lettered right to left around the portrait: Cheminant sur la Croix au Ciel ie tends les aisles. And within the inner oval: Aetatis xxii. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> An oval frame, perhaps eighteenth-century, of fruitwood stained brown, with a moulded tortoiseshell front, and with the inner rim painted with gold.\n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Ieffrey Whitehead, his sale, Christie's 10 August 1915, lot 635, by Drawings\", Connoisseur, LI, Pt. 1(1918), p. 65, repro.; Long 1929, p. 170; Foskett 1979, pl. 13d; Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 24.\n\n\nDate and technique alone would place this miniature very close to the other works by Gerbier and the Anglo-Netherlandish engravers cited in the entry for Cat. No. 3, and the resemblance would be greater still if the vellum bearing the outer parts of the scrollwork cartouche had not been cropped from the (presumably) original rectangle. The use of engraver's techniques to suggest by means of line alone differences in texture, light and shade, curved or receding forms etc., is again perhaps specifically connected with the influence of the van de Passes. But the dynamic, baroque pose in this subject differs markedly from the hieratic imagery used for the royal portrait in James 1's <i>Opera</i> and the <i>Baziliwlogia</i> (1616-18). The motto in French, perhaps Jansenist in sentiment, could suggest that the portrait was painted before Gerbier's arrival in England to join the household of Noel de Carron, the Dutch ambassador, in 1616. On the other hand, Gerbier himself claimed in correspondence with the Duke of Buckingham that he had not been a painter until he had left the service of Prince Maurice for that of the Duke.(1) And Gerbier's role in Buckingham's service was no less international than it had been in Prince Maurice's. \nUnfortunately the coat of arms, an eagle displayed over a saltire cross, is not readily identifiable. Of the various possibilities (2) that of the Constant-Kebecque family of Holland seems closest. (3)  It seems right that the arms should be Dutch, but preferable that they should belong to a family recognisably part of the circle of princes and courtiers whom Gerbier otherwise painted: Constant-Kebecque rings no bells. It may be significant that Gerbier's accuracy in representing the complicated quarterings of Prince Maurice's arms could be faulty;(4) but here the device is so simple and ill correspondence with the motto so exact that Gerbier is unlikely to have misrepresented it.
