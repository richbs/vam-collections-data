In 1876, Ardern Holt wrote in The Queen, a periodical, that 'As the trains of outdoor dresses get longer and longer a serviceable dress holder becomes more and more indispensable...What we expect of a dress holder is to grasp the dress tightly, and to retain its hold firmly without injuring the material in any way; besides, the mechanism should be capable of being easily applied, as well as of being easily detached.'\n\nThis dress holder would have been suspended by a chain from a chatelaine hook worn on the girdle of a woman's dress.  It claims to be 'The Duchess of Connaught Patent', named in honour of Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, who married Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and son of Queen Victoria, in 1879.",

This example was a patent design named in honour of Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, who became Duchess of Connaught on her marriage on 13 March 1879 to Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, son of Queen Victoria.\n\nThe donor records that the dress holder was almost certainly owned by Mrs W. E. (Annie) Wallace (n\u00e9e Frankham, 1856-1943), whose husband, William Henry Wallace, was a noted floriculturalist.  He won the Royal Horticultural Society Victoria Medal of Honour in 1927, and was a county alderman and Justice of the Peace.  The firm of W. E. Wallace and Son Limited specialised in carnations, following the gift of some cuttings from Leopold de Rothschild in 1904.  Carnations were supplied to among others, Buckingham Palace and the Royal Yacht.  W.E. Wallace's son was William Henry Wallace whose sister, Mrs P. S. (Winifred May) Oates (1900-92) definitely owned the dress holder.  From her it passed to a daughter of W. H. Wallace, Enid. M. Church (n\u00e9e Wallace; 1913-2008).",
