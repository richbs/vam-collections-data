They also demonstrate the artist's distinctive use of floral subject matter, which illustrates both the growth and the decay of plants and flowers. Although Nerys Johnson was reluctant to be seen as a disabled artist, by her own admission her works are a testimony to the physicality of the creative process. This is particularly apparent in the artist's use of a wide range of techniques that were often dictated by her health. These include the use of tissue paper instead of a brush for creating images. Nerys Johnson often employed art students to help her to mix paints and prepare her materials, and so turned the problem of her deteriorating health into an opportunity to teach and share her talents.",
