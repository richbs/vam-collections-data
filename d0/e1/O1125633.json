They also included  the catsuit, jumpsuit and flying suit, and were usually sleeveless or short sleeved unwaisted garments with trouser legs, in a fairly lightweight but warm fabric.\n\nThe jumpsuit was originally worn by those making a jump by parachute and the flying suit from clothes worn while flying a plane.The bubble suit was in reference to its fuller cut, which more easily fitted over a nappy and was therefore particularly suitable for the youngest children, whereas the cat suit was tighter fitting, and probably thought to make the wearer move like a cat",
