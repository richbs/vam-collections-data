He explains \"The Norman Shaw collection of clocks, which was very extensive, was sold at Christie's in 1913 - a few specimens only being kept by the family\".  He describes all of the clocks being offered including \"the other bracket clock is by Charles Gretton, an (eminent?) make of \"The Ship\", Fleet Street (C.C. 1672 Master 1701).  This clock of about 1680 is in an ebony case with gilt metal mounts, has an hour striking and a repeating movement and original engraved brass key.  It would be a very desirable acquisition.\".\n\n28/3/32 H Clifford Smith notes on Minute Paper\n\"I have already reported on these two clocks - the Charles II ebony bracket clock of about 1680; and\u2026\u2026\u2026\" .  (Further file memos refer only to another 18th C. clock\n\nThis clock and 1 long case clock were the only 2 accepted from the offer.\n\nOn long loan to Privy Council Office from 1968 to 1998.",
