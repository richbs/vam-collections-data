He trained as a sculptor under Professor Lant\u00e9ri at the Royal College of Art, and later under J E Boehm in Paris. Although he is remembered as a sculptor, Dressler had a wide range of interests. He was an early member of the Art Workers' Guild, and produced works in a variety of materials and techniques. He also held strong Ruskinian beliefs, and published a paper in 1896 entitled 'The Curse of Machinery'.\nA photograph (A.3:2-1995) of about 1900 showing the bust in the sculptor's studio was acquired at the same time as the present piece.",
