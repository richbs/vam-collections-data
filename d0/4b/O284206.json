It could not adopt the muslin\u2013like quality that fashion required in that period, and bobbin lace could assume; but with continued patronage from the Catholic church and some court use, particularly in Spain, Russia, and Poland, where French needle lace remained the prime lace for ceremonial occasions, the industry saw gradual development again. This border has the trailing flowers, open ground and detailed diaper-patterned fillings fashionable in lace in the mid century.",
