It remained popular in Spain and Italy throughout the 17th century. The blade of a 'main gauche' or 'left hand' dagger was usually straight and double edged, frequently with prongs or serrations designed to catch an opponent's blade. The counterguard of Spanish daggers was often triangular and the guard was usually decorated en suite with the rapier. \n\nSome of the finest chiselled iron cup hilts in the Spanish fashion were produced by Italian craftsmen from the Kingdom of Naples, under Spanish rule in the mid 17th century. In their designs the Italian chisellers drew upon the common stock of engraved ornament of their time, but, interpreting their sources in a particularly individual manner, they created something that was quite fresh and original.\n\nSource:J F Hayward, Swords and Daggers, London, HMSO, 1963, p.7",
