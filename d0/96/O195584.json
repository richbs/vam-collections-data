He has influenced designers in the 1980s such as Ian Anderson of the Designers Republic and in some ways established the profession of sleeve designer. \n\nDean's work represents an important stylistic phase in pre-punk Britain that grew out of the psychedelic work of Michael English in the 1960s. His general importance to the British record industry is attested by Richard Branson's commission for a label logo for his newly formed Virgin Records in 1970.",

(He has designed chairs, interiors and houses and is currently (1991) exploring the possibility of designing a theme-park with a Japanese company.) \n\nDean graduated from the RCA in 1968 and in the same year designed the seating for the club 'Upstairs' at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. His interests in architectonic and organic forms are reflected in his sleeve art. His work for the rock group Yes established a strong 'corporate identity' further enhanced with the 'organic' logotype (ca.1971). He began designing stage sets for the group in 1972 which reflected the sleeve designs.",
