Both effigies were originally placed in the church of S. Pedro at Oca\u00f1a near Toledo in Spain, but they were removed when the church was declared structurally unsound in 1906. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda holds a rosary, an indication of her piety.\n\nThe church of S. Pedro was closely associated with the military Order of Santiago, which owned Oca\u00f1a.\n\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda's simple dress, reminiscent of a nun, also implies her lack of ostentation and her religious devotion. Although the author of the tomb is unknown, he is likely to have been a sculptor active in Toledo, and the skill with which the dress and portraits are rendered on both this effigy and that of don Garc\u00eda Osorio (do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Perea's husband) suggests an experienced Castilian sculptor perhaps influenced by Netherlandish prototypes, in the tradition of Gil de Siloe.",

            "history_note": "Like A.48-1910, this effigy was originally in a chapel of the church of S. Pedro at Oca\u00f1a, about fifty kilometres east of Toledo. The church was used for meetings of the Castilian cortes (the local parliament), and for important ceremonial occasions, until the the end of the fifteenth century. The contents of the church were dispersed in about 1906, when the building was declared structurally unsafe (it was demolished in 1907). The effigies may have been acquired by a Madrid dealer, Borondo, and were subsequently bought by the London dealer Lionel Harris, from whom the Museum purchased them. Two other effigies from the same church were bought by the Hispanic Society of America  in New York at the same time.\n\nHistorical significance: Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Perea is shown holding rosary beads, a symbol of her piety. At her feet a small mourning allegorical female figure leans against three books, which may well be intended to represent devotional volumes. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda's simple dress, reminiscent of a nun, also implies her lack of ostentation and her religious devotion. Although the author of the tomb is unknown, he is likely to have been a sculptor active in Toledo, and the skill with which the dress and portraits are rendered on both this effigy and that of don Garc\u00eda Osorio (do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Perea's husband) suggests an experienced Castilian sculptor perhaps influenced by Netherlandish prototypes, in the tradition of Gil de Siloe.",

            "historical_context_note": "The church of S. Pedro was closely associated with the military Order of Santiago, which owned Oca\u00f1a. The subject of this effigy was do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de Perea (d. after 1499), the wife of don Garc\u00eda Osorio, a knight of the Order of Santiago, whose effigy is also in the collection (A.48-1910).",
