A warming-pan was used to overcome these inconveniences.  The pan was filled with hot coals from the fire, then moved swiftly between the sheets using the long handle, immediately before the occupants got into the bed.\n\nMaterials\nThe pans are usually made from wrought iron as they are less likely to be damaged by hot coals.  The lids are of brass or copper although the very wealthy had warming-pans with silver lids.\n\nOwnership & Use\nServants had to be careful not to scorch expensive linen sheets.  When not in use the warming pan was hung from a hook on the bedroom wall.  With its brightly polished lid, it formed part of the ornament of a room and was usually decorated with engraving or pierced work.  Warming-pans are mentioned in the 14th century in French documents and by the 17th century they had become relatively common domestic items.  This warming-pan may have been made as a wedding present as the scene on the lid shows a cavalier and his lady.",
