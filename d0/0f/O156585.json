This ceremony is central to all denominations of Christian faith. It is held to commemorate the Last Supper, the meal taken by Christ and his disciples on the day before the crucifixion. It is described as a simple meal during which Christ bestowed symbolic significance on the bread and wine. The ritual taking of bread and wine is therefore central to Christian faith. In the Orthodox Church every communicant receives wine and bread offered in relatively large chalices such as this one.\n\nThe decoration of the chalice follows the Orthodox tradition and includes quotes from the Gospels and pictures relating to the Passion of Christ. In addition to its complex religious symbolic and importance as liturgical silver, the chalice is also a fine example of Russian goldsmithing of the early 17th century.\n\nThis chalice is on loan to the Victoria & Albert Museum as part of the Gilbert Collection. Sir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The date 1702 marks what would have been the busiest stage in the planning of the cathedral, which is thought to have been conceived around 1698. Certainly this was a period in which Sampson must have turned his attention to the embellishment of his new church with splendid ritual implements. Also, although Astrakhan had a number of churches, none was as large or rich as the cathedral, nor were there any others dedicated to the 'pure Virgin Mother of God'.</i>\n( Alla Theodora Hall, in: T. Schroder, 1988, p. 569)\n\n\nProvenance: According to inscription donated by Sampson, Metropolitan of Astrakhan and Tersk,  probably to the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God, Astrakhan; George  R.
