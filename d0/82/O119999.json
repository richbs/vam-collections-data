They are often illustrated in scholars' studies where they served meditation, or simply helped judge the time of day.\n\nSandglasses in this period were constructed from two matching glass ampoules sealed (often with wax or pitch) and bound with fabric at the joint. The 'sand' was usually a material less sensitive to moisture such as powdered metal, rock or eggshell.\n\nThese four sandglasses in a single frame run for different periods, probably subdivisions of an hour, but it has not been possible to time them precisely as the particles no longer run freely.",
