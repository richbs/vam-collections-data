This one translates as 'Belonging to Mr Juan De Ocampo' and 'Francisco Moreno in Baeza 1695'. Francisco Moreno probably gave the knife to Juan De Ocampo in 1695.\n\nSome sets of cutlery were made as gifts or in commemoration of special events. Others were designed to be portable and were engraved with their owner's name. Some simply show the mark of the cutler who made or sold them.",
