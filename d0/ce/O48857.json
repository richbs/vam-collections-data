Covent Garden was represented by a strawberry seller, one of the hundreds of women who carried the fragile crop into and around London from Shropshire or even Wales.'\nRichard Phillips, 'Modern London', 1804/5\nWhen this watercolour was reproduced as an aquatint in Phillips' 'Modern London' the following  'Description of the Plate' was offered:\n\n'STRAWBERRIES -\nBROUGHT fresh gathered to the markets in the height of their season, both morning and afternoon, are sold in pottles, containing something less than a quart each.  The crier adds one penny to the price of the Strawberries for the pottle, which, if returned by the customer, she abates, or will take it again at the same price on another occasion.  Great numbers of both men and women are employed in crying Strawberries during their season, which is June, through the suburbs of London.  Their profit is from threepence to fourpence in the shilling.  Strawberries are frequently to be bought in London at sixpence per pottle.'\n\nThere then follows a note about Covent Garden, the location of the itinerant trader featured in this plate.",
