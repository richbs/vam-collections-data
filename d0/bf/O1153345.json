She carries an arrow in her left hand and wears a hat with a stiff brim made from feathers and with a feather decoration at the top. She also wears a circlet of feathers and beads on both calves and bracelets at her wrists and ankles. The man on the left is dressed in a fitted costume made from ivy leaves and wears a soft cap with a crown shaped brim. In his left hand he carries a broom with a circle of burning candles inserted in its top. The other male figure stands on the far right of the image and is dressed in a long gown with a train. He wears a soft bonnet and a three quarter length tunic.",
