            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe first example of this circular table was designed by Edward William Godwin (1833-1886) in about 1870 for his own home. The ebonised finish was inspired by Japanese woodwork, while the design of the legs is based on a Chinese stand. The table was very popular and subsequently different versions were made by various manufacturers. In 1876 a table like this cost \u00a37.75, while a walnut version cost \u00a37.35. Brass feet cost an extra \u00a31.50.\n\nPeople\nEdward William Godwin (1833-1886) was an architect and designer. He was particularly interested in Japanese art and culture. When he began designing furniture for his own home in London in 1867, he used ideas taken from Japanese sources. He designed a circular table with eight turned legs for himself in about 1870. In 1877, Godwin collaborated with a London manufacturer, William Watt, over a catalogue, 'Art Furniture', which included the design for this table.\n\nTime\nEbonised furniture like this table was very fashionable during the 1870s and 1880s in Britain because of the influence of Japanese designs. Circular tables were also popular because they could be used in the centre of a room with flowers, ornaments or books on them.",
