The same text was written in a cartouche on the third page, but has been erased. \nThe book is divided into sections. Each has an introduction to a particular rule and an example, followed by a number of questions, with spaces left for students to complete the answers.\n\nThe titles of each section are printed in heavy gothic type, whereas the numbers are in elegant italics. There is a great mixture of weights and sizes of text throughout the book. though it is densely printed, there does seem to be room for a pupil's workings. The pages are all numbered up to the last two leaves, which function as a catalogue of other Pinnock and Maunder publications. \n\nThis book has been completed up to page 27, in pen and then pencil (possibly in a different hand). Many of the questions are incomplete, allowing a student or teacher to insert appropriate values.\nFor example: 'Bought 48 sheep for .........., what did each cost?'\nOccassionally there are lists of questions to be answered orally by the pupil, for example: 'How many penny-weights one ounce? How many ounces one pound?'",

She married Scottish draper John Train, but was soon widowed, and thereafter is listed is woollen goods trader as well as dressmaker.\n\nFrancis (born 1832) moved to Australia, possibly before his twentieth birthday, where he stayed the rest of his life.\n\nHenry (born 1836) was an apprentice in 1851. Ten years later, at the age of 25, he inherited the family business, and by 1881 was employing 6 men and 2 boys. He was married to Elizabeth from Somerset, and they had six children. He was able to retire in his mid-sixties and move to a country house on the proceeds of the business. Soon after, Elizabeth died, but Henry remarried at the age of 72 to a woman 31 years his junior.
