The joints of the puppet are slits in the wooden body parts with metal strips placed in the slit and pinned in place. The pieces of wood have pencil marks on them, indicating perhaps this doll was made from recycled wood. It is wearing a floral print dress with lace trim around the neck and a pink bonnet that is coming un-glued. The feet have been painted black and the hands are small lead weights to make the arms hang down. The doll has brown curly synthetic hair.",

They were relatively easy to make and this one appears to have been made from recycled pieces of wood as there are pencil marks and letters on the wood, indicating it may have been used for something before it was used for the puppet. This one dates to around the 1940s and would probably have been made for a child when toys were cheaper to hand make. This one has used a mass-produced face that is painted on cloth and then pinned to the wooden head of the marionette. The clothes are of a floral pattern and the material would have been readily available to make the outfit, as making clothes from patterns was popular in this period.",
