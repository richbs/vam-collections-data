At the sale of the contents of his house, 34 Grove End Road, London NW, it was located in his dining room (lot no. 323). A note of Alma Tadema regarding the donation of this leather panel reads as follows: 'Dear Sir Cecil [Smith], I found a pencil note my dear father had made concerning addition to his will, which he did not live to carry out. He wished to leave his large panel of repousse leather to the Victoria & Albert. We were bound by the tenets of the will to let it go into the sale. Fortunately for me it was at a low enough figure enable me to purchase it, and I want to carry out his wish and present it in his name to the museum. I don't know if he had the opportunity of showing you the panel ever at home. He was fond of showing it to his friends, I believe it is supposed to be Italian, 16th century. The only other one we have ever heard of like it is in the Pamphilij Doria in Rome. It measures 110 x 43 inches, is mounted in a mahogany hinged frame.'\n\nAlthough mentioned in the letter by the donor, there is no gilt leather hanging in Palazzo Pamphilij Doria in Rome (this was checked by Eloy Koldeweij when he visited the palazzo in September 1996).\n\nMiss Anna Alma Tadema offered this panel to the Museum in a letter of 20th July 1913 (RF 3690M, Museum Archive). Her letter identifies the panel as a piece her father, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, had intended to bequeath to the Museum in a note he made concerning alterations to his will. The panel was included in the sale of his collection by Hampton & Sons at his home, 34 Grove End Road, London, June 9th-16th 1913. It was probably lot 323 in the Dining Room, 'An old Italian upright leather panel, finely embossed birds, flowers, fruit and foliated scrolls, etc., in high relief, mounted in a specially-made mahogany hinged frame (110 in. by 43 in.)'. Miss Alma Tadema was able to buy the panel at a low figure in order to fulfil her father's wishes that it should be given to the Museum.\n\nOliver Brackett, Department of Woodwork, suggested the panel be displayed 'on one of the pillars in Room 21, which would probably give a satisfactory side light'. (Minute, 24th July 1913, RF 3690M). In 1926 it was on the staircase by the old offices.\n\nIdentical to museum numbers: 3695-1856, 3697-1856, 3697A-1856 and 3728-1856.",
