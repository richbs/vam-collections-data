It acted as instructions for the weaver about how to tie up the threads on the loom and then weave in the pattern. It is similar to a group of designs commissioned by a silk manufacturing partnership active in Lyon \u2014 the most prestigious centre of the silk industry in Europe from the 1660s onwards \u2014 and corresponds in style to the 1760s when patterns were curvaceous. The partnership was called L. Galy, Gallien et cie from 1761 until the beginning of 1771 and it was one of Lyon\u2019s 400 manufacturing concerns mid century. It kept good records, noting on the back of the designs the number of the design and minimal instructions on how it should be woven.\n\nThis design was for a patterned silk with a plain background, approximately 54 centimetres wide. It would have had this motif repeated across the width at least twice. In Lyon, manufacturing regulations dictated the widths in which such silks might be woven.\n\nThe point-paper printer was Joseph Veret, a silk designer who married Marie-Anne Brenier, the widow of Pierre Huilliot, silk designer and engraver. As a dowry he received copper plates suitable for the printing of point papers which were worth a substantial sum of money. On his wife\u2019s death in 1783, the business passed to her nephew Royannet. It was the main supplier of all kinds of papers for design and manufacture in Lyon.",

It belongs to a group of thirty-one designs with similar motifs acquired by the V&A in 1972; they all date to the decade between 1761 and 1771. The manufacturer who commissioned this particular design is unknown but the designs are very similar to those commissioned by L. Galy, Gallien et cie., active in Lyons from 1759-1771 when the firm became L. Galy et cie. At a later date, the designs belonged to the designer Robert Ruepp (b. 1854) whose address was 7 rue Berg\u00e8re in Paris and who exhibited silks of extreme Art Nouveau design at the International Exhibition there in 1900 and other rather less original designs in 1925.  They passed into the hands of Sir Frank Warner, head of the famed English silk manufacturing firm, from the archive of which, part being sold at auction, the V&A acquired them in 1972.",
