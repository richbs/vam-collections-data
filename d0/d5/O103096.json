It would have been used to store consecrated communion bread, known as the host, within a church. Pyxes have closely fitting lids to protect the host from any accident. \n\nThe scene on the front of the pyx is known as the Pi\u00e8ta. It shows the Virgin Mary lamenting over the dead body of her son Jesus. This image developed around 1300 and through its contemplation, the viewer could share the grief and compassion of Mary for her son.\nAlthough church plate of this period is often made of silver or for the most wealthy, gold, gilded copper provided a cheaper but acceptable alternative.",

This iconography would have been clearly understood in the past but it may be less familiar to modern eyes. \n\nThough often decorative, the symbols used on religious metalwork also refer to the function and significance of the objects. The contemplation of religious motifs can draw   believers into a deeper understanding of their faith. Complex theological themes can be represented in a visual form. A chalice, for example, might be adorned with the tools used in the Crucifixion (the 'Instruments of the Passion') to direct the viewer's mind towards Christ's sacrifice and his death on the cross.\n\nThe use of images has caused controversy throughout Christian history. While supporters held that imagery glorified God and helped believers understand their faith better, critics attacked its use as superstition and idolatry.\n\nSaints\nChristians venerate saints as men and women who, through the holiness of their lives, became especially close to God. The saints include martyrs who suffered and died for their faith as well as great teachers and preachers. Their lives provide an example and inspiration for the faithful. Roman Catholics also believe that saints can intercede on their behalf with God. In Christian iconography, saints are usually depicted with a distinctive object or 'attribute' associated with their martyrdom or works. For example, St Bartholomew, who was skinned alive, holds a flaying knife, and St George is shown with a dragon.",
