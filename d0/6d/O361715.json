The collection dates from 1905 to the early 1920s and provides a unique snapshot of a wealthy woman's wardrobe of this time. In contrast to many of the earlier Edwardian garments, with their intricate fastenings and tight fit,  this dress demonstrates the straighter less complicated style of 1920s dresses. The bodice is loosely cut with medium low waistband which sits at the hips. The straight-cut skirt and loose sleeves allow for greater freedom of movement. The organdie vest is not a separate garment but is built into the main body of the dress. Even the small mother of pearl buttons which run down the front of the vest hide more convenient popper fastenings.",
