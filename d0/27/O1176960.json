It shows Act 2 from a production of Amed\u00e9e at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in 1957.\n\nAmed\u00e9e or How to Get Rid of It (Original French title, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e ou comment s'en d\u00e9barrasser) is a play that was written by Eugene Ionesco in 1954 and was based on his earlier short story entitled Oriflamme. This play has been designated part of a movement known as 'The Theatre of the Absurd' which arose in the late 1940s. Playwrights associated with movement, (which deliberately rebelled against, and refused to be bound by, logical construction and argument),  included Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Jean Genet, Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, Fernando Arrabal, and Edward Albee. \n\nIn Amed\u00e9e (which was the first of Ionesco's full length plays) a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger. Ionesco never fully reveals the true identity of the corpse, or how they died, or indeed explains why it is continually growing.",
