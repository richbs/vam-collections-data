The ceiling lamp shown here resembles a Chinese lantern complete with dangling tassel, which was a popular motif in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The plush bedroom setting was invented by Wooller, and is similar to those he designed for ocean-going liners during this time. With lots of machine aesthetic curves, though probably actually hand-made, the emphasis on shiny, shimmering surfaces is like the earlier Elfrida Mostyn bedroom (plate 77), and has an air of luxury about it. The blend of cream and green, together with the rich honey tone of the wood, is reminiscent of Art Deco interiors, and it seems Wooller was attempting, during the austere war years, to recapture a previous period of prosperity and extravagance in design. It would have contrasted dramatically with the austere, plain Utility bedroom furniture which was all that was available in Britain between 1941 and 1953.\"",
