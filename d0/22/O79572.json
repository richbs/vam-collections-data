The use of flexible wire is Ottoman in origin, and bracelets of complex interlocking wire, like this one, were mainly worn by women in the rich cities, particularly in Syria and the Holy Land.  The jewellery of Cyprus, due to its heritage and location, forms part of this general Ottoman tradition, and is often very similar to the jewellery of Syria.  It was worn both by Muslims and the predominant Orthodox Christian population of the island.\n\nThis bracelet was acquired with a collection of other Cypriot jewellery in 1888, just after a terrible famine, when many people had to sell their family heirlooms to survive.  It was described as 18th or 19th-century in date.",
