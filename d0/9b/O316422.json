She was described as an ancestress of the donor.\n\nPreliminary research has revealed that an Elizabeth Manks (b.1836) married Alfred Oakley Pollard (b.1839) on 9 January 1860 in Halifax. Elizabeth was 24, and Alfred was 21. The bride's name, date of the wedding, and the geographic location match, which suggests that the groom's name \"Oakley\" may have been misremembered or misheard as \"Crossley\".",
