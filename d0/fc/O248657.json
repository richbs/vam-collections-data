It uses the turn-over structure associated with woven fabrics and hand-knotted carpets. There is no attempt to mask the obvious horizontal and vertical repeats and there is no backprint to draw attention from the main pattern. The use of line on the flowers, leaves and fruit gives only the slightest sense of depth. <i>Acorn</i>, of the same date, is very similar. \n\nAccording to George Wardle, original drawings showed two repeats vertically and more than one horizontally: \n<i>In preparing the design \u2026 constant watch had to kept for the effect produced by the necessary repetitions of the pattern on wall or curtain and curious experiences were sometimes had when the repeats of a pattern came to be joined round the original unit. In order to see that all went well therefore it was necessary to have at least parts of eight repeats of the design and sometimes entire repeats carefully drawn round the central \u2018model\u2019. \n\nSunflower, Acorn</i> and <i>Mallow</i> (the last designed by Kate Faulkner) were registered as a group. They are all simple, single-colour patterns, issued, for the most part, in soft and pale tones with blues and yellows predominating. The cheapness of these patterns (4s. 6d. to 5s. 6.d. per piece) was intended to balance the range against papers such as <i>Chrysanthemum</i> and <i>Bower</i> (1877), which cost 11s. and 9s. \n\nHowever, also in 1879, an extremely expensive version was published. <i>Sunflower, 108</i>, was printed in greenish-black oil colour on a gold crape-embossed ground and cost 30s. a roll. Morris wrote in December of the same year to the Howards (Kelvin 601, 604) about a gold <i>Sunflower</i> paper which upon inspection \u2018to our grief \u2026 would not do \u2026\u2019 \n\nThe version shown here, printed in red on a gold ground, is entered in the printing log about 1881. In November that year Morris was writing to Rosalind Howard (see Kelvin 742, 749, 750, 753): \u2018The gold and red sunflower is on my board at Queen Square and I will do my best to hit the due colour.\u2019 Obviously the gold-ground papers tended to look too bright on the wall. It is not clear whether these variants were designed first for the Howards or the stock range.' \n\nGeorge Wardle quote presumably taken from: Wardle, George. <u>Memorials of William Morris</u>. 1897.
