            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nPortrait medallions had long been made in metal, and were popular in wax and ivory in mid-18th century England.  Wedgwood, however, was the first person to manufacture them in stoneware on a commercial scale.  \n\nUse\nWedgwood's medallions of 'Modern Subjects' were probably hung on the wall, in wood or brass frames, to display the political and cultural allegiances of the household. Sets of portrait medallions were also kept in cabinets. Wedgwood's letters indicate that his 'Modern Subjects' sold best  when their subjects were most topical.\n\nPeople\nTorbern Bergman (1735-1814) was a Swedish chemist and natural historian. He is remembered for his contributions to the science of analysis and for his investigations into volcanic action.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWedgwood probably copied the portrait from a glass paste medallion manufactured by James Tassie (1735-1799). Tassie in turn probably copied his portrait from a plaster relief by the Swedish sculptor Tobias Sergel (1740-1814), which is now in the National Museum, Sweden.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe medallion is made of Jasper, a fine-grained stoneware that Wedgwood developed as a material for manufacturing medallions and gems. It  was one of a range of new materials that he introduced to meet changes in taste.",
