            "physical_description": "This vessel possibly dates to the 14th century A.D.(R.K.). It is a cylindrical vessel, apparently with a soldered-in base plate. This has a criss-cross pattern on it, and the solder consists of lumpy off-white material. Form the inside, the base plate looks plain. There are three tiny feet, and there is some openwork decoration. This consists of a band of scrolls near the rim. Abraded areas have a browning-gold appearance, and most of the surface is reddish-brown. The interior seems almost rusty, and there is a silvery-white ring where the base plate meets the body. \nAnalyses were carried out on the body and the base, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The body had a completely different composition from that of the base plate. Both parts had been cast separately from a mixture of copper and lead, containing a very low level of tin. However, the base had more than three times the lead content of the body. The reddish colour observed must have been due to the very low proportions of alloying elements in the copper. The zinc figure is ambiguous, and it is not possible to be sure of the presence of this element in the EXDRF spectrum for the body. The overall composition is similar to a number of vases which have been made from what is basically a copper and lead mixture. Silver, iron, arsenic and antimony were apparently the impurities in the body, whereas only iron and silver were detected in the metal of the base plate.",
