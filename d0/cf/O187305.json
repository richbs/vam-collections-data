Signed <i>Gillot</i> (s)<i>c</i>. Inscribed with facsimile signature <i>Bertall</i>. Lettered with details of the paper's publication and within the design with the names of the members represented and with titles of communard newspapers. Gillotage, coloured by hand. 17\u00be x 11\u00bc in. (45 x 28.5 cm.). E.2221-1962\n\nThe Commune's business was divided between nine commissions including an Executive Commission, which was meant to implement decrees passed by the other commissions. In fact, since every measure had to be referred back to the Commune itself, it had very little power. This system was disappointingly similar to traditional and bourgeois patterns of government. The artist scoffs at the Commune's lack of originality, presenting several members of the Executive Commission (including Edouard Vaillant, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cournet, Eug\u00e8ne Vermorel, F\u00e9lix Pyat and erroneously Louis Charles Delescluze) as a bunch of faded flowers.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
