It was first published in the magazine Punch on 14th December 1877 and is a critical response to problems across the British Empire. The design and content of the cartoon may also have been inspired by the first Imperial Assemblage (or Durbar) in Delhi at which Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India. This spectacular ceremony was captured in both paintings and photographs, many of which sought to capture ethnographic and zoological exotica to excite a British audience. It is interesting to note that Queen Victoria was not present at this ceremony, and indeed never visited India.\n\nThe cartoon is part of the George Speaight Punch & Judy Collection and was drawn by Joseph Swain (1820-1909).",
