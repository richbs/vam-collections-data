According to an inscription over the eastern entrance, the tomb was built in 1753\u20131754 by Safdar Jang\u2019s son, Nawab Shuja\u00edu\u00edd-Daula.\n\nThe mausoleum consists of a platform with a series of arches.

He also took more general photographs of the most important monuments of the cities he visited, this being one of them.",
