Simonson in memory of her brother George Simonson.\n\nHistorical significance: Bellotto was the son of Lorenzo Bellotto and Fiorenza Domenica Canale, sister of the famous view painter Antonio Canaletto (DATES). His artistic talent seems to have been spotted early on with his uncle beginning to train him when Bellotto was in his early teens. He was enrolled in the Venetian painter's guild in 1738 at the young age of sixteen. He produced many of the compositions that had been developed by Canaletto, possibly following this successful example or to help fulfil the numerous commissions received by his uncle. Approximately 55 Venetian views are known by Bellotto and many of his <i>capricci</i> date to his time in Venice. This early period shows the artist quickly developing his artistic skills. In the 1740s he travelled throughout Italy visiting cities including Milan, Rome and Turin. All these journeys resulted in groups of view paintings. His Venetian period came to an end with his departure for Dresden in the spring of 1747. He would never return to Venice. This marked the beginning of a period of three decades where he would enjoy patronage in the Northern European courts, including Munich and Vienna as well as Dresden. He eventually settled in Warsaw, where he continued to work until his death. \n\nThe drawing is signed 'Bernardo Belotto de Canaletto Inv. Et Fec. 1764' in the lower left corner. The composition combines various recognisable architectural motifs. In the left building behind which consists of the arches of the prisons on the ground floor and an arcade reminiscent of the Ducal Palace above can be seen beyond an arch from the <i>Marciana</i> library, Venice. The base of the Equestrian monument in the right mid ground recalls that of the <i>Colleoni</i> sistuated in the Piazza di San Giovanni e Paolo, Venice. However the statue itself is closer to that of <i>Augusto II</i> in the Neustadt, Dresden. The view opens out to show a distant town on the other side of the lagoon. Here a tower that recalls that of the Campanile in Saint Mark's Square, Venice, contrasts with the taller round tower on the right which has a northern European feel. There is an earlier drawing for this work in the National Museum, Warsaw. The Warsaw drawing is unfinished, with no shading and ruled lines of perspective still available. The drawing was acquired with another similar <i>Architectural Caprice</i> by Bellotto (inventory number E.31-1939). Both these works are highly finished and present architectural motifs in an almost theatrical way. Unlike most <i>capricci</i> of the eighteenth century, these drawings do not include figures, giving the main focus of each work to the architectural detail and spaces.",
