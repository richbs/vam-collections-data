It is likely that this bust as well as the version in the National Portrait Gallery were cast from a copy of the Bodleian original, although differences are apparent in the two later versions.\n\nHubert Le Sueur (ca. 1590 \u2013 after 1658) was the son of a master armourer in Paris, where he became established as a court artist.  He was appointed as one of the sculptors to Louis XIII in January 1614.  In 1625 he was sent to England to work at the court of Charles I, shortly after the King's marriage to Louis' sister, Henrietta Maria. The use of marble is unique for Le Sueur's portrait busts, as he specialised primarily in bronze.  His impressive equestrian bronze portrait of Charles I now in Trafalgar Square is signed and dated 1633.",
