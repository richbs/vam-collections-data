The robe has a close front with a low square neck, and pleats on either side of the centre front of the bodice.\n\nAn undulating row of fringe is stitched to the skirt to suggest an open front. In the panel are stitched chenille fly braid tassels. An undulating row of trimming is also stitched around the hem. The dress originally opened all the way down the back but this has been half stitched up in recent times, and there are seven sets of ribbon tapes to tie across.\n\nTo the bodice of the robe is stitched a straight bib turned to form a collar of lawn trimmed with three rows of gathered needlepoint lace edging. Originally is would seem that this was in two separate though matching parts. The short sleeves have been covered with matching round cuffs trimmed with three lace frills. Since the spider work insertion with a flower in a pot design is placed under the arm, and the lace is dipped tea colour, it is assumed that the attachment is from a later date.",
