London : South Kensington Museum, 1874.\nThe relevant text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'BOLOGNESE SCHOOL. \n...\nANNIBALE CARACCI. \nPainter and Etcher. \nBorn at Bologna in 1560, died in 1609. \n\nALLEGORICAL SUBJECT for a book illustration. Nude female figure stepping upon a globe; Cupid above, supporting drapery, on which a cardinal's arms are designed, a trophy on the left, and a fallen crown and turban on the right. There is a signature on the drawing of Friederich Inspach, who was probably a former owner.  291 \n<i>Height,</i> 5 6/12 <i>inches.  Width,</i> 3 <i>inches.</i>'\nWard-Jackson, Peter, <u>Italian Drawings. Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 100 The following is the full text of the entry: Allegory An illegible inscription, possibly German, in the lower margin in a darker ink Pen and ink and wash; the outlines incised with a stylus 5 5/8 x 3 (143 x 76) Dyce 291 PROVENANCE Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE &lt;i&gt;Dyce Catalogue&lt;/i&gt; no. 291 (as Annibale Carracci) The drawing shows a naked woman, her right foot upon a globe, and a flag in her right hand. A crown and cloak hang upon a branch of the tree beside her, and a winged putto holds out above her head a canopy decorated with the arms of a cardinal, probably the three bees of Barberini. Enclosed in a framing line in ink. Probably a design for an engraving. The old attribution seems to have no justification. The &lt;i&gt;Dyce Catalogue&lt;/i&gt; gives the inscription as &lt;i&gt;Friederich Inspach&lt;/i&gt;, but this reading does not seem correct. A similar subject is represented an etching of Simone Cantarini (Bartsc 19, p. 143, no. 34)\u2022",
