Embroidered with coloured silks and trimmed with silver braid in chain, satin and stem stitches with couched work and French knots. The design consists of a man in a long robe and cap above a crane catching a dragonfly, and a parrot amidst large flowers on slender scrolling stems, insects and devices of shapes worked in silver thread. The seven tabs at the bottom are embroidered with small five-petalled flowers and leaves. The central part of the stomacher and the tabs are outlined by silver braid and a silver cord is criss-crossed between the two main lines of braid. The edges are bound with cream-coloured silk. There are three tabs of silk ribbon on each side. The stomacher is stiffened and lined with yellow silk.",
