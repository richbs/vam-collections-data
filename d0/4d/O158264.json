Rolf Harris takes lead billing. Although not known as an actor, but rather as a television presenter and artist, the demands of a role in pantomime are very different from those of a serious play. Similarly, Gareth Chilcott, a former rugby star, appears in the production. Lesley Joseph and Sylvester McCoy, although well-known at the time for their appearances in popular BBC television programmes Birds of a Featherand Doctor Who, have both had more serious acting roles on stage.",
