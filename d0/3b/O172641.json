The original textile is preserved in the church of St Servais at Maastricht.\n\nIn the late 19th century the Victoria & Albert Museum acquired many examples of early textiles in good faith. A number of block-printed fragments from the 1200s and 1300s were later revealed to be German fakes made in the 1880s. This piece of silk came from the same source as many of the fakes, but is an honest reproduction. The weaver's identity has been recorded, as has the source of the original textile.\n\nWhilst this object is a reproduction, it is of historical interest. Visitors and students would have been shown it as an example of 7th century design. Before colour photography became widely available, alternative methods of making such material accessible would have been through hand-coloured photographs or paintings.",
