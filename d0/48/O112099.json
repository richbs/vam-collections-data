The musical comedy was a huge success, running until 1940 and making its cheerful Cockney ' Lambeth Walk' number into an instant hit.\n\nLupino Lane (1892-1959) was the son of the clown Harry Lupino and the nephew of the theatre manager Sara Lane.  He appeared at the London Pavilion in 1903 as 'Nipper' Lane and by the 1920s was a popular performer in the West End and in films. His long list of successful comedy parts was nevertheless eclipsed by his triumph as the Cockney who finds himself one of the aristocracy.  The show celebrated its 1000th performance on 26 July 1939, and it may well have been for that occasion that these dolls were made to give to the audience.  The Victorian producer George Edwardes inaugurated the system of giving souvenirs to his audiences for special occasions, giving Geisha dolls representing various characters in the cast  to every audience member to celebrate the 600th performance of The Geisha.",
