Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Sardinia, but has the marks of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which were used throughout southern Italy in the 19th century.  Simple hoop earrings, often very large and made from red gold, were common in the 19th century, and are still widely worn today.  The chain in the centre of this earring, made from flat shapes of red gold, is also typical of southern Italian earrings.\n\nThis earring was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
