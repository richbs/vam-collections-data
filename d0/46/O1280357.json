Blamey was drawn there by the hand-made quality and variation produced by printing techniques, which he wanted to celebrate but not mimic in this book. The hammered aluminium slipcase with a screen-printed label is immediately suggestive of Indian hand-craft and use of recycled materials. The deep yellow of the page edges and title lettering refer to the colour of the spice turmeric. The text, in English with Hindi transliteration, conveys the reader on a tour marked out by phrases from local street advertising. Juxtaposed, the single phrases propose their own darkly humorous meanings. Framed on each page is a facsimile of a leaf from Blamey's notebooks, the unevenness of their perforations making them unfamiliar to a Western eye. The simple drawings have a quality of the commonplace found object, just beyond recognition. The areas of textured shading might be rubbings taken from unexceptional surfaces along the way. 'Past Golden' is a material product, a literal record and an intimately personal impression of a particular place. Yet the fragmentary, abstracted nature of its content allows the viewer to make their own journeys.",
