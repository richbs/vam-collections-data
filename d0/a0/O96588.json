To be seen on the hunting field was an essential attribute of social success. This coat is from an important collection previously in Castle Howard, Yorkshire, that includes seven scarlet hunt coats and one blue hunt coat as well as waistcoats, breeches, stockings and boots.\n\nThere were many different hunt membership rules regulating the colour of the coat, collar and buttons. The engraved buttons on this coat denote the hunt the wearer belonged to. This is an example of a dress hunt coat worn for formal occasions and hunt balls, not out on the field. Dress hunt coats are double-breasted with wider lapels and short tails behind. They often include elements made of more luxurious materials, such as velvet collars and silk-satin facings to the lapels.",
