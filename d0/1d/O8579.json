The chapel was finished by 1248. Due to advances in architectural engineering, the chapel could be built with many large spaces within the stonework to house decorated glass.\n\nThe enormous array of stained glass in the Sainte Chapelle upper and lower chapels depicts the story of humanity from creation to the redemption of mankind by the sacrifice of Christ. Each window contained various stories from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. In the 19th century, the windows were removed and restored and some ended up in private collections. The panels seen here were part of the collection of Henry Vaughan who gave them to the Victoria & Albert Museum in 1864.\n\nThese panels were not originally grouped together. After patient research over the last hundred years, it is now believed that the top left panel illustrates the birth of the prophet Jeremiah from the Old Testament book of Jeremiah. The other three panels are probably episodes recorded in the Old Testament book of Esther.",
