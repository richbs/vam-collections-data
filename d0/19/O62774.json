Behind the head there is a heavy wheel-like siras cakra (disc for hanging garlands). Other details include a srivatsa symbol above the right breast, waistband, makara-kundala ear pendants, a garter with bell worn on the right leg, and padasaras on the feet. The figure is fixed to a circular lotus pedestal, the latter with small holes for fixing the image to a processional carrier. This rests on a detachable rectangular moulded base (pitha) with two rings on either side (currently detached). Traces of encrusted carbonate matter in the crevices  indicate a period of earth-burial.",

The epithet \u2018Rama the moon\u2019 alludes to his handsome face and beauty, most in evidence in this gracious and beautiful image. Rama is the seventh divine appearance (avatara) of Visnu on earth, who appeared in order to rid the world of the demon-king Ravana; their epic battles are recounted in detail in the Ramayana. Rama is a highly popular deity because he is understood as a deified human, a prince of virtuous and noble character who lived on earth as a human, despite being understood as a divine appearance of Visnu.\n\nRama gently flexes as he leans of his long bow (kodanda) and with his raised hand gestures as if holding an arrow. He wears a cylindrical crown (kirita makuta), a skirt-cloth secured with a girdle featuring a large makara clasp, and other body adornments. The srivatsa symbol, denoting both the natural world over which Visnu presides, is visible on his upper right chest, and he wears a sacred cord. The figure is fixed to a circular lotus pedestal, the latter with small holes for fixing the image for processional use. Reportedly unearthed in the Zamindari at Ramnad (modern Ramanathapuram) south-east of Madurai. Traces of encrusted carbonate in the patina indicate an extended period of burial.",
