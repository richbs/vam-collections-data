The doll is produced by Mattel, Inc and was invented by Ruth Handler, whose own daughter was called Barbara. In recent years Barbie has faced increasing competition from the Bratz range of dolls. This particular Barbie was produced in 2003 in China by Mattel. \n\nThe doll was acquired in 2007, donated to the Museum from the BBC, who had made a programme on Barbie for their Money Week special. This Barbie doll is part of the My Scene range which was Mattel's answer to the rivalry of Bratz. This doll is called Sutton and he is Afro-American with dark brown hair, dark skin and brown eyes. He has an urban look and comes with musical accessories. He is named after Sutton Place in New York.",
