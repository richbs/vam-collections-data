            "public_access_description": "Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-1770) was born in Paris and probably received his first artistic training from his father who was a painter before attending the Acad\u00e9mie de France in Rome. He may also have travelled to Naples, Venice and Bologna. Around 1731 Boucher returned to Paris where he rapidly gained the royal favour and interest from private collectors. He was a very prolific artist and produced a wide range of artworks from pastoral paintings, porcelain and tapestry designs as well as stage designs influencing deeply the new Rococo movement.\n\nThis painting is a copy after a composition signed and dated by Boucher in 1741 but now lost. It depicts the allegory of Fire and originally belongs to a cycle of four paintings representing the Elements. The V&A also owns a copy of Air (595-1882) which forms a pendant with the present painting.\n This work is a fine example of the early career of Boucher, who already pervaded his oeuvre with mischievous pastoral scenes which would become the hallmark of his art and eventually of the whole rococo period.",

In 1725 he was commissioned by Jean de Julienne to undertake engravings after Watteau for the <i>Figures de diff\u00e9rents caract\u00e8res de paysages et d'\u00e9tudes</i>. In 1727 he was in Italy with Carle van Loo and on his return in 1731 he became an <i>agr\u00e9e</i> of the Acad\u00e9mie. Three years later he was called to Beauvais to design tapestries and ultimately became Inspector of the Paris Gobelins factory after Oudry's death in 1755. He was a profilic and popular painter, working for Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. In 1765 he was appointed Director of the Acad\u00e9mie, and <i>Premier Peintre du Roi</i> in succession to Van Loo. \n     Boucher was the most important figure among the second generation of French rococo painters and he exerted considerable influence both in painting and in the decorative arts. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> A Michel, <i>Boucher</i>, 1906; P. de Nolhac, <i>Boucher</i>, 1907. \n\n\nFollower of Fran\u00e7ois BOUCHER \n\n40 \nFIRE: THREE PUTTI HOLDING A BOW \nAND ARROW, A BURNING TORCH AND A MANTLE CONTAINING HEARTS AND FLOWERS \n<i>Canvas</i> \n34\u00bc x 29\u00bd (86.6 x 74.6) \nJones Bequest \n596-1882\n\nOne of a series of four pictures, of which two are in the Museum (see no. 39), representing the Elements. The original composition by Boucher was engraved by J. Daull\u00e9 (print in Dept. of Prints & Drawings, 26472.3). The engraving is inscribed:  \n                                   Sur le front de l'Amour \n                                   Brille une flamme pure: \n                                   Aimons; c'est l'oeil du jour \n                                   Le Feu de la Nature. \n     The engraving is reversed, which suggests that 596-1882 is derived from the original painting and not from the engraving. It differs also from the engraving in minor details, such as the legs of the lowest figure. Like the engraving, it was probably originally oval; the canvas at the upper corners were added at a later date. The quality of the painting indicates that it was executed in Boucher's studio and not by the master himself.\n     The popularity of the composition is witnessed by its appearance on objects of the decorative arts; see R.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.  The Jones Collection.  With Portrait and Woodcuts</u>.  Published for the Committee of Council on Education by Chapman and Hall, Limited, 11, Henrietta Street. 1884.  \n<u>Chapter I.

Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a copy after a lost composition, oval in format and currently known through the engraving made by Jean Daull\u00e9 in 1748 (see The British Museum, London, 1866,0113.21 and The Victoria and Albert Museum, E.6918-1903). \nIt depicts three naked putti: one carrying hearts and flowers in a drapery, another holding a torch, the last one about to shoot an arrow. This composition is traditionally interpreted as an allegory of Fire and was part of a cycle of four paintings representing the Elements, all four were engraved by Jean Daull\u00e9 in 1748. The print is inscribed with the following verses:\n                        Sur le front de l'Amour \n                        Brille une flamme pure\n                        Aimons : c'est l'oeil du jour, \n                        Le Feu de la Nature.  \nAccording to the print, the original painting by Boucher belonged to Louis XV, King of France whereas the print was dedicated by Daull\u00e9 to the Count of Bruhl.\nThe cycle is composed of allegories of the other three elements: <i>Earth</i>, Ivens collection, England, <i>Water</i>, lost and known only through Daull\u00e9's engraving, and <i>Air</i>, formerly in a private collection, New York and sold again at Sotheby's, New York, 23rd June 2003, lot 93. The V&A also owns a copy of <i>Air</i> (595-1882), which forms a pendant with the present painting.\nCompare with the V&A copy, Daull\u00e9's engraving appears in reverse, which suggests that the V&A version was not made after the print but after the original painting. \nThese paintings from Boucher's early career anticipates somehow the pastoral imagery pervaded with putti, mythological figures, shepherds and shepherdesses in idyllic landscapes that would contribute to characterise the Rococo movement, of which Boucher became one of the greatest exponents.",

            "production_note": "", 
            "historical_context_note": "Pastoral is a genre of painting whose subject is the idealized life of shepherds and shepherdesses set in an ideally beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century in fact, the Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had became an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.",
