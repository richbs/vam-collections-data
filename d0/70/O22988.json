The Utility scheme was a war-time intervention by Government to standardise furniture in order to avoid wasting precious raw materials. A committee, infused with an almost nineteenth century moral purpose and earnestness, supervised the design, initially of a range of 30 items designed by Edwin Clinch and H.T. Cutter from the traditional furniture centre of High Wycombe. The furniture, issued under a rationing coupon system, was available to newly married couples and people who had been bombed out. A legally enforced specification was licensed to certain manufacturers, who, to save fuel, were regionally organised and so might have little previous experience of furniture making. Post-war austerity meant that the Utility furniture scheme was only fully revoked in 1951.\n\n[Stephen Astley, 'British Design at Home', p.132]",
