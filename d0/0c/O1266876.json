Enamelling is a painstaking and empirical art. The firing temperature of different enamel colours must be determined in advance so that colours can be applied and fired in the correct sequence. Nor do enamels reveal their true final colour tone until they have been fired in the kiln. By trying out different recipes and making a careful note of what ingredients were used for each colour, the painter could be confident that his finished work would accurately reflect the scheme that he had planned. Above each neat and tiny enamelled rectangle are numerals and sequences of dots which acted as a colour code for the painter. The palette here is particularly strong on browns, reds, pinks and  yellows rather than blues and greens. The back is signed in black enamel with the  artist's monogram and date.",

He was a keen collector and bought many items for his properties via art agents who obtained pieces for him from auction. Limoges enamels and portrait miniatures both featured in his bequest to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, so it was quite possibly Cunliffe who acquired this plaque rather than the Copeland family (of the Copeland Spode Staffordshire ceramics business) who inherited the property through descent. The plaque was not sold as part of the Copeland China Collection on 24th July 2013 but as part of the house contents on the preceding day.",
