The island of Nias, off the west coast of Sumatra, assimilated some of the finery of the courts of coastal Sumatra, but also had its own unique and elaborate range of ceremonial garments and ornaments.  The extended shoulder-line of this jacket is typical of male dress in South Nias, and it would have been worn either on its own or over a long-sleeved jacket, with a loincloth or, more recently, western-style trousers.  The jacket is lined with European printed cotton.",
