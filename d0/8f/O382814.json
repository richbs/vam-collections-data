This is confirmed by the marks on the back of one of the roundels, which show that it was made after 1886 by David Andersen, one of the foremost jewellers in Oslo at the time.  But David Andersen did not make these as earrings.  Traces of fittings which have been removed show that the individual roundels were originally part of a necklace or bracelet.  They were probably made up into earrings in the early 20th century for Lady Cory, a great lover of jewellery who had no hesitation in adapting pieces to suit her needs, and who gave them to the museum, along with many other pieces, in 1950.",
