            "public_access_description": "Sir Charles Harcourt Chambers (1789-1828) was appointed Puisne Judge of the new Supreme Court, Bombay in 1823. He was knighted by George III and became acting Chief Justice of Bombay in August 1828, two months before his death. In his spare time, Chambers was an accomplished amateur watercolour painter of landscapes and riverscapes and journeyed regularly across the harbour to Panvel on the mainland. He also explored the nearby region of the Konkan and Western Ghats, and his pictures were clearly executed on the spot as he travelled. He repeatedly painted the forts, hills and pinnacles, often including trees and vegetation to enhance his compositions. He had considerable skill in capturing atmospheric effects, and his scenes have a distinct sense of reality. It was Chambers himself who probably inserted the pictures into three albums (IS.21 to 23-1994) by slitting the leaves and placing them mostly on separate pages. They are mostly in pencil and watercolour, with a few drawings in pen and ink or pencil.  Besides views of Western India, the albums contain a few paintings of  London and scenery in England, Scotland and Wales. This picture shows the Hill Fort of Lowghur as seen from below. Chambers has inscribed it as follows: 'The stone round with a hole in it and lying in a circle of green at the bottom of picture - is still used for grinding mortar - which is spread on the circle - Bullocks are then yoked to the stone - a chain being passed through the hole and they are made to drag it round the circle'.",
