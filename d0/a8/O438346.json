The central motif of a crab can be symbolic of good wishes for success in the civil service examinations.  It was recovered from a Portuguese ship wreck, circa 1558, off the coast of Mozambique, in Africa in 2001. This suggests that Chinese ceramics were already being traded in Africa during the late 16th century.",

Rapidly the island prospered and became the principle centre of African trade and the most important nodal point within the Western empire. Due to the increasing importance if this harbour in 1545 the decision was taken to fortify the northern end of the island with the monumental Fortaleza de Sao Sebastiao. 456 years later and only 480 meters away from this fortress, marine archeologists discovered the remains of an early Portuguese ship. the cargo included a large number of Chinese ceramics, mostly blue and white.",
