In part, his attitude reflected the general status of photography in Britain in the 1950's, as an undervalued artistic medium. After his dismissal from Vogue he photographed street scenes in Paris and Rome. Deakin\u2019s reputation was re-evaluated following an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1984.",
