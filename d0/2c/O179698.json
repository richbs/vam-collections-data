Wealthy women owned many pairs suited to different occasions and carefully chosen to match particular outfits. Strict rules applied to the wearing of gloves. A woman would be considered undressed if she left the house ungloved and it was customary, for instance, to keep gloves on in church, at the theatre and at balls but to remove them before dining.\n\nThese lilac-coloured kid gloves are typical of day gloves worn by women throughout the 19th century.  A slim, elegant hand was considered a sign of good breeding and women's gloves became ever closer fitting. The gloves shown in this image would have been stretched to fit the wearer, using a special glove-stretching tool. The decorative pointing on the backs of the hands add to the slender appearance.",
