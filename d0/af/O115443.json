The surrounding birds, monkeys, happy couples and celestial beings playing musical instruments all contribute to the sense of joy.\n\nThe Ajanta cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them.

They depict scenes from the lives of the Buddha and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Of the 30 or so paintings he completed most  were displayed at the Crystal Palace in Sydenham. Unfortunately those that were displayed were destroyed in a fire there in 1866. This painting is one of only 4 surviving examples in the museum collection.",
