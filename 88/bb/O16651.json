Voysey was one of the most original and influential architects and designers of all forms of decorative art working at the end of the 19th century. In 1882 he set up his own architecture practice. From the late 1880s he started to design repeating patterns for wallpaper, woven and printed textiles and carpets. \n\nVoysey's most interesting designs date from this time. They are dominated by flowing patterns incorporating pastel-coloured birds, animals, hearts, flowers and trees in silhouette. He sold his work to manufacturers such as G. P. & J. Baker, Thomas Wardle and Alexander Morton. His designs were well known in continental Europe. Although they were popular with French Art Nouveau designers, the founders of the modern movement felt his influence more dramatically.\n\nGeorge Percival and James Baker were brothers. They founded the printed fabric manufacturers G. P. & J. Baker in 1893. They bought work from the leading designers of the years around 1900, including Voysey, Lindsay Butterfield and the Silver Studio in London. These designs were characterised by highly original floral patterns. The firm became contract printers to many popular shops, such as Liberty & Co. of London.",
