It is widened by the insertion of two triangular gores at each side, starting below each arm and widening to 5.5 inches each at the hem. The sleeves, which are 9.5 inches long (elbow length) are set in straight and beneath each is a square gusset folded into a triangle. The neckline is only slightly hollowed at the back and a little more deeply into a 'V' at the front where there is a 9.25 inch opening. There is a finer quality linen edging at the neck and a frill at the front opening and at the sleeve ends. The garment is very finely stitched and is faced with tapes on the reverse of the neck line, the junction of the sleeves at the shoulder, the cuffs, the button attachment at the neck, the buttonhole and the bottom of the neck vent. There is a linen reinforcement at each shoulder which simulates a shoulder seam finish. The gown fastens with a tape threaded through the neckline, and a linen covered metal button and tape buttonhole at the neck opening.",
