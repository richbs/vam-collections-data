The one shown here appears to be a section of a tunic showing an armhole and a trimmed neck. The pattern of the silk consists of a circular medallion with the stylized Chinese character shou, meaning 'longevity', and motif of a flaming jewel that fills the spaces in between these medallions. However, the pattern might have been misunderstood by the tailor as it is utilised 'upside-down', with incorrect orientation of the motifs. This suggests that at least the tailoring was done in a context where the reading of Chinese characters was irrelevant.",

The one shown here, in pale blue and silvery beige, appears to be a section of a tunic showing an armhole and a trimmed neck. The pattern of the silk consists of a circular medallion with the stylized Chinese character <i>shou</i>, meaning 'longevity', and motif of a flaming jewel that fills the spaces in between these medallions. However, the pattern might have been misunderstood by the tailor as it is utilised 'upside-down', with incorrect orientation of the motifs. This suggests that at least the tailoring was done in a context where the reading of Chinese characters was irrelevant. The weaving may thus have been carried out in China and the silks then exported westwards, or it could have been done outside China by Islamic craftsmen familiar with Chinese patterning.\nThe staining may be due to their having been buried, although no archeological report exist.\nSimilar textiles have not been found in China and it is possible that these silks were made specially for the Mamluk empire (1250-1517). From surviving Mamluk textiles, it seems that blue was a favoured colour. Mamluk and other textiles from the Islamic world are known to incorporate scripts into their designs, so the inclusion of a longevity ideograph may have been a deliberate move.",
