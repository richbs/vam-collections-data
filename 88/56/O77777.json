It is likely that it was intended to be displayed as an example of fine embossing or repouss\u00e9 work (silver hammered from the back to give a raised decorative effect) to inspire art workers or students visiting the Museum.\n\nPeople\nThomas Spall, who made this panel was born in Dublin in 1853 and studied at the Birmingham School of Art before training with the local, but internationally important manufacturers, Elkington & Co. His work was praised for its 'feeling and finish' and admired for the excellence of the craftsmanship.\n\nSubject\nAt the time the panel was acquired, the subject  of two angels singing from a book, was stated to be 'after an original by Donatello'. More recent research has indicated that the panel which it copies is more likely to have been the work of an assistant in Donatello's studio.",
