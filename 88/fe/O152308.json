It is placed within a square formed by graceful arabesques in dark blue outlined with silver.  There is a subsidiary pattern in 'gold' thread: thin lines with small leaves and small 'gold' flowers sweep out from the centre to form swirling stems which cross at the corners and halfway down each side. There is a composite blossoms where they cross and dark blue round flowers, leaves and other smaller blossoms along their length.  The blossoms in the corners are large, in silver and dark blue and blue.\nThe border is edged on both sides with black silk threads over which silver threads have been couched.  Metal thread forms a coiling meander with a flower head in coloured silks.\nBacking: pieced pink cotton.\nFacing: green silk satin. Under-drawing is clearly visible where couched threads are loose.\n\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: dark blue, blue, light green, pink, light pink and black.\nMetal thread: silver-gilt strip wound around a yellow silk core and silver strip wound around a white silk core.",
