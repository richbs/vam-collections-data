This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into the creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.\n\nFast Product was an Edinburgh-based independent record label, established by Bob Last in 1977. It released the first records from a number of influential post-punk bands, including the Human League and the Mekons.",
