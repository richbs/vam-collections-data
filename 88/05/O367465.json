The deep gauntlet cuff is inspired by historic sixteenth and seventeenth century gloves. A sign of their quality can be seen in the construction of the thumb, which has an extra gusset at the base to offer an accurate fit and greater freedom of movement. This feature is known as a \"Bolton thumb\".\n\nThe designer, Cornelia James (1917-1999) emigrated from Vienna to Brighton following World War II. In 1946 she and her husband established a high end glove-making firm and the following year, were commisioned by Norman Hartnell to make the gloves to accompany his designs for Princess Elizabeth's wedding and going-away outfits. Cornelia James continued making gloves for the future Queen, and also made gloves for other members of the Royal Family. In 1979 the firm was awarded a Royal Warrant as 'glove maker by appointment to Her Majesty the Queen', which it still holds. The company now operates under the direction of Genevieve James, Cornelia's daughter.",
