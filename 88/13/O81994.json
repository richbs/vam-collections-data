Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>93 Unknown man</b>, 1590-93\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.3-1974)</i>\nVellum stuck to a playing card with six hearts at the reverse, oval, 50 x 42 mm, 2 \u00be x 1 5/8 in.\n\nOne of the five Radnor miniatures (see nos. 87, 210) still in its original turned ivory box.  It is in very poor condition with sever flaking of the shirt, abrasions to the features and background, which is also damaged by water, and very faded.  Nonetheless the miniature is unique amongst Hilliard\u2019s <i>oeuvre</i> in placing the sitter against a black background.  V. J. Muirrell points out that the demand of the sitter for this colour has caused Hilliard difficulties in marrying it to the hair, resulting in a hard unbroken edge in contrast to his usual ability to extend the hair over a lighter background.\n\nThe young man looks about twenty and is presenting himself as a lover.  Black as a colour is emblematic of constancy because it will take not other colour (see Leslie Hotson, <i>Mr W H</i>, London, 1964, p. 211 for a list of references to this).  Both REYNOLDS AND Auerbach date this miniature to c. 1585 which, on grounds of the hairstyle, is impossible.  The hair is long and curly at the sides and brushed away from the forehead, a fashion adopted by young men at the opening of the 1590\u2019s (Strong, <i>The English Icon,</i> 1969, p. 217 (175); 220 (179-80).  The still free calligraphic rendering of the hair dates it before c. 1593 when Hilliard\u2019s style changed.\n\nNo identity can be suggested but the miniatures, as a group, relate to Elizabeth Stafford, Lady Drury.\n\nCOLLECTIONS: See no. 87 [P.2-1974].\n\nLITERATURE: Countess of Radnor and W.
