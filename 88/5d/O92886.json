The wakizashi was the shorter of the two swords (know together as \u2018daisho\u2019) worn by the samurai at all times. The characteristics of this blade are typical of the simple and functional blades produced by the smiths of Seki in Mino province (modern-day Gifu Prefecture) during the 16th century. At Seki, the traditions established by the great smith Kaneuji were continued by a number of other smiths, who all signed their names beginning with the character \u2018Kane\u2019 after the founder of the school. This blade was most likely made by one such smith, Kanemichi, who was working during the Tensho era (1573-1592).\n\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, the town of Seki in Mino manufactured blades on a near mass-production scale to meet the growing demand for swords for the ever-increasing numbers of samurai who were by now fighting in massed ranks on foot. Consequently there were many swords produced of little aesthetic merit, being purely practical cutting weapons and lacking any great artistic distinction. At Osafune in Bizen province, blades were also mass-produced at around the same time and these too were pure fighting weapons of little or no artistic merit. These mass-produced blades were referred to as \u2018bundled swords\u2019 (\u2018sokuto\u2019) or \u2018mass-produced thing\u2019 (\u2018kazu uchi mono\u2019), a term that carried with it certain notes of contempt.",
