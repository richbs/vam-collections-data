Three pairs of short tabs are attached to the sides.\n\nIt is made of linen and silk taffeta and is embroidered with coloured silks in a long and short, satin and chain stitch with French knots. The ground is entirely covered with laid and couched silver thread. Some of the flower centres are also worked in silver thread. A branching, flowery stem spreads over the whole of the stomacher. The flowers increase in size towards the top of the stomacher where there is a large, stylised rose.\n\nThe stomacher is backed with linen and the edges and the point are outlined with cream, grosgrain ribbon, which forms a raised edge. The spade shaped end is outlined with a double line of couched silver cord and there is a narrow silver braid, originally decorated with spangles, along the top edge.",

The stomacher formed part of the ensemble of fashionable women\u2019s dress from the 1680s to the 1780s.  This example is richly embroidered with coloured silks and metal thread in satin stitch, chain stitch and French knots.  On either side of the stomacher, the ribbon tabs would have been attached with pins to the edges of the gown.  The narrow dimensions and tabbed lower point of this stomacher suggest it was made between 1700 and 1720.",
