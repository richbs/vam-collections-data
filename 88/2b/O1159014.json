They were often used as decoration within the home as opposed to toys for children. The mechanisms inside them to make the eyes work could be activated in different ways on different bears. Some had buttons on their sides, others required you to press their back or paw. because of their nature these mechanisms often stopped working quite quickly.\n\nThis bear could have been made by either Bruin Manufacturing or Fast Black Skirt Company, although the bear has no marks or labels on it so it is very difficult to identify.\n\nThis soft toy is from Daniel Agnew's collection. He is best known for running Christie's famous Teddy Bear auctions from 2000 to 2007, but his passion for Teddy Bears and all toys goes back much further than that. His mother is a well-respected antique dealer known throughout Britain. As a child he was fascinated with the bits and pieces that she bought home from her various buying trips. Daniel started to attend auctions and shows with her at the weekends and as a child of 9 or 10, what caught his eye most were the toys.",
