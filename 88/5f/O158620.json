This border has a quilted ground with a scale pattern. The quilting is worked with white silk.\nIn the centre is a lobed medallion formed by a blue band with red dots; there is a red and blue rosette in the centre.  A blue 8-pointed star encircles this and links 4 large red blossoms in profile at the diagonals and 4 round red blossoms at the cardinal points.  A pair of blue serrated leaves and a red trefoil emerges from the top of every blossom. On the outer edge of the lobed medallion there is a small red tree at every angle. A quarter of this design, minus tree, is in each corner.  The ground if filled with small sprigs with one star-like red flower and buds leaning to the left; these sprigs point towards the central horizontal axis.  The ground is quilted with the scale pattern.\nBacking: coarse white cotton through which the quilting has been worked. \nThere are five green silk twill loops on the back of the upper edge, for display purposes.",
