Subject and period appealed greatly to designer Oliver Messel, and when he was commissioned to produce designs for a production at the Bath Festival in 1955, he was inspired to create some of his most enchanting designs.  It gave scope to his love of fantasy, elegance, beauty of colour and lavish, fantastical yet real architectural settings.  \n\nThese sketches show the transformations that Messel used for his scene changes.  He uses gauzes, curtains which, when lit in a certain way, are opaque (in this case with variations on clouds) and when lit another, are transparent, showing the scene behind.  The clouds here would be projections. They also indicate how Messel wanted the lighting to evoke different feelings and emotions: the captions on the final two images read: 'Zermina wakes and finds herself in Azor's Palace everything dark adn empty gauze curtains blow in the wind.' 'as Zermina cries I love you, everything changes to brightness with cloud chariot and candelabras and lights for finale.'  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: A series of designs showing gauzes and transformations are comparatively rare in theatre.  There are also rare indications of the lighting effects that Messel envisaged.",
