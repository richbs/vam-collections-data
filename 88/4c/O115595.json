This technique is known as 'retroussage'. \n\nThe printmaker engraves or etches the lines of the design into a metal printing plate, creating grooves beneath the surface of the plate. Ink is applied with a dabber or roller and forced into the grooves where it is held while the surface of the plate is wiped clean. At this point the loosely folded piece of muslin can be drawn lightly over the plate bringing a little of the ink over the edges of the grooves. This slightly diffuses the harshness of the lines when the plate is printed.\n\nTo make the print, or impression, a sheet a paper is laid over the inked plate and together they are submitted to pressure (usually in a roller press) so that the paper draws the ink out if the grooves in the plate. The printed image is in reverse of that on the plate.",
