            "public_access_description": "A scene at the top of the panel refers to the tale of the Jewish queen Esther and her husband King Ahaseurus from the Old Testament Book of Esther. Many historians believe that Ahasuerus was King Xerxes, who ruled Persia from 486 to 465 BC. Haman, a court favourite, believed himself slighted by the Jew Mordecai. Haman persuaded the king to execute Mordecai and to institute a pogrom against the Jews in his kingdom. Esther successfully negotiated on Mordecai\u2019s behalf, thus saving both him and the Jewish people. This event is still celebrated today in the Jewish feast of Purim.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation in the 16th century had an adverse effect on the work of stained-glass artists, who mainly relied on ecclesiastical sponsors for their work. In mainland Europe artists turned to the burgeoning trade in decorated domestic glass windows. The Swiss workshops were especially prolific in their output. \n\nAdvances in technology, in window glass and in enamel paints, meant that highly decorated panels could be produced at a relatively low cost. Chemists had developed a wide range of enamel colours, so complicated arms could be painted without the need to introduce leaded pieces of coloured glass.",
