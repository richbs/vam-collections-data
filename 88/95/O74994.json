Embroidered or beaded purses in the seventeenth century often included acorns in their pattern, an exhortation perhaps to 'save and prosper'.  This early seventeenth century purse is made from a single nutshell, covered with embroidery and lined and hinged with silk.  Barely large enough to contain a few coins, the purse was probably a novelty gift, but its maker may also have had the thought in mind that large oaks grow from tiny acorns.",
