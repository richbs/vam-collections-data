His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s first post-war production was Sheridan\u2019s comedy of manners, The Rivals (1775). Performed at the Criterion Theatre in 1945, and directed by William Armstrong and Edith Evans, he designed costumes and sets in pastiche of eighteenth century period style.  The artificiality and lightness of his designs were well suited to the improbable plot and satiric spirit of the play.\n\nMessel inventively combines materials to create the set model, which he used to establish the scale of the set.  Some parts of the model, such as the bookcase, are painted illusionistically on flat paper cut-outs, whilst other parts, such as the staircase, are made from painted and folded card.   He uses small pieces of painted acetate to imitate the shimmering effect of a crystal chandelier.",
