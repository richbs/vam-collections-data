            "public_access_description": "Copy of a figure from a wall painting by leading architect and designer, Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The drawing shows a detail from a late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century wall painting depicting a putto holding a baluster-shaped candelabrum in each hand. The putto is winged and cloaked, and wears a diagonal strap across the chest. The lamps are joined by a garland. Pencil lines indicate significant changes to the position of the figure's legs and to the shape and size of the wings. This seems to be another example of Chambers improving his subject rather than simply recording it. \n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
