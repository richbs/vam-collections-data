            "public_access_description": "This delightful S\u00e8vres tea service or d\u00e9jeuner was made in 1760.  It is decorated with the fashionable pink  ground colour rose, and the white reserves have fanciful military trophies hung with triumphal garlands of flowers.  Although the mark of the painter Charles Buteux the elder appears on the underside of only one cup and saucer, it is probable he was responsible for the decoration of the whole set as he specialised in painting trophies.  This set is an early example of his trophy painting as during the first years after his arrival in 1757 he experimented with painting animals and cherubs before finding a subject that suited him.  The shape of the tray was also new as it was only introduced in the year when it was made.  It is thought the shape matches entries in the S\u00e8vres records for plateau Duplessisafter the chief designer at the factory, Jean-Claude Duplessis.   The undulating profile of the tray, and the light-hearted decoration of all the pieces with their rich colours and densely scrolling gilded borders, make this tea service a typical example of the French rococo style.  It may seem strange that there is no teapot here to match the other pieces however this was not unusual at the time as silver teapots on burners were often used to boil water for tea.\n\nIn the nineteenth century when John Jones bought this set he may have thought it had previously been owned by the mistress of Louis XV, Mme de Pompadour, or by the mistress of Louis XVI, Mme du Barry as this pink ground colour was routinely described as Rose Dubarry or Rose Pompadour by English dealers.  The service is too early in date to have any connection to Mme du Barry and there is no evidence to suggest that either lady favoured this colour over the other rich ground colours used at S\u00e8vres.  On the death of Mme de Pompadour in 1764, porcelain of all colours was recorded in the inventory of her properties.  The service is one of the many wonderful things in the art collection bequeathed to the nation by John Jones on his death in 1882.",

            "bibliography": "Clare Le Corbeiller and Linda H. Roth. <u> French Eighteenth-Century Porcelain at the Wadsworth Atheneum, : the J. Pierpont Morgan Collection</u>, Trustees of the Wadsworth Atheneum, 2000, see catalogue 98 for a <i>d\u00e9jeuner</i> with a tray of the same shape, dated 1768. On p. 198 a convincing explanation is given as to whythe name <i>plateau Duvaux</i> is incorrect for this model and why <i>plateau Duplessis</i> is more appropriate. The drawing for this shape is illustrated on the same page. 'It was first recorded in 1760, when two were listed among <i>pi\u00e8ces extraordinaires</i> in the factory's inventory. A second size appeared in 1761, when molds and models were listed at <i>8 livres</i> each.' Two sizes of this tray were produced and this example tallies with the 1st size and is cited in footnote 9, p. 199. The only earlier example cited, of 1759/60, is in the Metropolitain Museum of Art, New York, no. 37.20.9 (green with flowers, 34.7cms wide).\nRosalind Savill. <u>The Wallace Collection Catalogue of S\u00e8vres Porcelain</u>, Trustees of The Wallace Collection, London, 1998. See Vol III, pp. 1007-1009 for information about Charles Buteux a\u00een\u00e9 (1719-82). He came to the factory from Chantilly in 1756 and 'soon became the factory's most prolific painter of trophies and attributes.' In footnote 4, p. 1009, Savill cites a green<i> porte-huilier</i> C.453-1921, marked for Buteux 1757, painted with animals as an early example of his work at S\u00e8vres prior to his specialising in trophies. For information about the ground colour <i>rose</i>, see Vol III, p. 1175. It first appears in 1756 (although first recorded in 1758) and is often used with carmine enamel edging the gilding (as here) to prevent the gilding discolouring the ground yellow. It occurs most frequently in the 1760s, although was still recorded in 1789. In the 19th century the terms<i> R</i><i>ose Pompadour</i>and <i>R</i><i>ose du Barry</i> were often used to describe this colour, particularly by dealers who probably used it to give an added allure to pink ground items by association with the famous mistresses of French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. Savill cites Eriksen as saying the term rose Pompadour was an English term for rose appearing as early as the mide-1760s, and often used in the nineteenth-century. In her purchases Mme de Pompadour did not particularly favour pink, but bought richly decorated porcelain of every ground colour, including pink.\nGeoffrey de Bellaigue,<u> French Porcelain in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen, Royal Collection, 2009</u>, Vol 1, the subject of trophies recurs as trophies of different kinds are depicted on the reverse panels of many S\u00e8vres vases. Trophies were a popular motif in the decorative arts in 18th century France. Books of trophies were published in the form of engravings after various artists, eg 1\u00e8re and 2i\u00e8me Livres de Troph\u00e9s dessin\u00e9s par Peyrotte Peintre du Roy , engravings by Gilles Demarteau after Alexis Peyrotte, and Attributs Militaires engraved by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Tardieu after Jean-Charles Delafosse, published in 1777. Some of the latter are known to have been published separately prior to 1768. The artist Charles Buteux specialised in painting trophies 'attributs ' S\u00e8vres, de Bellaigue records him having painted 141 in overtime during 1766 at a rate of 1 livres 10 sols for each one. (Vol II, p. 151)\nHandbook of the Jones Collection in the South Kensington Museum, 1883, see p. 49 on S\u00e8vres: ' Other favorite colours were 'bleu-turquoise, violet, yellow green (this last of different shades 'vert pomme', 'vert jaune', 'vert pr\u00e9' or 'vert Anglais') and red, and especially the rose pink, commonly and improperly called Rose Dubarry. This well-known rose pink should rightly be called Pompadour, as it was invented twelve years before Dubarry appeared at court. It was the favorite colour of Madame de Pompadour, and almost all the best pieces were made before her death in 1764.'\nR.J. Charleston and J.
