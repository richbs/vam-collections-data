This was described as 18th century Anatolian, when it was acquired in 1873, but is just as likely to have come from the Balkans, which were under Turkish rule until the end of the 19th century.  The circular wire, with a short decorative strip attached to its front, is one of the most characteristic elements of Balkan earrings.  The bi-conical pendant is less typical, and is unlikely to be much earlier than the date of acquisition.  There is no evidence that any part of this earring is as old as the 18th century.",
