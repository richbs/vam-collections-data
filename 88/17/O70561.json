He is being assisted by a bearded man wearing a flattish hat and short, belted gown, who stands in front of the tomb, bent over the body. Three other figures stand behind the tomb, a man wearing a bag-crowned hat and a cloak fastened at his right shoulder, a woman wearing a barbe and veil, and a curly-bearded man wearing a belted gown and a chaperon. A three-branched tree with curious pad-like foliage is represented on the left in front of the tomb. Remarkably, the body in the shroud still apparently bears the head on the shoulders.\n\nThe top left corner of the panel is missing. The beard of the figure in the middle of the group is damaged. Green paint and usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. The upper background is gilt with traces of gesso knobs. There is green on the tree. Traces of black, brown and gilt remain on the beards of the figures. The front of the tomb is decorated with a pattern of short lines in brown. There are three lead-plugged holes in the back of the panel, all with latten wires attached.",

This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.\n\nWrapped in a sheet, the body of St John is carefully lowered into a tomb by sorrowful bearded men. Next to the tomb grows a strange three-branched plant with mushroom-like leaves. Curiously, although John was decapitated by King Herod\u2019s men, the body in the shroud still has its head.",
