Etched lines are formed by the action of acid on the metal printing plate, but engraved ones are gouged into the plate with a sharp-pointed tool called a burin.\n\nTrading\nThis print is after a painting by the American-born artist Benjamin West (1738-1820) for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery. This 'Shakespeare Gallery', first proposed by John Boydell (1719-1804) in 1786, was his most ambitious project: a series of commissioned oil paintings representing scenes from Shakespeare's plays; a collection of engravings after the paintings; and a new edition of Shakespeare's plays. The last-named was published in 1802 with accompanying engravings. The 'Shakespeare Gallery' opened at 52 Pall Mall, London, on 4 May 1789, with 34 paintings by prominent British artists, including West, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) and Henry Fuseli (1741-1825). It was planned that the sale of the prints would finance the project. But subscribers to the prints became displeased with the long production delays, and not all the prints were of high quality. This print was well received, however, and was one of the most successful in the series.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis print shows a scene from Act III, scene iv of Shakespeare's play King Lear. It  depicts the deranged Lear and his companions in a storm on a heath. Lear is attempting to tear off his clothes, while his companions try to persuade him to take shelter in the hovel seen on the right.",
