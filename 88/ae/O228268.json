Like all Italian jewellery, they often had symbolic, as well as decorative, meaning.\n\nThis ring is engraved with Christian symbols, which were widely used in Catholic Italy, by the Society of Jesus among others.  The monogram IHS represents the first letters of the name Jesus in Greek.  The three arrows below it represent the nails with which He was nailed to the cross, and the cross itself rises above the letter H in the centre.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
