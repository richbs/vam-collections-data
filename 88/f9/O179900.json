It had the great advantage of being a drawing toy which did not need loose parts or batteries. He took it to the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg in 1959. At first it aroused little interest but eventually The Ohio Art Company decided to take a chance and started to manufacture it. Originally made by hand, mass manufacture began in July 1960. The knobs were originally brass and later became plastic.",
