His works are not dated but due to the depicted persons the time is identifiable. He was apparently active in Brescia, Padua, Treviso, Venice and Verona. \n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440ies with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings",
