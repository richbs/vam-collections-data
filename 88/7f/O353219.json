The entire surface has twists of coloured silks (mainly red with black and yellow lines and other colours of green, yellow and blue). Each 'twist' is approx. 3mm wide and is composed of around four, x-ply threads, z-spun. These are twisted together in the s direction. These twists are sewn over the original fabric to create rope like decoration in geometric shapes - circles, zigzags, waves, lines and triangles. The skull cap section is composed of eight triangles with thick lines between each leading to a circle at the centre. The head band starts at the top with a row of double lines creating triangles; the next row is of red wavy lines; the next row is connected to the one above and below with red/yellow lines creating connected stars that run around the band with concentric circles at each centre; the row below is of red wavy lines; the last row is of double lines creating triangles. The edge is finished with a line of black/yellow woven to create chevrons and a hem of red with groups black/yellow lines evenly spaced around the hem. One side of the hat has been damaged and red silk has been used to roughly sew it together. Inside, at the point where the skull cap is attached to the band, there is a band of plain woven, undyed linen that reinforces the join. It has been sewn on with thick, double threads of undyed silk with a loose s-spun twist.",
