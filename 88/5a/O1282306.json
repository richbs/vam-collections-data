Medallist and die-cutter Leonard Charles Wyon was paid \u00a36,409 for supplying the official medals; he designed the reverse of the medal himself, and had them struck in bronze at the minting facilities of Messrs Pinches. The Scottish artist Daniel Maclise designed the allegorical scene on the obverse, a complex composition for such a small medium; he was most renowned for his large scale murals in the Palace of Westminster.",
