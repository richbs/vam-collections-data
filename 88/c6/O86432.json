He was performing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 19 December 1904. The company had appeared there the previous March, and now they were billed as \u2018The Welcome Return of Manning\u2019s Entertainers in the Convulsing Carnival of Uproarious Mishaps\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. This depicts a moment from \u2018The Turkish Bath\u2019 sketch. Comic sketches were a regular feature on variety bills at this date, and often featured companies of performers.",
