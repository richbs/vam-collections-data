This collection coincided with the reappearance of the term the 'It Girl' in the mid '90s.  Antoni & Alison (A&A) see themselves as having played an important role in the bold, positive feeling that the 'It Girl' represents.  During this period A&A moved away from the labour intensive screen printing to the use of transfer printing.
