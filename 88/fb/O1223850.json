It is still in its original unopened packaging, a plastic bag with cardboard label and would have hung on a peg in a shop, rather than more expensively produced dolls more commonly housed in their own boxes. \nAfter the Second World War there were great manufacturing opportunities brought in by moulding techniques and newly developed types of plastics, producing a boom period in the toy industry and many companies began to produce toys in East Asia, and in this case in Hong Kong.",
