They were created to show to prospective clients in couture, retail or wholesale dressmaking. They are from the archive of Zika Ascher, an innovative textile manufacturer who based himself in London after the annexation of his home country of Czechoslovakia in 1939. His wife designed textiles and their company became incorporated in 1942 as Ascher Ltd. Ascher developed a range of different fabrics for use at the top end of the fashion market. He himself was not a manufacturer, but rather collaborated with manufacturers to produce exciting novelties.\n\nAfter the Second World War in Europe, couturiers used novel lightweight mixes of fibres such as wool, mohair and nylon for winter coats and dresses. In contrast, they favoured screen-printed rayons and silks for summer day wear and shot organza for evening dresses.",
