It is known as 'Sultanabad ware' after the place it was first found. However, these wares were probably made at Kashan - the main centre of pottery production in Iran before the Mongol invasions of the early 13th century, which continued to operate during the Ilkhanid period (1256-1353).\n\nThe Mongol invasions created a close link between the Middle East and China as both regions came to be ruled by the Mongol viceroys. In China this was known as the Yuan dynasty. These dynasties maintained close cultural links with each other through trade, by sea and land, along the silk route. This created a flow of many new artistic motifs from China into the Middle East such as the dragon, the phoenix and the lotus blossom.\n\nFigural decoration appears less frequently on underglaze-painted pottery in the late 13th century. Geometric designs are used instead. One of the most popular was the \nthe so-called \"panel-style\", because of the division of the surface into separate panels, which is shown by the present bowl.",
