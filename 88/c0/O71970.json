            "public_access_description": "This print is one a series commissioned by a publishing venture, Contemporary Lithographs, who set up business in 1936 to compete with the market in fine art reproductions of oil paintings. Their intention was to make original work by contemporary artists accessible to the general public. Prints in the series mostly depict simple, familiar scenes aimed to appeal to such an audience. Ardizzone, already well known as an illustrator, was an obvious choice for Contemporary Lithographs. He was extremely popular, thanks to his keen eye for human behaviour and attitudes and his delight in the commonplace.",
