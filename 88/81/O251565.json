It was broken and repaired in England using powdered glass or enamels, which were applied to the break, after which the bowl was refired to fuse the parts together. Small quantities of other materials were added to the glass and enamels to lower the melting point, and the wares were supported by a clay mould during firing. The technique was practised in England from the 1760s and in Japan from about 1790. It fell out of use around 1920. The repairer has here concealed the damage by over-painting it with a leafy branch, which continues the enamelled design.",
