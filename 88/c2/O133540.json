Stephen played as a child in his parents company but had little formal education.  After a brief apprenticeship with a chemist at the age of 14, he served his theatrical apprenticeship with Mark Moore's troupe and joined Tate Wilkinson's company in 1781  He made his London debut in September 1783 at Covent Garden Theatre as Othello, but never managed to match the fame of his brother John Philip Kemble or his sister Sarah Siddons.  His considerable girth later made him able to play the part of Falstaff without padding, and with reference to his brother it was once remarked that Covent Garden had the big, and Drury Lane the great Kemble.\n\nStephen Kemble married Elizabeth Satchell in 1783 and most of his career was spent as an actor manager in various parts of the country including Coventry, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow.  He returned to London in 1818 where he managed Drury Lane and attempted to launch his son, unsuccessful, in a theatrical career.  He retired from the stage in 1820 and died two years later, his wife surviving him by 19 years.",
