            "public_access_description": "This locket was designed by Alexis Falize (1811-98), a Parisian jeweller who was inspired by Japanese and Chinese motifs and colours. Oriental styles were fashionable in Europe during the 1860s and 70s, partly a result of Japan\u2019s decision in 1854 to open trading links with Western countries. This brought Japanese decorative arts to the attention of the West after centuries of isolation. Falize was particularly inspired by albums of Japanese printed woodblocks, drawing on their linear forms. He combined this with the rich colours of Chinese enamels. \n\nLike many of Falize\u2019s Oriental pieces, the locket is made using cloisonn\u00e9 enamel, a technique found in traditional Japanese and Chinese metalwork. It involves a design being made up of small compartments (or cloisons) outlined by wire, which are then filled with different coloured enamels. \n\nFalize\u2019s best-known cloisonn\u00e9 jewels were made in collaboration with Antoine Tard, a highly skilled freelance enameller. Tard created Oriental-style cloisonn\u00e9 enamels for both Falize and another important Parisian jewellery firm, Christofle. He won several awards for his work, including a gold collaborator\u2019s medal at the 1867 Exposition Universelle held in Paris.",
