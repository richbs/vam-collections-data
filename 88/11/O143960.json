The armorial shield in the centre would indicate that it was made for a noble family. The arms, a rampant wolf, have not been identified.\n\nThe wide border is decorated with a stylised leaf pattern which follows the shape of the plate. The leaves were incised through a white slip using a tool that enabled the decorator to create straight edges on curved patterns. The central part of the leaf pattern was incised using a fine or blunt point. The modern potter's tool on display nearby (no.17) creates such effects. The technique of carving away a lot os slip to reveal a pattern is known as 'fondo ribasatto'. The pattern appears in sharp relief against the carved out background.\n\nThe three marks in the centre of the dish are known as 'spur marks'. Ceramic objects were stacked in the kiln at firing so that many objects could be more economicaly fired together at the same time. The objects were separated from each other by a 3-pointed triangular-shaped spur. The marks on this dish are where the kiln spur was placed.",
