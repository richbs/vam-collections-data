The pile on the reverse is z-spun, unplied.  From the right the colours are blue, red and a mixture of yellow and orange.  Max. surviving length of pile is 5 cms.\n\nSide finish:  cut\n\nEnd finish:  cut\n\nDesign:  Field: appears to be a lattice of large diagonal serrated decorated leaves, each compartment having its own ground colour.  There is evidence to suggest that each compartment would have contained 4 large complex blossoms and their stems form a central diamond.  Small blossoms lie on a subsidiary pink and dark blue lattice.  From the bottom the compartments are dark blue, then half a dark yellow and half a red, above them green and then half a dark blue and half a pink.\n\nMain border:  dark red ground with a strapwork design:  2 meanders, one dark blue on top of a yellow one.  These form an arch and then a palmette in sequence and then reciprocally.\n\nInner border:  purple and orange reciprocal trefoils outlined in green.\n\nOuter border:   blue ground with angular meander with right angled blossoms and rosettes in various colours on a pink stem.",
