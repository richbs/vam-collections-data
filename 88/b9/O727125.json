London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"ANONYMOUS\nView of the Marine Pavilion, Brighton, from the Old Steyne, 1788.\nLettered <i>Pubd by E. Lay on the Steine Brighton.  Augt. 1.1788</i>\nEtching coloured by hand\n40.4 X 56.6cm \nE.211-1942\nBequeathed by Mrs Violet E. F. Becker\n\nThis print is one of a set of four, depicting views around the Old Steyne (an area of open ground in Brighton) published the year after the completion of Henry Holland's domed pavilion.  This building was remodelled by John Nash into the celebrated Royal Pavilion in 1815-1821.\nThese prints come at the opening of a new phase in the history of Brighton as a fashionable resort likely to generate pictorial representations of itself.  The unknown artist may have been a local amateur, both the draughtsmanship and the colouring are rather inexpert.\nOnly two of the four prints have publication lines.  Those without might deceive the unwary into thinking they were watercolours done over a drawn pen outline, the technique used in many British watercolours at the time the print was made.\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1942</u>, London: HMSO, 1955.\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1942</u>, London: HMSO, 1955.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n'<b>ANONYMOUS: Architecture and Topography </b>\n\nViews (4) of the buildings surrounding the Old Steyne, Brighton in 1788.\nE.211 <i>lettered</i> Pubd. by E.
