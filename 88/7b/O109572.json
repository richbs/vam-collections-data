He was a celebrated Muslim mystic who died in Bukhara in Uzbekistan in 1261. \n\nThe main panel has a pattern of intersecting 12-sided figures. Long straight rays link groups of small hexagons which are arranged around a six-pointed star. This type of decoration is typical of the patterns based entirely on the arrangement of geometric figures that came to play a significant role in Islamic art. They were used in both religious and secular contexts.\n \nBy the 14th century, when this panel was made, such patterns often combined more than one scheme. However, decorators made no attempt to create an illusion of depth. The picture plane remained deliberately flat, producing patterns that were impressively complex.",
