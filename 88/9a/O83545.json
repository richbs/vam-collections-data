This \u00e9lite charity event has effectively taken over the role of court presentations: etiquette demands that women wear white dresses and pearls are considered appropriate jewellery. Vivienne Westwood\u2019s design provided the grand statement that the occasion demands. Inspired by 18th-century rococo motifs, she gave the dress a modern note by shredding the tulle skirt.",
