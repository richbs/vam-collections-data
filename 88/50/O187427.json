Lithograph, coloured by hand. 12 x 8in. (32.7 x 21.9cm.). E.1334-1962\n\nHere are shown the Abb\u00e9 D\u00e9guerry, who was the Empress Eug\u00e9nie's confessor and the Archbishop of Paris, Mgr Darboy. They are enclosed in a corset emblematic of their rigid beliefs. They were both arrested on 4 April on the grounds that they were hostile to the Commune. Rigault's real intention, however, was to exchange them for his hero, Blanqui. Rigault believed that Blanqui, who had been imprisoned at Versailles on 17 March, was the one person with the power to resolve all the Commune's problems. Thiers was of the same opinion and refused to make the bargain, admitting in private that to hand over Blanqui would be equal to giving the communards an army corps! The Archbishop and Abb\u00e9 D\u00e9guerry languished in the Mazas prison along with several hundred other priests until 24 May, when they were transferred to La Roquette. That evening they were shot by a group of inexperienced volunteers, who missed the Archbishop in the first volley. When Thiers' troops discovered the Archbishop's body in the Pere-Lachaise cemetery, they marched 147 captured Communard prisoners to the spot and shot them.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
