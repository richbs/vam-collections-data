Recording began in November 1968, with the London Bach Choir performing the choral part in 1969; this is the sheet music for the alto part. Although popular on the radio, this song was never released as a single, but rather a version without choral part was the b-side to the Honky Tonk Women single. The choral part was re-instated for their 1969 album Let It Bleed. The printed score also features pencil annotation showing how the lyrics and some of the music was adapted and changed during the recording process. \n\nThis sheet music was also signed by four members of the band at the time: Mick Jagger, Keith Richard, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones. Brian Jones, however, did not perform on the recording of this song. Although he founded the band in 1962, he was asked to leave by the other members in June 1969 because of his erratic behaviour, and later drowned in his swimming pool, in early July 1969, having  never seen this song released.",
