This panel is one of two showing the same subject (the other is in the Stained Glass Museum in Ely).\n\nCollins copied this composition from an engraving of one of Raphael\u2019s cartoons, which were painted about 1520. The cartoon has been in the Royal Collection since 1623 and is now on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nSome of Collins\u2019s other painted glass commissions were for St Sidwell\u2019s Church in Exeter. He also made a large window for St Peter\u2019s Church in Calcutta, India.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century there was a fashion for both private and ecclesiastical bodies to commission painted glass copies of famous paintings on canvas. Advances in glass manufacture now enabled larger sheets of thin, clear glass to be produced. It was possible to paint on them, without using lead to compose the structure. Glass painters like William Collins used enamel paints to create their \u2018pictures on glass\u2019. In the 18th century, however, these paints were quite opaque, so that light did not transmit easily through the painted surface of the glass. The fashion for this type of painting started to die out in the early decades of the 1800s.",
