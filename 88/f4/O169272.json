Decorated on the body with six crocketed, trefoil ogee arches springing from 'plumed' lion heads, framing five inverted heads surmounted by plumes (giving the appearance of grotesque masks), with lion heads in the spandrels. The handle fits neatly into the central beaded arch, with a plumed, inverted head below. The central crocket of the arches overlaps the lower moulding of the projecting lip. Recessed foot, with projecting moulded base. The inset under the base was possibly caused by excessive shrinkage during cooling where the pouring sprue was attached. This would have necessitated repair and thickening to allow for use.",
