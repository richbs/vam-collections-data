He was performing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 24 October 1904. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nThe Belle of the Orient was a 35-minute condensed musical, or \u2018comedy extravaganza in three acts\u2019, written by Peterman with Clifford Harris and George Arthur, and with music by Paul Knox and J. W. Tate. It had previously run for two months at the Oxford Music Hall in London. Ike Novinski\u2019s \u2018pawnbroker\u2019s cakewalk\u2019 dance was featured in Act III.\n\nJoe Peterman had his own company, which specialised in presenting musical sketches or revues on the variety stage. In September 1912 a review in The Era shows that his company was topping the bill at the Hippodrome, Poplar, with a farcical musical comedy called The Stationmaster. This was a comic piece that included singing and dancing. Another of his shows was Flyaway\u2019s Derby, featuring female bookmakers in \u2018startling costume\u2019. Also on the bill that week at the Grand were Gilbert Girard and Cliff Ryland, who were also drawn by Cooke.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the Jewish music hall performer Joe Peterman as the Jewish moneylender Ike Novinski in 'The Belle of the Orient', a 35-minute 'condensed musical play' which had just finished a 2-month run at London's Oxford music hall.  By 1912 Joe Peterman had his own company performing sketches in music hall and variety, and in September 1912 a review in 'The Era' shows that his company was topping the bill at the Hippodrome, Poplar, with a farcical musical comedy 'The Stationmaster', a comic piece including singing and dancing. The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
