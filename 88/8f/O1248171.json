            "public_access_description": "This book was presented as a prize to Henry Thomas Chandler in 1894. Henry lived in Southall, on the western fringes of London, and attended the local Board School, until he was old enough to leave school at the age of eleven. In later life, Henry became a soldier and continued his education, gaining qualifications in smithing and veterinary science.\n\nBooks were awarded, along with medals and certificates, to students who achieved 100 per cent attendance over the school year. This was a popular motivational tool in the first decades after 1871, when school was first made compulsory. The choice of edifying reading matter \"for boys\" is interesting. 'The Dog Crusoe and His Master' recounts the story of two boys who travel through the Western prairies, attempting to make peace between the cowboys and native Americans. \n\nThis prize was valued highly enough to stay in the Chandler family for over a century; Henry's daughter Joyce has also inscribed her name in the front pages. It then passed to the donor, who was Joyce's cousin's daughter.",

            "history_note": "Henry Thomas Chandler was born in September 1884, the son of William and Jemima Chandler. Census returns list William as a carter, which would have involved transporting agricultural goods in a horse-drawn wagon. The couple had a total of eight children, five of whom lived to adulthood. The family lived in Southall, on the western outskirts of London, and Henry and his siblings attended the local elementary school. Henry was 10 when he received this prize book. At the time, the family were living at Newalls Cottages, Southall.\n\nThe Southall Board School was established in 1878, in two buildings previously occupied by the Church of England (National School). By 1897 it had an average attendance of 217 children.\n\nAs an adult, Henry (called Harry on the bookplate) was a professional soldier. He signed up in 1904, giving his previous trade as a cabinet maker. In 1905 he was posted to India and served in Nowgong, Poona and Jubbelpore before returning to Britain in 1914. He gained qualifications in smithing carriages and horse shoes, as well as a veterinary certificate. In 1912 he was promoted to Corporal. In the First World War he served as a Sergeant in the Royal Garrison Artillery. He married Caroline in 1916 and the couple had two daughters. Henry died of Tuberculosis in 1929. \n\nHenry kept his book along with his sister's (May Emily, see B...), and after his death it passed to his daughter, Joyce. After Joyce it passed to the donor, who was her cousin's daugher, as she was known to have an interest in family history.",
