This legendary Christan martyr was converted to Christianity whilst out hunting. According to the legend Eustace was carry his two children one by one across the Nile. On his way back for the second child a wolf and a lion appeared on either side of the bank and snatched the two children away. Later the family was reunited, but they suffered martyrdom by being roasted alice in a hollow brazen bull.\n\nThe origins of this pyx has puzzled scholars. The work is executed in the champlev\u00e9 technique of the famous Limoges enamellers, who were influential in the Middle Ages. However the style of the figures and the architecture have closer similarities with Parisian translucent enamels of the 14th century. Some scholars have suggested that this object could be an example of Limoges-style enamel made in Paris.\n\nComparisons in style have been made between this pyx and the goldsmith work of the reliquary of Jeanne D'Evreux, 1339, believed to be made in Paris.\n\nSeveral pyxes of this style, shape and colouring survive. Along with another example in the V&A, a very similar pyx is held in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris (museum no. OA 6936)",

The Eucharist is the bread transformed into the Body of Christ during the Christian Mass. Wafers of bread were handed out to the congregation and left over pieces were stored in pyxes- decorative boxes suitably precious to hold such important items. Pyxes could also be used by priests to transport the blessed bread to the sick. A large proportion of surviving medieval pyxes are decorated in enamel. This may have been partly due to the relatively inexpensive nature of the raw materials compared to gold and silver, however the popularity of enamel was also due to its ability to colour metal which enabled a wide variety of iconographic designs.",
