Like many other of Hoffmann's designs at this time, the decorative elements of the chair have a functional dimension. For instance, the corner balls or blocks reinforcing the seat and the shaped bentwood backrail. The punched and geometrically arranged decoration are also typical and can be found on many other Hoffmann pieces. \n\nThe chair's design was praised by contemporary art critics but does not appear to have been produced for long; perhaps the rather severe lines were suited better for  use in a public building than in the home.",
