Patrick Rylands had trained as a ceramicist at the Royal College of Art, and his love of sculptural forms combined with his interest in plastics technology led him to design smooth rounded plastic toys which were very easy for small children to handle. The fish is one of a group of toys by this designer which won the Duke of Edinburgh's Design Award in 1970.",
