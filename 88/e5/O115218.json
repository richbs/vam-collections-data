Within the palace is a Naga-raja (snake king) and rani. The raja has over his head a five-hooded cobra while the rani has a single cobra hood and is seated close to the king, almost in his lap. The royal couple are surrounded by attendants; a servant in a blue dress tends the rani\u2019s feet and there is a woman with a chauri (flywisk) behind the raja. \n\nTo the right of the raja and rani are a group of figures, arranged around the decorated pillars; women with necklaces and jewels in their hair along with a more distinguished looking character in an elaborate costume of blue and white stripes. \n\nIn a building behind the raja it is just possible to see a ladder or staircase  with a person ascending it. \n\nThis part of the painting depicts a section of the Sudhana Jataka. The narrative sequence in this painting continues on IS. 18-1885 and IS.12-1885.",

The Ajanta cave paintings are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas). This painting depicts a scene from the Sudhana Jataka.\n\nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves. This is one of the approximately 300 paintings they produced.",

            "history_note": "Historical significance: The paintings inside the Ajanta caves tell stories from the lives of the Buddha. This painting depicts scenes from the Sudhana jataka. \n\nNarrative:\nThe king of the Nagas or snake king sits with his queen surrounded by attendants. He has presented a precious robe to  a hunter in gratitude for the rescue of his son. The hunter, dressed in this gift, seen here on the right hand side with an elaborate blue and white striped costume, asks the king for an additional gift of  a magical noose which will help him capture a fairy princess. \n\nThe hunters captures the princess, and gives her to a prince called Sudhana. They live happily together until a problem at court makes her flee the palace. After a long adventurous journey, he comes to find her. \n\nWhen she is bathing on her balcony, having water poured over her by other maidens she catches sight of a signet ring in one of the maid\u2019s water jugs. She recognises this as belonging to Prince Sudhana and realises that he must have thrown it in there and that he has come to find her. (IS.18-1885)\n\nInside the palace, the princess hides Sudhana away from the king. Sitting with her attendants she gestures with her hand and reveals to a friend her love for Sudhana who is shown here standing in the doorway  holding a walking-staff and with the same hand gesture. (IS.12-1885)\n\nInside the royal palace the princess tells her father, the king of her love for Sudhana and obtains his consent for their marriage.",

            "historical_context_note": "The cave paintings of Ajanta are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They depict scenes from the lives of the Buddha and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is one.",
