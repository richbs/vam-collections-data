These are chevron lines in pink and orange with a green line and with a dark brown [decayed] line next to a dark green and blue wide band. There are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: green ground with a downward pointing white floral spray on an angled green stem alternating with a pink blossom on an angled green stem pointing to the lower right hand corner.\n[2] wider stripes with two designs: [a] Edged with a dark brown line.  Diamond sections; pink vase outlined with light green and large pink flower with yellow centre, alternating with similar pink flower outlined with blue.  Lots of dark green and blue make this band contrast with the others. [b] Wider band.  Diamond sections: yellow vase outlined with blue with a pair of white leaves at the base and a floral spray with multi-headed white blossom at the top. The same vase with pink triangular blossom at the top.\nThere is a wide border down the lower part of each side and  along the bottom: downward or outward pointing spray of three flowers, pink outlined with green alternating with light blue outlined in yellow.  Pairs of facing blue flowers are between each spray.  There is an additional border above and below the bottom border: 3-petalled white flower alternating with an indistinct pink and mauve flower.\nThreads: 2S silk: white, dark brown, dark green, blue, red, light green, yellow, mauve, light blue, orange, green.",
