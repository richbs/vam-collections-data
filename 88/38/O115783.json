The silk goes through the closed shed and is plied.\n\nPile:  silk:  13 colours (some fading and it is not clear exactly how many colours): red, dark yellow, yellow, dark green, green, light green, dark blue, blue, light blue, (possibly) pink, light brown, black, white; asymmetrical knot, open to the left and tied around 2 threads; 192 knots per sq. inch (3000 per sq. dm),\n\nSide finish:  one cord overcast with red (faded) silk\n\nEnd finish:  Lower: twisted warp loops form a fringe 15 cms. long; Upper: as lower, 8 cms.\n\nDesign:  Field: faded red ground with blossoms on two sets of spiralling stems - thick light blue spirals and thin dark green stems both with blossoms and leaves; symmetrically spaced along a central vertical and horizontal exis.\n\nMain border: green ground with large palmette blossoms encircled by stem-like arabesques and blue split leaves.\n\nInner border: simple reciprocal-like yellow hear-shaped motifs and blue crosses.\n\nOuter border: floral meander with half flowers in blue, pink and green.",
