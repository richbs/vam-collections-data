He was a collaborator of Canaletto when he was in his 40s and became later popular running a large studio of his own. He trained both his younger brother Nicol\u00f2 and his son Giacomo, whose work is well known and who imitated his father's style.  \n\nThis painting is a copy with variations of a composition respectively executed by both Canaletto and F. Guardi, which  differ between them. The present work looks closer to Guardi's version. It shows a fair in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, scattered with small figures, and the whole view is seen through an archway with the basilica and the campanile in the background under a wide blue sky.",

Before 1800,</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 141-2, cat. no. 163.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nFrancesco GUARDI (1712-93) \nItalian (Venetian) School \nThe son of an Austrian painter, Domenico Guardi (1678-1716), he was born in Venice, where he lived his whole life. He appears to have shared the studio of his elder brother Gian Antonio (1698-1760) in the period before 1760. Gian Antonio was a painter of figure subjects whereas Francesco practised mainly view painting, but the exact division between the two brothers is controversial. Francesco was influenced by Magnasco, Marco Ricci and Carlevarijs, as well as by Canaletto, whose pupil he may have been and whose compositions he copied in his early years (see below nos. 163-65). He was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1784 and died in 1793. His sister married G. B. Tiepolo. \nLit. G. Simonson, <i>Francesco Guard</i>i, 1904; G. Fiocco, <i>Francesco Guardi</i>, 1923; <i>Mostra dei Guardi</i> (<i>Catalogo</i> a cura di P.

G. Constable, <i>Canaletto</i>, 1962, nos. 527-28, also Canaletto, exhibition Toronto, 1964, no. 125) and an oil painting (Lord Wharton collection; Constable, <i>Canaletto</i>, no. 19) firmly attributed to Canaletto, which indicates that his was the original composition. One of the drawings was made in 1760 and it is probable that Guardi, who is known to have copied Canaletto's compositions in his early years, painted his version at about the same time (Frankfurt, Stadelsches Institut). Another version attributed to Guardi was in the collection of Frederick Prince of Prussia (sold Ball & Graupe, Berlin, 27-8 November 1931, lot 14, pl. 6). \nCAI.101 is stylistically and in detail of composition closer to the Guardi than to the Canaletto version; the latter, for example, contains a hanging lamp in the foreground which does not appear in the Guardi composition. G. A. Simonson (1904 and 1914) accepted it as an autograph work by Guardi, though he felt that the two seated figures and the one in the foreground were added by another hand. G. Fiocco (1923) attributed it to Giacomo Guardi and placed it in the 19th century. Neither attribution is acceptable, though Giacomo is too shadowy a figure to allow of dogmatism on this point. CAI.101 appears to be a work of the early 19th century, based largely on the Guardi version, though with a different disposition of the figures and omitting the relief decoration at the top of the arch. The standing figure in the foreground, looking outward at the spectator, does not occur in any of the other versions and would seem to be a 19th century invention. \n\nProv.

Ionides, 1900. \nThe collection formed by Constantine Ionides includes works of a wide variety of schools, periods and artists. His collection includes Old Masters, 17th century works, contemporary British works and French 19th century works. Constantine formed friendships with artists of the day, especially Legros, who, having spent 17 years in Britain, became a naturalise British citizen. Constantine proved a stable and generous buyer of Legros work, while Legros, in turn, became an advisor in the matters of art to the attentive Constantine. Under the influence of Legros Constantine developed a keen interest in French 19th century paintings purchasing works by Delacroix, Degas, Millet and Rousseau.\n\nConstantine's plans concerning his collection conformed to a more 'public-welfare' vein of thought than his father or brother. He decided to donate his collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum, instead of privately distributing it or disposing of it in a Sales room.\n\nHis will states:\n\n'All my pictures both in oil and water colors and crayon or colored chalks (but subject as to my family portraits to the interest herein before given to my said Wife) and all my etchings drawings and engravings to the South Kensington Museum for the benefit of the nation to be kept there as one separate collection to be called \"The Constantine Alexander Ionides Collection\" and not distributed over the Museum or lent for exhibition. And I desire that the said Etchings Drawings and Engravings shall be framed and glazed by and at the expense of the authorities of the Museum so that Students there can easily see them.'\n\nThe collection bequeathed to the museum in 1901 comprises 1138 pictures, drawing and prints, to which a further 20 items were added on the death of his widow in 1920. The works are listed in the V&A catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection.\n\nHistorical significance: There are two drawings of this view (W. G. Constable, <i>Canaletto</i>, 1962, nos. 527-28, also Canaletto, exhibition Toronto, 1964, no. 125) and an oil painting (Lord Wharton collection; Constable, <i>Canaletto</i>, no. 19) firmly attributed to Canaletto, which indicates that his was the original composition. One of the drawings (whereabouts unknown, formerly Henry Oppenheimer collection) was made in 1760 and it is probable that Guardi, who is known to have copied Canaletto's compositions in his early years, painted his version at about the same time (Frankfurt, Stadelsches Institut). Another version attributed to Guardi was in the collection of Frederick Prince of Prussia (sold Ball & Graupe, Berlin, 27-8 November 1931, lot 14, pl. 6). \n\nCAI.101 is stylistically and in detail of composition closer to the Guardi than to the Canaletto version; the latter, for example, contains a hanging lamp in the foreground which does not appear in the Guardi composition. G. A. Simonson (1904 and 1914) accepted it as an autograph work by Guardi, though he felt that the two seated figures and the one in the foreground were added by another hand. G. Fiocco (1923) attributed it to Giacomo Guardi and placed it in the 19th century, an attribution supported by A.F. Spender, who interpreted the diametrically opposed shadows of the figures as characteristic of Giacomo's style. A. Morassi rejected both attributions, as did Kauffmann (1973 catalogue).  \n\nCAI.101 appears to be a work of the early 19th century, based largely on the Guardi version, though with a different disposition of the figures and omitting the relief decoration at the top of the arch. The standing figure in the foreground, looking outward at the spectator, does not occur in any of the other versions and would seem to be a 19th century invention. Although the broad, atmospheric sky recalls Guardi's typical emphasis on light, the thick brushstrokes are uncharacteristic of his work.\n\nGuardi produced a number of works which utlise this compositional principle (e.g. <i>Venetian Capriccio: View of a Square and a Palace</i>, the Hermitage, St Petersburg, and <i> Venetian Capriccio: View of the Ducal Palace</i>, formerly Koetser collection, New York).",

Guardi was much imitated during his lifetime and his compositions were much copied for more than a century after his death.\n\nThe Piazza San Marco was, and remains, the hub of Venetian social life. Temporary huts at the foot of the Campanile were used for performances of the Commedia dell'Arte. \n\nA 'veduta' is a painted, drawn or engraved composition representing a landscape or a town, largely topographical in conception. These were particularly popular during the era of the Grand Tour. Such painters were known as 'vedutisti' and sometimes employed a 'camera obscura', a box with a small hole used as an optical device, to capture effects of scenery. Canaletto also visited England and painted views of London, creating a taste for view paintings, which influenced the next generation of English painters, including JMW Turner (1775-1851).The 'veduta' eventually succumbed to the invention of photography.",
