Even in the 19th century, with competition from oil lamps, gas and electricity, candles and candlesticks remained essential items used throughout the home and moved from room to room as light was required.\n\nThis candlestick is made of Sheffield plate, a fusion of copper and silver, discovered in 1742 by a Sheffield cutler, Thomas Boulsover (1704-1788). It imitates the appearance of solid silver, but at less than half the cost. It is made from die-stamped sections soldered together. The candlestick form was well suited to the technical innovation of die stamping. In this technique, where relief decoration was formed in thin sheets of metal, such as Sheffield plate or silver, the ornament could be assembled in a variety of combinations to provide a vast supply of models, differing from each other in only one or two details. The candlestick is decorated in an ornate, revived Rococo style.",
