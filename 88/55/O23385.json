Here the artist made a specific reference to Mi Wanzhong, a leading rock painter and connoisseur living in the late 16th and early 17th century. \n\nPu Ru (1896-1963) was a native of Beijing and was a Manchu prince and cousin of the last Emperor Pu Yi. He is considered one of the few great artists in the first half of the 20th century who mastered classical poetry, calligraphy and painting.  He studied natural sciences in Germany, and moved to Taiwan in 1949.",
