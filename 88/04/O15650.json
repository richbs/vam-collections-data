Everyday living for Balmain's clientele often involved grand evening occasions, and he is perhaps best known for the lavish ball-gowns he created for these events. \n\nMiss Stella Carcano y Morra wore this jacket at her marriage to Viscount Ednam on 10 January 1946. She teamed it with a skirt of white faille and a small pillbox cap. Balmain later wrote, 'This was the first society marriage for which I designed the bride's and bridesmaids' dresses'. \n\nThe jacket forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. Sir Cecil Beaton was a society photographer. With great energy and determination Beaton contacted the well-dressed \u00e9lite of Europe and North America to help create this monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
