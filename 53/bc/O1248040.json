During the winter of 1817/1818 masses of ice and snow from the Gietroz Glacier had damned the River Drance and formed Lake Mauvoisin.  In June 1818 the lake burst its barriers and caused terrible devastation throughout the entire Val de Bagnes as far as Sembrancher and Martigny.\n\nIn 1818 a 16-page leaflet: 'A Description of the Inundation of the Valley of Bagnes in Swisserland [sic]' was published and sold by I.B.
