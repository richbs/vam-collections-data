Using concrete poetry as a kind of springboard Houedard developed a way of making more purely abstract or pictorial images with the typewriter keys. \n\nIt is not clear if this blotter was used as such or not. It was described at the time of acquisition in the Circulation Department Register as one of a series of typewrtier drawings making use of mirror images with a mixture of straight and reversed letters and words, with inkspots and one blot.",
