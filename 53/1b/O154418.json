Kate Greenaway's close friend, Helen Paterson, who later married William Allingham, also contributed illustrations to the book.\n\nIn 1889, Kate Greenaway sold her drawing to Mr. Pears, the soap manufacturer. It was engraved and printed in colour on an advertising handbill, opposite Sir John Everett Millais's painting, 'Bubbles'.",
