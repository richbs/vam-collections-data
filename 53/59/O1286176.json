He was artistic adviser to the Sunday Times magazine in the 1960s, and his work has appeared in many newspapers and periodicals including Vogue and Vanity Fair. In 2001 the National Portrait Gallery held a retrospective exhibition of his work.\n\nActor Sir Derek Jacobi was an acclaimed Hamlet, playing the role for the Prospect Theatre Company (later the Old Vic Company) at the Old Vic and on tour in 1977- 1979, and on television in 1980 as part of the BBC\u2019s Shakespeare series. He was Laertes in the National Theatre Company\u2019s opening production at the Old Vic in  1963 and Claudius in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s film version of the play in 1996. He had directed Branagh in the leading role for the Renaissance Theatre Company in 1988, the year in which this photograph was taken.",
