By the late 19th century wallpapers were widely used by all classes, both in homes and in public buildings.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis wallpaper was designed to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887, the fiftieth year of her reign. The design shows a portrait of the Queen surrounded by representations of  India, Canada, Australia, and the Cape Colony (part of what is now South Africa), which were then part of the British Empire.\n\nOwnership & Use\nWallpapers commemorating important historical events and royal anniversaries were produced in large numbers in the second half of the 19th century. They were intended for the cheaper end of the market. At the time many critics and design reformers condemned pictorial patterns like this as evidence of bad taste and poor design. This wallpaper is a 'sanitary' paper. It was printed with oil-based colours that were not soluble in water, so that the surface was washable. Sanitary wallpapers with commemorative designs would probably have been used in an inn or hotel rather than in an ordinary home.",
