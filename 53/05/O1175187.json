Left shoulder enlarged to fit over a pad. Cotton back, open and fastening with three sets of ties.\n[underdoublet] Longer under-doublet of old-gold silk, ornamented with gold braid applique in lattice-work with jewels between, and small satin ruffle at neck, fastening down the front with silk-covered buttons.  Left shoulder enlarged for a pad, and left side of back reinforced with black cloth and tying-tapes to avoid any risk of shifting.\n[gown] Long asymetrical open gown, the left hand longer and with extra fabric to drape over right shoulder. The gown is made from purple silk [?] velvet, stamped with Tudor rose and lined with gold silk. This lining is very worn and shattered. The collar and inside cuffs of the 'bells' sleeves are appliqued with scrolls of gold braid.\n[robe] Robe/tunic, calf length, purple velvet with ermine border at hem and cuffs. Fastens from neck to waist at the front with eleven self covered buttons with a further metal hook and bar at waist. Two thin metal 'bars' are also attached to the exterior of the robe, one at each shoulder, possibly to hold a cloak. Robe opens at the rear to below the waist and is secured with three fabric tabs and metal buttons and two hooks and eyes at the waist. It appears that this rear opening was created at a later date, as the costumier's label, sewn into the cream silk lining has been cut in two.\n[train] Extremely long and wide court train of deep red velvet (much worn and shattered) decorated with regularly spaced appliqued and embroidered badges depicting the Royal Arms in the White Rose and Sun of York. According to Holmes  (Holmes 62, 61 and 159, 'Catalogue of Theatrical Costume') the train was originally lined and bordered with fur.\n[boot] Ankle boot, crimson suede with glass jewel decoration, laces with decorative points (two missing).\n[boot] Ankle boot, crimson suede with glass jewel decoration, laces with decorative points (two missing).",

            "public_access_description": "Henry Irving (1838-1905) wore this costume in the title role of Richard III by William Shakespeare (1564-1616).  The costume dates from Irving\u2019s first production in  1877, apart from the ermine-bordered tunic of purple velvet which was made for his revival of the play in 1896.  Irving used the design of the costume to visually support his characterization of the role.  In particular, the under-doublet has one shoulder enlarged to cover a false hump, and the heel of one boot is raised causing him to walk with a limp.  The 1877 production marked a return to Shakespeare\u2019s original text.  Before Irving, most actors had used the eighteenth century adaptation by Colley Cibber (1671\u20131757).\n\nIrving became a professional actor in 1856, and learned his trade in regional theatres until 1866, when he came to London.  He joined the Lyceum Theatre company under the management of H. L. Bateman in 1871, winning great acclaim that year for his psychologically developed characterisation of the guilt-ridden inn-keeper Mathias in Leopold Lewis\u2019s melodrama The Bells.  He took on the responsibilities of \u2018actor-manager\u2019 in 1878 when he assumed the management of the Lyceum, and remained there until 1902, enjoying star status with his leading lady Ellen Terry (1847-1928).   Irving produced a diverse range of old and new plays at the Lyceum, including Shakespeare, historical drama, and literary adaptations.  His tireless work to elevate the status of the theatrical profession was rewarded in 1895 when he became the first actor ever to receive a knighthood for services to the Theatre.\n\nIrving specialised in spectacularly staged productions with large casts of performers. He commissioned designers and composers to create appropriate scenery, costume and incidental music, played by a full orchestra.  Although electric lighting was available from the 1880s, Irving preferred the softer effects of gas, with lime light to focus attention at key points in the play.  Irving toured complete productions outside London, taking the full company, scenery and costumes throughout the United Kingdom and across the United States and Canada.   The development of the railway system made his the first generation able to achieve this level of touring productions.",
