The date of the mirror is based on the approximate dating of the barometer to about 1720. \n\nOwnership & Use\nInventories show that barometers were usually hung in the hall, providing a useful guide to the weather prior to leaving the house. The mirror was in the collection of the Mildmay family and according to family tradition hung in their London house in Stoke Newington.\n\nDesign\nThe unusual shape of this mirror recurs with certain mirror plates on desk and bookcases of the mid-1740s. These were probably inspired by earlier forms, like this example, and are often thought to be the work of the cabinet-maker Giles Grendey (1693-1780). The style of the decorative carving is close to the work of Grinling Gibbons (1648-1721), though it does not have Gibbons'  naturalistic fluency.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe survival of the original oil gilded finish is remarkable. The gold has been applied to the carved surface over a paint ground. In the border between the inner and outer mouldings, sand has been mixed with the paint to provide a granular surface which forms a contrast with the smooth gold on the carved surfaces.",
