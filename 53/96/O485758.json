It is of traditional Chinese cut without without shoulder seams, a high collar, and button and loop-fastenings. It has three patch pockets, a less traditional feature. It is lined throughout with a plain weave, grey/blue silk and is wadded. The lining is not attached at the hem of the jacket. The wadding is sandwiched in place between a soft unbleached cotton and the plain silk lining. Rows of quilting stitches run across the jacket vertically.\n[Trousers] The trousers are of the same top silk and lining silk as the jacket and are similarly wadded. They are of a traditional baggy cut with no seams along the outside edge. There is a small gusset at the crotch. The deep waistband is of blue cotton and is designed to be worn bunched in with a belt (FE.94B-1983).",
