Whistler's first major suite of prints, his 'French Set' brought critical acclaim but disappointing sales.  Seeking more generous patrons, he moved to London in 1859. Initially under the influence of his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden, a pioneer of the 'etching revival', he began a series of superbly observed and finely detailed views of the River Thames with its shipping, thriving wharves and picturesque characters. In his 'Thames Set' etchings Whistler often introduced the figures of workmen, boatmen or loungers in the foregrounds. Here, however, the figure - 'W. Jones, Lime-burner of Thames Street' - is made the central element, while the view to the river beyond becomes almost incidental.",
