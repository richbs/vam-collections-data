Another artist has gone over some of the lines making up the Virgin's hands, but otherwise the majority of the lines on the plate were created by Rembrandt himself in 1654. There are also some areas of the plate that have become worn, such as a patch on the Virgin's temple. A print was last made from this plate in 1906.\n\nThe V&amp;A holds an early state of an impression from this plate, Museum number CAI.646. The plate was being printed from until 1906, during which period many of the plates were reworked to prolong their life. \n\nThe composition is partly based on an engraving of the Virgin and Child by Antegna Mantegna.",
