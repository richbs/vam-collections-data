It was printed on coloured silk satin probably with an engraved copper plate and using paper printing inks. \n\nThe Wanstead Young Men's Association was probably one of a number of local Victorian organisations with members drawn from branches of the working classes with a strong interest in the performing arts. The programme sets out the entertainment for the evening. Both men and women performed piano, violin and vocal turns, and prizes for recitation were presented during the interval.\n\nThe central cartouche (oval panel) of oak leaves shows Queen Victoria as Queen of Great Britain and Empress of India. Six flags, all indistinct except for the Union Jack, are represented. The design also includes a lion, tiger, kangaroo and beaver, representing Africa, India, Australia and Canada. The back of the programme shows a view of Windsor Castle, Berkshire.",
