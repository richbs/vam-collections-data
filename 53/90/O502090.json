The cylindrical leg has a tapered foot and the same garlanded moulding over finger moulding. On the right side the leg is similarly tapered with finger moulding but ungarlanded.

Most designs are associated with the well-known Rococo designer and carver Matthias Lock, but the album includes a number of designs which should probably be associated with a later Matthias Lock, recorded at Clerkenwell Green in 1788-1797, who is probably his son. These include neo-classical mirror designs, and designs for foliate ornament. In 1769, a Matthias Lock published A New Book of Foliage for the Instruction of Young Artists and A New Book of Pier Frame\u2019s, Oval\u2019s, Gerandole\u2019s, Tables, &c, all in the neo-classical style. This is presumably also the son. The neo-classical style and presentation of this chair design closely match the neo-classical mirror designs which have been attributed to the younger Lock. It is therefore possible that this chair design also belongs to the son. The album was bought from a descendant, probably his grandson, George Lock, and had been exhibited by him at the International Exhibition held at South Kensington in 1862.",
