It can be hung upon a wall or smaller versions may be worn as decoration, like a brooch. \n\nSpiers was an English architect and author (b. 1838, d. 1916). He first studied at King's College London and later at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts in Paris and occupied a long mastership at the Royal Academy. He travelled widely (France, Spain, Egypt, Syria and the East), where he recorded architectural data and made many water-colour sketches.\n\nThe sculptor and medallist Lanteri was a native of Burgundy, and initially trained under Aim\u00e9 Millet (1819-1891) and M. Lecoque de Boisbaudran, and later at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts under Eug\u00e8ne Guillaume (1822-1905) and Pierre-Jules Cavalier.  Lanteri settled in England from 1872, and was naturalised in 1901. At the age of 23 he became chief assistant to Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, a position he held until Boehm's death in 1890.  In 1874 Lanteri was appointed Master of Modelling at the National Art Training School (now Royal College of Art), and in 1900 became the first Professor of Modelling.  During 1905/6 he supervised students working on the figures of Fame, Sculpture and Architecture for the Exhibition Road fa\u00e7ade of the Museum.  Lanteri wrote a three volume guide to modelling published in 1902, 1904 and 1911.",
