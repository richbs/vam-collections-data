His work blurs the boundaries between photography and sculpture and deals with the nature of photographic representation and its relationship to the material world.  It challenges the viewer to scrutinise the divide between an object and its depiction. In selecting and abstracting things from their place in the world, Harvey-Regan removes them from their contexts to perform specifically for the camera.  Technically he works primarily with traditional film and printing methods, seeing the restrictions associated with these as both an inspiration and a gently humorous frustration. In this way, he is forced to engage with and physically manipulate objects, rather than have limitless scope to alter and adapt them digitally.  As a result, the viewer is confronted with images that are like optical puzzles, confounding the visual codes of both analogue and digital photography.",
