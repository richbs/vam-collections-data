It has a good movement as well as a good case, and would be acceptable\".\n\n22 March 1932, minute paper\nnotes condition of the clock on arrival at V & A as \"cracked, chipped, portions missing\".\n\n4 August 1932 letter, Dr F A B Ward (Science Museum) to Clifford-Smith \nexplains the figures on the clock.
