The great hall was the usual setting for such displays, since it was here that the medieval lord feasted with his household and guests. These eye-catching decorations not only advertised his wealth, but also proclaimed his lineage and social alliances.\n\nPlace\nThis is one of a series of coats of arms relating the history of the Beaupr\u00e9 family. It is thought to have been commissioned by Sir Robert Bell for Beaupr\u00e9 Hall, the family's ancestral home near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Bell married Dorothy, the sole heiress of the Beaupr\u00e9 line, in 1559 and succeeded to the Beaupr\u00e9 estate following the death of Dorothy's father, Edmund, in 1567. The windows seem to date from the completion of a new great hall in around 1570, but were later moved and cut down to fit narrower lights.\n\nPeople\nThis shield shows the arms of Thomas Fordringaye, Lord of Southacre, Alderford and Dorwards Hall in Brocking, Essex. He was the father of Margaret who, in 1493, married Nicholas Beaupr\u00e9 (for their arms see another panel from this group, museum no. C.69-1946). The white on ruby cross device of the Fordringaye family is shown here quartered with the arms of the houses of Blauney, Durward, Coggeshall and Harsyck. Three of the sections which made up this panel have been lost and were replaced, probably in the mid-20th century, with contemporary yellow stained glass.",
