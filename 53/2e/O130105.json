Cowern was interested in structure, exploring both architectural interiors and pattern related to architectural settings in her work.  She produced her first felt piece in 1976, a nine-piece matrix which she described as 'a key work'.  'Felt, Weave, Knit' focused on the transformation of a raw material to demonstrate the structure and pattern of each technique.  Increasingly drawn to the freedom and directness inherent in the art of feltmaking, Cowern started to produce large scale works inspired by the fast changing skies of Cumbria; which she believed 'had the effect of huge, freely-worked watercolours and the colour in depth of frecoes'.  'Felt #29' reflects a departure away from Cowern's sky series of felts, and a concentration on cutting and re-combining the material to create a complex collage.",
