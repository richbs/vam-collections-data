            "historical_context_note": "Beatrice Emma Parsons was trained as a painter at the Royal Academy Schools, and from 1889 exhibited at the R.A. summer exhibitions. Her early pictures, such as `The Annunciation' (for which May Morris posed as the Virgin Mary) were often of religious subjects, but she is best known today as a watercolour painter, mainly of flowers and gardens. Beatrice was also part of the William Morris circle and encouraged her younger (and now more famous) brother, Karl Parsons, to take up stained glass designing in the studio of Christopher Whall.",
