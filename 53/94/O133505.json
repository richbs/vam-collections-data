Messel was a master of materials and could make theatre costumes appear lavish by using the most mundane of fabrics and material.  When he designed stage armour for Helen! in 1932 - although in a pastiche production - he used heavy flannel, but film called for a more realistic approach, hence his use of leather.  Using moulded leather for the decorations made the costume more flexible and easier to wear than if he had used metal.",

The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: The costume is an excellent example of design and making and relates to a prestigious film that, at the time, was the most expensive ever made in Britain.  It was the only colour film Messel ever designed.",
