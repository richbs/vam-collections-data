It consisted of a stand supporting a separate cabinet that was fitted with drawers and compartments for papers and writing materials, and a hinged 'fall' front that provided a writing surface when opened. More fashionable examples supplied by cabinet-makers were decorated with new styles of marquetry or attractively figured veneers. Plainer examples, like this one, made by a joiner in oak, had simpler geometrical ornament created from glued mouldings, and eye-catching spiral legs to the stand.",

(RF 22/1658).\n\nOn loan to Kew Palace 1948-2005\nThis cabinet belonged to the Eyre family in Berkshire, who had been Lords of the Manor of Landford and had, since at least the 17th century, owned properties in Berkshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire and Essex.  \n\nThe decorative use of geometrical mouldings, as seen on this writing-cabinet, was in wide use from about 1630 (though their first use in England is much earlier, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth); its use here c1680-1700 appears to indicate a rather old-fashioned survival applied to a relatively new form. The design of the stand (in terms of spiral-turned legs and stretcher) is more characteristic of the 1680s.",

Three early examples were supplied to Ham House in the 1670s, one built into the fittings of the library by joiner Henry Harlow 1672-4, in cedarwood on oak; another freestanding example in burr-elm veneers with ebony on oak c1670-75; another freestanding example on spiral turned stand, veneered with parquetry of kingwood, with silver mounts. The form was relatively short-lived, being superceded by about 1700 by smaller desks in the form of a large box with hinged front on a table or kneehole chest of drawers, which could be extended into a larger, two-stage bureau-cabinet, by the addtion of an upper section with twin doors.",
