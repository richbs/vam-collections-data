It was made in Iran, and the highly stylised blossoms arranged like a tree are typically Iranian. The more naturalistic flowers above the arch, however, resemble Turkish Ottoman designs. The flowers in the border show the influence of new floral designs imported from India after 1600. They are strikingly similar to South Asian patterns in which flowers are shown head on.",
