(formerly Parker & Perry) established in London by Mr. William Parker in the mid-18th century, which supplied lighting appliances, <i>inter alia</i> to the Royal Palaces and Residences.  The company continued in existence until 1925.  For later designs made for Perry & Co., see the volumes and drawings by Bartlett and J. Wateridge, the donor of these drawings.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nDesign for a pendant lantern in the gothic style.
