This costume for Dr Faustus in Christopher Marlow's play immediately establishes Faustus as a scholar and man of learning but the symbols indicate magic and the occult; the hat, though in period, carries overtones of a wizard's pointed hat.  The drawing also indicates the make-up for the actor.  Very few designers draw the make-up for the actors, except as part of the costume design.   \nAlthough theatre designs are often considered works of art and are sought after by museums and private collectors, their artistic worth or decorative qualities are secondary to whether they 'work' on stage.  The success of a costume design cannot be judged until it is translated into fabric, texture and decoration by the costume makers and seen as part of the whole stage picture.  Some designers are very knowledgeable about costume making and produce very detailed designs, with notes on fabrics and making techniques, others create an 'atmospheric' drawing, which gives the feeling of the costume, and they then either work closely with the costume maker to realise their concept or have trusted makers who know their work and can create the effects they have in mind.",
