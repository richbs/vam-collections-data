The princess is identified by an inscription as the daughter of 'Ali 'Adil Shah, ruler of Bijapur (presumably the second of that name, who reigned 1656-1672). Bijapur was the capital of one of the Sultanates of the Deccan in southern India, until absorbed into the Mughal empire in 1686.  The princess is chasing a black buck and two does. Hares run from two male servants in the foreground. There are panels of verse above and below the painting, and on the back there is a drawing showing an ascetic with disciples, mounted with two sheets of verse.",
