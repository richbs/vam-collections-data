His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s first post-war production was Sheridan\u2019s comedy of manners, The Rivals (1775). Performed at the Criterion Theatre in 1945, and directed by William Armstrong and Edith Evans, he designed costumes and sets in pastiche of eighteenth century period style.  The artificiality and lightness of his designs were well suited to the improbable plot and satiric spirit of the play.\n\nAn ink and wash study for a tree in King Mead Field, Bath, the setting for the last act.  The tree is intended to be a cut-out flat set piece, so Messel has defined the outline of the tree in white opaque paint, to indicate where prop makers should cut-out the shape of the tree.",
