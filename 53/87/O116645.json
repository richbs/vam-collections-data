She works in a variety of printmaking techniques. Her works can also be found at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, as well as in private collections. \n\nThis print is a combination techniques: the glass surface is printed with silkscreen printing, with cut paper and paper sculpture underneath. The delicately printed silkscreen on the surface brings a dreamlike quality to the work, perhaps suggesting travel in real locations, as well as journeys of the mind. The theme of travel and the way the places here are shown fragmented and disrupted perhaps echoes the artist\u2019s background as someone who doesn\u2019t live in her native country anymore.",
