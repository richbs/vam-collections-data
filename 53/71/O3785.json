Philip Webb (1831-1915) has created a design that combines a flat-bottomed vessel part, typical of an elaborately coloured and enamel-painted 16th-century Venetian goblet, with a stem of six twisted canes (rods) of glass and a raised foot. But in designing it for clear glass and giving the vessel part a ribbed profile he has invented an entirely new form.\n\nPeople\nWebb designed a set of table glass intended for the personal use of the designer and writer William Morris (1834-1896) at Red House, Bexleyheath, Kent. The fully completed drawings for this glass are dated January 1860. It was made by James Powell & Sons of London. That first set, which no longer survives, was elaborately historicist in style and included enamel-painted decoration.  By 1862 Webb was converting the more elaborate designs into a plainer range for multiple production. This goblet is from that plainer range.",
