A.120-1929), and variants of both remain at Brocklesby Park, Lincolnshire, the ancestral home of the Yarboroughs. Both busts stand on their original wood plinths.\n\nNollekens was a prolific sculptor of portrait busts and operated a thriving workshop in London. Many of his busts are in the classical style, with loose drapery and cropped hair. He spent eight years in Rome from 1762 to 1770, where he worked with Bartolomeo Cavaceppi restoring and copying antique marbles. One of these copies, his group of Castor and Pollux, is in the Museum's collection (Museum no. A.59-1940).",
