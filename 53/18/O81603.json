He studied with local painters in Toulouse before entering the Paris studio of David (1748-1825) in 1797. He was soon consider as the champion of the French classical tradition of history painting, traditionally opposed to the art of Delacroix in the early 19th century. Ingres was awarded the prix de Rome in 1801 and alternated long sojourns in Italy and Paris from 1806 until 1855. He received important state commissions and official honours for his oeuvre that also includes portraits paintings which represent a good testimonial of the 19th-century French high society.\n\nThis work is an unfinished preparatory study for a painting executed in 1817. It depicts the King Henry IV of France playing with his son, the future Louis XIII (1601-1643) surprised by the Spanish ambassador. The subject matter was taken from a popular anecdote and is a fine example of the history paintings inspired by the history of France in vogue during the first half of the 19th century.",

He won the Prix de Rome in 1801, but was unable to proceed to Rome until 1806. He then lived in Rome until 1820, and in Florence 1820-24. On his return to Paris he received the Cross of the Legion of Honour from Charles X and was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. In 1835-41 he was again in Rome, as director of the French school. He was made a senator in 1862. Ingres painted portraits and historical, mythological, allegorical and religious subjects; he excelled as a draughtsman. \n\n113 \nHENRI IV, THE DAUPHIN AND THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR: A SKETCH Signed lower left <i>Ingres</i> \nCanvas \n19 7/8 x 24 \u00bd (50.5 x 62.3) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.58 \n \nThe King, being discovered playing as a horse for his children, asked the ambassador if he were a father, and on receiving an affirmative reply, observed quietly, 'Then I shall finish my round.' \nThis is one of four recorded versions: (1) Whereabouts unknown; painted for the Comte de Blacas, French Ambassador in Rome, and dated 1817 (Delaborde, no. 63; Wildenstein, no. 113, fig. 61); (2) private collection, Paris; Ingres sale, 27 April 1867, no. 9 (Delaborde, no. 66; Wildenstein, no. 115, fig. 62); (3) Whereabouts unknown, formerly Baron Alphonse de Rothschild collection; a replica of (1), dated 1828 (Delaborde, no. 65; Wildenstein, no. 204). \nThese differ considerably from CAI.58. They show Marie de M\u00e9dicis seated in the middle of the composition and include four children instead of only one. CAI.58 is clearly a sketch. Perspective guidelines are visible on the floor and there are indications that the artist changed the composition in several places. A shadowy figure on the extreme left is partially visible behind the door, and the door itself appears to have been moved from its original position. \nIt differs too greatly from the finished version, Wildenstein, no. 113, to be called a sketch for it, but Delaborde's description of it as a 'premi\u00e8re pens\u00e9e' would seem acceptable. As the finished version is dated 1817, a date ca. 1816-17 may be proposed for CAI.58. The drawings in the Mus\u00e9e Ingres at Montauban (esp. nos. 867-1402,867-1409) relate more closely to Wildenstein no. 113 than to CAI.58. It was engraved by Adrian Nargeot (<i>L'Artiste,</i> 1876). \nThere are two paintings of the same subject by Bonington (1802-28) in the Wallace Collection (no. 351, oil on canvas; no. 733 water-colour). The subject was also painted by Pierre Henri Revoil (1776-1842) (L. Rosenthal, <i>La peinture romantique,</i> 1900, p. 75). \n\nProv. Given by Ingres to Dominique Papery, pensionnaire of the Acad\u00e9mie de France in Rome (according to Wildenstein); M. Delavey berette, Duc de Morny; before 1876, M. Meyer; before 1884, Constantine Alexander Ionides; bequeathed to the Museum in 1900. \nExh. <i>French and Dutch Romanticists,</i> Dowdeswell Galleries, 1889, no. 193. \nLit. H.

Delareyberette, Duc de Morny; before 1876 coll. M. Meyer; from whom perhaps purchased (stock book entry difficult to read - perhaps 'Duger' or 'Meyer'?) on 21 November 1881 as Ingres 'Henri IV et l'ambassadeur d'Angleterre' by Goupil  &amp; Co., Paris (stock book no. 15785); from whom bought by Constantine  Alexander Ionides, 21 November 1881; listed in his inventory (private collection) on 21 November 1881 as 'Oil sketch. Henri IV receiving an ambassador. by Ingres. Goupil' at a valuation of \u00a3280; bequeathed by Constantine Alexander  Ionides to the Museum in 1900. \n\nHistorical significance: According to Ingres\u2019 early biographer, Henri Delaborde, this painting was a preparatory study (\u2018premi\u00e8re pens\u00e9e\u2019) for the finished version, executed in 1817, for the Duc de Blacas (Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais, Paris \u2013 Inv. 1164) and exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1824 and at the <i>Exposition universelle</i> in 1855. CAI.58 was most likely the earliest of a series of four and was left unfinished.  Of the four versions, the V&A painting is the most distinctive one with only a few figures whereas the other versions included more children and the Queen and a very different interior. \nIt depicts the king Henry IV playing a horse with his son, the Dauphin, on his back and surprised in such posture by the Spanish Ambassador. The subject is taken from an anecdote related in the <i>M\u00e9morial pittoresque de la France</i> (1786). The king, being discovered, asked the Ambassador if he were a father and on receiving an affirmative reply, observed quietly: \u2018Then I shall finish my round\u2019.\nThis painting is a fine example of the so-called \u2018go\u00fbt troubadour\u2019, an aesthetic movement that aimed to renew the classical tradition by focusing of subject matters drawn from the Middle Age and the history of France. Ingres painted other two versions of the subject in addition to the ones mentioned above: one, dated 1828, was formerly in Alphonse de Rothschild collection, Paris, while another belonged to Mme Ingres (Wildenstein, no. 62).\nIt was a popular subject treated by several artists in the 19th century, including Pierre Revoil (1776-1842), in the Mus\u00e9e National du Ch\u00e2teau de Pau, dated 1813, and Richard Parkes Bonington (1802-1828), in the Wallace Collection, London, dated c. 1827.",

            "historical_context_note": "History painting, i.e. depictions of non recurring events based on religious, classical, literary or allegorical sources, particularly developed in Italy during the Renaissance (15th-16th centuries). History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
