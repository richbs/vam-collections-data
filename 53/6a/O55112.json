The menu is illustrated with pictures which had previously been made by the Scottish illustrator, Jessie Marion King for an edition of 'The Studio' in 1919.\n\nJessie Marion King is best known as a designer and book illustrator. She studied at the Glasgow School of Art, and her distinctive linear style of illustration reflects the influence of the dynamic and innovative designers, such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who helped form what became known as the Glasgow style at the turn of the 19th century. She enjoyed a varied career, designing jewellery and textiles for Liberty & Co. and textiles for Alexander Morton & Co. She enjoyed fame and recognition in her own lifetime, when many of her designs were published in 'The Studio' and exhibited in Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Berlin and Turin.",
