The story is taken from a later version of the Chanson de Roland and shows a m\u00eal\u00e9e in the battle of Roncevaux, where Roland, with his sword Durendal, is in combat with the King Marsile. The real battle was the last of Charlemagne's first campaign to capture Spain, an attempt that ended in failure. Roland and the rear guard were left behind by the main army, and were attacked at the Roncevaux pass in the Pyrenees by the Basques on 15 August 778 AD. The Franks were completely annihilated.\n\nThe battle was later romanticised into a major conflict between Christians and Saracens, although both sides were Christians, and Charlemagne comes to the rescue of Roland and destroys the Saracens.",

The real battle was the last of Charlemagne's first campaign to capture Spain, an attempt that ended in failure. Roland and the rear guard were left behind the main army, and were attacked at the Roncevaux pass in the Pyrenees by the Basques on August 15, 778, when the Franks were completely annihilated. This minor battle was romanticized by oral tradition into a major conflict between Christians and Saracens (both sides were Christians), where Charlemagne comes to the resue of Roland and destroys the Saracens. When <i>The Song of Roland</i> was written down, by an unknown troubadour of the 11th century, it became the first chanson de gest or epic poem of medieval France.",
