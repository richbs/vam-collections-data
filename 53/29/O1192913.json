It was designed in Australia in 2000 by Wheely Bug Toys Ltd and is made in China. It is now sold all over the world. Wheelybugs come in a variety of different designs including a bumblebee, ladybird, mouse, tiger, and a cow. They are available in two sizes: the small one is aimed at 1\u20132 year olds and the large one is aimed at children aged 2\u20135 years old. The bright colours and modern design are appealing to both girls and boys. \n\nThe Wheelybug is a new variation on more traditional moving or ride-on toys. These toys were usually made from wood and metal, and had wheels that only moved in a forwards and backwards direction. The Wheelybug has castor wheels that move completely freely allowing the child to move in any direction, helping to promote gross motor skills, spatial awareness, and balance.",
