He has let his kimono fall to his waist revealing a muscly, hairy body covered in a massive tattoo of a floral design which stretches over the whole of his upper body and down his arms. Whereas the ivory for his kimono and hat is a mellow yellow colour, that of his body is white, with extensive incising and staining in black, with red inside the mouth. The base consists of two holes to accomodate the netsuke cord, as well as an incised and stained inscription.",

Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Netsuke were traditionally made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving).  This example is a three-dimensional carving in the form of a seated, tattoed man scratching an itch on his foot. \n\nThe subject of this netsuke makes excellent use of its small size by drawing the viewer\u2019s eye all round the carving, while also injecting a humorous element. Not only does the heavily tattooed upper body attract the viewer\u2019s eyes, but so too does the grimace on the man\u2019s face and his contorted body. On inspection it soon becomes evident that after suffering from a terrible itch on his foot, he has succumbed to frantic scratching. The look on his face is a combination of agony and relief.",
