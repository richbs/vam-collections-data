Jill grew up in Borrowby Lincolnshire.  It was purchased by her grandmother, possibly in a shop in London. Her coat is a smart, good quality and well made garment by the label Karlinda of London.\n\nThe style and shape of the coat is classic and its velvet trimmed collar and cuffs, the highly placed buttons, fitted waist and flared bottom varied very little from the 1930s to the 1960s. Jill's two older sisters had worn similar styles of coats a few years before her grandmother had bought this one for her.",
