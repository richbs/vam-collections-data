Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nOne of the most typical techniques in the south of Italy and Sardinia was the use of mixed colours of gold.  The goldsmiths often used yellow gold, mainly filigree, as a base, and attached flat shapes of red gold to its surface.  This technique was used for pendants and necklaces, as well as earrings, and is still in use today.\n\nThis earring was bought for \u00a31 (the pair) as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
