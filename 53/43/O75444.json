The buttons and buttonholes are attached to a panel of the olive-bistre synthetic ribbed fabric fixed under the front edges.  Around the lower edge of the coat and up the side slits are loops of olive bistre velvet ribbon.  On either side of the jacket is a slit pocket with a row of buttons and false buttonholes.  Around the back slit is a band of the dark brown velvet ribbon trimmed with black braid, as on the front panels.

It was later revived at the Coliseum when the Sadler's Wells Opera had become English National Opera, and later at English National Opera North.\n\nHistorical significance: The costume is the work of a distinguished theatrical designer for an opera by Richard Rodney Bennett, who was to become one of Britain's most distinguished composers.  Bennett's previous music had been primarily for film and this was his first excursion into opera.",
