He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nAnatole de Grunwald commissioned Messel to design costumes and sets for a film version of Alexander Pushkin's supernatural short story The Queen of Spades in 1949.  Post war rationing meant that materials were difficult to acquire and Messel had to create 19th century  St Peterburg on a shoestring budget in a small studio at Welwyn Garden City. This design shows the bookshop visited by the hero Captain Herman Suvorin, played by Anton Walbrook,who is visible in the doorway.",
