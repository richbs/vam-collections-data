Exhibited 35 paintings at the RA between 1818 and 1859, 50 at the BI 1820-66, and 32 at the SBA 1828-72. Specialised in domestic genre and scenes of schoolboy life, sometimes humorous; many of his works were engraved. Died Uxbridge, Middlesex, 19 April 1879. His sister, Charlotte Farrier, was a miniature painter. \n\n<b>The Parting - A Recruit Taking Leave of his Family</b> \n229-1879 \nCanvas, 73.6 x 62.1 cm (29 x 24\u00bd ins) \nGiven by Miss Mary Farrier 1879 \n\nFarrier exhibited several subjects of this kind: one critic wrote of 'Preparing for War', exhibited at the RA in 1847 (23): 'The very same boys that, time out of mind, have disported themselves upon the canvases of this artist ... preparing for war, as they did long ago, parading funnels as helmets and pot-lids as shields. The picture is, in other respects, similar to most of those we remember of the productions of the painter' (<i>Art Journal</i> 1847 , p186). \n\nThe present painting may be that exhibited at the RA in 1844, 'The Parting: \"Life was New and Hope was Young\" '; he also exhibited 'Taking Leave: \"Life was New, and Hope was Young\" 'at the BI in 1827 (329, measurements including frame given in the catalogue as '33 by 30 inches'). The former work was described in the <i>Art Journal</i> (1844, p167) as 'the old story of a young man having enlisted, and now taking leave of his mother and sisters. The style of work is hard and edgy, but there is some point in the leave-taking'. \n\nEXH: ?RA 1844 (616)\"",
