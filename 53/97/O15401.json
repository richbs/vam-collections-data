It is possible the design was inspired by embroidery with applied pearls on 16th-century woman's dress.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe appearance of pearls and jewels was achieved by applying thick raised enamels in appropriate colours.\n\nPeople\nW. T. Copeland's succeeded the partnership of Copeland and Garrett in 1847. The original company, started by Josiah Spode in about 1761, has traditionally been credited with perfecting bone china in the late 1780s. In their revolutionary technique, bone ash is added to porcelain to give a whiter and stronger material.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe Great Exhibition jury reports praised the competence of this jewelled work but not the result: 'The effect of inlaid pearls and other jewels is rendered with considerable success'.  Much skill was involved, but the taste of the final product was questioned.",
