(Name of issuing firm.)   Mark in cover.   Book 87.\n\n<b>Description.</b>--A catalogue of edge tools.   9 in. by 14<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> in.   56 plates, some folding.   In original mottled paper cover with cloth back.   No date.   No water mark.   E. 121-1896.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--As M. 63 k. and in addition gravers, tools for skinners, tanners and weavers, book binders' knives, garden tools, picks and mattocks, hammers for carpenters, shoemakers and saddlers, tailors' shears, shears and snips for metal, draughtsmen's tools, planes and ploughs, metal turning tools and chasers, hand pads, chests of tools, files and rasps, shovels and spades and nails.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--This appears to be another edition, probably later, of M. 63 k., at any rate the author has had access to the earlier plates.   It is of peculiar interest, because on the backs of some of the plates is a sticker bearing the name of Cutler &amp; Co. (late Furness, Cutler &amp; Stacey), Castle Hill, Sheffield.   The text serves to warn all and sundry that:--\n<sup>It is well-known that a great proportion of TOOLS are manu-\nfactured ONLY TO SELL ; and an\nINFALLIBLE TRUTH\nThat those are the cheapest which do most work.\nThe ultimate issue of this sort of thing is the moral : Buy Cutlers\n&amp; Co., and remember--\nNone are genuine unless stamped--WELDON.</sup>\nThe additional plates relate to tools for engravers and mezzotinters, skinners and tanners, weavers, and book-binders.   Garden tools are also adequately represented.   It is worth remarking, because it proves how carefully the plates were kept for use for succeeding editions, that a blank half page in M. 63. k. has been utilised in this issue for a few examples of pickaxes and mattocks.   Later labels pasted on the pages give some idea of the appearance of Castle Hill Works, and show Hiram Cutler at this period in business solely on his own account, and advertising fresh trade-marks.   In all these the trade-mark embodies a cross and the letter \" F,\" which suggests that Furness was the real founder of the business. \n   Hiram Cutler also sold or made nails ; and illustrates joiners' sprigs, floor stubs, shoe bills, slender bills, box and trunk nails, tacks, bed nails, clog nails, glaziers's sprigs, chair springs, shoe hobs, and slater's lath nails.   The interesting details are the slender points, and in the case of joiner's sprigs over \u00be in. long, and the lath nails, the \" spatulate\" flattened ends.   None of the other goods are priced.\"",
