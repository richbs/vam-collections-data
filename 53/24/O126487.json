Worked as assistant to his father by the age of 15. Exhibited 34 works at the RA between 1843 and 1898, 18 at the BI 1844-67, and 25 at the SBA 1846-94. Early works mainly subjects from English history, and from literature, particularly Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites in the 1850s, in both technique and subject matter; painted several scenes of modem life, notably 'Omnibus Life in London' (1859, Tate Gallery). Later works are mostly 18th-century costume subjects. Designed one of the first Christmas cards, an etched greeting dated 1848. Friend of W P Frith, for whom he painted backgrounds on occasion. Died Chiswick, London, 20 February 1916. \n\nLIT: W M Egley <i>Catalogue of Pictures</i>. . .

Pencil sketches are also recorded in 1853. This scene is a sketch for the painting 'Tartuffe at Supper' exhibited at the RA in 1857 (517), (no268 in the artist's <i>Catalogue</i>, sold Sotheby's 18 December 1985 (99, signed and dated 1857, 63.5 x 95 cm (25 x 37\u00bd ins), repr in colour in the catalogue). The finished painting shows the three figures in the same poses, but almost all the details of their surroundings are different. \n\nIn the RA catalogue, several lines of dialogue, in French, are appended to the title; the episode depicted is described in act 1 scene 5 of Moli\u00e8re's play, first performed in 1664. The hypocritically pious Tartuffe has talked his way into Orgon's household to obtain his property including his wife. In this scene, Orgon is informed by the maid Dorine that his wife is ill, but Orgon enquires with more interest after Tartuffe, and is told that he has eaten a heavy supper; the lines are given in translation in the artist's <i>Catalogue</i>: \n\n<i>Dorine</i>: The day before yesterday our mistress was very feverish from morning to night, and suffered from a most extraordinary headache. \n\n<i>Orgon</i>: And Tartuffe?\n\n<i>Dorine</i>: Tartuffe! He is wonderfully well, stout and fat, with blooming cheeks and ruddy lips. \n\n<i>Orgon</i>: Poor man! \n\n<i>Dorine</i>: In the evening she felt very faint, and the pain in her head was so great that she could not touch anything at supper. \n\n<i>Orgon</i>: And Tartuffe? \n\n<i>Dorine</i>: He ate his supper by himself before her; and very devoutly devoured a brace of partridges and half a leg of mutton hashed. \n\n<i>Orgon</i>: Poor man! \n\nThe <i>Art Journal</i> critic (1857, p173) thought of the RA painting that 'the execution is careful, even to extreme hardness; and the characters want point'. \n\nPROV: Bought by H S Ashbee 20 August 1898 for \u00a36, and bequeathed by him to the museum 1900\"",
