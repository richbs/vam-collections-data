This was on the bill at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 22 August 1904. It was advertised (with a reference to the motor-racing event of the time) as \u2018Motoring, or How We Lost the Gordon Bennett Race\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nMotoring,Tate's first great success, became hugely popular for his company in the music halls. The sketch is about a father, an idiotic son in his Eton suit, and a chauffeur attempting to take the son back to school in a car that won\u2019t start. The son sat in the back of the car making inane comments such as \u2018It\u2019s amazing, pa-pa\u2019, and \u2018Goodbye-eee\u2019. 'Goodbye-eee' became Tate\u2019s best-known catchphrase and the inspiration for the popular World War I song.",

'Motoring' was a hugely popular sketch for Tates's company on the music halls, a story about a father, idiotic son and chauffeur attempting to take the son back to school in a car that won't start. The caricature comes from the first of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, and  features music hall performers working in the early 20th century. The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
