This was the popular improvised type of comedy which flourished in Italy from the 16th to the 18th centuries and had an impact on theatre throughout Europe, especially France. Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability to improvise and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest. Various visiting Italian troupes performed in France in the 16th century where their type of theatre was called the Com\u00e9die-Italienne. By the 17th century however their plays were being performed largely in French, and by the 18th century Commedia dell'Arte was a recognised part of the French theatre.  \n\nMezzetin was one of the stock characters of Commedia dell'Arte. His name meant 'half measure' and in accordance with his inconsistent character could be a deceived or a deceiving husband, and could serve his master with devotion or take bribes and betray him. Although not one of the Commedia characters who became assimilated into British pantomime, he was well known in France in the 18th century and is the subject of a painting by Watteau dated 1718-1720.",
