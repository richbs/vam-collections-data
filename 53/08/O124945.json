Fairfax-Lucy, reports that the plaque was previously at Charlecote Park House in Warwickshire having probably been brought to England by a member of the Lucy family. Bought by the museum from Sir Montgomerie Fairfax-Lucy in 1945.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of the finest quality Limoges enamel, the object is in brilliant condition and no similar plaque is known.\n\nAn individual version of Cufic frequently appeared on medieval enamels. Other examples include two ciboria one in the British Museum and the other in the Louvre and a reliquary chasse known as the chasse de saint Calmine. The enamels ornamented in this way are usually dated to the second quater of the thirteenth century.  An ultimate Spanish origin for the deocration seems probable, and it is possible that jewish craftsmen  were partly instrumental in in spreading the idea of using non-Christian characters. The actual patterns vary very little.",
