The journal featured articles about theatre, travel and other pursuits of interest to the leisured wealthy, but the main emphasis was always on fashion. It was published from November 1912 to the summer of 1915, and again from January 1920 to December 1925. The complete run consisted of 12 volumes. It was intended for the Parisian \u00e9lite, and introduced fashions in colour plates such as this one. The contributors included many prominent artists of the time, and the colour plates anticipated the Art Deco style that was to dominate the 1920s. The illustrations were stencilled by hand with watercolour, in a technique known as pochoir.\n\nThis fashion plate from 1920 presents a dress. It shows a young woman skipping in a field, dressed in delicate fabrics, trying to catch a butterfly. The image is light-hearted and happy and anticipates the 1920s fashion for the 'flapper girl', with her short hair, loose clothes and care-free attitude.",
