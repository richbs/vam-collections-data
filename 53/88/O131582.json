NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative.\n\nThis sample of sheer fabric has fine black lines which have been pleated into ripples to produce a watery effect. A small proportion of black carbon fibres are woven into the polyester slit yarns, reducing the risk of damage by static electric snags and achieving the sheerest quality.",
