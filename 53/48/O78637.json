This was the most popular design for an argyle, although the reason for this is not known.   Two methods were used in argyles  to keep the sauce or gravy hot. The liquid was either heated by an external jacket, filled with hot water, enclosing an inner gravy reservoir or by a hot iron, placed in an internal socket like a tea urn.  In this example, the hot water would have been  poured through the aperture at the back into the 'jacket'. The handle is covered with wicker to protect the user's hand from the heat.  The spout rises from the base, a common feature of most argyles, to prevent the fat from being poured out.  Argyles were most popular between 1765 and1800 and were made in silver, Sheffield plate, porcelain and earthenware. They were one of a number of specialised articles that evolved because of an increasing preoccupation with refined and elegant dining.\n\nPeople\nThe credit for inventing the argyle is generally given to John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll (1693-1770),  who  commissioned the silversmith Fuller White to make him one in 1755.",
