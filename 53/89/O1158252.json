It was Stravinsky's second ballet for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and used a story of traditional street puppets, the Russian equivalent of Punch and Judy, who are brought to life by a showman. The first performance was given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, in 1911, when the Blackamoor, one of the puppets, was danced by Alexandre Orlov. \n\nPetrushka was designer Alexandre Benois' most important production. The ballet was frequently revived and between 1911 and 1957 Benois redrew the sets and costumes for 14 different productions. He would often inscribe later designs with the names of the dancers who created the roles, and as his designs are similar in style they can be difficult to date. The majority of the original drawings were annotated and signed in Russian.\n\nThis design is not for the first production and may have been made for the 1936 staging by the Ballet de Monte Carlo, first seen at the Alhambra Theatre in London, with Andre Eglevsky as the Blackamoor.",
