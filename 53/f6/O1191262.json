The company name was originally Chillproof, presumably alluding to the warmth of the garments produced. The name was later changed to Chilprufe. The company were well known for making high quality and good value adult and childrenswear, although Bolton originally specialised in woollen underclothes for children, like this sleep suit. \nThe company and its products were very much a reflection of high quality but mainstream tastes for much of the first 60 years of the 20th century. The company was bought out by Passolds, makers of the childrenswear label Ladybird in the 1960s and subsequently they were then bought out by the Coats Viyella Group.",
