Philotetes, a bearded male nude carved almost in the round, is seated on a tree trunk which rises from the platform. He faces to the left with his right leg extended across the relief and his right foot raised on the projecting step. With his left hand he clasps the tree trunk, and with his right, he fans the inflamed wound in his right calf with a bird's wing. In the left background are two columns and the entablature of a temple, and on the right is a tree, to which are tied a bow and  quiver full of arrows.",

The bow and arrows of Hercules are shown in the right background of the relief ; they were presented to Philoctetes or his father in return for lighting the funeral pyre of Hercules on Mount Oeta, and were later instrumental in effecting the fall of Troy. The popularity of this relief is reflected in the survival of three modified variants. These are in the Hermitage, the Palazzo Ducale at Mantua and a private collection in London. The basic composition of the relief is related to an antique cameo of the same subject, signed by the Hellenistic artist Boethos, while the figure itself is derived from the Belvedere Torso.\n\nMaclagan and Longhurst relate the present relief to to a number of others depicting heroes and heronies of antiquity presumed to have been made for Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. Pope-Hennessy dissmisses the claim that the group or any of its individual constituents was carved for Alfonso d'Este at Ferrara.",
