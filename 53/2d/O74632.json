The artist Peter Behrens (1868-1940) was a pioneer of Modern design and was known for his work for AEG, the German electrical company. He was an admired designer at the time. He was asked to create this poster for the Deutsche Werkbund. The organisation was founded by artists, manufacturers and designers who were committed to improving the standard of German product design. Unusually, Behrens chose to use a classical, though stylised, design for this impressive poster. The torch perhaps indicated that the group was lighting the way ahead for the collaboration between manufacturers and designers.",
