The donor was usually a prominent member of the community, which in country parishes often meant the local landowner. But gifts came from other sources too. Many were given by women, showing their active involvement with the church. Churchwardens also took pride in commissioning new silver and often contributed to the cost. Occasionally, gifts like Lord Hertford\u2019s chalice and flagon were made to win support for a political cause. \n\nNot all of these gifts were new. Old-fashioned domestic plate, often richly decorated with secular ornament, was welcomed and used for the service of communion or the collection of alms.\n\nPart of a set of silver-gilt altar plate consisting of two flagons, and a cup and paten presented by Elinor James with a crimson velvet altar cloth embroidered in silver with the sacred monogram 'IHS'",
