The Bedford Master took his name from two outstanding manuscripts made for John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford. John of Lancaster was the brother of Henry V (ruled 1413-22), who won the great victory of Agincourt against the French in 1415. The Bedford Master's style was widely practised in Paris. The Dunois Master appears to have adopted his painting style and models most closely.\n\nThe miniature on this leaf comes from a Book of Hours, a type of prayer book used by lay people. It shows scenes from the life of St Apollonia, a holy virgin who was martyred in Alexandria in Egypt during a local uprising against the Christians. Apollonia was seized and had all her teeth broken by the mob. They then erected a pile of faggots outside the city gates and threatened to burn her alive if she refused to repeat after them impious words. Apollonia sprang quickly into the fire and was burned to death.",
