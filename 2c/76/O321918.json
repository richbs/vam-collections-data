The finely carved ivory border helps date this set of panels to the end of the fourteenth century between 1380 and 1400 A.D. \n\nBefore entering the V&A collection this object was owned by Dr Meymar, a Turkish Bureaucrat who worked in Cairo between 1850 and 1869 A.D.  His collection was bought by the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum) in 1869. This collection formed the foundational collection of Mamluk art at the V&A.",
