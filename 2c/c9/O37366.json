It bears pencilled markings.\nThe background is white which blends into light yellow and then into lime green.\nThe Ford truck is a cab and trailer, red with a wide white stripe which narrows.  There is a thin red stripe on the top and bottom with a green and red stripe through the centre.  FERRARI is written in yellow of the side of the trailer, near the back, together with its trademark of a black horse within a white band.  Written along the side are various trademarks and names of companies associated with Ferrari - GOOD YEAR, AREXONS, KONI, MAGNET ARELLE, CHRONOGRAPH HEVER, SPEEDLINE, CHAMPION, AGIP.  The black horse mark is used on the front of the trailer within a crest of red, green and white stripes and on the side of the rig/cab.  There is the outline of a door in the centre of the trailer.  The tyres are red and black with silver hubs.\nThe vehicle is one which Ferrari used to transport its racing cars.",
