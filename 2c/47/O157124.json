As well as its tourist activities in Egypt, the firm was responsible for transferring the wounded from Alexandria to Cairo after the Battle of Tell al-Kabir in 1882, and in 1884-5 J.M. Cook directed the transportation up the Nile of the abortive British expedition to relieve General Gordon in Khartoum. Although the album itself is dated 1885 on the dedication page, it contains drawings dated 1875, 1882, and 1885, 1886 and 1887. For information on the subject matter of the drawings, see E.W. Lane, Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians, 1836.",
