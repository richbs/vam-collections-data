            "public_access_description": "John Gunter (born 1938) trained at Central School of Art and Design under Ralph Koltai before working at the Queen\u2019s Theatre, Hornchurch and the Bristol Old Vic.  In 1965 he became resident designer at the Royal Court where his style ranged from the stark minimalism of Edward Bond\u2019s Saved to social realism in Peter Gill\u2019s landmark revivals of D H Lawrence\u2019s coal-mining plays.\n\nJohn Gunter's international career began in 1970 with a residency at Zurich\u2019s Schauspielhaus.  He returned to head up the Theatre Design Department at Central School in the 1970s, meanwhile making his mark at the Royal Court, the Royal Shakespeare Company and Nottingham Playhouse.  His collaboration with director Richard Eyre at Nottingham led to a remarkable run of hits at the Royal National Theatre in the 1980s, starting with setting and costumes for The Beggar\u2019s Opera in the Cottesloe and the sensational neon-lit Guys and Dolls in the Olivier.  Gunter mastered the latter theatre for The Rivals directed by Peter Wood, with ingenious moveable houses mounted on trucks and panoramic vistas of Bath.  In Gogol\u2019s The Government Inspector, audiences adored the surreal setting: its sea of bureaucratic paperwork and huge portrait of the Tsar stole the show every night.\n\nOther major directors John Gunter has worked with include Peter Hall and Trevor Nunn, most notably the latter\u2019s Porgy and Bess at Glyndebourne in 1986, and Hamlet at the Old Vic in 2004 with Ben Whishaw in the title role.\n\nHis career now spanning five decades, Gunter continues to design classic and modern drama and, increasingly, opera for leading companies in the UK and abroad.  He won Best Designer award from SWET for Guys and Dolls(1982), and an Olivier for Best Designer with Wild Honey (1984).\n\nOn moving house in 2008 he kindly donated to the Museum six set models including this one - all of which he made himself.  To mark the occasion he was interviewed  by Geoffrey Marsh, Director of the V&A Theatre & Performance Department, in his studio before it was dismantled by the removers.  A copy of the interview is viewable in the Theatre & Performance Department's archive.",
