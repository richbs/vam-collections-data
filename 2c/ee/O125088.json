First exhibited Dublin 1809. Visited London with Francis Danby ARA 1813, returning there to live 1822. Exhibited 21 landscapes (several views around Dublin) at the RA between 1822 and 1840, 38 at the BI 1823-39, and 17 at the SBA 1829-1838. Visited Brussels 1826-7, Paris and Germany 1832-3. Health and eyesight declined; died Brompton, London, 7 January 1841; his studio sale was at Christie's 12 February 1842 (Art Union April 1845 made a financial appeal for his widow). Some of his works were exceptionally large; Bodkin proposed that his best paintings were on a smaller scale but seldom exhibited. S Redgrave (A Dictionary of Artists of the English School) in 1878 thought the landscapes 'boldly painted, show great feeling, and are good in tone and colour, but rather green', and Hutchinson in 1985 describes the artist as: \n\" \nUntil about ten years ago ... possibly the best loved of all Irish painters. This affection ... was not based on any real knowledge of his paintings, but on an affinity with the lyrical mood of his most common landscapes, which, it was widely believed, always included tiny figures wearing red waistcoats walking down country lanes on fine summer days. \nLIT: \tGentleman's Magazine March 1841, p329, June 1841, p666 (obit); Dublin Monthly Magazine April 1842; W G Strickland A Dictionary of Irish Artists, Il, 1913, pp179-82 (with engr self-portrait); T Bodkin Four Irish Landscape Painters 1920, pp17-28; James Arthur O'Connor centenary exhibition catalogue, Municipal Gallery of Modem Art, Dublin, 1941; A Crookshank 'Early Landscape Painters in Ireland' Country Life 24 August 1972, pp468-72; A Crookshank and the Knight of Glin The Painters of Ireland 1978, p209; J Hutchinson James Arthur O'Connor NGI, Dublin, 1985 \n\n\nLandscape, with Two Men Fishing (attributed to J A O'CONNOR) \n578-1870 Neg GB578 \nMillboard, 15.8 X 18.7 cm (6 \u00bc X 7 ? ins) Bequeathed by John Meeson Parsons 1870 \nMore l8th-century in style than O'Connor's mature works, both in composition and handling of paint, and in 1923 Basil Long made a tentative suggestion in the Departmental Files that it was painted by Alexander Nasmyth (1758--1840). It may be compared with the small oil sketch attributed to O'Connor and reproduced by Bodkin (pl X). \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
