It was finished in July 1968, but was not released until November as the record company would not allow the cover art to be produced; it featured a graffiti covered toilet wall. It was eventually replaced by a plain white cover featuring the band name, title and the letters RSVP. The inner artwork was still used, however, and featured this photograph taken by Michael Joseph from a series shot in Sarum Chase, a neo-Tudor mansion in West Hampstead, London, over the course of a weekend with the band.\n\nMichael Joseph was chosen by The Stones because they had seen his extensive advertising portfolio. Having photographed the Vietnam War while still at college, he went on to assignments for Nivea, Pirelli and Schweppes and worked in the fashion industry for Hart, Schaffner and Marks in Chicago.",
