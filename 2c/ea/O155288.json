The Museum Number is in the top right hand corner. This is a very wide trouser panel and it is probable that this type of trouser was worn over a padded pair for extra warmth. The pattern is large-scale and the embroidered fabric is soft and pliable.\nPieced: a slightly longer section has been added down the right hand side. The top edge has been cut through the embroidery. \nThe pattern is a series of black diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  \nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: [a] shades of light green ground with flowerheads in pink and red or pink and light blue.  This border is either side of:\\[b] a slightly wider band with a white ground with a large triangular pink flower, a blue flower outlined in dark red and a smaller blossom arranged as a meander on a chevron stem.\n[2] wider stripe: black ground with two diamond-shaped blocks of flowers: 9 white flowers outlined in red and a downward pointing spray of pink flowers outlined in green and dark green.\nThreads: white, black, light green, dark green, red, dark red, yellow, light blue, blue, orange, grey silk; 2S; dark blue cotton.",
