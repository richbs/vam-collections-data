Woollen pile upholstery textiles were very popular in the mid-19th century. This example and the two with which it is displayed depict highly fashionable floral subjects shown in popular colours. These include dispersed rose sprigs and morning glory in the shades of royal blue, drab and brown.\n\nThis was part of a group of examples exhibited in Class XIX (no. 79) of the Great Exhibition of 1851 by Robert Lees of Cheapside in London. The exhibition catalogue described Lees' products as 'printed mohair tapestry; Utrecht mohair velvet; mohair velvets; printed Chinese velvets of mohair etc.' These samples have not been displayed since the 1851 exhibition and their condition is as new. This clearly shows the brightness and clarity of colour used in furnishing the home at this time.",
