Manufactured by Knoll International since 1950. \u2018The Brno chair was one of a series designed for the Tugendhat house in Brno, Czechoslovakia in 1930. Now a classic modern interior. Mies designed most of the interior including light fixtures etc, incorporating the arrangement of furniture into the overall design.\u2019 See P.Johnson, Mies van der Rohe, New York 1947. H.T. Cadbury-Brown, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Architectural Association Journal, July-August 1959. From the same house Mies designed the \u2018Tugenfhat\u2019 chair in white vellum or pig skin, a couch of similar design, and a coffee table supported on a cross of flat chromium plated steel bars. \n\nNotes on object from: Hollis, R. 1970. Modern Chairs:1918-1970. The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London\n\"\u2018The chair was one of a series designed for the Tugendhat house in Brno, Czechoslovakia. The fame of this house, Mies\u2019s best-known design after the Barcelona Pavilion, rests largely on the handling of space and the use of materials in the living-dining area, now a classic modern interior. The elegance of this room derives not only from its size and the simple beauty of its design, but from the contrast of rich materials and the exquisite perfection of details. With a scrupulousness unparalleled in our day, Mies personally designed every visible element even to the lighting fixtures, the curtain track holders and the heating pipes. Equally unusual is the unique manner in which he has incorporated the arrangement of furniture into the overall design. The relation of one piece of furniture to another, of one group to another, and of the groups to the walls and partitions is so carefully calculated as to seem inevitable. No other important contemporary architect cares so much about placing furniture. Mies gives as much thought to placing chairs in a room as other architects do to placing buildings around a square.\u2019 Phillip C. Johnson: Mies Van Der Rohe, New York 1947\"",
