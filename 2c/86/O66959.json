Lorenzi was also a graphic artist known for his fashion plates. Here he depicts fashionably dressed women surrounded by flowers. The silk manufacturers Bianchini-F\u00e9rier were known for their innovative and lively fabrics in bright colours. Lyon was famous for its silk industry, which had flourished since the 1500s. It was a major producer of luxury goods for a worldwide market. This was an era when the French government actively promoted this sector, since they sought to establish French design as the foremost in Europe.\n\nIn 1909 Charles Bianchini, one of the partners in the firm, had visited Vienna, a leading city for textile design. He subsequently established an office in Paris. This enabled him to cultivate good relations with the top Parisian couturiers, such as Lanvin, Patou and Poiret, who all bought dress fabrics from him. He also employed chic illustrators such as Paul Iribe (1883-1935), Charles Martin (1848-1934) and Georges Barbier (1882-1932) to design textiles for the firm.",
