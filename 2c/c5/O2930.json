The V&A collections include a similar example, datable to about 1676-7 and marked with the raven's head seal of the English glassmaker George Ravenscroft (1632-1681).\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe form of this small ale mug was not so much designed as inherited from its larger imported German brown stoneware predecessors. Just as drinking glasses had lost most of their Venetian influence by 1700, so these little German-derived globular mugs disappeared at the same time, to be replaced by the typically English 'dwarf ale', a small trumpet-shaped glass which, apart from its distinctive short stem, could be confused with a jelly glass.",
