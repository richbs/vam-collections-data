It consists of five slides set with pastes and decorated on the back with painted enamel, of the kind used in aristocratic jewellery in the 17th century, and which survived in provincial jewellery, in some regions such as Sicily, into the 18th century. The Abruzzi is a remote and mountainous area of central Italy, which was formerly part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nThis earring was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.  It clearly demonstrates that re-use of bits of old jewellery is not purely a modern phenomenon.",
