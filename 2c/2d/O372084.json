The sheet is softened in an air oven at approximately 165 degrees centigrade. A pneumatic ram with a small rectangular plate is pressed into the sheet, leaving the shape visible in the lowest point of the seat. The re-formed sheet is then hand stretched to fit onto the metal frame and attached with clips. This process leaves the original surface undisturbed, so that no finishing is required (which would be needed in a chair moulded in a former). The compound curves \u2013 forming seat, back and armrests \u2013 produce an exceptionally strong seating membrane. Unlike most plastic chairs the edge is flat and does not curve round the frame. The shell rests on a steel-rod frame which is made of one trapezoid shape for the back, and a rectangle for the seat connected to front legs which extend into a trapezoid form open at the front as base. The individual frame elements are welded together and also clamped along the bottom and top edges of the seat and also along the base where the two frame elements meet. The seat is held to the frame by the three clamps along the seat edges. Those steel clamps are welded to the frame (the back one concealing a weld in the frame).",

            "public_access_description": "In 1926 the modernist designer Marcel Breuer predicted that in the future it would be possible to sit on air, a prediction suggestively fulfilled by David Colwell's transparent Contour Chair. As a consultant for ICI Plastic Division, Colwell designed it to capitalise on the properties of acrylic. The bubble-like seat was produced by firing a pneumatic ram into a heated sheet of acrylic and allowing it to cool. \n\nPlastic helped create the fashionable futuristic space-age interiors of the day, and clear plastic was also used for inflatable furniture. The most famous example was the Blow chair from Italy, which literally used air pressure to support its sitter. The Contour chair was not produced in great numbers but is a good example of Pop design from the late 1960s that celebrated the use of new materials and unusual, sometimes improbable, forms. Furniture was to be fun, mobile and in most cases ultimately disposable.",

The chair was the result of a two year involvement with ICI Plastics for whom Colwell also designed a reception desk and a number of jewellery showcases lit by fibre optics. All objects explored free forming Perspex sheet without moulds. Rectangular shapes were plunged into hot acrylic sheet, self-creating subtle contours whilst increasing strength and preserving optical clarity due to the absence of mould contact. Mouldless forming meant that Colwell could produce impressive designs without prohibited tooling costs. \nThe chair was produced in a clear, smoke (like this one) and blue acrylic shell. the design received the RCA Silver Medal as well as the ICI Perspex Design Award. To celebrate his company (Trannon) 30th anniversary, Colwell released a limited run of the Contour chair in 2008.\n\nDescription of Craftsman from Hollis, R. 1970. Modern Chairs:1918-1970.
