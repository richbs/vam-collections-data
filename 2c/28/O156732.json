            "public_access_description": "Andirons, or fire dogs, supported the logs in a fireplace. They were normally made of brass or iron, and silver ones were a great luxury. It is not known who originally owned this example (one of a pair), but in the 19th century they belonged to the Duke of Sussex, brother of George IV. He altered their design and added the lions at the bottom.\n\nLarge sculptural objects for display had long been an important feature of aristocratic and princely silver. But in Restoration England many commented with disapproval upon the extravagance of the latest fashion (imported from France) for massive silver furniture, chandeliers, wine cisterns and other heavy types of plate. Impressive and monumental Baroque silver of this kind had a particular appeal for Arthur Gilbert.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
