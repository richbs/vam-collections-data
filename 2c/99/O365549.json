The names given to the weavers were, presumably, well-known among linen weavers of the time. Few such books have survived but the terminology resembles weaving draft books which have survived in the USA. A comparison could be fruitful.\n\nThe book had belonged to the donor's aunt Miss Lilian Harris, who was interested in spinning and weaving and joined a group of weavers (possibly the Guild of Weavers Spinners and Dyers, West Kent Branch?). Miss Harris died in 1971 and the book was found among other items of interest to weavers in a case. This case had belonged to the previous tenant of Miss Harris' house, Miss Mary Somerville. The house had belonged to a Mrs Heron Maxwell, also a weaver. The family assumed that the book had belonged either to Miss Somerville or Mrs Maxwell. None of these people had any connection with any family named Palmer or with Ashby-de-la-Zouche.",
