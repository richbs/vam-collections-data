This example is entirely typical.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWith the influence of Chinese porcelain fading fast in the early 19th century, manufacturers of printed earthenware needed fresh design sources. Popular prints seemed ideal for popular tablewares, and with the publication in 1807 of Captain Thomas Williamson's Oriental Field Sports, Wild Sports of the East illustrated by Samuel Howitt (previously issued from 1805 in 20 monthly instalments), the Spode factory found a perfect new source. The great success of this series of prints on Spode tableware led to other manufacturers copying the same designs, which were free of copyright restrictions.\n\nTime\nThe British had been vigorously extending their power and influence in India since the mid-18th century, and after peace was restored in Europe in 1815 following the decisive battle of Waterloo, public interest began to turn once more towards the expanding British Empire. Prints such  these, which derived from 'on the spot' drawings by British artists and soldiers living in India, and which showed both British and Indian sportsmen hunting game together, did much to stimulate  curiosity about the sub-continent and its cultural life.",
