Reynolds, in his Discourses, described it as an 'excellent art' but stressed that the highest ambition of the still life painter could only be 'to give a minute representation of every part of those low objects which he sets before him'. The painter of still life was thus relegated to the role of copyist, and denied the respect accorded to those who united imaginative power with technical skill. Flower painting was readily assimilated to the decorative and in fact Moser painted an entire room (at Frogmore House, Windsor, one of the royal residences) with naturalistic floral motifs for Queen Charlotte. Moser, like Kauffmann, was later to exhibit history pictures at the RA, but it is on the more stereotypically feminine flower pieces that her reputation rests.",
