The donor  writes: This is the issue widely claimed to have  initiated the events which ultimately brought down the  Berlin Wall. Environmental protesters, active since  1984, gradually built popular support and eroded the  Hungarian Government's grip on the country. In 1988 100 000 people demonstrated to protect the Danube -  unprecedented in a Communist country and it was beyond  the powers of state and police to disperse them. The government reacted by stopping work on the  Hungarian side of the project to defuse the growing  protest movement but within a month (September '89)  East German tourists flowed into Hungary, camped in the West German Embassy grounds, refusing to move until  given Western visas. When several hundred had gathered, the foreign minister Gyula Hom (elected prime minister  in May '94) ordered the borders open and let the East  Germans into Austria (ie. the West). On 10 November '89 the Berlin Wall fell as Gorbachev had told the East  Germans that \"when 200 000 of your citizens have left  the country via Hungary, the game is up.\"",
