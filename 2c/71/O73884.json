The drapery of the mantle shows crumpled folds with gently curved borders. The mantle is caught up under her left hand and falls in a tubular fold; she holds a book in her left hand and turns the page with her right. \nThe figure is carved from one piece of wood; several holes have been drilled into the back, which has been flattened and hollowed out. Three wedges of wood have been inserted into the front edge of the base. A label is attached to the back with the number '363' and the present inventory number written in ink. The face  shows several layers of naturalistic flesh tones with red on the cheeks and lips, which are partially rubbed off. Craquelure is visible on the painted surface of the hands. The hair is painted light brown. The gown and sleeves have gilded borders, and were silvered under a green glaze; this has deteriorated and has been repainted in green. Two holes are drilled into the border of the gown over the chest, probably for ornamental buttons. The gilded mantle is glazed with translucent yellow. The protruding shoe and the base are overpainted in blue and green respectively. The crown was made separately and fitted into a ridge on the head. Part of the crown was broken away and restored in the Museum with coloured plaster in 1910 (Departmental records). The centre of the cresting is now missing.",
