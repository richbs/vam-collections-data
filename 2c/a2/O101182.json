The body is composed of four hull like sections which have been combined and twisted to allude to a rowing scull moving through the water.  The crest of the rim rises to four points, equally spaced, enclosing a small, central, circular cavity.  The body is bolted to the base.  The external surfaces are highly polished while the interior is given a satin finish.",

This annual competition, organised by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, London, began in 1994.  It encourages the design of studio silver as part of the Company\u2019s objective to promote excellence of design combined with dexterity of craftsmanship.  The award is open to any student under 30 in the United Kingdom on an undergraduate or postgraduate degree course.\n\nThe design brief for 2003 was for a sporting trophy, to be contemporary and any size.  The award provides experience of making a commission for a national collection in a leading workshop.  Sang-Hyeob Lee, a second year South Korean student from the London Institute Camberwell College of Arts, had the opportunity of beginning his piece under the watchful, expert eyes of Richard Fox  and John Cutbush in the workshop of  Richard Fox in  London.  The finished sporting trophy was presented to the Victoria & Albert Museum on November 11th, 2003.",
