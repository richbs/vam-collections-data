It was Stravinsky's second ballet for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and used a story of traditional street puppets, the Russian equivalent of Punch and Judy, who are brought to life by a showman. The first performance was given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, in 1911. \n\nPetrushka was designer Alexandre Benois' most important production. The ballet was frequently revived and between 1911 and 1957 Benois redrew the sets and costumes for 14 different productions. Although the details varied, a constant feature of the sets was the false proscenium that framed the action. The ballet's first and final scenes take place in Admiralty Square and the main picture in this rough sketch shows the fairground booths and, at the rear, the tall spire of the Admiralty building.",
