To the right of the Virgin's head is a damaged inscription: <i>MAPIA</i> (Maria) and a star. The remains of the ox and ass to the far right, above the raised cribb which presumably contained the Christ Child. The left side is bounded by a spirally-fluted column and along the top is a straight band with a row circles enclosing conventional blossoms.",

The choice and disposition of the subject reflect both the tradition of late Roman art and the newer innovations taking place in the Eastern Roman Empire. The couch on which the Virgin reclines and her comfortable pose are those of many a Roman matron and the rectangular form of the scene is reminiscent of the side of a sarcophagus, even to the columns at the corners. In the eastern tradition angels attended the Nativity rather than simply appearing to the shepherds in the fields, according to the second-century <i>Protevangelium</i> of James and the fourth-century Gospel of Nicodemus. In this tradition the Nativity takes place in a cave illuminated by a star which can just be seen before the damaged inscription.\nFrom the Major Myers collection.",
