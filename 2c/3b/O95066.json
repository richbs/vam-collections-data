The dish was bought directly from the manufacturer for \u00a340 in 1864. We do not know why it was made, or for whom, but its scale and subject suggest that it may have been conceived of as an exhibition piece, perhaps for the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855. British journalists singled out Wi\u00e8se for praise at that exhibition. The Post had this to say: \u2018Jules Wi\u00e8se is an artist of very exquisite taste. His Renaissance cups are perfection, and every object in his stall displays a thorough knowledge of middle-age art\u2019. The Museum may have acquired the dish from him at this exhibition.\n\nWi\u00e8se was trained in Berlin by the court goldsmith J. G. Hossauer. In 1839 he came to Paris to work for F. D. Froment-Meurice, one of the most eminent jewellers and goldsmiths. By 1844 he had set up on his own, although he still continued to work for Froment-Meurice. The Exhibition of 1855 was the first at which he exhibited in his own right. He won a Medal of Honour at the Universal Exhibition in London in 1862. His work was described as \u2018of the highest merit, both in design and execution; principally of oxidised silver, and not costly, although admirable as examples of pure Art\u2019.\n\nThe medals of the kings on the dish mainly date from 1839\u201340. Armand-Auguste Caqu\u00e9's series of medals of the kings of France was well known, under the title Galerie numismatique des Rois de France. It was exhibited at the Paris Salons from 1836 to 1839. Bovy was a Swiss national who lived in Paris. He seems to have filled in the gaps in the series.",

Wi\u00e8se was trained in Berlin by the court goldsmith J.G. Hossauer, but came to Paris in 1839 to work for F.D. Froment-Meurice, one of the most eminent jewellers and goldsmiths. By 1844 he had set up on his own, although continuing to work for Froment-Meurice, but the 1855 Exhibition was the first at which he exhibited in his own right. Wi\u00e8se won medals at exhibitions in 1849, 1851 and 1855. His reputation was confirmed at the 1862 Universal Exhibition in London, where he won a Medal of Honour, his work being described as \"of the highest merit, both in design and execution; principally of oxydised silver, and not costly, although admirable as examples of pure Art.\"\n\nThe medals of the kings on the dish mainly date from 1839-1840. Armand-Auguste Caqu\u00e9's series of medals of the kings of France was well known, under the title \"Galerie numismatique des Rois de France\", and had been exhibited at the Paris Salons from 1836-1839. Bovy, a Swiss national who lived in Paris, seems to have filled the gaps in the series.",
