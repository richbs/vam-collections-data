            "public_access_description": "The S\u00e8vres porcelain painter, Andr\u00e9-Vincent Vielliard might have seen the dramatic  incident depicted on this cup and saucer himself.  On 2nd March 1784, the pioneering  aeronaut, Jean-Pierre Blanchard, brought his hydrogen gas balloon down only a  short distance from S\u00e8vres in the rue de S\u00e8vres in Billancourt.  He had taken off  from the Champ de Mars in Paris and intended to fly to La Villette, however the  wind blew him south-west towards S\u00e8vres.  His daring exploits caused a  sensation as this was only the third time Parisians had witnessed such an event:  the first successful manned balloon flight had taken place on 21st November 1783, when Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes took off from the palace of  Versailles in a hot air balloon made by the Montgolfier brothers. The first manned  hydrogen balloon flight had taken place on 1st December 1783, when Professor  Jacques Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert ascended from the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris.\n\tIt is not surprising that a number of tea wares painted with this subject are known, as the balloon flights sparked a veritable mania for ballooning and S\u00e8vres  responded by creating the equivalent of modern-day souvenirs, albeit for well- heeled customers.  Ballooning scenes were also painted on fans and snuff boxes  and influenced fashion with puffed skirts and sleeves and even special hairstyles.",
