On the right it is possible to make out the prow of a ship, it is blurred because of its movement during the long exposure time needed to take a photograph with a early paper negative or calotype. There are also areas of 'fog' in the foreground and on the bridge caused by the movement of people and horse drawn vehicles, which could only be photographed if they kept still. \n\nCalvert Jones began to experiment with photography from the moment the new art was announced in 1839. He became closely connected with its British inventor, W.H. Fox Talbot through relatives and friends who lived near Jones' home in South Wales.",

In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nThis is the second occasion on which Calvert Jones photographed the drawbridge at Broad Quay: a few years earlier, he had used a smaller camera from the same viewpoint. (The two calotype negatives in the Science Museum Collection, 1937-3055 and 1937-3056, overlap to form a panorama.) The juxtaposition of the foreground and bridge lead the eye to the white buildings on the far side of the dock, where there is a glazed photographer's portrait studio roof  on the top of the central building.",
