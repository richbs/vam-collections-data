It is almost an exact copy of the one made in 1619 for St. Mary Abbots, Kensington.\n\nHistorical significance: The set is an important illustration of the liturgical reforms put in place by Archbishop Laud and Bishop Lancelot Andrewes during the 1620s and 1630s.",

Like his contemporary Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, he regarded the Anglican church as a purified form of traditional Catholicism. Together they set out to restore the ceremonial that had been abolished with the Reformation of the previous century, including the high altar and the use of candles and incense.\n\nLaud's intentions, however, were seen by Parliament as an attempt to overthrow the Protestant religion and in 1645 he was beheaded. It was not until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that churches could again use a Gothic chalice and celebrate the Eucharist with an elaborately chased and decorated communion set.",
