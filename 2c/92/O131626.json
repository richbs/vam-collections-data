This technique was formerly most often used together with (karami ori) to weave lightweight summer kimono and sashes.  Though today only a few craftspersons remain who can still produce this finely detailed work; and fewer still who can craft the rippled reeds for the loom.  At Nuno, we used the tools of their trade to make soft silk scarves.  A contribution, we hope, to preserving an endangered art.'\nReason For Production: Retail",
