Studies of clouds and sun taken between 1927 and 1936.\nThe following is an abstract from \"Alfred Stieglitz's photography of clouds ('Equivalents') by Sarah Eden Greenough, a PhD dissertation from the University of New Mexico: \"In 1922 Alfred Stieglitz made 10 photographs of clouds, thus beginning a series of photographs that occupied his attention for the next eight years. The Equivalents, as he came to call them, have been hailed as his most important contribution to photography. His aim was not to distill the essence of clouds but to transform them into an abstract language of form expressive of his feelings.\"\nIn \"Alfred Stieglitz & Lake George. The American Place\", <u>History of Photography</u>, Summer 1991, Graham Clarke suggests that the Equivalents represented for Stieglitz \"A spiritual continuum untouched by 'the hand of man'\".",
