Straight lace made in three horizontal bands mostly in cloth work tapes with wheat-ear fillings, and mesh and spider fillings, and linking bars. The Maltese crosses with which the flounce is decorated are of cloth stitch. \n\nDelicately patterned with narrow continuous curving tapes which form two rows, one large and one small, of paisley cone motifs placed back to back to create a series of compartments, each containing a Maltese cross. Between the main motifs are elongated leaf shapes and flower heads with wheat-ears fillings. The lower scalloped border is decorated with clusters of leaves and round flowerheads and is outlined with a row of linked roundels. The top edge is scalloped and was probably originally joined to a further band of lace. Pattern repeat of large cones 7.25 inches (18.5 cms).",
