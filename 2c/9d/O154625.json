Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nLaurent Rivaud's jewellery is generally themed around the fashion collections he designs for. He often creates a new narrative with found objects which he combines with traditional jewellery materials and techniques.  \n\nRivaud, the French jewellery designer for Vivienne Westwood, brings a flamboyant approach to social comment with his bright and bold collage-like brooch incorporating gun cartridges. He has also worked for the fashion houses Chloe, Givenchy and Thierry Mugler.",
