They were mainly worn by urban women, rather than tribal people.  They were originally always worn in pairs, one on each wrist, and in some places were regarded as the mark of a married woman.  They were worn by Christian and Jewish women, as well as Muslims.  The double pin, opening on each side of the fastening, is characteristic of bracelets of this kind from the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe elegant workmanship ensured that they were as popular with tourists in the 19th century as with natives, and similar bracelets are still being made in the region today.",
