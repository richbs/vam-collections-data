They were often matched with a mirror and a pair of candlestands, as here. Carved and gilded pier furniture was often made to match other interior decorative features.\n\nPlace\nThe rustic caryatids (supports in the form of sculptured figures) which carry the table top match those flanking the mirror, and may have been inspired by the borders of the 16th-century Brussels tapestries illustrating the 'Story of Cyrus'. These hung in the Tapestry Room at Hinton House in Hampshire. Their borders were embellished with caryatids, allegorical figures and groups of birds.\n\nDesign & Designing\nLike the matching mirror, the table design was also inspired by French prints in books of designs, such as J.B. Toro's Livre de Table de diverses formes of about 1716 and Nicholas Pineau's Nouveau desseins de Pieds de Tables (1737). Pineau's designs were reissued in London by  William Jones in The Gentlemens' and Builders' Companion (1739) and by Batty Langley in The City and Country Builder's and Workman's Treasury of Designs (1740). Matthias Lock (born about 1710; died 1765) understood the Rococo idiom (a style imported from France) more fully than any other English furniture designer.\n\nMaterials & Making\nLock worked on the table for 15 days, and was probably responsible for the carving, which cost \u00a321. The joiner's costs came to \u00a322 5s 5d.",
