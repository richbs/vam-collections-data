Dell served his apprenticeship in Hanau before working as a silversmith in Dresden while being trained at the Kunstgewerbeschule under Henri Van de Velde.  After military service in the first world war, he worked for Emil Lettr\u00e9 in Berlin before joining the Bauhaus in 1922 where he was head of the metal workshop until 1925, working closely with L\u00e1sl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy.  Unlike many of his Bauhaus colleagues, he did not reject historicism entirely and yet nonetheless, his silver during his period at the Bauhaus  is strongly geometrical in character.  From 1926 until 1933, he taught at the Frankfurt Art School as well as design several light fittings for industrial mass production.  He was removed from his teaching post in 1933 by the Nazi government and later set up his own jewellery business in Wiesbaden.",
