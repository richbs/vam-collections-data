            "public_access_description": "Mirka Rozmus is an Australian weaver who specialises in creating unique hand woven silk scarves. Originally trained as a classical violinist, Rozmus ran her own Design Studio in Sydney creating couture garments from her hand woven fabrics. She gave up her musical career in 2002 to concentrate on weaving full time.\n\nRozmus trained under Peter Townley, also a musician, who ran a weaving course at the Tasmanian School of Art, before moving to Sydney in 1984. Every year she travels to Kyoto in Japan to purchase the traditionally hand dyed silks from which she weaves limited edition scarves. She uses the traditional method of handweaving, working on an eight shaft, foot powered jack loom; this is a lengthy and precise method of handweaving as the warp alone may contain over 2,000 fine silk threads. Rozmus weaves only two or three scarves per warp and never reproduces an original design. Each finished scarf is individually named and allocated an 'archival number' before being rolled on a hand made silk covered roller, wrapped in Japanese paper and placed in a box, also designed by Rozmus and hand made in Kyoto.\n\nUber Cool was inspired by a trip to New York and the interior of Grand Central Station. Dazzled by the polished marble, the expensive food hall and retail outlets, Rozmus was also aware of the impersonal and soul-less reality of urban living. Uber Cool also references the start designs of Kenneth Cole and the monumental structures of metal, steel and concrete. The warp series was a prototype for a 'men's series' of scarves, the use of a monochrome colour palette evokes the feeling of the big City.",
