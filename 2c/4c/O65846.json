            "public_access_description": "This wax figurine of a nude female body is ascribed to Giambolgona.\nTHe technique of modelling and the reddish coulour of the material point to a Florentine origine of the late 16th century. The model first appeared in England in the early 19th century. Its small scale , the torsion of the body, and the implied directions of the limbs suggest that it may be meant to be complementary to a well-known type of small bronze figurine from Giambologna's workshop, the 'Woman Bathing'. This delicate model may also be one of Giambologna's stock from his earlier career in Florence when he was most prolific.\n\nBorn in Flanders Giovanni Bologna (1524-1608), or short Giambologna went to Rome to study antique sculpture from about 1550 to 1553. He then travelled through Florence where he was persuaded to stay. He became sculptor to the Medici family and thus became one of the most influential sculptors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He drew attention to many artists  from Northern Europe and disseminated his style mainly through small bronzes. He established an efficient and large workshop.\n\nBy c. 1570 Giambologna had become the most influential sculptor in Europe; apart from the fame that his monumental statues in Florence inevitably brought, his style was disseminated in the form of small bronze reproductions of his masterworks, or statuettes, which he composed independently as elegant ornaments for the interior. These were used by the Medici as diplomatic gifts for friendly heads of state, and were also eagerly purchased by European collectors as examples of sophisticated Florentine design. They were especially favoured in Germany and the Low Countries and were prominently illustrated in paintings of fashionable gallery interiors there.\nFor compositional subtlety, sensuous tactile values and sheer technical virtuosity, Giambologna\u2019s work is virtually unequalled in any period or country.",
