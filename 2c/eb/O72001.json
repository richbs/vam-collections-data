He became an enthusiast, experimenting with many of the techniques, particularly those of relief printmaking. He was also influenced by his visits to the inventive teacher and engraver S. W. Hayter, who ran a famous studio workshop - Atelier 17 - in Paris. This is one of  Rothenstein's earliest prints, commissioned by the Artists International Association to celebrate the Festival of Britain planned for the following year. Poultry were a common feature of life in post-war Britain: even in cities many people kept them for a supply of fresh eggs. The cock appears frequently in Rothenstein's work, often symbolising conflict between the countryside and encroaching industrial and urban development.",
