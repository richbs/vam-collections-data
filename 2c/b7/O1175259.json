It shows a full length image of a woman in a costume loosely inspired by Russian 'peasant dress'. She is dressed in a loosly fitting jacket which finishes just above her hips. The jacket has cream sleeves and dark navy front panels bounds with three leaf green bands at the hem and centre front and cuffs. The sleeves are also patterned with delicate navy patterns at the side of the sleeves. Her skirt is dark navy with a wide red band at the hem. Over her skirt she wears a narrow cream apron with a red panel at the top and decorated with delicate motifs in red, navy and blue at the base and with a green/gold band at the edge. She also wears a tall red hat with a navy band at the base. Over this she wears a wide leaf green scarf patterned with darker green spots and with a wide dark green band decorated with delicate dark blue motifs at the base. The design is signed Comelli and dated 1921. \n\nThe borders of design are bound in a transparent gauze which is pinned in place. A hand drawn chart detailing the measurements of the actress for whom the costume was intended is pinned to the rear.",

There follows a case of mistaken identity in which Sybil is thought to be the wife of the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke goes along with this deception and his wife pretends to be Sybil. The Grand Duchess then becomes attracted to Petrov and the Grand Duke tries to attack him. After much confusion everyone's true identity is revealed and the play ends happily.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis production of the play opened at Daly's Theatre, London on 19th February 1921.",
