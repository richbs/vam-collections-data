The sticks are often decorated by extremely intricate piercing and carving, creating an illusion of filigree work or lace. The sticks on this fan, with their serrated tips, display a strong Chinese influence. Many fan sticks were produced in China for import into Europe.\n\nOn this fan the maker has left an area of the central fan sticks solid to carry a painted vignette. The scene is a music lesson in a garden setting, and there is a suggestion of romance between the man playing and woman signing.  Fans were often associated with flirtation and scenes of pastoral dalliance were a popular subject for their decoration. This fan is further decorated with small painted medallions in imitation of blue jasper ware cameos.",
