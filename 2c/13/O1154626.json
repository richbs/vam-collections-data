The jigsaw puzzles that we know today were not created until the introduction in the 1870s of the jigsaw itself, a machine with which an irregular pattern could be cut. Puzzle pieces would have come with a box, usually with a guide picture on the lid.\n\nThis puzzle however, is slightly more simple as it only contains six large pieces. They are not in the traditional jigsaw shape and connect by fitting the curves of the cut together. The picture on the front is a photograph, perhaps of someone the maker knew. Today, it is easy to have your own digital images made into puzzles by uploading them to websites which will produce it for you.",
