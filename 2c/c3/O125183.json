His work is reminiscent, particularly in early years, of that of the watercolourist and lithographer Thomas Shotter Boys. Wood exhibited at numerous institutions throughout his career, including the New Watercolour Society, at which he exhibited over 200 works, and the Royal Academy. In all he showed 40 works at the Royal Academy, most of which were architectural subjects. For many years he also exhibited English landscape paintings at Burlington House. Wood became an associate of New Society of Painters in Watercolours in 1866, gaining full membership in 1870. He rescinded this in 1888 having exhibited for the last time at the Society the year before. \n\nWood first visited the Continent in 1836 in an expedition that proved inspiring, and for the rest of his career the small towns and villages of Belgium, Normandy and Brittany became the primary subjects of his work. \n\nThis work illustrates Wood\u2019s interest in architecture, particularly that of Northern Europe. This scene has been tentatively been identified as Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. In this painting the artist accentuates the quaint and rustic qualities of the architecture, probably to appeal to a British market. \n\nSources:\n\nH.L.
