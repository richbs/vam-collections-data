The bust is fixed to a circular turned ivory socle. The girl is shown with long hair, facing slightly to her left, with a pensive expression. It could conceivably be thought to represent Eve, rather than being a portrait.\n\nThe donor was a Shakespearean actor and scholar (1852-1934) (see http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/465863/William-Poel). \n\nDelves Molesworth wrote to R.P. Bedford, the Keeper of Sculpture in a memo of 21 September 1931, 'This bust was left by Mr. Pole on 13th Sep..  ... he seemed very distressed that the piece should not even be considered ... The bust is signed \"Carved by C. Cooper\" and may possibly be a Mrs. M.C. Cooper who is quoted by Thieme-Becker as having exhibited  ... at the R.A. in 1880, 1883-4.'  Mrs Mary Cuthbert Cooper did exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1880, 1883 and 1884, though there are no recorded works by her of ivory, and so the identity of 'C. Cooper' remains uncertain.",
