            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe tea table was first introduced in the late 17th century. Elizabeth Maitland, Duchess of Lauderdale (died 1698), had 'a Tea-Table carved and guilt' in her Private Closet at Ham House near the Thames at Richmond in 1679. Around 1700, over 6,000  lacquered tea tables were imported through the East India Company.  By the mid-18th century, London furniture makers produced their own alternative form for the luxury market in mahogany embellished with brass inlay. Today, 34 such tables are recorded.\n\nPeople\nTea was still served to people of quality, although as prices fell it became a more popular drink. In 1745 it was noted that 'the tea-table costs more to support than would maintain two children at nurse'. This table is attributed to Frederick Hintz (died 1772), who settled in London and worked at the sign of The Porcupine, Newport Street, Leicester Fields. His stock in 1738 included mahogany tea tables, tea chests and tea boards.\n\nDesign & Designing\nFrom 1730, some of the most luxurious furniture was decorated with brass inlay. The use of mother-of-pearl as well as brass inlay is described in an advertisement of Hintz's stock in 1738. The anthropomorphic legs of this table are rare, possibly inspired by Dutch prototypes.",
