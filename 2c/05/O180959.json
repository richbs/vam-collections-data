He stands in a contrapposto (slightly twisted) pose wearing Roman armour under a draped cloak, with close-cropped hair in the antique style. Rysbrack's models are often, as here, highly finished, and this terracotta closely resembles the lifesize marble for which it was a study.\n\nRysbrack (1694-1770) was born in Antwerp, and trained in the Netherlands, but spent his working life in Britain. He was one of the most important sculptors active in this country in the first half of the 18th century, and specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments. Although he never visited Italy, many of his works are clearly indebted to classical archetypes. His terracotta models are particularly fine, and are often virtually finished pieces in their own right.",

Hildburgh F.S.A. and on loan from him to the Museum from 17 June 1953. Given to the Museum by Dr. Hildburgh in December 1953, and registered as the first objet acquired in 1954 by the Department of Architecture and Sculpture, later Sculpture Department. Hildburgh's enthusiasm in regularly offering as a gift the first object of the year to be accessioned by the Department of Architecture and Sculpture is commented upon by Leigh Ashton in his letter of thanks to Dr Hildburgh for the gift of the present piece.",
