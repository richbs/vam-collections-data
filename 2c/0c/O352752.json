The silk has decorative icons (trees, birds, beetle, floral shapes - white, blue, green, yellow) running down the band, on a red background. On either side are two borders. The inner border is in blue, white and green and is a row of a repeated floral shape. The outer border has connecting red short crosses/trefoils on a white background. The bands are stained and there are some holes.  The linen onto which the bands were once sewn is of weft-loop pile. The silk was once stitched on either side and along the centre of the band, probably with a linen thread (s-spun), most of which is missing. The linen is stained and with holes. 818-1903 is not attached to linen.",
