The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nPolitically, the Action Alliance was further left than the parties associated with the citizen's movement and continued to follow Marxist theories. They still claimed that reform could be managed within the GDR and resisted 'annexation' to West Germany. With this attitude the party stood alone against the tide of political opinion in favour of reunification.  \nThe poster asks the voter to consider the policies of the parties contesting the election rather than 'punishing' the Left in the ballot box for its associations with the comminist government before 1989. The poster's intentionally 'primitive' style echoes the paintings of the Neue Wilden (New Fauves) in West Germany. \n\nAction Alliance United Left was an electoral alliance formed in February 1990 between Die Nelken (The Carnations) a small Marxist party founded on the 13th of January 1990 and Vereinigte (United Left).  They sought a renewal of socialism in the context of a market economy with worker participation in decision making.",
