            "history_note": "The bust, evidently part of a wall monument, was said to have been purchased from the convent of Santa Lucia delle Botteghe Oscure in Rome (demolished 1938). \nIt is stylistically similar to that of the monuments of Faustina Ginnasi (died 1646), originally within Santa Lucia and now transferred to the chapel within the Palazzo Ginnasi, Rome. It was ascribed by an early source to Cosimo (1618-1688) and Giacomo Antonio (1619-1671) Fancelli.Both brothers trained with Bernini and assisted him on a number of major commissions. Several portrait busts by Cosimo Fancelli exist in Rome, dating from between 1660-1680. Based upon this evidence, this bust has tentatively been identified as Caterina Ginnasi (1590-1660), the daughter of Faustina (Martinelli, 1956, p. 32).\nCaterina was a painter of religious altarpieces who trained with Gaspare Celio and Giovanni Lanfranco. Eschewing marriage, she lived at the convent of Santa Lucia which may explain the veil worn by the sitter. After her uncle\u2019s death she dedicated herself to religious initiatives (Melasecchi, Olga,  \u2018Caterina Ginassi\u2019 <u>Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani</u>, Vol. 55, 2001). Caterina was buried in the chapel of S. Biagio in the family church at the foot of the tombs of both her mother and uncle, the art patron, Cardinal Domenico Ginassi (Brunelli, Giampiero,  \u2018Domenico Ginassi\u2019 <u>Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani</u>, Vol. 55, 2001; also see Dombrowski, Damian, 'Addenda to the Work of Giuliano Finelli' , <u>The Burlington Magazine,</u> Vol., 14, No. 1149, (Dec. 1998), pp.824-828).",
