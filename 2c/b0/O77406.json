As a result small, light versions of the fashionable civilian sword, known as a small sword were often worn by boys, especially on formal occasions.  This is a miniature version of the type of sword worn by adults in England in the late 18th century.\n\nMaterials & Manufacture\nThe hilt of this sword is made of cut and polished steel and was made in Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory in Birmingham.  The blade was made in Solingen, Germany, famous for the production of blades.  Similar hilts cut with facets are shown in the Boulton and Watt pattern book, now in Birmingham City Library.  The facets were cut into the surface of the steel to improve the reflecting qualities of the highly polished surface.\n\nProduction Methods\nThis sword hilt was manufactured by the most modern production techniques available at the time.  The steel was polished using wheels powered by a steam engine.  At his Soho Manufactory Boulton used mass-production methods to produce his wares.  As a result he could make a large number of wares very quickly which were cheaper than those of his competitors in Woodstock and London.",
