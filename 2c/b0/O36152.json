The bottom of the whole broadens out in the centre to house the friction drive mechanism, mounted between two wheels. The underside of the rockers; each end of the mechansim is filled in with wedges of green metal. \n*The mark is on the lower right side just in front of the rear leg. It looks like two men at a billiards table with the letters GELY underneath. \n*The subject of a girl riding a horse is quite unusual; even though the horse is a rocking horse.",
