The Falcon brewery therefore decided to commission a specially designed bottle to launch its new beer. Because it was a new beer the company were quite happy for a totally different design. Their main \tspecification was that it had to be a dark coloured bottle, not transparent glass, as light shorten's the beer's shelf life. They also wanted the graphics to be screen-printed. Jasper Morrison worked with the graphic designer Tony Arefin to produce the cardboard box for packing bottles, the beer mat and promotional beer glass, as well as the bottle itself. The traditional beer bottle shape was redesigned and the typeface changed from a traditional uppercase typeface and the symbol of the falcon bird omitted.\n\t\t\t\tThe company had seen Jasper Morrison's work in exhibitions of British design in Sweden. His previous work in glass included carafes made frm old wine bottles and vases for an Italian company, Cappelini Spa.
