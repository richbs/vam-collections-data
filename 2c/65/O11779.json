The originals of the paintings that Day copied are in the 'Large Clive Album' in the Collection of the Indian and South East Asian Department  (this is a copy of  IS.133:49-1964). The drawings demonstrate the ancient Turkish art of 'ebru' (or 'abri') -  marbling on paper. The patterning on the robes was achieved by the use of resists on the other parts of the drawing. (For a modern example of this technique by a Turkish artist see E.1536-1991). Day's interest in this technique was apparently inspired by seeing examples exhibited in the V&A Museum.  It was made by the artist in the process of teaching himself the technique of 'abri' or integral paper marbling.",
