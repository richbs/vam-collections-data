He published 'David Bailey's box of pin-ups' in 1965 as a loose portfolio of 36 portraits of the mainly-male fashionable elite that, as the cover description states, 'belong to Bailey's own world of fashion, pop music and the Ad Lib [nightclub]'. Each portrait is accompanied by notes by Francis Wyndham. \nSurprisingly, only four of the pin-ups are women, all of whom are models. As the notes explain, 'in the age of Mick Jagger, it is the boys who are the pin-ups'. John Lennon received his M.B.E. in October 1965, and returned it in 1969 in protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra affair and the Vietnam war. This caused as much furore as the Beatles' initial decoration. \nThe portraits constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture of the Sixties, and many of them have become the definitive images of key figures of cultural life in London during the Swinging Sixties.",
