His photographs highlight the enduring human spirit, often addressing difficult issues in a subtle way.\n\nMofokeng's series Chasing Shadows is an exploration of a landscape invested with spiritual significance.  The three photographs from this series document caves used both as a Christian prayer site and a place of traditional healing.  Here, Mofokeng is inviting the viewer to explore the meaning and the use of the landscape and environment for ritual and ceremony.",
