In this English version lizards and leaves replace the dragons, peonies, clouds and masks favoured on Chinese ceramics.  The green and yellow drip glazes which appeared in Tang ceramics during the period 700-775CE are here translated into Doulton's salt-glazed stoneware.  The basic form is a standard Doulton shape, albeit in Chinese style; Francis C. Pope modelled the lizards and leaves.As a result the vase could be marketed as a unique art work.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDoulton & Co. was established in 1854 by Henry Doulton (1820-1897) in the traditionally stoneware-manufacturing area of Lambeth, London.  After reluctantly agreeing to collaborate with the nearby Lambeth School of Art, he  rapidly saw the benefits of a serious interest in the history of ceramics and in developing an artistic range of wares. The earliest production was shown with great success in the international exhibition, Paris, in 1867. Pope was one of the School of Art students employed in Doulton's art studio.",
