A plotter is a mechanical device that holds a pen or brush and is linked to a computer that controls its movements.\n\nThe computer program was based on a series of decision making processes that were used to structure the image.  The artist deliberately wrote random variables into the program to allow the computer to make certain choices of its own from a given number of options. \n\nMohr began life as an expressionist painter and jazz musician but in the 1960s began exploring geometric form, and moved towards a more objective, systematic way of working that anticipated his use of the computer. Mohr underpins his computer programs, or algorithms, with precise mathematical logic.  The computer allows Mohr to create very complex algorithms which would otherwise be too difficult and time consuming for humans to process.",
