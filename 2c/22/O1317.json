The lid is attached to the upper part of the handle and can be opened with the thumb of the hand in which the vessel is held. This opaque blue glass vessel is decorated with a wheel-engraved decoration consisting of a mirror monogram 'JVG' with a crown and two palm sprigs, probably referring to the original owner of the glass. \nTwo figures of miners flank the central arms. Underneath are a star and a hammer and pick, typical miner\u2019s tools which are often found in heraldry in the Erzgebrige which was an important mining area. The same symbols are repeated on the town-mark on the pewter lid which has been attributed to Ehrenfriedersdorf, a major tin-mining town. The opaque quality of this type of blue glass is caused by the addition of tin-oxide to the mix of raw materials. All of this makes it very likely that the original owner was a local, involved with the tin-mining industry.",
