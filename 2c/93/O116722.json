The original pigments detected, ultra marine and copper green, lie deep down on the sculpture of the halo and were probably applied as an egg medium. The next, more recent, layer is over most of the carved surface and is dark red, brown, black and bright green. Traces are too fragmented to provide a realistic indication of the colour scheme.\n\nColour was very important \u2013 in the 6th century, about thirty per cent of the work on a sculpture would have been allocated to carving, and seventy per cent to painting.\n\nHistorical significance: This sculpture depicts the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni, probably in a 'wish granting' gesture, though with both his hands missing it is difficult to be certain. The sixth century was a period of disunification in China, when different regional lords declared themselves rulers, with the result of several independent states co-existing at the same time. Yet it was this social turbulence that led to a flourishing Buddhist art, and many excellent sculptures, including the present example, were produced during this period.",
