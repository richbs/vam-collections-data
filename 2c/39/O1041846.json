            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 135, 148\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nPage from a sketch-book trimmed.\n\nA water-colour drawing on the back of No. 238 [609-1888], of the top of a head, completes the drawing on No. 239 [799-1888].  \nFor Constable\u2019s visit of November 1821 to Winchester, see note to No. 237 [792-1888].  The drawing had been laid down on card, and the inscription and drawing on the back remained unrecorded until the back was examined during the preparation of this Catalogue.  If, as appears likely, the note on the back of No. 239 [799-1888] referring to the loss of the sketch completing the head was written by one of the artist\u2019s children, the drawing had presumably been laid down before it entered the Museum.  No. 238 [609-1888] evidently comes from the same sketch-book as No. 239 [799-1888]; that is to say, from the sketch-book measuring in full 6 3/8 x 9 3/8 ins. (161 x 237 mm.) which was first in use in 1820.\n\nNote on Nos. 191, 192, 200, 203, 204, 206, 220, 238, and 239 [297-1888, 257-1888, 622-1888, 251-1888, 351-1888, 271-1888, 353-1888, 609-1888, 799-1888]\n\nNos. 191 [297-1888], 192 [257-1888], 220 [353-1888], and 239 [799-1888] are untrimmed leaves from a sketch-book, of which the pages measure 6 3/8 x 9 \u00be ins. (161 x 237 mm.) and some bear the Whatman watermark of 1818.  The dimensions of Nos. 200 [622-1888], 203 [251-1888], 204 [351-1888], 206 [271-1888], and 238 [609-1888], all of which have been mounted on card and probably trimmed, show that they most certainly come from the same sketch-book.  The dated leaves show that Constable used this sketch-book in 1820 (Nos. 191 [297-1888], 203 [251-1888], and 206 [271-1888]) and in 1821 (Nos. 220 [353-1888] and 238 [609-1888]).",
