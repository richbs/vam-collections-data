In terms of cost, only good quality tapestry was a more expensive way to furnish walls. The three-dimensionality, rich colours and metal foils created a rich and luxurious effect. Leather was also durable, and had practical advantages over textiles in rooms used for dining, as they did not retain the smell of food. Gilt leather was also used as coverings for screens, chairs, mirror-boxes, chests, and cushions, table carpets, altar frontals, chasubles and independent panels to be displayed like pictures.",

Accepted on RF 98617/1898, as 'Spanish 17th century'\n\nThis panel has been analysed as part of the gilt leather cataloguing project in 1996. Eloy Koldeweij, October 1996.\n\nThe full design is shown in an engraving with the gilt-leather pattern of the <i>royaele</i> <i>plaat</i> (1075 x 774mm), V&amp;A E.43-1929.  This design the <i>royaele</i> <i>plaat</i> was introduced in 1663 or 1664. The size of this pattern, 1075 x 774mm.\n\nSee also a wall hanging in the Stedelijk Museum 'De Lakenhal', Leiden; villa Aldobrandini, Frascati (It.). A copied version of the pattern survives on an altar frontal (V&amp;A 728-1890). A mirrored, illegally copied, version of this pattern also exists (see Koldeweij, 1996 p.144).\n\nProduction\nThis panel would have been made using the following method, using vegetable tanned calf skin. A thin layer of silver leaf was used to cover the whole surface, fixed with  parchment glue and covered with the same material to prevent oxidizing. One or two layers of  yellow varnish (consisting usually of natural resins such as sandarac and  asphaltum). The leather (with foil and varnished already attached) pressed foil-side down into a metal mould. Paints and coloured glazes were then added at this point, according to the the client's wishes, which added to the cost of the finished product.",

            "historical_context_note": "Gilt-leather hangings were a prestigious and fashionable wall-covering in the Netherlands. The panels were hung as tapestries, or nailed to the woodwork of the room walls, with a slight overlap. In terms of cost, only good quality tapestry was a more expensive way to furnish walls. The three-dimensionality, rich colours and metal foils created a rich and luxurious effect. Gilt leather wall hangings are depicted in Dutch paintings of the period, such as Pieter de Hoogh, A Party with Four Figures, c1663-5 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Robert Lehman Collection, 1975 (inv. no. 1975.1.144), and Pieter de Wit, Portrait of Dirck Wilre, dated 1669, sold Sotheby's London, 6/7/1994, cat. no. 61). Leather panels were also durable, and had practical advantages over textiles in rooms used for dining, as they did not retain the smell of food. Gilt leather was also used as coverings for screens, chairs, mirror-boxes, chests, and cushions, table carpets, altar frontals, chasubles and independent panels to be displayed like pictures.\n\nManufacture\nIn the Netherlands calfskin was generally used, which was prepared with tannings based on oak bark, often in combination with 'sumac'. From 1628 in Holland it became possible to mass produce leather with relief patterns, using a technique by which the design was pressed into the leather (with foil and varnished already attached) with the use of a metal mould (usually about 75 x 65cm). Around the middle of the 17th century the usual rectangular size of panel c.75 x 65cm was replaced by longer pieces. The 'gilding' consisted of a layer of silver foil, fixed and covered with parchment glue or albumen. The covered foil was then painted with one or two layers of yellow varnish, which generally consisted of natural resins (sandarac and asphaltum), to give it a golden appearance. \n\nGilt leather production existed in the Netherlands from at least 1511 when a Malines maker is recorded. Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent were also significant centres. Production in the Northern Netherlands is recorded from 1612, with production established in Amsterdam, The Hague, Dordrecht and Middelburg, through Flemish immigrants. At this stage, 'Spanish type' leather with a flat surface decorated with small stamped motifs. In Amsterdam three major factories and at least seven smaller ones existed. Press-moulded, embossed leather, the hallmark of 17th century Dutch leather, was developed and patented by Jacob Dircxz. de Swart (d.1641), and produced from 1628. The embossed decoration typically includes floral scrolls, birds, insects or auricular motifs. The large scale of production of the larger factories is evidenced by the contract between Hans Le Maire and a French merchant Le Roux in 1627 for the delivery of 16,000 calfskins per year. Le Maire ran a large factory in Amsterdam with at least 50 workers, and supplied leather to the Dutch Stadholder Frederick Henry, the Danish king Christian IV, and Emperor Ferdinand II in Prague, as well as exporting to Germany, Sweden, Poland, Russia, China and Japan. During the second half of the 17th century, flatter patterns with more polychrome decoration became more popular. During the 18th century gilt-leather wall hangings were superceded by painted canvas, oil-cloth and wallpapers.\n\nFrom the 17th century in the Netherlands, gilt leather could be bought from shops dealing in textiles and wall-hangings. The maker of this panel, Martinus ven den Heuvel used various methods to sell his gilt leather: he advertised in the newspaper the <i>Amsterdamsche Courant</i>, and from 1686 onwards in the <i>Amsterdamsche Beurs-prijscourant</i>, the regularly published pricelist of the Amsterdam commodity exchange. He may also have displayed his gilt-leather patterns in a <i>voorhuis</i> (front of shop). He also sent prints showing the design(s) to potential clients to inform them of the various patterns available, their different finishes and their prices. This is the earliest instance of prints made specifically for a manufacturer to sell and promote his products.
