Anna dei Lombardi (Monteoliveto), Naples, which was completed in 1489. Many of the works by Benedetto Buglioni depend from other painted or sculpted compositions, and it is likely that this was made in his workshop or bottega, which specialised in tin-glazed terracottas. Works by Buglioni are documented in the inventory of Benedetto da Maiano's studio made after the latter's death, indicating that Buglioni was ermployed by the da Maiano workshop.\n\nBenedetto Buglioni is said to have learned the art of enamelled terracotta from a woman employed in Andrea della Robbia's house. He appears to have worked in Florence at the same time as Andrea, but the products of his workshop are considered both technically and artistically inferior.",
