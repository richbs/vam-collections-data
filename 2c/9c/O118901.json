With music re-written and supplemented by Frederic Austin, Gay's 18th century ballad opera featuring traditional tunes took London by storm and put Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map. \n\nThe huge popularity of  The Beggar's Opera revival which ran for over three years spawned a surprising quantity of souvenirs, especially figurines in porcelain and wax.  They are an indication of the impact that the production made on designers and artists.  The highly simplified, almost illustrative, quality of the designs was characteristic of British theatrical design in the wake of the impact of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and in reaction against the detailed 19th century tradition of realism and historicism.",
