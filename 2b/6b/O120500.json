Construction began in 1571 and work continued on various buildings until 1858. The prominent tower in the centre is popularly known as the Hiran Minar (Deer Tower). It may well have been lit up at night to act as a kind of lighthouse and show travellers the way.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised.\nThis window mount is similar to others in the collection. At one point it would also have had a label with red edging indicating the title of the photograph. There is evidence of this being torn off the mount. This type of label and mount suggests inclusion in an exhibition, possibly the Paris exhibition of 1867 or the subsequent South Kensington exhibition for which no catalogue has been found.",
