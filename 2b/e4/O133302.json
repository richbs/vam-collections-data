Her youthful easy-to-wear clothing became so popular that in 1963, she launched a lower-priced ready-to-wear range called 'Ginger Group'. She also entered into licensing agreements with manufacturers to produce hosiery, underwear, cosmetics and accessories bearing her name. Almost anyone, whatever their income, could spare the money to buy a pair of 'Mary Quant' stockings or a lipstick. This enabled girls who could not otherwise afford her clothing to feel in touch with fashion, and made Mary Quant into a household name and a commercial success.\n\nHer contribution to British life was marked by a retrospective exhibition at the London Museum in 1973. The exhibition included many of Quant's most revolutionary garments, some remade as facsimiles if original ones could not be found. This 1966 cream and navy wool trouser-suit was one of the outfits remade. It looks remarkably like a modern tracksuit, and was based on sports and utility wear.",

In her book Quant on Quant, the designer gives the following advice:\n\n'Every girl should go for separates. She should think of each piece as a part of a jigsaw, then build up a comprehensive fashion picture. I would suggest a wardrobe in miniature like this. Take a pinafore dress, a jacket, skirt, sweater and pants that all go happily together and you have umpteen outfits...Fashion should be a game and it is fun to work out for yourself the different ways of wearing the different garments.'",
