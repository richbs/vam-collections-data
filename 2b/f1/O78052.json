This example is missing its glass chimney.\n\nDesign & Designing\nFran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Argand (1750-1803) was a Swiss scientist. He invented the circular wick in 1782. This was a strip of woven cloth mounted in a fitting that allowed every part of the wick to be equally exposed to the air, hence the wick burned more evenly and brightly.  With a conventional wick, the thicker it became, the more difficult it became for it to burn at the centre.\n\nTrading\nMatthew Boulton (1728-1809) was introduced to Argand by William Packer, a Birmingham merchant in 1784. Argand had only provisionally patented his design through not having sufficient funds to take out a full patent. Boulton, a natural entrepreneur, was fascinated by the ingenuity of Argand's invention and put into production lamps made in Sheffield plate incorporating Argand's design for the wick. But Boulton failed to finance a full patent application; the provisional patent lapsed in 1786, and his relationship with Argand ended acrimoniously.",
