The child is standing out\n of doors on a boarded wooden surface, probably a verandah, beneath an\n open window, with a folding chair and a pushchair in the background:\n the child, and possibly the babywalker, appears to be tied to the\n pushchair with a length of doubled tape to prevent its falling over or\n moving too far.",
