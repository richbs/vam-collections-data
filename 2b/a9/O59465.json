It would have been positioned as part of a niche group, most probably situated on the exterior of a major temple. The musician is tensed and his knees are bent to give support to the drum, in a treatment that gives considerable vitality to the subject. The flamboyant foliage forming a canopy above his head and the extravagant detailing of the jewellery and crown suggest that the sculpture belonged to a temple built in the southern Deccan in the early thirteenth century. Prior to that period the Jains had been slow to exploit the ornate style that had evolved under Hoysala Hindu patronage. This style is especially in evidence on the numerous temples built during the reigns of Hoysala rulers Vira Ballala II (1173-1220) and Narasimha II (1220-39). An exception is the Jain temple of Santisvara Basti in Sravana Belgola, built by Vira Ballala II in the late twelfth century, where celestial drummers are depicted in the external reliefs, breaking with the Jain convention for unadorned temple exteriors.\n\nThis unusual sculpture is a cornerpiece and the adroit artist has ingeniously accommodated the form in such a way that the figure is visible from both sides. This may explain why the drummer seemingly strikes an awkward posture in the illustration. Supporting his drum with his left thigh, he grasps it with his left hand, beating the instrument only with his right hand.",
