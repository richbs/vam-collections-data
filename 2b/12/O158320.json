A benefit performance was a way of raising money, usually for one of the performers who would keep all profits from the ticket sales (once the expenses had been deducted), or sometimes for the author of a piece, or to help the family of an actor who was unwell or had died. In this case, the benefit was held for the Head Waiter and Refreshment Manager of the Metropolitan theatre.",
