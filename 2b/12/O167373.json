Mid-20th century.\" Though the pair may have been made by a shoe store called Sun Sun which is no longer located at its stated address \"32 Lyndhurst Avenue, HK\". \n\nAccording to Garrett, in her book Chinese Clothing: An Illustrated Guide (p 131-138), brides traditionally had to embroider their own shoes, along with everything else to be placed in her future bedroom i.e. curtains, bed sheets, etc to demonstrate her embroidery skills. But over time, articles of ready-made wedding clothing were usually sent to the bride from the bridegroom's family, which were usually borrowed or rented for the occasion. \n\nBy the mid-20th century, wedding costume of the bride has changed from something more elaborate garments decorated with auspicious flowers and birds or sometimes of dragon and phoenix (dragon was said to represent the male and phoenix the female, having them side by side symbolises the perfect balance of yin and yang of the bride and the groom)  into what is more popularly known as \"hong gua\" (sometimes \"qun kwa\") which is a set of matching red jacket and skirt whose design is still predominated by the dragon and phoenix, often with the metal couched threads covering the whole of the satin. Also, in place of the red bound-feet shoes the bride wore flat slippers embroidered with the dragon and phoenix.. It then became far more usual to hire these expensive outfits. Though Western white wedding dress are usually worn by brides of today, the hong gua is still worn for kowtowing to the ancestors and both sets of parents. \n\nThis heavily embroidered pair of heels maybe considered as a contemporary version to replace the traditionally flat embroidered wedding slippers.",
