The defeat of Mary's army at Langside in 1568 led to her flight to England and subsequent imprisonment by Elizabeth. \n\nCharles Landseer (1799-1879), the painter of the original picture, was celebrated for paintings of historical and heroic scenes. This painting was particularly popular and was exhibited in 1837 and 1862.\n\nA firm favourite with embroiderers, four versions of this scene were exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851. It continued to be copied throughout the 19th century. \n\nA second embroidered version (T.298-1963) is owned by the Museum.This picture is an example of ' Berlin woolwork'. These were first introduced from Germany in the early 19th century. Using brightly coloured merino wools, the embroiderer would follow the ready marked pattern using one stitch for each square of canvas. This technique soon superseded all other forms of needlework and by the 1870s needlework shops were known as 'Berlin Warehouses'.",
