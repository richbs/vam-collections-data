            "physical_description": "Vase. Bronze, cylindrical, chased with diaper and scrolls.\nThis vase dates to the Song dynasty(R.K.). It has an inset base plate, apparently joined on with solder. The body is decorated with designs in bands, which alternate with plain bands. There are seems visible in the exterior of the main decorated and figured decorated bands, but apparently not in the interior. The inside is quite clean, except for a few drips which may be solder from the base. Slight damage is visible in the plain areas, but no obvious joins. Possibly these seems are the remnants of joins in the wax model that had not been tidied up before the casting. They appear as discontinuity and a kind of ribbing in the decorated bands.\nDeeply cut areas contain yellowish material, and some abraded parts look greenish under the general glossy brown of the surface. Possibly this green gives the yellow-brown appearance to the less rubbed areas. An abraded portion of the base ring shows bare pinkish metal. The rim band shows probable evidence of turning, and there are hints of wires or chaplets on the body of the vase. The design seems to be partly the result of engraving, but it is not apparent if this was in the wax model, or if it was in the metal. A small nick out of the base may be damage to the vase, or may have been a small casting flaw. \nAnalyses were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The body, base, and the solder were all investigated. The body metal was a mixture of copper and lead, with a small amount of tin, and zinc at about the level of an impurity. The very low tin level would account for pinkish appearance of the metal. The alloy would be relatively soft, and so easy to engrave for finishing and so on. The composition was different from that of the base, which had more lead, less tin, and a notable nickel impurity. The base must have been cast also. The qualitative results for the solder indicated that a very large amount of lead was present, in addition to greater concentrations of tin and zinc than had been found in the base or body metals.",
