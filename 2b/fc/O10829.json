The hood is seen clearly by the congregation when the priest faces the altar. By designing ecclesiastical hoods as highly decorative items in their own right, Pugin returned to an established medieval practice which had died out in Europe in the 16th century. \n\nThis hood depicts Saint Thomas of Canterbury as bishop and is appropriate for the Kent church for which it was designed. The head is seen full-face, as in the manner of church brasses, a form advocated by Pugin. The embroidery is worked in the manner of opus anglicanum (English medieval work). This was much admired and aspired to in the mid-19th century by amateurs and an increasing number of professional church embroiderers. \n\nThe embroidery is raised, padded and couched work. The highly professional padded techniques of silver and silver-gilt work show the skills of professional accoutrement makers such as Lonsdale & Tyler, whereas Mrs Powell may well have supplied the central, figurative roundel.",

English medieval work was much admired  in the mid-19th century by amateurs and an increasing number of professional church embroiderers.\n\nOne of two hoods depicting St Thomas which were designed by Pugin and embroidered for use at St Augustine's church, Ramsgate (see T.290-1989). These were worn on plain copes or those made of jacquard woven silk and wool fabric of the 'Gothic Tapestry' design (see T.289-1989). The head of St Thomas is seen full-face as in the manner of church brasses, a form advocated by Pugin.\n\nBy designing ecclesiastical hoods as highly decorative, often figurative, items in their own right, Pugin returned to an established medieval practice which has died out in Europe in the 16th century.",
