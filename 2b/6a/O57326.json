Seymer was also the owner of an extensive garden of exotics.\n\nThomas Robins is an enigmatic artist and, so far, little has been discovered of his life. Between 1747 and his death in 1770, Robins produced a series of drawings and paintings of English country houses and, in particular, their gardens. His surviving drawings and paintings epitomise English rococo taste. Robins was either specially attracted to rococo gardens, or had a reputation for the delineation of such gardens in the circles of cognoscenti of the rococo. \n\nRobins and his work are of significant interest both topographically and aesthetically. His pictures of rococo gardens, with their vistas and ornamental buildings, are of great historical importance because they immortalise a fashion whose exemplars have disappeared. Robins, who was in many respects an 'amateur' painter, never succumbed to conventional facility and his views retain the charm and freshness of a personal discovery. \n\nHis son Thomas Robins the Younger was a drawing master who excelled in botanical paintings. He was well acquainted with Henry Seymer and it is on the latter's recommendation that Robins spent 10 years in Jamaica to illustrate the island's wildlife.",
