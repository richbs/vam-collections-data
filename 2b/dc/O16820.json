The dazzling, jewel-like details of the embroidered design include miniature bees, grasses, wheat and wild flowers. These motifs are worked in relief in faceted glass, gold beads, brilliants and variously shaped pearls, mother-of-pearl and gold petals. It also features an extravagant back bow. The design of this single-occasion gown diplomatically refers to French motifs, including the flowers of France and large gold bees, the emblem of Napoleon. It was intended to both compliment the French nation and draw attention to the Queen.",

(pl.7.8).  He had been invited by Lady Jebb (later Lady Gladwyn), wife of the British Ambassador in Paris, to sketch the return state banquet at which the queen had entertained president Ren\u00e9 Coty at the British Embassy in Paris.  At the time, he had written to his hostess, saying 'The Queen triumphed over Hartnell's bad taste'.  Despite this, he was delighted to accept the ivory satin evening dress, encrusted with beads, brilliants and gold.  Beaton succeeded in acquiring several other dresses worn during the same visit.  Lady Gladwyn donated the lilac lace evening dress [T.173-1974] by French designer, Jacques Fath.  Lady Diana Cooper, Lady Gladwyn's (and Beaton's) great friend, donated a strapless Balmain gown of appliqu\u00e9 printed silk satin [T.50-1974].  Baroness Alain de Rothschild (Mary Chauvin de Treuil), the wife of one of the Rothschild banking brothers, gave a white spotted tulle dress by Dior [T.121-1974] (all pl.7.9).\nJebb, M., ed. <i>The Diaries of Cynthia Gladwyn</i> (London, 1995), pp.205-13\nFrankly her clothes \u2013 though praised tremendously in the English papers with such remarks as \u2018Paris gasped\u2019 or \u2018The Queen in her Hartnell dress stole the show\u2019 (a silly remark, because she in fact <i>was</i> the show) \u2013 were not very beautiful, and did not compare with the French clothes.  Cecil Beaton wrote to me afterwards; \u2018The Queen triumphed over Hartnell\u2019s bad taste\u2019. p.208\nThe Royalist, Friday, 29 September 2006 'Memories of life as the Queen's seamstress' by Joanne Leyland\nShe's worked on outfits for some of the world's most famous faces, from the Queen to soccer star David Beckham.\n\nNow an embroideress has let the world into her memories of working for one of the world's most celebrated fashion houses as a new exhibition of some of the most stunning items from the Queen's wardrobe opens at Kensington Palace.\n\nVisitors to the new Palace exhibition have been treated to a one-off demonstration of embroiderer Marureen Markham's skills, following which she spoke about her memories of a life which has seen her work on some of the Queen's most famous gowns.\n\nWhen Her Majesty visited the Paris Opera House during a state visit to France in 1957, even the most hardened republicans were won over by her style as the young Queen made her entrance in an ivory floor-length gown which incorporated Napoleonic bees, French emblems and hundreds of meticulously embroidered beads, pearls and gold thread. The Norman Hartnell dress was such a hit it was even awarded its own name: the Flower of the Fields of France evening gown.\n\nRecalls the 67-year-old needlewoman, who worked for Hartnell for 26 years: \"I met the Queen several times. Whenever she had a fitting of one of our dresses, the boss would take me along. She was always very charming and when this particular dress was made, she was tiny.\"\n\n\"All Norman Hartnell designs are very elaborate and intricate. I must have spent about three weeks embroidering this one, working on it for seven hours a day. It could be quite fiddly work but I loved it. It's nice to be creative and to see the results of your work.\"\n\nMiss Markham also worked on the wardrobes of other royals, including Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and the most glamorous Princess of the pre-Diana generation, the film star-esque Princess Margaret.\n \nDespite the sudden death of Norman Hartnell in the 1970s, Markham continued to have an impact on the royal wardrobe, working as she did for the Queen's new designer, Ian Thomas.\n \nAlthough now semi-retired, the embroideress is still contracted to undertake work on behalf of Buckingham Palace. Clearly, though, it will be hard to top those starry-eyed days when the eyes of the world were on the dresses which were truly fit for a Queen.\n\nThe new royal exhibition, French Connections: Memories of Her Majesty The Queen In Paris, at which the Flower of the Fields of France dress is a star attraction, can be seen at Kensington Palace from now until March 18th 2007.\nThe Queen wearing T.264-1974.

The design diplomatically makes reference to French motifs, including the \"Flowers of the Fields of France\" (such as daisies and crossed wheat sheaves) and Napoleonic bees.\n\nIt was worn to the state dinner on the first night (Monday 8th April), hosted by President Ren\u00e9 Coty at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, followed by a visit to the Op\u00e9ra to see a ballet by Lifar from <i>The Diaries of Cynthia Jebb</i>.  \n\nThe dress was worn with a necklace (of 4 stones with centre drop jewel) and small earrings, a tiara, and long white evening gloves adorned with a bracelet (or small watch) on the left wrist. The Queen also wore the jewelled Badge of the Legion d'Honneur and sash from her right shoulder to her waist (left).  She also carried a small white handbag and wore a white fur stole for travelling. \n\nThe dress was displayed at Kensington Palace in 2006-7.  Research conducted by Kensington Palace included an interview with Maureen Markham, one of the embroiderers who worked on the dress.  She recalled that they worked with blacked-out windows to avoid the Press and that she hoped the Queen would have nice plush cushions to sit on so as not to crush the embroidery.\n\nThe Queen wore this dress again to the Opera in the early 1960s.\n\nHistorical significance: The 1957 State Visit followed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC).",
