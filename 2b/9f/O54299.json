This colour effect is sometimes known as a 'barber's pole' and in a technical analysis the warp threads would be described as 'Z3S',  meaning that two threads spun anti-clockwise have been twisted together in a clockwise direction to create a strong and useable thread. \n\nThe weft is also visible in this area and because it is cotton it has a slightly fluffy appearance when compared with wool.  Loose weft threads can be seen along the lower edge of the fragment showing how undulating the weft is as it passes over and under the warp threads. \n\nThe pile was built up row by row with a line of knots, each tied around two warp threads, followed by two passes of weft which keep the knots in place and create a stable and very durable fabric.\n\nBefore it was acquired by the Museum attempts had been made to replace the missing pile with embroidery. There are embroidered repairs, mainly in pink, yellow and dark blue, in the lower right hand diagonal of the central lozenge.\n\n \nTechnical Analysis\n\nWARP: cream and brown wool plied together; Z3S, two cream and one brown; 18 threads per inch (63 per dm).\n\nWEFT: white cotton; Z3S; 2 shoots after every row of knots; 10 knots per inch (40 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool; 11 colours: red, orange, yellow, dark green, light green, dark blue, light blue, dark brown (corroded), light brown, black, cream; plus small amount of olive embroidery to replace corroded dark brown, with some pink/green embroidery; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 90 knots per sq. inch (1260 per sq. dm).\n\nWoven in Azerbaijan between about 1880 and 1910.\nT.49-1975"
