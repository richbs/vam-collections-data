A working cutler of Sheffield, Thomas Boulsover (1704-88), found that bars of silver and copper, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The copper and silver were of unequal proportions. The industry that this material created flourished for approximately 100 years. In the 1840s it was superseded by electroplating.\n\nJoseph Hancock (1711-90) developed a process for the large-scale production of fused plate (Sheffield plate). This differed little throughout the course of the industry. An ingot of copper was covered with a thin sheet of sterling silver. In general, the thickness of the silver sheet was one-fortieth of that of the copper block. After about 1760, it became the practice to plate two sides of the copper ingot, so that the resulting sheet was plated with silver on both sides.",

The flat bottomed boats of the early 19th century, in the form of an open skiff with circular depressions to hold the decanters, may have been intended to sit upon the mirrored glass plateau, which would give an illusion of water beneath the boats. By 1820, these jolly boats were being fitted with wheels to move around the table more easily. Jolly boats and later coaster wagons were popular on English tables and occasionally copied in France.",
