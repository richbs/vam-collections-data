This chalice was designed by the architect A.W.N. Pugin (1812-1852), using 15th-century Italian church plate as his model. On his frequent visits to the Continent  he studied and recorded objects in Museums and cathedral treasuries. He re-interpreted the forms and details of these historic objects to create a distinct 19th-century expression of the earlier designs.\n\nPeople\nThe architect, A.W.N. Pugin, and the manufacturer, John Hardman shared a commitment to the revival of the Roman Catholic Church in Britain. In 1838, they founded a business to provide church furnishings describing themselves as the first 'Medieval Metalworkers'. As designer, Pugin promoted the Gothic as the only appropriate Christian style. However, this chalice, which was influenced by 15th-century Italian models in its shape and decorative detailing, demonstrates that his sources of design were not exclusively Medieval.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis chalice was first shown as part of the large display of altar plate and church fittings in the Great Exhibition's Medieval Court in 1851. Richly embellished with enamels and hardstones it is one of the finest pieces made during the collaboration between its designer A.W.N. Pugin and the manufacturer John Hardman. The chalice was designed as an exhibition piece to advertise the skill of designer and maker and was bought by the Museum from the Exhibition for the high cost of \u00a345.",
