Donner and to have served as one of the models for those on the balustrade on the Grand Staircase at Schloss Mirabell, in Salzburg. However, this is not the case. The figure has also been described as a work of Feuchtmayer or very close to that of Straub, possibly by Jorhan or Schm\u00e4del, both apprentices of Straub. Most scholars, however, now believe it to be an early G\u00fcnther.",
