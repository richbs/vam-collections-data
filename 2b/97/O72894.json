Sir Joshua Jebb was Surveyor-General of Prisons. He was responsible in part for the construction of Pentonville prison in Islington, north London, described as a 'model prison', and for the one  in Portland, the Isle of Wight.\n\nPatrick MacDowell (1799-1870) was an Irish, Belfast born, sculptor, who was initially apprenticed to a London coachbuilder. Later he trained under the sculptor Peter Francis Chenu. He attended the Royal Academy Schools, but already after two years he had a well merited and established reputation as a sculptor. His most important work is probably the memorial to Frederick Richard Chichester, Earl of Belfast (d. 1853) in Belfast Castle, but he is best known for his group depicting Europe for the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens.",
