The Scheme was an historically unprecedented example of government regulation of furniture design and production. It represented what many saw as a practical effort to regulate the use by manufacturers of basic raw materials, wood and petrol especially, that would be in great demand during the war. In terms of consumption it ordered the priority by which members of the public would be allowed to purchase furniture; only those who needed furniture would be allowed to buy. The Scheme evolved into an attempt by members of its Design Panel - especially Gordon Russell - to raise what they saw as the low level of design in Britain. The idea was to produce pieces that were well designed in terms of construction and appearance: solid, durable furniture that would be distinctly modern but appropriate to wartime. Restrictions were relaxed in 1949 and Utility furniture production was officially ended in 1952.",
