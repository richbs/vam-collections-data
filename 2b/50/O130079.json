These zones of interlocking figures, animals, grotesques and quasi architectural forms create a pyramidal structure which conforms to the design that was standard in the Veneto in the late 16th century.  \n\nThe base is of open work decoration with a coat of arms in the centre surrounded by interlocking figures. The figures, which are intricately modelled and decorated, depict classical monsters, grotesques and foliate ornaments which are converging by degrees towards the single standing figure of Juno.\n\nImmediately below the classical statuettes which form the pinacle of the structures, female sphynx like figures with elaborate Mannerist headgear and belts high up their bosom surround the vase shaped central section.",

Often, firedogs do not even appear on inventories which indicates their status as standard household objects, not necessarily worthy of particular note.\n\nThis firedog is one of a pair (the other is 3012-1857, and crowned with Jupiter).\n\nThe sculptor Guiseppe de Levis (1522-1611-14) was born and died in Verona.  He came from a large family of sculptors and bronze foundry men although he was by far the most successful.  His works have been identified from the signature that he frequently cast on to his works: IOSEPH DE LEVIS IN VERONA MI FECE. \n\nDe Levis specialised in ornamental artefacts such as bells, mortars, inkstands, door-knockers and firedogs.  For smaller figurines etc he was skilled enough to work alone but for more challenging and significant figures he would often collaborate with the sculptor, Angelo de Rossi.   When working together, the sculptors would both sign the works.  The V&A firedogs are signed by Giuseppe de Levis alone however.",

He came from a large family of sculptors and bronze foundry men although he was by far the most successful.  His works have been identified from the signature that he frequently cast on to his works: IOSEPH DE LEVIS IN VERONA MI FECE.  In addition to his signature, de Levis also often dated his works which has allowed around 30 works to be clearly attributed to him.  There was speculation that he may have been Jewish on account the way he signed his name, Jospeh de Levis, but this has been discounted since Rognini discovered that his family came from the village of Levo.  The Latinized form of his name was considered normal at the time by people who were keen to elevate their positions in society if they were not originally of noble birth.  \n\nDe Levis specialised in ornamental artefacts such as bells, mortars, inkstands, door-knockers and firedogs.  For smaller figurines etc he was skilled enough to work alone but for more challenging and significant figures he would often collaborate with the sculptor, Angelo de Rossi.   When working together, the sculptors would both sign the works.  The V&A firedogs are signed by Giuseppe de Levis alone however. \n\nIn many of his works, and indeed on these firedogs, Giuseppe de Levis used a number of motifs such as sphinx like forms and sea horses.  It is often difficult to tell how personal motifs are.  It could be perceived that since we see motifs such as sea horses frequently on works by Giuseppe de Levi, that they could signify his handicraft when they appear on unsigned utensils.  In reality, it is likely that they were common property of all of the founderies of the day.  In turn, it is probable that artists borrowed such devices from one another.",

Often, firedogs do not even appear on inventories which indicates their status as standard household objects, not necessarily worthy of particular note.\n\nThe Firedog consists of nine pieces: a base, two mid, a triangular and a vase shaped part, a nut, washer and rod and a statuette which is the mythological figure of Juno.  These zones of interlocking figures, animals, grotesques and quasi architectural forms create a pyramidal structure which conforms to the design that was standard in the Veneto in the late 16th century.",
