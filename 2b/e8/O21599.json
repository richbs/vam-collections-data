The rich chocolate brown colour is an industrial reference to the 'brown mug' aesthetic in studio pottery which was widely popular in the 1970s. The chunky shape with generous curves in the handle and lid, showing an Art Nouveau influence, are a witty contrast to the earnest brown clay body and the distinctive surface.\n\nThis was Martin Hunt's first design for Hornsea to win a Design Council Award. Hornsea was prepared to experiment technically to achieve better design results, something which set it apart from other manufacturers of this time. 'Contrast' was also the pottery's best-selling range for over twelve years.",
