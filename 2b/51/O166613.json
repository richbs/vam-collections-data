Wears long hair, a turban and a girdle with a tassel. The right arm (missing) was held up, the left hand was placed on the hip (arm missing). The tunic has traces of blue pigment, the stockings red, the hair black. The feet are missing. The figure has been broken across the middle and repaired. \n\nThis figure is related to A.21-1928 and A.22-1928, which were likewise both donated by Lady Marling.\n\nA.23-1928 (mask, plaster with remains of colour) and A.24-1928 (plaster harpy) were also donated at the same time by Lady Marling. The pigments on A.23-1928 were analysed in 2006 by Raman spectroscopy, by Lucia Burgio in V&A's Conservation Science section. The bright red pigment (on the mouth and eyebrows) was identified as vermilion, the black (on the hair and eyes) gave a weak signal for carbon black, but no spectrum could be obtained for the dull yellow pigment (used for the eyes).
