The print was made in August 1996.  There were two images on the one plate, one Pinter and one Berkoff.  I sent copies to each of them.  Although I retain copyright on the original as artist, I felt I wanted to inform or even ask permission of them.  Harold Pinter owned the original of his, and I had had an ongoing dialogue with Steven Berkoff, including sittings.\n\nBoth images were completed from video from television interview.  Video of drama or interview has proved to be the best way of catching the undercurrents and contained life apparent in these intriguing theatrical people.  Since then I have worked a lot from contemporary dance in Britain and movement forms in India (martial arts and Kathakali) were I have used my own films as a source of reference.  \n\nAll the prints are 'Artists Proofs' as the run never got made due to financial and marketing considerations which I could not deal with at the time.  There were less than 15 of each of these.  Two however are owned by (and to my knowledge still displayed at) the Queen Mary and Westfield College in Mile End.'   Janine Creaye, 24 March 2002.
