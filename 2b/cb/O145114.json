Instructions on the squares of the board provide advancement or frustration to the theatrical career being pursued by each player, and the winner is the first to become a star. A printed label with the game notes that show business involves a great deal of hard work, numerous difficulties and a certain amount of luck, and that the game: 'is designed to give you an interesting insight into the numerous hazards in the pursuit of stardom.' Despite being made in 1950, most of the hazards in the path to stardom are surprisingly similar today.\n\nThe idea for the game came from Emile Littler (1903-1958), one of the greatest British theatrical impresarios of the 20th century, particularly for pantomime and musicals. The son of theatrical managers Agnes and Jules Richoux, Emile and his siblings were adopted by Frank Littler after he married their mother.  Three of the Littler children - Blanche, Prince and Emile - went on to become the most influential producers of their day who understood better than most the pitfalls of a career in show business.",
