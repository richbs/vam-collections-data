This watercolour is one of five in the Searight collection reproduced as aquatints in Willyams\u2019s publication, A Voyage up the Mediterranean in his Majesty\u2019s Ship the Swiftsure. (1802).  Napoleon had invaded Egypt in July 1798, and established himself in Cairo; however, in October that year his fleet was sunk by Nelson\u2019s forces off Abu Qir. In his watercolours Willyams shows less interest in the naval action than in the people taking part in it, and in scenes of local life. Here the battle has been relegated to the background, while attention is focused on the amusing incident in the foreground of the Turkish captains retiring to a small boat in the shelter of a wreck to smoke their pipes.",
