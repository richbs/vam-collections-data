The play is set during a country house party at the Lancasters' where family secrets are dramatically revealed.  It premiered at the Everyman Theatre in 1924. According to Noel Coward, \"The Vortex was an immediate success and established me both as a playwright and as an actor, which was very fortunate, because until then I had not proved myself to be so hot in either capacity.\"\n\nGladys Calthrop (1894-1980) was an English set and costume designer. Born Gladys Treeby in Devon, Calthrop married, and later separated from, Everard E. Calthrop. She met Noel Coward in Italy during 1921, they subsequently became friends and worked together on many plays. Their first collaboration was on The Vortex in 1924 for which Calthrop designed both sets and costumes. She worked in both London and New York.",
