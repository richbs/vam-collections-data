It took only two people to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. By simply depressing a lever, a metal plunger was lowered into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Europe and Britain, giving rise to stylistic changes and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid- to late 19th century the first period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved quality while cutting costs even further.\n\nIn 1889 George Davidson patented a new production method for two new colours, under the name of Primrose and Blue 'Pearline'. The novelty of this extremely popular line was that the colour of each piece gradually changed from clear at the bottom to opaque at the top.\n\nPeople\nThis basket was made by 'George Davidson & Co., Teams Glass Works' at Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. Founded in 1867, they soon became one of the most famous and prolific manufacturers of pressed glass in Britain.",
