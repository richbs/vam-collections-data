            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis type of mug was made by London delftware potters in the second quarter of the 17th century. Containing about half a pint of liquid, it may have been intended for strong beer which, in the general absence of wine, was a drink equally favoured by women. But its primary role was probably as a commemorative piece for display.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis style of mug is apparently an original invention, not based on German stoneware prototypes. Its barrel-shaped form with a rather small foot may have been devised to give the maximum uninterrupted surface for decoration. Certainly it is the inscribed examples that survive, though plain white mugs of this shape may well have been made as well. The handle, with its lumpy solid terminal at the base, is reminiscent of Continental tin-glazed earthenware of the period, which is not surprising in view of the Southwark potters' strong links with The Netherlands.\n\nCollectors & Owners\nThis object was first 'collected' by James Bandinel (1783-1849), a humanitarian official at the Foreign Office noted for his writings on slavery. As one of the very earliest English collectors to take an interest in native English pottery, his example was later followed by Henry Willett (Willett Collection, Brighton Museum), Thomas Greg (Greg Collection, Manchester City Museum) and Dr Glaisher (Glaisher Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).",
