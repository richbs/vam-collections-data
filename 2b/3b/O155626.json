The corner units are composed of similar diagonal bands but finish with fan-shapes each with four petals.  A narrow needlewoven band of lozenges [a] surrounds this central area, followed by a wider band of needlewoven lozenges interspersed with stepped triangles of straight stitches; the corner junctions have NOT been skillfully managed.  A repeat of band [a] forms the outer border.\nThe non-selvedge edges have been rolled and stitched in place.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk, 2S",
