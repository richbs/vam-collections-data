It has a light blue ground with offset rows in which a white turban alternates with a white and pink flower.  These motifs appear to be linked by a downward curving line with 4 circular motifs.  There is evidence of a silver metal strip having been used as a weft in the turban motifs.\nThere is a border made from three fabrics: [1] Corner squares: red satin ground with offset rows with a blue and light blue bird on a blue and light blue flower alternating with a brown and white bird on a brown and white flower. The birds face in the opposite direction in alternate rows. There are traces of impressed lines in pairs forming a diamond around each motif.  There is evidence of metal thread: silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk core. [2] Sides: metal thread ground [silver-gilt strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core] with a twill binding using the red silk warp. The pattern is in offset rows with botehs alternating direction in alternate rows.  Each boteh is packed with tiny flowers in red, light blue, black and green coming from a tiny white vase. [3] There is a small piece of the third fabric in the lower part of the left hand side: metal thread ground [silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core] with an incomplete design of small flowerheads.\nBacking: pieced; blue ground printed with curving orange stems, small orange leaves and dots, larger orange and green pointed leaves and orange and green roses.\nFacing: bias cut stripes: dark blue with 4-petalled flowerhead in dull red outlined in white with 2 leaves; dull red with acorn-like motif in blue outlined in white; white with horizontal blue serrated leaf joining dull red flowers.",
