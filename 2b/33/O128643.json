His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1944, Messel was released from his war duties as a Camouflage Officer in Norwich to work on the Gabriel Pascal (1894-1954)  film Caesar and Cleopatra, reputedly the most expensive film made in Britain at the time.  Despite war time rationing and scarcity of materials, he successfully combined pastiche of period Egyptian and Classical style with the liberty that a 1940s audience would understand. \n\nMessel probably mocked up this Roman Soldier\u2019s helmet in his home studio at Pelham Place, prior to mass production of the design.  He used Plaster of Paris to create a solid structure, to which he attached bristles from a household broom.  The relief decorations are suitably classical, in the form of arabesques and Pegasus, a winged horse from Greek mythology.",
