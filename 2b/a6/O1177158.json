The bed of the pram is made up of three removable buttoned (on one face) upholstered cushions covered in black leathercloth. The folding hood is of black leathercloth, with metal fittings, and is edged with two-tone brown braid in a greek key pattern. The handle has a black lacquered horizontal bar between two S-shaped side pieces of chromium which fasten to the underside of the body. \n\nThe pram is suspended from C-springs by leather straps fastening with metal buckles. It has two pairs of  ball-bearing metal wheels with metal spokes and tyres of rubber compound; the mudguards are painted black. There is a fitting between the bars of the handle for the attachment of an apron. The foot-operated metal brake is horizontal in action, moving from right to left to prevent the pram moving. A matching umbrella-holder is attached at one side of the handle.",

Perhaps the biggest difference between the modern product and its predecessors is the emphasis on comfort and safety. Present day versions have to conform to legal safety requirements and often come with harnesses and safety leashes, whereas the 18th and 19th century pushchairs often lacked even a simple brake or straps, and were deplored by reformers such as Pye Henry Chavasse in his book 'Advice to a Mother' (1839) as much for their lack of safety as for their unsuitability for young babies who needed to lie flat (not catered for until the introduction of the wicker bassinet prams in the 1880s).\n\n\"...The child, while being borne in the nurse's arms, reposes on the nurse, warm and supported, as though he were in a nest! While, on the other hand, if he be in a perambulator, he is cold and unsupported, looking the very picture of misery, seeking everywhere for rest and comfort and finding none! ...\"\n\nChavasse's argument, on the other hand, does not consider what would happen to the child if any kind of accident happened to the nurse.",
