It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nMiss Nell of New Orleans came to Brighton for a week from 15 February as part of the post-London tour with the complete London cast including Irene Vanburgh as Nelly Daventry and George Zucco as George Durand. By 1932 Irene Vanbrugh was an established star. She made her first stage appearance at the Margate Theatre Royal in 1888 as Phoebe in As You Like It, and her London debut the same year as the White Queen in Alice in Wonderland  She worked with several important actor-managers of the day, including Herbert Beerbohm Tree and George Alexander.  She celebrated her golden jubilee in 1938 and in 1941 was created a Dame of the British Empire.",
