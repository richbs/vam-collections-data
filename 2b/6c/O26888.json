The cards are shuffled and dealt round to all the players.  The object of the game is to acquire as many complete families as possible. A family consists of four characters of the same name, i e Mr. Chip, Mrs. Chip, MIss Chip and Master Chip.\nThe game commences by the player of the left of the dealer asking one of the others for a character he requires to complete or partly complete a family.  If this player has the card he must surrender it and the first player may continue to ask any of the players for cards he requires until refused.  The one who refuses him says Not At Home and he in turn may ask in the same way for any cards he requires.  No player may ask for a card of any family unless he holds at least one card of that same family.\nWhen a family is complete, it is placed face downwards on the table in front of the player.  The game is finished when all the families are complete, the player holding the greatest number of families being the winner.\n\n\nGENERAL HAPPY FAMILIES RULES\n\nThree or more can play and special cards are normally used, each showing four members of a family, mother, father, son and daughter,  However, variations have been developed to use groups of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to a set.  Also subject variations occur and some are educational, for example The Counties of England.\n\nThe object of the game is for each player to collect as many complete `families' as possible.  \nOne of the players deals out all the cards.  If more than one round is played, the players take it in turn to deal.  It does not matter if some players have one card more than others.\nEach player looks at his cards and sorts them into families.\nIt is important that players keep their cards hidden from each other.  With young children it is a good idea if they can lay their cards out of view of the other players.\nWhen all the players are ready, the person to the dealer's left asks any player, by name, for a particular card (eg Master Baker).  He must already possess at least one of member of the same family, ie Mrs. Baker.  If the person asked has the card, he must give it to the first player, who may again ask anybody for a card of any family as long as he already has one card belonging to that family.  \nHe continues to do this until he fails to obtain a card.  If the person asked does not have the card requested, it is his turn to ask for cards.\nWhen a player collects all the cards of the same family, he puts them into a pile face down in front of him.\nPlay continues until all the families have been completed\nThe winner is the person who collects the most families.",
