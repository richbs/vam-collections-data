Many spoons of this type were made by West Country spoonmakers. Apostle spoons were highly popular from about the 1450s, when they appear in a range of standard designs available from specialist spoonmakers.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe popularity of spoons, as the least expensive means of possessing or giving silver, is indicative of the spread of silver to a broader society during Tudor times. A single spoon was an acceptable gift up to the 17th century, when the custom fell out of favour except at christenings; by that time spoons were no longer the main eating tool.  Apostle spoons were commonly given as baptismal presents.  The choice of Apostle was often connected to the name of the baptised, but it could also correspond to that of a local saint. St  Peter, to whom Exeter Cathedral in Devon is dedicated, frequently graces West Country Apostle spoons of the period. In other cases however, the Apostle appears generic, with no particular emblem or attribute.\n\nDesign\nThis spoon follows the normal lines of construction. The  bowls and stems are raised in one piece from a spade-shaped blank. The finial is cast. If the Apostles have emblems, these are either part of the casting or soldered on.",
