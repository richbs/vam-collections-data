As she describes it: 'A scandal is growing over claims that UK Defence Secretary Geoffrey Hoon\u2019s failed to equip British troops in Iraq properly. It suggests incompetence at the highest level of the Labour government. The media show emails sent by soldiers in Iraq, complaining of not having the boots they need for extreme desert conditions, while many still await their chemical suits.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
