Analysis carried out in the museum for a V&A exhibition in 1982 showed it to be made of lead glass, meaning that it could not be earlier than about the turn of the 18th century and was almost certainly European. During this century England exported glass in large quantities to India, suggesting this as the most likely place of manufacture. English makers often produced exotic forms that would be suitable for the eastern market, such as rosewater sprinklers or the bases of water pipes.",
