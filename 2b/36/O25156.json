There is a tiny figure of the deer which is the symbol (lanchana) of this Tirthankara. The figure is beautifully modeled, with finely articulated hands and feet. The symmetrical curls of hair frame a face of serene calm. The prominent srivatsa mark on the chest is inlaid with silver and copper. The eyes are silver and were probably once set with precious stones and crystal, now missing. An aureole is given behind the head with lotus design. A portion on top of the aureole is missing, perhaps it held a chatravali (umbrellas).  The elaborate back-rest of the throne is cast in two sections, the lower section shows the fly-whisk bearers and  the leogryphs and male figures.  Two garland-bearers (maladharas or vidyadharas) and two seated four-armed female figures (yaksis) are shown on the throne-bar. Elephants and drummers are shown on top, strangely enough the elephants are not shown holding pots and pouring water on the Jina. A meditating male figure seated in lalitasana is illustrated on top in the centre.   We are unable to identify  this important figure. Branches of the Kevala tree of the Jina also are shown on top with pots.   This image of Santinatha is one of the finest twelfth-century western Indian Jain monumental bronze castings recorded.  The modelling and casting of the backplate, however, gives the appearance of not being contemporary. In all probability it was cast as a replacement, perhaps as late as the fifteenth century.  An incription on the base of the image confirms the identity of the Jina and the date of its dedication.",

He is the 16th Jina (saviour-teacher) and is said to have revived Jainism at a time when it was in danger of extinction, assuring the faith's survival. Over time Jains came to invoke him to avert calamities and ensure the peace his name suggests (santi, \u2018peace\u2019; natha,\u2018lord\u2019).\n\nThis image is one of the finest 12th-century western Indian Jain monumental bronze castings recorded. The figure bears an inscription dedicating it to the triumph of Sri Shantinatha in the year of Vikrama-Sanwat 1224 (1168 AD).\n\nThe naked meditating Jina is seated in the \u2018padmasana\u2019 posture on a jewelled cushion. This is richly decorated with silver and copper inlay and deer motifs. The deer which appears on the throne-base is the attribute (symbol) associated with Shantinatha.\n\nThe figure is beautifully modelled, with finely articulated hands and feet. The symmetrical curls of hair frame a face of serene calm. The prominent \u2018srivatsa\u2019 mark on the chest is inlaid with silver and copper. The eyes are silver and were probably once set with precious stones or crystal, now missing. The highly elaborate back plate is cast in three sections and provides the \u2018prabhavati\u2019 (radiating halo). It also supports the fly-whisk bearers and celestial attendants, elephants and musicians who pay homage to the Jina.",
