By the time he died he had produced over 500 prints, including sets of the Senses, the Planets and the Twelve Ceasars, as well as many portrait and costume prints.\n\nDesign & Designing\nIn this print Abraham de Bruyn has deployed a huge variety of ornamental motifs in the border framing the central oval. They include men in armour, naked men - possibly sea gods riding on sea monsters -, strange creatures that are half- animal and half-snail, a mask, vases, flowers, branches of leaves, scrolling foliage, flags and hanging drapery. All these elements are organised symmetrically. There is as much to look at outside the oval frame as inside it.\n\nPrinted Design Sources\nThe set of six oval-framed scenes from the life of Perseus on which this print is based were a source for a number of interiors in England at the beginning of the 17th century. The elaborate border was copied almost exactly in an overmantel (the area above a mantelpiece) at Boston Manor House at Brentford in Middlesex, around 1623. One of the few changes to the border that the maker of the overmantel introduced was to replace the stylised roses to the left and right of the oval in the print with masks.  Whoever made this overmantel also decided to replace the mythical scene of Perseus rescuing Andromeda at the centre of this print with the biblical subject of the Sacrifice of Isaac from the Book of Genesis.",
