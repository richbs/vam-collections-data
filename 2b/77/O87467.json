Dearle had worked for Morris & Co. since 1878, rising from shop assistant to designer after Morris trained him as a tapestry weaver. Dearle produced his first tapestry design in 1887 and by 1890 was the firm's chief designer.  His early textiles were closely based on Morris's style, but his mature work, influenced by Near Eastern patterns, shows greater originality. He designed tapestries, carpets, embroideries and woven and printed fabrics and supervised most textile production up to and after Morris's death in 1896, and later became Art Director. Because of Morris's fame, Dearle's contribution was much neglected and his work often attributed to Morris.\n  \nMorris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles for sale in two London shops, manufactured from 1881 at Morris's Merton Abbey works.",
