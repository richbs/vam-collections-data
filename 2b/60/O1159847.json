            "public_access_description": "Named after the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire where the factory was situated in a town called Chesham the Chiltern Toy co as we know it today started manufacturing its first bears in 1915. The owner of the company was Joseph Eisenmann, he died in 1919 and left the company to his Son-in-Law Leon Rees who took Harry Stone as a business partner in 1920. Harry Stone had previously worked with J.K.Farnell of Farnell Bears fame, and together Leon and Harry formed H. G. Stone and Co. \n\nOne of the most well known bears that they created was the Chiltern Hugmee bear in the late 1920s. They were called Hugmee as they were stuffed with soft Kapok (with the exception of the head that was excelsior) that made them more cuddly than bears stuffed solely with excelsior. They used top quality mohair and velveteen or cotton paw pads with carded soles to the feet on many early bears. \n\nDuring the war the factories ceased producing bears and helped the war effort instead. But before the war and after growling and musical bears became popular. In the 1950s Chiltern produced bears with plastic noses, these were in line with new safety standards.\nIn 1967 the Chiltern Company became a subsidiary of Chad Valley.",
