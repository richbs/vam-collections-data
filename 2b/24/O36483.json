One upright is attached to both the base and platform and the other is only attached to the platform. Between the top ends of the uprights is twisted and knotted a loop of string. The uprights, base and platform are painted black, with the edges of the platform and base painted white. From the string hangs the figure; the string passes through two holes in each of its `hands'. The figure consists of a head and body, two arms and two legs, loosely jointed to the body. It is carved and painted white and black to show a comic mouse, an early version of Mickey Mouse. To operate, squeeze the lower uprights together; this tightens the loop of string and makes the figure move around the string to appear to be an acrobat.",
