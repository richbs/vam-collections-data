His major work, the \"Rapimento di Cefalo\", was set to music by Giulio Caccini, the father of the sculptor who made the bust, Pompeo Caccini.\n\nThe bust, known only in two versions, is the only known sculpture by Pompeo, who is documented as a painter in Florence, active from 1601-1615.  The sensitive portrait shows the poet at the age of seventy-two. It may have been modelled when Chiabrera was in Florence in 1624, or perhaps when Caccini visited in Rome.\n\nIts small scale suggests a personal commission or a gift on the part of the artist, who proudly signed it on the back, and could have been kept within a studio or cabinet.",
