It seems clear that Lumaconi then gessoed, gilded, burnished and painted them in his Perugia workshop. They were seen and admired by Lemo, Rossi, Scotti and Signor Prof Costa. Lumaconi claims that his price quoted (1200 lire) allows him, after the costs of bringing the frames to Perugia, only 1.5 or 2 lire per day for his work of gessoing, 'beating the gold especially to imitate the antique finish', gilding and burnishing, and requests additional payment.",
