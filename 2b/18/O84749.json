He is standning on a green band representing grass with styilised tufts of grass stalks dotted across it.  The ground behind the figure is painted in a pale green colour and rises up to a band of blue clouded sky which has been added on an extended piece of paper, four centimetres in depth, at the top.\n      The boy is dressed in a pale mauve <i>jama</i> sprigged with green and gold trefoils and pale green lappets under his right arm.  He is wearing a a rounded turban of Persian style in a white material with minute dots spotted in green with a golden top-knot. His <i>patka</i> has horizontal stripes of gold and red with a red tulip at both ends.  He is wearing golden boots decorated in green, maroon and red. His features are delicately painted with soft modelling, with no apparent hatching.\n      The painting has a pink-buff inner border painted with a stylised floral scroll in gold, outlined in white with additional ruled lines in black and blue.  The extended painting has been given a dark green inner margin.  The outer border has an ivory-coloured ground and is decorated with alternate poppies and lilies outlined in gold. The page has strips of buff-coloured paper collaged along the edges with an inner white outline. A pale brown strip of paper has been stuck over the paper margin on the left hand side to act as a gutter for the album binding. The edges of the page have been gilded.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawings and flower studies on both sides.  The binding is covered with an Indian brocade. This silk may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
