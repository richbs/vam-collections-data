Augsburg goldsmiths produced numerous examples with striking and fantastic ornament. The mounts on this tankard were made by Augsburg goldsmith Hans Heinrich Hering, but the carved ivory drum is the work of another artist, possibly Ulrich Hurdter, a Swiss pupil of David Heschler (1611-1667). The subject-matter of the decoration is inspired by the antique, and comprises a frieze of tritons (sea gods) and nereids (sea nymphs) amongst reeds and water.",
