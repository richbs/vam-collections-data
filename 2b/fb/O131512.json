A sheer chiffon caftan in a bold painterly print is worn over a sleeveless silk minidress in the same print. Heim knew that the women who bought his designs would not wear very short miniskirts or sheer caftans over bare flesh. Such looks were for avant-garde young people and their boutiques on King's Road and Carnaby Street.\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R.L.Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes were sold by high end London boutiques.",
