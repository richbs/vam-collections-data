A lover of music and the plays of Ibsen, he realised the value of the stage as a platform for social and political reform. His first play Widowers' Houses was staged at the Royalty Theatre in 1892, and although his early work was often criticised for its polemic nature, he became one of the most notable dramatists of his time. His popularity was assured by the Court Theatre repertory seasons under the management of Harley Granville-Barker and J. E. Vedrenne between 1904 to 1907, when eleven Shaw plays were produced.\n\nThe artist Stacey Hopper was born in South Wales and taught art before the war at Ealing. In 1934 he published the caricature The Origin of the Nazi Salute which credited the salute as a tribute to an image of Hitler holding up n a paintbrush. During the war, whilst serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, Hopper's artistic talent led to his providing artwork for the Army Medical Department, notably to warn soldiers of the dangers of malarial mosquitoes. He returned to teaching after the war and continued producing caricatures for publication, especially of actors and entertainers.",
