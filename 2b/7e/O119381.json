The Spanish-born couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), regarded by his peers as \u2018the Master\u2019, had moved to Paris from Spain in 1937. By 1952 he had 232 employees there and was producing 356 new designs per year. His clients, admitted to his salon only after a personal introduction, included many cosmopolitan women of different nationalities.\n\nBalenciaga was a perfectionist in cutting, sewing and finishing garments, and was renowned for his exacting standards. Plain fabrics show up defects in any aspect of dressmaking so this coat reveals his craftsmanship. It reveals his skill in paring down his design into an elegant pea-green organdie 'duster' coat which is almost timeless in line (worn here over T.126-1982). Organdie is a semi-transparent fabric, usually made from cotton, and firm in handle.",
