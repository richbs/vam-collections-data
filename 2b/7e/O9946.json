The colour and weave of this garment are not an obvious choice for babywear (traditionally tending to be made in white or pastel colours), but are likely to be a reflection of the post-war austerity which prevailed at during the early 1950s.  The garment is typical of the way older relatives and family friends would make baby garments in the past, primarily of decorative appearance and using traditional or even old-fashioned styles and techniques.",
