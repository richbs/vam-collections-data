The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. No contemporary, independent version of the text is known and the only remnants of it are those on the backs of the few remaining paintings, making it difficult to reconstruct the stories. Work on the project probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\nIn this episode, Hamza's strong-armed angel Sa'ad dashes enemies to the ground with one hand and leads the army to Barda, where Hamza and the heroes recover their sight. The paint surface is badly damaged.",
