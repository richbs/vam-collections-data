The other side has ornate decoration and an inscription stating that it was built in 1199 by Qutbuddin Aibak. The central arch is 6.7 metres wide and 16 metres high.\n\nOn the right-hand side is the Qutb Minar, the tower from which the daily call to prayer is made. It is the highest stone tower in India and tapers from a base diameter of 14.32 metres to 2.75 metres at the top. It too was begun in 1199. Only the first storey was built during the lifetime of Qutbuddin Aibak. The next two storeys were built by his successor, Shamsuddin Iltutmish, who also built what was the fourth and final storey. When this was destroyed by lightning, Firoz Shah Tughlug (1351-1388) added the two storeys seen here. The difference in their size and style suggests that they must have a replaced a single, better-proportioned one.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

The other side of the screen is ornately decorated and has an inscription on the central arch states that it was built in 1199 by Qutbuddin Aibak. The central arch is 6.7 meters wide and 16 meters high and is an ogee or s-shaped corbelled arch. \n\nTo the right hand side is the Qutb Minar. The minar is part of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque and was built by Qutbuddin Aibak. Inscriptions around the minar outline the history of the tower and state that the building of the tower was started in 1199. Only the first storey was built during the lifetime of Qutbuddin Aibak. The next two storeys were built by his successor, Shamsuddin Iltutmish. Iltutmish also built the fourth and  it is believed final storey but when this was destroyed by lightning, Firoz Shah Tughlug (1351-88) added the two storeys as can be seen here. The difference in size and style of these two suggest that they must have a replaced a single better proportioned storey. \n\nThe minar is covered with red and buff standstone and marble and is the highest stone tower in India. The diameter of the base is 14.32m and 2.75m at the top.",
