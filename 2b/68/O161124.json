There is a border along the bottom and part way up the sides: black ground with pansy-like flower with green, pink and red or green, pink and white details.  Along the bottom and on the 3 sides of the inner edge is a narrow border with a green ground and yellow-edged diamonds filled with pink or white.  The borders up the sides taper towards the top and do not have a definite outer edge.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left. These are chevron lines in green and pink.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: a pink flower and bud alternating with a white flower and bud.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white ground with a round pink flower edged with green leaves on a straight striped stem pointing to the lower right and a green and yellow vase pointing straight down with two V-shaped tows of small flowers and leaves.\n[b] broader than the previous stripe: black ground with clearly shaped diamond-shaped motifs: a central pink flower with 3 blue ones and white ones and a central spray of 7 white flowers with 4 blue and 4 pink ones.\nThreads: Silk, 2S: black, white, blue, orange, purple, light purple, green, dark green, yellow, red, pink, light blue.",
