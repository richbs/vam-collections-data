Suites of seat furniture such as this were sometimes used to furnish state bedchambers. They were luxurious furnishings intended to show wealth and status. The high back with an arched cresting was fashionable in the 1690s, and showed off luxurious fabrics well.\n\nPlaces\nThe first record we have of the chairs is in 1906, in an article in the magazine Country Life on Hornby Castle, Yorkshire. However, the chair was probably made for another house, Kiveton Park, which was built by the 1st Duke of Leeds, Sir Thomas Osborne, in 1697-1705. The 5th Duke of Leeds, Francis Godolphin Osborne, married the heiress of Hornby Castle in 1773, and the chair might have been moved from Kiveton Park to Hornby Castle after this date.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe present covers are replacements. The original upholstery fabric was probably the same as that seen on photographs of the matching settee taken in 1906, which had Genoa velvet in red, blue and black on a brown background. The gilt frame to the back is an unusual feature, which hides the edges of the upholstery. The surface finish on the chair frame is not original.",
