            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a mandarin duck. \n\nThe most widely used materials for making netsuke were traditionally wood or ivory. Since trees grow abundantly throughout Japan, wood is readily available and many varieties are comparatively cheap. There is also a long tradition of expertise in woodcarving in Japan. The small size of netsuke often makes identification of the wood used impossible. This example, however, can be identified as yew, a soft wood that was particularly used for its colour. Whereas the outer layer is creamy white, the centre is yellow to brown, with additional veining providing an attractive contrast. In Hida province yew was often worked in the relatively simple ittobori technique (\u2018carving with a single knife-stroke\u2019). This technique used simple, broad carving strokes instead of the more usual complex and intricate type of carving, and became a speciality of the region. This netsuke was produced in this way and is signed by the originator of the technique, Sukenaga.",
