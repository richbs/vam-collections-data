The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe 'Demokratischer Aufbruch' ('Democratic Awakening') was founded in 1989 as a Christian-conservative oriented opposition party in the GDR. Just shortly before the elections the then head of the party, Wolfgang Schnur, was convicted for being a long-standing spy for the GDR secret service and consequently had to resign. \n\nThe poster seeks to discredit the popular SPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands - Social Democratic Party of Germany) by associating it with the former ruling communist party, through a play on both parties' initials.\n\nThe Social-democratic Party was generally known by its initials, SPD. The ruling party of the previous communist regime, the SED, had reformed and renamed itself the PDS. Systematic attacks on political opponents were a feature of the election campaign introduced by West German political influence. The Alliance for Germany's smear campaign against the SPD, which commanded  53% of the vote in a poll published a month before the election, and was successful. The CDU won the most parliamentary votes with 41% of the vote, compared with 22% achieved by the SPD.\n\nThis poster with the words 'Stop SPDS' could have been applied in any of the election campaigns up until now. Even today - 20 years later - there are serious discussions about the scope of a possible collaboration with the PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism). On 4th August 1990 the DA merged with the CDU.\n\nThe Alliance for Germany was an opposition coalition formed on the 5th of February 1990 in then West-Berlin to stand for the 'Volkskammer' (People's Chamber) election. It got the majority of the seats and thus formed the interim-government until reunification with Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as Minister President.\n\nThe CDU, DSU (German Social Union) and DA (Democratic Awakening) were part of the Alliance. The political aims (reunification of Germany and reconstitution of the federal states) were mainly determined from the West German side of the CDU. The then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared at many election campaign activities for the East German CDU.",
