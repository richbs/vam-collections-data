It would have been used for creating Will Judge's illustrated headed notepaper.\n\nWill Judge was a well-known comedy-variety and pantomime artist  for over thirty years in the first half of the 20th century. Although he performed all over the British Isles and occasionally in London, he was best known in East Anglia and the North of England. He was born and lived in Beccles in Suffolk, but also lived in Blackpool. He made his first appearance in Beccles where he started his own  repertory company in a stable at the age of 14, and began his professional career touring East Anglia and the Midlands with Cyril Getcliffe's National Ladies' Choir. He played Dame in pantomime,  more as the elegant rather than the grotesque figure, and in 1912 married the soprano and Principal Boy Gertrude Orchard (1883-1947) appearing together in the Fulham Theatre 1912/13 production of The House That Jack Built as Miss Pippin the Village Daisy, and Jill the Squire's adopted daughter; and as Widow Twankey and the Fairy Queen in Aladdin at Cheltenham Opera House, 1915/16. Later in his career he also acted in plays, as in May 1931 in the Whitley Bay Playhouse  production of Walter Hackett's It Pays To Advertise, when he played George McChesney.",
