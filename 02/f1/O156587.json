He was a member of the Studio del Musaico at the Vatican but also worked independently. A large number of his signed mosaics have survived, many incorporating animals. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Montauban, the goldsmith responsible for the box, was described as a bijoutier-garnisseur, suggesting that much of his work involved mounting pieces by other craftsmen. \n\nThe subject of this box would have made it an ideal romantic gift. Cupid, the son of the goddess of love Venus, drives his mother's shell-shaped chariot. He spurs on the sea serpents with a feathery frond, following the lead of a dove.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
