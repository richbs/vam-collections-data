            "history_note": "The table, together with an accompanying reading, writing and music stand (1057-1882), was reputedly given to Eleanor Eden by Marie Antoinette in 1786. Eleanor Eden, later Lady Auckland, was married to the diplomat William Eden. The Edens visited Paris in 1786 to negotiate a trade agreement between Britain and France. William Eden\u2019s correspondence during the visit noted that Marie Antoinette was very attentive to Eleanor, supporting the family\u2019s account of a gift. Emily Eden, Eleanor\u2019s daughter, later attached a paper label to 1057-1882, stating: 'S\u00e8vres China Table / the gift of / Queen Marie Antoinette / to my mother - afterwards / Lady  Auckland / in 1786 / Emily Eden / 1852'.\n\nThe table was probably acquired from the Eden family by John Jones between 1862 and 1869.  In 1882 it was bequeathed by John Jones to the Museum, with the rest of his collection of French decorative arts.",

            "historical_context_note": "This worktable is designed with two purposes. The drawer in the upper tier was used to hold writing materials and is fitted with an ink well, sponge, and pounce pot (pounce was a powder used to dry ink). The lower tier, with its four divided compartments, was a sewing box. The porcelain plaque would have functioned as either a writing or sewing surface.\n\nSmall, multi-purpose furniture was highly fashionable in Paris in the second half of the 18th-century. Light and moveable, objects such as this were positioned against the wall when not in use. They could then move around the room depending on light, company or time of day. Designed to be in the latest taste, this kind of writing table was not a major investment in relation to other furniture. It could be refashioned or replaced when styles changed.  \n\nThe S\u00e8vres factory began supplying plaques for use on furniture in the 1750s. These plaques were usually sold to Paris\u2019 <i>marchands merciers</i> (dealers in luxury goods). The <i>marchands merciers</i> commissioned both the plaques and the furniture onto which they were set, acting as influential middle men between the luxury trades and fashionable patrons.  \n\nThe plaque on this table is labelled on its underside with a price of 216 livres. This makes it a relatively expensive plaque, its price equivalent to the annual salary of an unskilled worker. Martin Carlin died in 1785 but the table was certainly made by him.  Jean-Jacques Pafrat only became a master cabinet-maker in September of that year; the presence of his stamp suggests that he completed the piece.\n \nFashionable writing desks were personal furniture. Bought by both women and men, they were kept in bedrooms or cabinets. Within these personal spaces, the writing desk allowed its user, in this case a woman, a space for private business and relationships.",
