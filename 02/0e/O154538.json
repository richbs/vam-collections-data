            "physical_description": "Child's jacket of block-printed plain weave cotton, and lined with block-printed cotton. Lightly padded and quilted with cuff facings of block-printed cotton and pockets of roller-printed cotton.\n\nThe back has a central vertical panel and attached side panels to create flare. These are joined at waist level. The front of the jacket is made in a similar manner.\nThere are shoulder seams and the sleeves are attached at right angles to the main panel. The sleeves are seamed only around the area of the elbow and then hang open. The sides are seamed only from the waist to just below the armpit and this leaves a diamond-shaped opening under both arms. The sides are edged with blue cotton and are held halfway down their length by two interlaced loops. The brightly coloured pocket can be seen between the side panels. The blue binding continues around the hem and up the centre front opening as far as the waist. The coat fastens left over right with a cord button on the left and a loop attached 13 cm in from the front edge. There is a small stand-up collar and a pocket at each side.\n\nWhite ground with a repeating pattern of lozenges formed by small flowers and leaves with a small flower head at each junction. The lozenges contain small floral sprays with five different versions. Colours: blue, red and black.\n\nLined with a coarse cream ground with a repeating pattern of lozenges formed by small flowers and leaves with  a small flower head at each junction. The lozenges contain small floral sprays with five different versions but these are not similar to those in the main fabric. Colours: brown, olive green and black. Inside the right sleeve is a small section from another fabric and it is block-printed and hand-woven plain weave cotton patterned with a small diaper and stylised flower heads in black and red.\n\nThe pocket is in fine roller-printed plain weave machine-woven cotton. The ground is two shades of red with an overall pattern of roses and botehs and leaves in bright green with white , blue and yellow details. The quilting is worked in vertical lines with white cotton stitching.",
