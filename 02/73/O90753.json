It was probably commissioned by his father, Sir John Musters, who had a number of courtly connections. The memorial was originally in the parish church of St Mary, Hornsey in Middlesex, which was demolished (apart from the tower) in 1831.  \n\nThe sculptor, Caius Gabriel Cibber was born in Denmark but became one of the leading sculptors active in Britain in the late seventeenth century. In this relief, the finely carved lace cravat and the buoyant putti indicate the sculptor's Continental training.",
