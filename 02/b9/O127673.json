William Henry Hunt was responsible for a whole series. Two were of black children, exhibited at the Old Water-Colour Society in London with the titles 'Jim Crow' (1837) and 'Miss Jem-Ima Crow' (1839). Lithographs after them were subsequently published in a volume of 'Hunt\u2019s Comic Sketches' mainly composed of images of white children aping their elders \u2026 In this collection the two watercolours of black children were given obviously comic titles: 'Master James Crow \u2013 Out of his Element' and Miss Jim-Ima Crow \u2013 a West Indian Cinderella'. Both must have been painted from living models posed and surrounded with studio \u2018props\u2019 to suggest a story. The boy, out of his element (the sun), warms himself in front of a stove.
