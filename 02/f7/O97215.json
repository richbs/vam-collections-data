Raymond, the translator of Ghulam Husayn's history, gives the following acount of him: 'Gurghin-qhan was a man born at Ispahan, the capital of Persia, and had a very remarkable physiognomy. He was above the ordinary size, strong built, with a very fair complexion, large black eyes, full of fire, an aquiline nose, forming a ridge in the middle of its length, and eyebrows very arched, that joined together, so as to form a point going downwards towards the nose . . .\nNothing was wanting to that man to render him capable of shining, even in Europe, but education; he owed everything to his own genius, and nothing to art or cultivation.'\n(Husayn [1789] II, p.503fn).",
