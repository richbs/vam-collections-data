Cut in an 'A' line style similar to a coat called 'MELBOURNE' and it has a narrow fit to the shoulders widening out gradually to the hem. The front and back are cut without a waistseam. The front edges are rounded off at the hem. The back is cut with a centre back seam and two side seams with a vent to the centre back and two pleats either side finished at the waist lines by a button. A pocket is let into each of the side pleats. The sleeves are very full tapering to a narrow cuff with one button.\n\nThe inside is quilted around the shoulders and chest. Rather more on the left than the right side suggesting that original owner has some slight deformity. Lined with black satin throughout except for the sleeves which are of blue and white striped cotton. Two inside breast pockets.",
