Princess Charlotte sometimes resented their presence, describing the gaunt Dowager Countess of Rosslyn and her nieces, the Cotes sisters, as \u2018Famine & the consequences\u2019.  Only eighteen months later Charlotte Cotes took part in the funeral procession for Princess Charlotte whose death in childbirth aroused a nationwide expression of grief. Henry Brougham, the statesman, wrote: \u2018it really was as though every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child\u2019.",

Princess Charlotte sometimes resented their presence, describing the gaunt Dowager Countess of Rosslyn and her nieces, the Cotes sisters, as \u2018Famine & the consequences\u2019.  For the wedding the two Cotes sisters received a set of peridot jewels and a set of amethyst jewels, but it is not certain which set each sister received.  Only eighteen months later Charlotte Cotes took part in the funeral procession for Princess Charlotte whose death in childbirth aroused a nationwide expression of grief. \n\nIn Rundell\u2019s invoice,  which is in the Royal Archives at Windsor, the entry for the peridot (described as chrysolite) and amethyst sets of jewellery is dated 3 April 1816, and the parts of each set are listed and costed.  The chrysolite jewels cost \u00a3240 9s, the amethysts \u00a3298 15s.   \n\nThe Cotes sisters, Charlotte and Lucy, were the daughters of John Cotes (1749-1821), M.P., of Woodcote, Shropshire, by his first wife, the Hon. Lucy Courtenay (died 1786), daughter of William Courtenay, 1st Viscount Courtenay. Her sister, Charlotte Courtenay, the future \u2018Old Famine\u2019, married Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rossyln (created 1801) in 1782.  He died in 1805.\n\nThe set of peridots passed by descent  and by marriage to a lady who generously donated it to an auction held on 10 November, 2012 (lot 220), organised by the Community of the Resurrection, Mirfield, in aid of the Community.  It was subsequently the subject of an export licence application by the new owner.  A licence was deferred and the owner subsequently agreed to sell the set to the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
