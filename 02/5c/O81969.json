Charles I (ruled 1625\u201349) probably acquired the original with the collection of Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga, later Duke of Mantua. Although the Gonzaga inventory of 1627 did not list it as by Fetti, he has always been known to be the artist. The painting was sold from the Royal Collection in 1652, after Charles I was executed. It was recovered at the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and hung in the Long Matted Gallery at Whitehall.

Although not listed as by Fetti in the 1627 Gonzaga inventory, it was always known to be by him. The confusion with Domechino in the inscription is merely clerical. In 1652 the painting was sold from the Royal Collection, but was recovered at the Restoration and hung in the Long Matted Gallery at Whitehall. It was presumably there that Flatman made his copy. Subsequently, as Michael Levey points out, the painting was enlarged to serve as an over-door at Hampton Court, where it was recorded in the List of Her Majesties Pictures in Kensington Hampton Court and Windsor Castle compiled during the reign of Queen Anne.\u201d\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1937</u>, London: Board of Education, 1938. </i>P.90-1937 Purchased from the funds of the R.H.
