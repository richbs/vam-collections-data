Since the mid eighties the artist's work has been concerned with the lives of urban women and their spaces (the home, work and society). In the early 90s, she shifted her work from the two-dimensional space of painting and printmaking to the three- dimensional space of sculpture and multimedia installations. Today, the artist addresses her concerns through performance videos. The artist lives and works in Mumbai.",

Since the mid eighties the artist's work has been concerned with the lives of urban women and their spaces (the home, work and society). In the early 90s, she shifted her work from the two-dimensional space of painting and printmaking to the three- dimensional space of sculpture and multimedia installations. Today, the artist addresses her concerns through performance videos. The artist lives and works in Mumbai.",
