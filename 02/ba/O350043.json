It is often hard to discover the originals of these replicas because the antique portraits of such figures existed in many versions.\n\nFrancis Harwood (born about 1727; died 1783) spent 30 years working first in Rome and then in Florence. He specialised in carving busts and figures after the antique, including the 'Venus de' Medici' and the 'Apollo Belvedere'. The sculptor Joseph Nollekens (1737-1823) wrote in a letter from Rome in 1769 in his idiosyncratic style: 'there is F.H. at Florence who is knocking the marbil about like feway, &amp; belive he as got more work to do than any One Sculptor in England'.",
