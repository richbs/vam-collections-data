Scofield played Lear for the RSC in 1962, directed by Peter Brook.  \u2018This production brings me closer to Lear than I have ever been; from now on, I not only know him but can place him in his harsh and unforgiving world\u2019, wrote Kenneth Tynan (Observer, 11 November 1962). Scofield\u2019s towering performance was re-created for the screen when Brook directed a film of the play, released in 1971. This was not intended as a film of the stage version, though it used several of the RSC production\u2019s leading players. It was shot on location in the snow-covered landscapes of North Jutland, Denmark, during the winter of 1968-1969. Filmed in black and white, play and setting matched each other in bleakness. The most frequently reproduced stills from the film show Scofield glowering from beneath this fur hat.",
