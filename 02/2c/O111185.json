Elvis records reached the top of the charts more than any other artist's; he achieved an unrivalled ten consecutive Number 1 hits, and was second only to The Beatles in total number of Number 1 hits. \n\nThis frosted glass head is an example of 1970s Elvis memorabilia, possibly produced after his death. Since several Elvis experts have never seen a similar example, it is possible that it was made as a prototype but never manufactured.  Elvis merchandising fetches high prices at sale today but items worn or owned by him, or associated with his live appearances, are the most sought-after by fans. There is almost no limit to prices that keen fans will pay at auction for cars he drove or items he wore.",
