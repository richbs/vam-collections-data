It is made of pashmina (hair of the Kashmir goat) which has been expertly spun and woven to produce a shawl of exceptional fineness. It is almost as transparent as muslin, and is thus very fragile, although it is in remarkably good condition. This is the type of shawl that was first brought to Britain at the end of the 18th century, and has the small sprigged borders typical of the time.",
