This group of semi-mythical personages is a favourite subject in China and began to appear regularly on all types of objects in the fourteenth century.\n\nThe 'Eight' are not always shown together. Sometimes only the personal emblems they carry are depicted. These identifying objects are bamboo tube drum and sticks for the Immortal Zhang Guolao, a fan for Zhongli Quan, a flute for Han Xiangzi, a lotus for He Xiangu, a basket for Lan Caihe, a crutch and a bottle gourd for Li Tieguai, a sword and fly-whisk for Lu Dongbin and castanets for Cao Guojiu. Some of these emblems can be seen on other textiles in the exhibition. They are not always easy to pick out as they often become part of a large repertoire of decorative shapes and do not always look like the original forms.\n\nIn China, the colour red is used on joyful occasions. The colour of these roundels has faded through age to an orange colour. The roundels are the right size and shape for pillow ends but we do not know if that was what they were used for. The careful embroidery, with each figure framed by a different landscape setting, is mostly executed in untwisted silk thread. This gives the roundels a soft glossiness as they catch the light. Some gold-wrapped thread has also been used."

These semi-mythical figures are a favourite subject in China and began to appear on all types of objects in the 14th century.\n\nZhang Guolao is sometimes also depicted riding a donkey. Here, in his arms he is carrying his identifying implement, a bamboo tube with two rods known as the fish drum. The percussions produced by the fish drums are believed to facilitate divination and help to tell one's fortunes.",
