The centre of each panel and of the blouse back is decorated with a vertical line of embroidery in black, mauve, red and green wools in back and looped-cross stitches. A second band of embroidery runs round the gathered part of the skirt 7.5 inches above the hem and this consists of 1.25 inch of white embroidery in chain stitch with sequins and 1.5 inches of embroidery with black, red, mauve and green wool, white cotton and silver-gilt thread in double-running, satin and chain stitches.
