The outer limbs are also china, the arms probably to the shoulders, with the right hand open and the left hand clenched; the legs are china to the knee, with red garters and shoes indicated; the body is probably of wood.\nThe doll wears court dress, with feathers and lappets in her hair.  The trained gown is said to have been made from a piece of cream Irish poplin of a pattern presented to Queen Victoria by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.  The woven fabric incorporates silver and brown silk roses and silver thistles with an arcaded pattern of shamrocks and oak leaves.  The gown is lined with a pale green fabric, with a skirt lining of glazed white holland.  It is trimmed on the bodice with a knot of pearls with a pendant loop, and a bertha of black machine made lace mounted on white tulle; and at the hem with a border of black machine lace.  The petticoat is of white satin with a frilled overskirt of white tulle trimmed with two white satin bows, and the underskirt is of white cotton; the drawers are knee length",
