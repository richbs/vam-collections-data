The History of Jack and the Beanstalk, was printed in 1807 by the London bookseller and printer Benjamin Tabart, although the story was in existence much earlier.\n\nThe British set and costume designer Hugh Durrant designed made this set model for E&B Productions, which specialised in producing pantomimes in theatres throughout the country. Once a production closed the scenery and costumes were stored to be re-used in a different town the following Christmas when the pantomime would be updated and the costumes and sets refurbished as necessary. In 1999 the Company was purchased by Qdos, Britain's largest pantomime producers in the early 21st century. High Durrant's work covers a wide range of theatre including pantomime, dance, opera, musical theatres, concerts and film and television and over fourteen productions for London's Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park.",
