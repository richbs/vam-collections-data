Nash was one of the more prolific artists working with this medium, whereby a picture is made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper. \n\nHistorical Association\nThis view of the colonial exhibits shows that, as well as works of art and manufacture, a large number of natural resources were on display, including minerals, fruit and vegetables.  The aim was to impress the visitor by the quality of colonial produce.  The comparatively few artefacts on display emphasised the importance of these countries to Britain as sources of raw materials and as new markets for their manufactured goods.  The official catalogue described Australia, for example, as 'the most extensive wool-producing country in the world', with valuable exports to Britain.\n\nThe British and colonial exhibits were grouped together in the western branch of the prestigious main avenue, while  other countries' exhibits were on the east.",
