Above the two horizontal channels are, to the right of the vertical channel, four near squares (1'3\" x 1'2\" or 35 cms x 39 cms) and to the left, two and two half squares. On both sides the inside, lower square with its cream ground is dissected by a tree and its sturdy branches in blue from which hang leaves in various colours. This design is repeated in the diagonally opposite squares.\n\nThe outer lower square and part square have a light red ground bearing an eight-pointed blue star within which are two light red and two cream rosettes and four purple and yellow lilies, with a small yellow flower at the star's centre. The star is framed by four right-angled stems with light blue flowers and green leaves. This design is repeated in the upper diagonal squares with yellow rather than red rosettes and with a central red flower. \n\nAbove the horizontal channels and along both sides of the vertical is a narrow, light green border with a dark green angular meander with red leaves. Between these borders and the \"garden plots\" is a wider, dark blue band with a series of stylised floral sprigs interspersed with a square formed by four leaves, largely in red or light blue, joined centrally by a small yellow square.  The narrow red and light green sprigs, which along the horizontal have no flowers, have a yellow flowerhead along the vertical, but along every border the stiff, white-leaf plants have a yellow flowerhead.",
