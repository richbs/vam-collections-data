            "physical_description": "The lowest 12 cm of the post is of square section, 8.5 x 8.5 cm. Above this the shaft is chamfered to create an equal octagon to about 33.5 cm above the base. A deep plainly carved collar is above this and from that rises a narrower, almost circular, shaft, the surface carved with lozenge shapes to suggest plaited rush or tape. A central collar, about 140 cm above the base, is decorated on its outermost moulding with chevron carving. Above this the post is carved with an elongated trellis enclosing lozenges carved with formal leaf shapes. A plain collar above this forms the bottom section of a plain octagonal capital, 8.5 cm high overall. \n\nThe base is heavily wormed on one side and a missing section in the centre and towards one side has been filled with 2 modern blocks of wood, about 8 cm long and 2.5 cm square. These help to provide a stable base for the post. A drilled hole in the original post runs diagonally 'through' this replaced section and presumably originally housed a peg. One of the octagonal sides of the base section shows the heads of two handmade nails. The top of the post is drilled for a dowel in the centre to a depth of about 1 cm. To one side of this is a shallow slot about 3 cm x 1 cm. One side of the octagonal top is fitted with a mirror plate for display and there is evidence that this was once fitted to a different side of the top, which also shows two nails driven into the wood. \n\nThis was traditionally called a bedpost but there is no evidence to support this. The surface is quite weathered and it might even have come from the exterior of a house.",
