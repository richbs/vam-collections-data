Rarely, however, are his works completely abstract. In this expansive lithograph Hodgkin evokes the exuberance and inventiveness of 18th-century Indian chintz hangings, which were large enough to cover entire walls. There are many examples in the Museum's collection. Bleeding is also an interesting example of the contribution that professional printers can make to an image. Hodgkin was very particular about the hand colouring of this work and demonstrated his wishes to Cinda Sparling, who then, in the printing process went on to contribute her own marks. Nevertheless, the result is a print of great vibrancy and freshness.",

London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Howard HODGKIN (b. 1932)\nBleeding, 1982\n(TG36)\nInscribed in pencil <i>HH82</i> and <i>25/100.</i>\n91.8 X 151.5cm\nLithograph from three plates coloured by hand (a green wash, an orange to red blend, sap green and crimson).\nE.99-1986\nTG=Tate Gallery, <i>Howard Hodgkin Prints 1977-1983</i>, London, 1985.\n\nThe post-war period has seen a breaking down of the once rigid conventions, as to what are and what are not, acceptable methods for artist to use in making prints.  In recent years hand-colouring had been enjoying a revival in the prints of some of the West's leading contemporary artists.  For a painter, hand-colouring on his prints, whether done by himself or by an assistant, is among a myriad of options available to him in creating an original print.  The American Jim Dine has sometimes produced prints in plain or coloured versions similar to the traditional marketing of hand-coloured prints, but the use of hand-colouring is somewhat different in the prints of the British artist Howard Hodgkin.  Of forty-three prints made between 1977 and 1983, all but six are partly hand-coloured.  This additional colouring is essentially part of the image.  It was carried out in all but one case by an assistant, Cinda Sparling.  Hodgkin does not paint a master copy for her to work from; rather he directs her work, stipulating the effect he wants, which, once established through trial attempts, she then applies to the whole edition.\nIn this print, there is a mixture of printed marks which capture the gestures Hodgkin made, and actual painted marks carried out under his direction.\nHodgkin's works can look to the casual observer nearly or entirely abstract but they derive from specific situations.  Through the use of colours applied with a variety of touch, Hodgkin's paintings are records of actual occasions or encounters and the emotions and sensations that have surrounded them for the artist.  His prints, although involving a number of stages in their production rather than the immediate creation involved in making a painting, bear the same relation to the artist's experience.\"",
