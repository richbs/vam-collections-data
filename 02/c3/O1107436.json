            "history_note": "This engraving featured in Thomas Bewick's first major independent publication, <i>A General History of Quadrupeds</i>, first printed and published in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1790. The publication contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces. \n\nThe text accompanying the illustration (in the publication) reads as follows: \n\n'<i>THE SMALL WATER-SPANIEL is similar to the other</i> [The Large Water Spaniel]<i> in form, habits, and disposition; and its capacity for receiving instruction is equally good. With looks of extreme attention and sensibility, it observes the motion of its master, and catches the well-known signal with amazing promptitude. \nThe various tricks which these Dogs are sometimes taught to perform, seem more like the effect of reasoning powers, than of undiscerning instinct.</i>' \n\nTaken from: Beilby, Ralph and Bewick, Thomas. <u>A General History of Quadrupeds</u>. Newcastle upon Tyne. Third Edition, 1792.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.",
