Little and the music composed by Billy Baskette and Joseph Santly. The song was performed by Miss Teddie Gerard (1890-1942), published by Herman Darewski Music Publishing Co, London ca. 1917.\n\nBubbly opened at the Comedy Theatre in May 1917 and featured twelve sketches, or  'Bubbles', as they were billed. The public loved the light and frothy mixture of songs and sketches  which were a much-needed antidote to the gloomy news about World War 1. The cast included the  25-year old Jack Hulbert, who went on to become a star of musical comedy. Bubbly was produced  by Andr\u00e9 Charlot, the Frenchman who was one of the most prolific 20th century West End  producers. He became famous for his series of intimate revues, some co-produced by the great  showman C.B.Cochran.",
