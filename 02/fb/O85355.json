The earliest instance appears in the design on a dish from the 1530s, but is more frequent on objects made in the second half of the 16th century. The ships are typically vessels rigged with triangular shaped sails, known as a 'lateen-rigged' or 'latin-rigged', a reference to their popularity in the Mediterranean, but were also the standard type used by Arab traders in the Indian Ocean.The striped design of the sales may suggest the stitched panels of the original sail cloth.\n  \nThe shape of this flat dish or tray with its narrow flattened rim is copied from metalwork, a form which seems to have originated in 15th century Turkoman Anatolia and was usually made of Finned copper.",
