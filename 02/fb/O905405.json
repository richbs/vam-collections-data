No. 27, Charles Street, Birmingham.\n\n<b>Description.</b>--A catalogue of tools for the gold and silver-smith's trades.   9\u00bd in. by 7\u00bd in., 38 plates, some folded.   No date.   Two water marks : L. Taylor and a design : Fleur de lys with G. R. under.   Bound in stiff boards with leather back.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--Files, tools and engines for clock and watchmakers and for the trades mentioned, engine, oval and common lathes, rollers or flatting mills, scales.\n\n   The title page (reproduced as frontispiece to this catalogue) is a beautiful bit of work, but unfortunately the list carries no indication of the period.   Its shape and size represent a departure from the hitherto accepted shape, and consequently the volume is more convenient to handle than some of those already described.   Each plate is mounted on a gurad, and a special feature is the set of folding plates showing watch and clockmakers' latehs with wooden wheels.   From these it may be gathered that some form of automatic screw-cutting movement had been invented at the time.   According to the title page the firm made also steelyards and \" machines for weighing waggons, etc.\"   It is further added :--\n   N.B.--To give a draft of every particular Article would swell the Book to an unreasonable Bulk, we have therefore selected the most useful, and hope with the assistance of the list of Prices our correspondents will form a clear Idea of <sup>e</sup>-<sub>y</sub> whole.\"\nUnfortunately the list of prices has not come down with the plates.   <i>See illustration, frontispiece.</i>\"",
