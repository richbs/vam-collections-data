They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  It is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nThis cross was described as 18th century, from Normandy, when it was given to the museum in 1911.  It is shaped like a croix de Saint-L\u00f4, and has hollow silver facetted bosses, like a traditional croix bosse, but the smooth backs of the bosses suggest that it is a croix Capucine or Maintenon from Provence. It is unmarked, but probably dates from the late 18th or early 19th century.",
