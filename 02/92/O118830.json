Details such as the age, occupation, status or even gender of the doll would be suggested by its clothing.  This doll has the standard baluster-shaped body with a flattened back favoured by English dollmakers of the period, flat wooden arms, and wedge-shaped feet.  Most of these features would have been invisible because the doll would normally be clothed.  Her body shape would have suited contemporary female fashions but could also adapt to other garments.  Some of the garments which survive with the doll are for women or girls, such as stays, petticoats, a pocket and a comb, but in about 1800 she was re-dressed with a different identity. Her outer garments are all loose fitting, and the simple dress of white linen is open all the way down the back, an indicator of clothing for a baby or young child.",
