This copy drawing is unfinished, and its design may possibly be of his own invention. The bottom edge of the frieze is defined by a band of reed moulding tied with ribbon. This is only partly sketched and, unlike the rest of the drawing, has not been overdrawn in ink. The frieze consists of palmettes alternating with oval cartouches, surmounted by a ribbon bow and a smaller flower cartouche. The left-hand oval cartouche contains a female mask. These are supported by a calyx moulding and linked to the palmettes by scrolling lines, which terminate in rosettes below the palmettes.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
