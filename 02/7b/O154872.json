Karl was one of the most prolific designers of the time, as adept at designing historical productions for the great actor-managers as creating musical comedies.  He worked at the costume makers Nathan\u2019s, who provided costumes for a wide range of stage shows, notably musical comedies.  These were on widely diverse subjects and called for dozens of lavish costumes, ranging from shop girls to royalty, gypsies to heiresses, street clothes and military uniforms.  \nThe huge success of Anthony Hope's the Prisoner of Zenda in 1894 spawned innumerable offpring, including several musical comedies, including The King of Cadonia in 1908.  This had a typical Ruritanian plot including a king who disguises himself by simply shaving off his moustache, murderous consipritors, a Princess betrothed to the King, whom she does not wish to marry, but who falls in love with him not knowing who he is.  The King meanwhile infiltrates the conspiritors (who also fail to recognise him) and wins their confidence, so that when he reveals himself they become his supporters, enabling him to regain his throne and marry his Princess.  The production had a healthy run of 333 performances.  \nDozens of costumes were needed, many on a theme like military or court costumes - and to create sufficient variation and distinguish various functions and factions required a particular talent, which Karl certainly possessed.  He produced endless lavish contrasting costumes - elaborate court dresses and military uniforms, picturesque male peasants owing much to Hungarian and Balkan sources, chic peasant girls, court officials, sailors - the men sporting flourishing moustaches.  It was the combination of ingenuity and efficiency in producing so many costumes to order that made Karl an invaluable part of Nathan's for nearly fifty years.",
