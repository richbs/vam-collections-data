Apparently painting portraits and giving drawing lessons at the age of 16. Received some tuition from Mather Brown in about 1822, and moved to London where he was encouraged by Sir Thomas Lawrence. His portrait practice in London seems to have been successful: he painted some of the distinguished people of the day, for example, the art patron Robert Vernon (RA 1827). Exhibited 22 portraits at the RA between 1823 and 1845, 13 works (mostly 'fancy' pictures) at the BI 1824-46, and seven at the SBA 1830-32/3. In 1833 he and the portrait painter Benjamin Faulkner (1787-1849) returned to Manchester for a long visit, working in the studio of the landscape painter Charles Calvert, whose daughter Bradley married. Finally settled permanently in Manchester 1847. He died, apparently in poverty, 4 July 1857. \n\nLIT: <i>L'Artiste Paris</i> 1857, p153 (obit, as William Brandley) \n\n<b>Early Fruit</b> \n694-1891 Neg HB2554 \nCanvas, 74.3 x 61 cm (29\u00bc x 24 ins) \nGiven by T H Wilkinson 1891 \n\nNot identifiable with any exhibited work, but presumably typical of Bradley's 'fancy' pictures such as the 'Flower Girl' exhibited at the BI in 1827.\"",
