The body of the vessel is formed as a circular drum from two die stamped circular halves, joined by a folded over seam, internally.  Each side panel is embellished with three concentric mouldings.  The milk jug is stabilised by a flat strip of silver, the edges slightly tapered, attached at an angle to the front.  The bottom edge of the handle stabilises the vessel at the rear.  The handle is of kingwood, square in cross section and curved to the same radius as the vessel.  It is attached to the body by a flat strip of silver at either end in the form of a T shaped section and secured by a pin.  The opposite end of the connecting strip is perpendicular to the curved wall.  The spout of the milk jug is composed of triangular side panels, separated by a narrow strip with a semi circular rim at the apex.\n[Lid (from a tea service)] The lid is a curved strip of silver which follows the radius of the body.  It is retained by an internal flange and an additional angled flange at the back which fits under the edge of the mouth of the body, so that the lid does not tilt forward as the vessel is poured.  The kingwood knop is an inverted triangle, attached to the lid by a pin through its centre and retained on the underside of the lid by a circular, threaded nut.",

            "public_access_description": "H. G. Murphy (1884-1939) was a pupil of Henry Wilson at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and then studied briefly under Emil Lettr\u00e9 in Berlin.  In 1913 he established his own workshop in London.  From 1907, alongside running his own workshop, he taught at the Royal College of Art and later at the Central School.  He was the first silversmith to be appointed Principal of the Central School.\n\nThis service was published in Design for Today Vol.II, p.300, (London 1934) with the following commentary:\n\nDESIGN IN SILVER\n\nThe exhibition of English silversmiths' work at the Victoria and Albert Museum arranged by the Museum Authorities and the Council for Art and Industry, traces the development of design as shown in silver by examples of ancient and modern side by side.  The modern examples, with some exceptions, are of traditional form shorn of embellishement.  Here and there the designer has wavered, adding a little beading along the rim or a little engraving.\n\nWe illustrate a tea set designed by H.G. Murphy, of 58 Weymouth Street, which won the highest award at the Milan Exhibition of 1933.  The design may at first sight seem deliberately eccentric, but its shape is in fact dictated by the method of machine manufacture.

The modern examples, with some exceptions, are of traditional form shorn of embellishement.  Here and there the designer has wavered, adding a little beading along the rim or a little engraving.\n\nWe illustrate a tea set designed by H.G. Murphy, of 58 Weymouth Street, which won the highest award at the Milan Exhibition of 1933.  The design may at first sight seem deliberately eccentric, but its shape is in fact dictated by the method of machine manufacture.  It cost \u00a320, which we understand is much less than a corresponding set manufactured by old methods would cost.  The lids lift off completely thus dispensing with hinges which must be hand-made.
