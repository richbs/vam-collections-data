Small boxes to contain the powder were made in their thousands, from the most luxurious to the everyday. This box is of a type that was produced in France by a semi-industrial process in the early 19th century.  Boxes were turned out of maple or burr birch, and then steamed to soften them. They were then put into screw presses where finely worked metal dies stamped scenes or motifs into them.\n\nMost of the scenes used to decorate the boxes related to current topical events.  This scene, titled 'LARRIVEE DANS LISLE DE SCIOTO' [The Arrival in the Island of Scioto] celebrates the hopes of French investors who bought land in Ohio in the United States of America from the Compagnie du Scioto.  They arrived in the United States to find that the promised city in the region of the Scioto river did not exist.",

There were at least two subsequent attempts to revive the company and in 1792 218 investors arrived in Alexandria, Virginia, to find that no land was allocated to them.  However, during the 1790s, the Ohio Company did sell land to the settlers and in 1798 Congress granted land to the community (the French Grant), close to the Scioto river. Five hundred settlers arruved in 1800 and in 1803 the Company founded the city of Worthington, Ohio.",
