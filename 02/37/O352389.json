The broadest band is decorated with four angular \"boteh\" motifs brocaded with red wool and white cotton. The upper part has a red ground. There are tapestry-woven wedges down each side (brown and green) and these are topped with a brocaded, diagonal band of pink/white or blue/white flowerheads. There is a flowerhead in the triangles formed by these wedges and bands. In the centre there are two vertical rows of disconnected black zigzags. In between these are bars and brocaded rosettes.\n\nThe sides are turned and stitched and covered with a blue and white braid. The upper and lower edges are turned and stitched. The turning at the top is large (1.5 inch/4 cms) and suggests that the total length has been adjusted. Two cords of plaited red and blue wool are attached to the upper corners for fastening around the waist.",
