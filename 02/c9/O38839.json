The front shows Noddy driving up to the police station in his car; outside are a teddy bear and a black and white cat, with a ladybird running away in the distance; the wording reads\nYOU ARE 6 TODAY\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY !\nwith the enlarged figure six printed in gold.  Inside is an illustration of an unlocked cell, with a golliwog being brought cake, flowers and a present by Noddy and some other toys, with a policeman joining in and another looking in through a barred window; the verse reads:\nA birthday for someone ?  Why, it's you !\nAnd here comes Noddy to say,\nHe brings you good wishes and greetings too\nOn this happy and wonderful day !\nA tab mechanism provides additional elements to both illustrations: at the front, a policeman in the doorway of the station, with policeman in a bus emerging from behind the building; inside, a line of marching policemen, and a teddy bear looking in through the barred window.",
