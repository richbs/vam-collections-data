This is a rare example of a room decorated in the Gothic Revival style of the 18th century. It was called the Strawberry Room. The house was altered again in the 19th century and the architectural parts of the room were given to the Museum when the house was demolished in 1953.\n\nPeople\nHorace Walpole influenced the style of the room as he was a friend of the owner, Thomas Barrett.  Walpole had already altered his own house at Strawberry Hill near London in the Gothic style and he wrote about Lee Priory, 'You will see a child of Strawberry prettier than the parent...There is a delicious closet, too, so flattering to me'.\n\nDesign & Designing \nThe room's architect, James Wyatt, was adventurous and eccentric and excelled at the Gothic style so admired during this period. Wyatt designed the ceiling with applied wooden tracery in imitation of stone fan-vaulting seen in Medieval churches, and shaped the mantelpiece like a Gothic arch. The woodwork was painted a pale stone colour. Originally, there was a window at the end opposite the cupboards.",
