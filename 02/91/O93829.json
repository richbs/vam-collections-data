Houses (under construction) south side of Princes Gardens in background. 112 x 81 mm  PH 457-1968:595 Literature:  Microfilm: 3.19.543 Also:ed. Graham Ovenden, Clementina Lady Hawarden, 1974, p.44. The Golden Age of British Photography, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1984. The balcony overlooking Princes Gardens was often used by Lady Hawarden as a setting for photography. By photographing through the open window she gave some of these images a dramatic thrust and enhanced the illusion that the balcony is a small detached platform floating above the ground. This effect comes to the fore in this photograph, which is of Lady Hawarden's eldest daughter and her cousin, Henry Brougham Loch, 1st Lord Loch (1827-1900). In the distance, across Princes Gardens, the houses on the south side of the square are still under construction, fixing the date to the summer of 1861. [Rate books. Information courtesy Mrs Jeanne Pingree, formerly Archivist, Imperial College, University of London.J Though Loch is not identified by an inscription on this or any other photograph in the Hawarden collection, his identity has been established through an inscribed carte-de-visite by Camille Silvy. [Photograph Collection, DP&D, V&A Museum. Pressmark X21, 850.J] In 1861, Loch was a celebrity. A distinguished soldier, he was attached as private secretary to Lord Elgin's embassies to China and Japan from 1857 to 1860, when he survived being taken prisoner by the Chinese during the Second Opium War.

[Reproduced in Isobel Crombie, 'China 1860: A Photographic Album by Felice Beato', History of Photography, 2:36.] Loch appears in more of Lady Hawarden's photographs than anyone outside her immediate family, indicating that they were close friends. As a child, she lived with the Loch family during the period when her parents were away in the Caribbean.
