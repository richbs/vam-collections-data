Said to have come from Dannat, near Clermont Ferrand in South-East France at acquisition, it has been revealed by Williamson that it originates from the celebrated church of Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand, in western France. There are two partially preserved orders from the same arch in the Muse\u00e9-Saint-Croix in Poitiers, coming from the same church. The inner arch contains the same luxuriant foliage, while the second order encloses the figure of St. Christopher and seated above is the now headless figure of St Martin of Tours. Likewise he holds a scroll in his hands with the Greek inscription 'epikeya'.\nSaint-Hilaire-le-Grand in Poitiers, dedicated to the forth-century bishop of the city, is one of the most famous churches of western France, well-known above all for its romanesque capitals and wall-paintings. The 11th and 12th century building remained practically unmodified through the Gothic period until the tenure of the powerful Robert Poitevin as 'Tr\u00e9sorier' of Saint-Hilaire, a post he held from 1449 until his death in 1474. Between these dated he built a splendid new principal entrance to the church. This portal must once have been among the most impressive of late gothic doorways of France.
