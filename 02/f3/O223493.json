There is no similar object in the Museum and the price is low. Very similar decoration appears in some panelling in the Palais de Justice, Dijon. See Sauvageot, <u> Palais de France</u>; p. 81. pl. 12,13.'. In an earlier memo (dated 23 October) it was noted that the ceiling was 'Bought in the neighbourhood of Toulouse'.
