            "public_access_description": "Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, (1675-1741) was a painter who, together with Sebastiano Ricci and Jacopo Amigoni, was among the most important Venetian history painters of the early 18th century. From 1708-1713 Pellegrini was in England, where his first task was probably the decoration (destr.) of the stair-well in the Duke of Manchester\u2019s house in Arlington Street, London. He also designed sets for the opera and a cupola in Castle Howard, N. Yorkshire (largely destroyed by fire in 1941) with a dramatic painting of the Fall of Phaeton. Pellegrini enjoyed considerable success in England where he was popular with the aristocracy and was appointed one of the directors of Kneller\u2019s Academy in 1711.\nIn 1710 Sir James Thornhill and Pellegrini were asked to produce a painted model for the decoration of the inside of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral with subjects from the Acts of the Apostles. The Commissioners appear to have deliberated for many years but finally selected Thornhill to paint the dome in 1715. While P.24-1953 may not have been Pellegrini's actual entry, as it does not derive its subject from the Acts, it was probably painted in connection with the competition and possibly for the artist's own use. This is one of Pellegrini's earliest oil sketches and is exceptional in being dated, however it lacks the brilliant brush strokes of his later works and has an overall muted appearance.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 214-215, cat. no. 269A.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nGiovanni Antonio PELLEGRINI (1675-1741) \nItalian (Venetian) School \nBorn at Venice, he studied under Pagani and was influenced by Luca Giordano and Sebastiano Ricci. He came to England with Marco Ricci in 1708 at the request of the Earl of Manchester and he remained here until 1713. He travelled considerably in the next decade, working in D\u00fcsseldorf and the Low Countries, visiting England again in 1719 and Paris in the following year. He died in Venice in 1741. \n\n269A \nDESIGN FOR THE DECORATION OF A DOME: THE ADORATION OF THE TRINITY \nSigned and dated on the back\n<i>Pellegrini pinxit 1710</i> \nCanvas \nSize of stretcher 23 \u00bc  X 24 (59 x 61) \nDiam. of painted dome 22 (56) \nP.24-1953\n\nOn 3 March 1709 the Commissioners for the Fabric of St Paul's Cathedral ordered that 'the inside of the Dome be painted with figures, but confined to the Scripturall History taken from the Acts of the Apostles, and that such Painters as are willing to undertake the same, do bring their Designs and proposalls .. on the 5th Day of April next.' On that day the Commissioners received designs by Thornhill, Pellegrini, J. B. Catenaro, Pierre Berchet and Louis Ch\u00e9ron. The last three dropped out soon afterwards, and at a meeting of the Commissioners on 11 February 1710 only Pellegrini and Thornhill were asked to paint models of the dome. It has been said (A. F. Bolton in <i>Wren Society</i>, xv, 1938, p. xxxv) that Pellegrini was Wren's choice, but if so he was frustrated in his plan. For a time Laguerre appeared as a leading contender and Pellegrini left England in 1713, but at their meeting on 28 June 1715 the Commissioners finally chose Thornhill to paint the dome. Vertue sums up Pellegrini's part in the competition: 'He made several designs and a moddle for painting the Cupulo at St Paul's, for which he was paid tho' he had not the Cupulo to paint.' \nP.24-1953 bears the date 1710 and it is likely that it was painted in connection with the competition for the cupola of St Paul's. As Croft-Murray points out, it could not have been Pellegrini's actual entry, for it does not follow the Commissioners' demand for a 'Scripturall History taken from the Acts .. '  The subject is the <i>Virgin, Saints, angels and figures from the Old Testament adoring the Trinity</i> (not the <i>Assumption of the Virgin</i> as in the R. A. exhibition catalogue, 1960) and the composition may be compared with Sebastiano Ricci\u2019s treatment of the Adoration of the Trinity (T. Borenius, \u2018Venetian 18th century painters in England\u2019 in <i>Studio Special Number, Fine Art</i>, Spring 1931, p. 57, repr.) The figures on the other side of the circle include David playing the harp, Moses, horned, holding a tablet and St Lawrence with a gridiron. Croft-Murray suggests that this sketch was probably made for the artist's own use, to fix the type of composition he had in mind. Indeed, Pellegrini's drawings and sketches seldom relate directly to his finished paintings (E. Young in <i>Apollo</i>, 89: p. 194 ff.). Here he follows the tradition of Correggio and the baroque painters of Rome, whereas Thornhill's winning designs, in sharp contrast, are made up of segmental compartments copied from Raphael's tapestry cartoons (St Paul's Cathedral Museum; Croft-Murray, pl. 127). \nThis design is one of the earliest of Pellegrini's oil sketches and it is exceptional in being dated. It is contemporary with his staircase dome, showing the Fall of Phaeton, at Castle Howard (destroyed 1940; Borenius, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 52, repr.), but in general conception it is closer to his ceiling of 1702 in the library of the Church of San Antonio at Padua (R. Pallucchini, 'Novita ed Appunti per G.A. Pellegrini' in <i>Pantheon</i>, xviii, 1960, p. 183, repr.). Among comparable sketches for ceilings, those in the Mus\u00e9e Massey, Tarbes (Pallucchini, op. cit., p. 252, repr.) and in the Ashmolean Museum (for Schloss Mannheim, E. Young, 1965, fig. 10) are closest in type of composition. \n\nProv. Sir John Wood, Bt, sale at Hengrave Hall, Bury St Edmunds, 15-8, 22, 25.

September 1952, lot 1683. \nReceived 5th March, 1953 from National Art Collection Fund,\nHertford House,Manchester Square, W.1\n\nHistorical significance: Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, (1675-1741) was a painter who, together with Sebastiano Ricci and Jacopo Amigoni, was among the most important Venetian history painters of the early 18th century. Bringing together the High Renaissance style of Paolo Veronese with the Baroque of Pietro da Cortona and Luca Giordano, he created graceful decorations that were particularly popular amongst the aristocracy of central and northern Europe. From 1708-1713 Pellegrini was in England, where his first task was probably the decoration (destr.) of the stair-well in the Duke of Manchester\u2019s house in Arlington Street, London. He also designed sets for the opera and a cupola in Castle Howard, N. Yorkshire (largely destroyed by fire in 1941) with a dramatic painting of the <i>Fall of Phaeton</i>. Pellegrini enjoyed considerable success in England where he was popular with the aristocracy and was appointed one of the directors of Kneller\u2019s Academy in 1711.\nIn 1710 Sir James Thornhill and Pellegrini were asked to produce a painted model for the decoration of the inside of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral with subjects from the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>. The Commissioners appear to have deliberated for many years but finally selected Thornhill to paint the dome in 1715. While P.24-1953 may not have been Pellegrini's actual entry, as it does not derive its subject from the <u>Acts,</u> it was probably painted in connection with the competition and possibly for the artist's own use. This is one of Pellegrini's earliest oil sketches and is exceptional in being dated. It is contemporary with his staircase dome at Castle Howard, but is closer in conception to his ceiling of 1702 in the library of the Church of San Antonio at Padua. It lacks the brilliant brush strokes of his later works however and has an overall muted appearance.",

            "historical_context_note": "Illusionistic ceiling painting, which includes the perspective techniques of <i>di sotto in s\u00f9</i> which means \"seen from below\" and <i>quadratura</i> in which the architectural elements of a wall or ceiling painting appear to be part of the real architectural setting, became especially popular during the Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo periods. In these ceilings <i>trompe l'oeil</i> perspective tools such as foreshortening, and other spatial effects were used to create the illusion of three-dimensional space on a flat surface or linear perspective was applied to the concave surfaces of domes in order to visually dissolve the architecture and create illusions of limitless space. \nOil sketches such as this are a type of painted work of small dimensions that first appeared in the 16th century. They derive from the Renaissance practice of preparatory drawings in pen and ink and are generally executed as a preparatory study in mixed oil and tempera for a finished larger work as an alternative to drawings. The finished version of these studies is often called a <i>modello</i>. Among the earliest known oil sketches are those by Polidoro da Caravaggio (ca. 1497-ca. 1543) but the technique spread quickly among the artists including Federico Barocci (1528-1612), Cristofano Allori (1577-1621), Tintoretto (1519-1594 ) and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609-1664) and became an important feature of Baroque art. Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) introduced this practice in Flanders. This method benefits both artists and patrons as artists were able to present and promote their work while patrons could evaluate a project at an early stage. Sometimes considered as works of art in themselves, oil sketches were also collected by connoisseurs. Oil sketches were still favoured during the Rococo and the Romantic period but by the end of the 19th century, artists tended to paint directly on the support, abandoning the technique as a preparatory study.",
