Sets of three, five, seven or even nine vases were known as 'suites of vases' in the 18th and early 19th centuries. They were commonly set out on mantelpieces, with the largest one in the middle, much as today.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis type of printing in more than one colour is only found on porcelain made or decorated at the Vauxhall porcelain factory. The polychrome effect was probably achieved by using animal glue transfers together with a pouncing technique. The printer first took a copper printing plate engraved with the design and oiled the surface. He then wiped it clean, so that the oil remained only in the engraved lines of the design. He then printed this design in oil onto a pliable sheet of animal glue. This was then laid onto the curved surface of the vase, transferring the design. A workman then 'pounced' (dusted) finely-ground enamel pigments onto the surface. These adhered only to the printed design and the rest was brushed away. Finally, parts of the design were then strengthened by a painter using a brush and the design was fused to the glaze by firing the vase in a small kiln.",
