A pyx is a container for the Sacred Host, bread which has been consecrated by a priest during the service of Mass and, in Catholic belief, miraculously transformed into the body of Christ. This central ceremony of the Catholic church is a re-enactment of the Last Supper, in which Christ shared bread and wine with his disciples, saying \u2018This is my body and blood\u2019. \n\nDuring this period pyxes were often shaped like small caskets. Traditionally, the hinged lid of the pyx was surmounted by a cross, symbolic of Christ\u2019s death. The knop (the protruding central section of the stem) allows the priest to hold the vessel comfortably without risk of dropping it. The decoration on this pyx has been elaborately hammered into relief and pierced, with small cast elements soldered onto the surface of the metal.",
