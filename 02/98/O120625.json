Gibraltar Tower Mill, the oldest (c. 1660), and one of the largest and finest tower mills in Essex, dominates its surroundings.  The mill's working life ended in 1930, and in this 1943 watercolour, signs of dilapidation are apparent.  However, it was one of the county's relatively few windmills to have escaped total dereliction following the war, being converted into a private house in 1957.",

Apart from being an easy target for air-raiders and a convenient dumping-ground  for bombs from machines which had failed to reach objectives farther inland, it was also a likely area for invasion, and consequently sure of priority in the attentions of the War Office.  Records of Essex, then, were wanted, and quickly, before the county was occupied by the British, or the German, Army.'\nPalmer, Arnold, ed. <u>Recording Britain</u>.

In addition to saving trouble, this allowed the body of the mill to be made of brick, resting firmly on the ground, and so at once stronger and less inflammable.\n[....]\nDuring the war it was used as a look-out by the Home Guard, who carved a few peepholes, and the sails have suffered further damage by storm since the drawing was made.  Their scattered limbs lie on the ground, where at least we can appreciate the astonishing weight and thickness of the timbers.'",

It was converted into a private house in 1957-58. \n \nThis work is from the \u2018Recording Britain\u2019 collection of topographical watercolours and drawings made in the early 1940s during the Second World War. In 1940 the Committee for the Employment of Artists in Wartime, part of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, launched a scheme to employ artists to record the home front in Britain, funded by a grant from the Pilgrim Trust. It ran until 1943 and some of the country\u2019s finest watercolour painters, such as John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint and Rowland Hilder, were commissioned to make paintings and drawings of buildings, scenes, and places which captured a sense of national identity. Their subjects were typically English: market towns and villages, churches and country estates, rural landscapes and industries, rivers and wild places, monuments and ruins. Northern Ireland was not covered, only four Welsh counties were included, and a separate scheme ran in Scotland.\n\nThe scheme was known as \u2018Recording the changing face of Britain\u2019 and was established by Sir Kenneth Clark, then the director of the National Gallery. It ran alongside the official War Artists\u2019 Scheme, which he also initiated. Clark was inspired by several motives: at the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a concern to document the British landscape in the face of the imminent threat of bomb damage, invasion, and loss caused by the operations of war. This was allied to an anxiety about changes to the landscape already underway, such as the rapid growth of cities, road building and housing developments, the decline of rural ways of life and industries, and new agricultural practices, which together contributed to the idea of a \u2018vanishing Britain\u2019. Clark also wanted to help artists, and the traditional forms of British art such as watercolour painting, to survive during the uncertain conditions of wartime. He in turn was inspired by America\u2019s Federal Arts Project which was designed to give artists employment during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nOver 1500 works were eventually produced by 97 artists, of whom 63 were specially commissioned. At the time the collection had a propaganda role, intended to boost national morale by celebrating Britain\u2019s landscapes and heritage. Three exhibitions were held during the war at the National Gallery, and pictures from the collection were sent on touring exhibitions and to galleries all around the country. After the war, the whole collection was given to the V&A by the Pilgrim Trust in 1949, and it was documented in a four volume catalogue published between 1946 and 1949. For many years the majority of the collection was on loan to councils and record offices in each county, until recalled by the V&A around 1990. The pictures now form a memorial to the war effort, and a unique record of their time.",

The village was something of an artists' colony, numbering Edward Bawden, Kenneth Rowntree, and Eric Ravilious among its residents; although these four artists' styles varied greatly, they were all, at the time, painting topographical watercolours.\n\nGibraltar Tower Mill is probably the oldest (c. 1660) in Essex.  It was twice converted into a house, first in the eighteenth century (it then reverted to its original purpose in 1751 and remained a working mill until 1930), then in 1957-58.  It remains a privately-owned house today.",
