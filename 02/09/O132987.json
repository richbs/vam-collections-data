Studied at Sass's Academy from 1835; entered RA Schools. In a long, prolific, and highly successful career, exhibited 107 works at the RA between 1840 and 1906, 13 at the BI 1838-1857, and 12 at the Society of British Artists 1838-1883. Subjects predominantly literary, historical, and - most notably - scenes of contemporary life, with which he achieved his greatest popular fame, amplified by many engraved reproductions, beginning with <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> (exh RA 1854 and bought by Queen Victoria). In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>Sketch for 'The Derby Day'</b>\n1038-1886 Negs 70118, GK3103 \nCanvas, 28.2 x 44.8 cm (11 1/8 x 17 7/8 ins) \nSigned and dated 'W P Frith 1858' bl \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nThe third sketch for the famous painting exhibited at the RA in 1858 (218), and now in the Tate Gallery. Full details of the finished work are given in M Davies <i>National Gallery Catalogue: The British School</i> 1946, pp53-4, and more recently and extensively by Connor and Lambourne. As Lambourne has pointed out, 'the race itself had not interest for him, and his chronology in his book is at complete variance with the real historical facts'. It seems sure that Frith visited Epsom on Derby Day in both 1856 and 1857, and began work on a first sketch, a charcoal drawing, numerous figure studies, and a 'small careful oil-sketch' which he painted on holiday at Folkestone. His friend, the wealthy pharmacist Jacob Bell, saw that oil sketch and commissioned a picture 'five or six feet long'. Frith then worked on a large oil sketch, and a third sketch - the present work - in which he tried a different arrangement of the principal and central group. Although inscribed '1858', it appears to date, to judge from Frith's own account, from 1856. He began the final canvas in January 1857, and finished it in time for the RA exhibition in May 1858. He made a replica in 1893-4, now in the City Art Gallery, Manchester. \n\nSeveral auction references are listed by Davies, all of which relate to studies for 'The Derby Day', but it is not possible to identify the present work among them; it is not known when it was acquired by Joshua Dixon. \n\nEXH: <i>?Winter Exhibition</i> French Gallery 1858 (48;47 was the 'First Study') <i>W P Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery 1951 (31) \n\nLIT: <i>Autobiography</i> I, pp268-303, III, pp156-8; P Connor and L Lambourne <i>Derby Day 200</i> RA exhibition catalogue 1979, pp71-8\"\nThe first study for <i>The Derby Day</i> was lot 24 at Christie's, Victorian and British Impressionist Art, 15 December 2011.
