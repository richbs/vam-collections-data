While the floral winged Lions, supporting the Crown / of Life, indicate its material triumphs; the Sphinxes, on either side of the tree, / figure its mystery, and those unanswered problems perpetually presented afresh to / humanity in the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. / In the freize the Crown again appears upheld in triumph by good genii of the / house, in the full pride of its flowering time, alternating with the fruit-bearing / seed after its kind. / WALTER CRANE.</i>",
