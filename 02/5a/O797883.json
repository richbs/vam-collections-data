It was executed closely following the design given here and exhibited in the Medieval Court at the great Exhibition of 1851. The house for which the staircase was intended was built from 1850 \u2013 1851 by George Myers with Samuel Dawkes as the architect. It contains much fine Pugin furniture.\n\nAlexandra Wedgwood,  A.W.N. Pugin and the Pugin Family , London; V&A, 1985, p. 200.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
