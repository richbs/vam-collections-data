Along the top edge of the plaque are five coral beads with filigree caps.  There is a loop at either side of the plaque, with three chains of decorative figure-of-eight links attached to each, which end in a sharp hook, with an applied filigree plaque covering it.

She might have used the large central pin to secure the front of her dress, with the hooks at either side hooked into her clothing at the shoulder, to allow the chains to hang down decoratively.  More likely she wore it as a head ornament, to decorate a stiff cloth cap shaped like a man\u2019s fez.\n\nThe combination of delicate open filigree over a red metal foil, multiple chains of decorative figure-of-eight links, pendent coins, and sharp hooks for attachment, is typical of the kind of traditional jewellery worn, particularly in towns, in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century.  This is confirmed by the Ottoman silver marks on the central pin.  It was described as Anatolian when it was acquired in 1872, but it would not have been out of place anywhere in the region, from the Balkans to Syria.",
