The neck is trimmed with a wreath of small white piqu\u00e9 daisies, and wreaths of the same,which are graduated in size, trim the train. The tight sleeves are long with spiral tucks and shaped to a point on the back of the hand.

The skirt, which is of heavier silk, is shaped into a high v-shaped yoke, back and front, and is double at the back. It fastens at the side.",
