Inside the lid is a label inscribed: <i>Wm. Herbert / Earl of Pembroke / by P. Oliver / signed.</i>  Evidently a replacement for an original locker with a hinged lid. \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Samuel Addington, his sale, Christie's 26 April 1883, lot 98, bt. Joseph (110 gns, and by him sold to J L Propert; FAS 1897, bt. Salting, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b>  BFAC 1889, no. 45, p. 100, and pl. VIII; New Gallery, Regent Street, <i>The Royal House of Tudor</i>, 1890, no. 1127; FAS 1897, no. 33; New Haven etc. 1981-2, no.32. \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Propert 1887, p. 255, repro. facing p. 60; Williamson 1897, p. 156; <i>Salting Collection</i>, 1911, p. 41, fig. 2; Foster 1911 (attributed to Isaac Oliver); Long 1929, p. 321; Long 1930, p. 52, repro. no. 17; Schidloff 1964, vol. II, p. 602; <i>Summary Catalogue</i> 1981, p. 42; Murdoch 1981, pl. 17b (repro in colour). \n \nThe miniature had presumably lost its original locket before some enterprising nineteenth-century dealer, fancying a resemblance to the Droeshout image of Shakespeare, supplied that identification and reinforced it with the sixteenth-century style portrait-box, either an old one already broken, or a new one made to look old and broke.  Turned ivory is exceptionally difficult to date. \n \nAlthough the inscription referring to Shakespeare and the price were too obviously a ramp, Addington and subsequent owners still believed that the sitter was William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630).  This Herbert identification was, presumably <i>faute de mieux</i>, as close as the portrait could plausibly be brought to Shakespeare: Herbert having been the patron of Shakespeare and, romantically, a candidate for the identity of Mr W H. \n \nBut the Herbert portraiture is not compatible with this miniature.  The three relevant images are: a) of 1617, variously attributed to Gheeraerts (Munthe Collection), van Blijenberch (Powis Castle) and Van Somer (Royal Collection); b) of c.1625, by Mytens (a very numerous type well exemplified at Wilton); and a posthumous classicising image by Van Dyck, also at Wilton.  In all he has a distinct widow's peak instead of the straight hair-line of this sitter, and he has a fleshier, less austere face.  Also he always wears his Garter ribbon and George, and carries his staff as Lord Chamberlain.  \n \nThe use of a table-book leaf for the support in the early 1620s is interesting; see Gerbier, Cat. No. 2  The use of pasteboard to provide supplementary support may be experimental, suggesting relatively little confidence in the 'new' material.  Case packing, provided by the silversmith, would not normally be glued to the miniature.\"",
