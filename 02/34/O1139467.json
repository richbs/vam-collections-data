The library was used by designers within Courtaulds and was also available for the use of Courtaulds\u2019 customers. Following the acquisition of Courtaulds by the international corporation Sara Lee and the subsequent change in the business it was decided that the V&A would be the most appropriate location for the collection to enable it to be appreciated and used more fully. The Library was donated to the V&A by Sara Lee Courtaulds in 2001.\n\nPaper post-it note with Courtauld Archivist's handwriting : \"Damocles Contessa Colbertado cotton/rayon jacquard Autumn 1964\".",
