            "public_access_description": "This is an etching. The technique was originally developed in the Middle East for decorating armour. Daniel Hopfer, who was an armourer by trade, was one of the first artists in Europe to experiment with the technique for making prints. \n\nThe contrast with engraving can be seen especially in the bush behind the table, in the tree bark and feathers of the man\u2019s hat. As the design is drawn onto the surface of the plate, curved and irregular lines are far easier to create in an etching than in an engraving. The acid also creates softer edges to the lines. However it removes some control from the artist - this image has \u2018foul biting\u2019 in the top centre, where acid has seeped into an area meant to remain white. \n\nHopfer used steel for his plates, a natural choice for an armourer. Steel is tough and produces a harsh effect. In 1520, Lucas van Leyden experimented with combining etching with engraving. He used copper plates instead of steel because the latter was too hard for engraving. Copper also proved a more satisfactory metal for etching, producing softer results.",
