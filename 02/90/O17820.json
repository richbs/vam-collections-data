            "public_access_description": "Fran\u00e7ois Bocion (1828-1890) was born in Lausanne. He first trained with Christian Gottlieb Steinlen (1779-1847) in Vevey and subsequently with Fran\u00e7ois Bonnet (1811-1894) in Lausanne. In Paris in 1845, Bocion entered the atelier of Louis-Aim\u00e9 Grosclaude (1784-1869) and later that of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874) and befriended Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) and other important exponents of the Realist movement. Back in Lausanne in 1849 he became a teacher at the Ecole moyenne et industrielle of Lausane, a position he held until his death. At the same time, he had an extensive output with several travels abroad. He exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Anvers, London and was a founder member of the Swiss society of watercolorists (1884). \n\nThis painting was probably executed shortly after Bocion's return to Lausanne and inaugurates one of the main thematic of the artist: lake views. Bocion combined here a genre scene, people crossing the lake on a ferry, and a lake view dominated by the Alps mountains in the background. Such subject matters and the interest in atmospheric effect and the direct observation of nature were characteristic of the Realist movement emerged in France in the 1840s. This painting is a fine example of Bocion's oeuvre characterised by peaceful scenes dominated by imposing mountains in the distance.",

Bocion</i> \nOil on millboard, oval, 23.5 X 32.5 cm  \n1594-1869. <i>Townshend Bequest.</i> \n \nFilmgoers with long memories will remember Orson Welles in the <i>Third Man</i>, in the culmination of a speech advocating violence, dismissing Swiss culture in a single sentence. 'And what did they produce?', he asks contemptuously: 'the cuckoo clock'.\n \nThanks to the bequest of the Rev. C H Townshend (d.1868) the V&A has a large collection of 19th-century Swiss paintings which should, by itself, give the lie to Welles' slanderous remark. Townshend, a friend of Dickens and a passionate collector not only of pictures and drawings but also of gem stones and cameos, Swiss coins, glass, watches and geological specimens, spent his winters in Lausanne and was personally acquainted with the principal Swiss painters of the 1840s and 50s. One of his favourite artists was Bocion, by whom there are sixteen pictures in the Museum. A native of Lausanne, he had studied in Paris and returned home to recover from typhoid in 1849. His work, as typified in the painting, represents the very fresh, naturalistic tendency which dominated Swiss art in the mid-19th century. It may, in part, be ascribed to the influence of Corot and the other French painters of the Barbizon school, but it is worth remembering that Lake Geneva had provided a focus for topographical painters from the late 18th century and, indeed, Konrad Witz's <i>Miraculous draft of Fishes</i> (c. 1440; Geneva Museum), a view of the lake painted 400 years earlier, is usually singled out as the very first topographical landscape in the history of European painting. \n\nBocion's many paintings of activities on and around Lake Geneva are closer to life than those of his 18th-century predecessors, but for his subject he was following in a strong local tradition. \n\nHis technique was to paint broad, rapid sketches, of which this is a typical example, in the open air and then to compose larger, more finished pictures for exhibition, in his studio. The <i>Luggage Boat</i> combines his lifelong interest in depicting ships on Lake Geneva with his desire to portray people in everyday attitudes at work or at leisure. \n\nMichael Kauffmann\"\nReymondin, M., <u>Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 de Fran\u00e7ois Bocion</u>, Immerc: Wormer, 1989, no. 33, p. 23.",

By F. Bocion. Signed. Swiss. Dated 1855'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is one of a group of 16 paintings bequeathed to the museum by the Rev. Townshend who had a villa in Lausanne where he spent the winter. \nIt is a fine example of the central thematic of lake views in Bocion's oeuvre. Probably executed shortly after his return to Lausanne from Paris, this painting witnesses the influence of the Realist painters such as Courbet and Leon Berthoud.\n The support suggests that the artist depicted outdoors directly after the motif but this does not exclude that he reworked the composition in his studio as Bocion used both practises. \nThere is another version of this composition with a slight difference in the position of the figures in a private collection. The oval format can also be found in another composition showing the shore of the lake with figures (Victoria and Albert Museum - 1589-1869). The present painting and the latter present the particularity to combine a lake view with a genre scene. The name of the boat, 'le passager' inscribed on the stern, was used in French as the title of the painting. Bocion was profoundly inspired by the surrounding of Lake Leman between Geneva and Lausanne where he resided. \nThe focus on a group of figures at close is a recurrent compositional formula in Bocion's oeuvre throughout the 1850s. \nComparable compositions include: Comparable compositions include: <i>Lake of Geneva, sailing boats</i>, dated 1855,  and <i>A Barge</i>, c.1855, both in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (see 1563-1869 and 1587-1869).\nThis painting was probably bought by the Rev. Townshend directly from the artist and displayed in his villa in Lausanne where it completed there a large collection of 19th-century landscapes paintings. The Victoria and Albert Museum owns the most comprehensive group of Bocion's paintings in the U.K.",
