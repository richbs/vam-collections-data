            "public_access_description": "This wine ewer is a rare example of Mughal jade inlaid with enamelled gold rather than precious stones, and probably dates from the 18th century. Jade as a raw material was found in the royal Mughal treasury towards the end of the reign of the emperor Akbar (r.1556-1605), but is thought to have been made into artefacts for the court only from the reign of his son, Jahangir (r.1605-1627). This coincides with the presence of the Iranian master craftsman, Sa'ida-ye Gilani as head of the court's goldsmiths' department. In addition to his skills as a goldsmith, Sa'ida was a renowned enameller, poet, calligrapher and specialist in hardstones. He remained head of the department throughout the reign of Jahangir and of his son Shah Jahah (r. 1628-58) a period which coincides with the production of the finest known Mughal jades. These were probably made in relatively small quantities for the emperor and his immediate circle, but in the late 17th century, and for most of the 18th century, production seems to have increased, probably reflecting easier access to the raw material of Chinese nephrite jade. \nThis ewer was bought by the Indian Museum in London in 1868 from the remarkable collection of Mughal hardstones formed by Colonel Charles Seton Guthrie, a Scot who had joined the Bengal Engineers in India in 1828. He left India at the end of his career in 1857, and it is not known whether he amassed his collection while living there, or through Indian agents after his retirement to England.",
