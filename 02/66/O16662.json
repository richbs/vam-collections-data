This fabric might have been used for curtains or upholstery. In this period it was particularly fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other.\n\nPlaces\nBannister Hall, near Preston, Lancashire, where this fabric was probably printed, was the leading works for woodblock furniture chintzes and set the fashion for other factories. Printing was carried out for London linen-drapers, such as Richard Ovey of Covent Garden, who from 1790 to 1831 was the leading London merchant for 'furniture prints'. He commissioned designs from skilled artists and sent them to Lancashire or to Carlisle in Cumbria to be printed.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe design of this cotton is very similar to one produced at Jouy, in France, in 1788, which was printed on a white background. This English fabric may be copying the Jouy design, or they might both have taken their inspiration from the same Indian source.",
