It has all the hallmarks of a object assembed by one of the half dozen exclusive Parisian retailers of this type of luxury goods, a marchand mercier. It combines high quality gilt bronze, porcelain plaques, an enamel dial and a clock movement, all of which would have been supplied by separate specialist manufacturers.  The movement was made by Robert Robin, clockmaker by appointment to King Louis XVI, a fact proudly proclaimed on the inscribed dial and plaque below (H=er du Roy is an abbreviated old French form of Horloger du Roi).  The plaques are of hard paste porcelain and were possibly made at the factory under the patronage of the King's younger brother, the comte d'Artois, in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis in Paris.  In imitation of the fashion on S\u00e8vres porcelain at the time, they have been given a costly form of 'jewelled decoration' where translucent and opaque enamels have been painted onto stamped gold foils applied to the surface of the glaze.  Jewelling was popular in court circles for a brief period in the early 1780s, for example the King and Queen both bought sets of three S\u00e8vres jewelled vases in 1782. (It is probable these are the vases now in the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Wallace Collection respectively). \n\nLegend has it that this clock belonged to Queen Marie-Antoinette herself.  Royal provenances of this type are usually unfounded and are known in some cases to have been invented by dealers in the nineteenth century to add value to their wares.  However, given the French royal fleur de lys prominently enamelled on the dial, the involvement of the King's clockmaker, the expensive and unusual decoration and the possibility the porcelain was made by a factory under royal patronage, the story may be true.",

            "history_note": "Robert Robin (1742-1799), the clockmaker who made this clock (his signature appears on a plaque below the dial) was clockmaker to Marie Antoinette and subsequently to Louis XV and Louis XVI. The clock is accompanied by a fine leather case stamped with the royal monogram of Louis XVI (the letter 'L' interlaced), surmounted by a crown. The Museum was bequeathed the clock in 1882 by John Jones; a note in the Metalwork Section register made when the clock entered the Museum observes that it had once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself.\nThe pendulum and escapement (the device to regulate the motion of the pendulum) are later replacements.\n\nThe porcelain panels of this carriage clock differ in shape slightly to the ones made at the S\u00e8vres factory. See C499, an upright rectangular clock in the Wallace Collection shaped like a <i>secr\u00e9taire</i>(see Savill below).  They would appear to be of hard paste Paris porcelain and may have been decorated by Joseph Coteau who, although recorded at S\u00e8vres 1780-1784, is known to have worked at the factory of the comte d'Artois in the Faubourg Saint-Denis.  A marked pair of vases from this factory in the Louvre has ornate bands of jewelled enamelleing, signed 'Cotteau' and dated 11th August, 1783 (illustrated by Plinval de Guillebon, see below).  This theory is reinforced by the fact that Coteau is also known to have enamelled clock dials (see Savill below, Vol III, p. 973, footnote 2 and Dawson, p. 152, footnote 27).  Signed clock dials by him are dated 1763, 1771 and 1785.\n\nThe porcelain is unlikely to be S\u00e8vres as it is unheard of a clockmaker being permitted to add his own mark to the porcelain in this manner.  However, as a typical object that has been assembled by a <i>marchand mercier,</i> it is difficult to know when the inscriptions were added, although they would appear to be contemporary with the object as a whole.  As with other typical <i>marchand mercier</i> objects (eg. travelling cases for porcelain services <i>n\u00e9cessaires,</i> fitted dressing tables) the porcelain plaques have been lined with pale green watered silk, edged with metallic (possibly now tarmished silver) braid.",
