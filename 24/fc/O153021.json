In the 1970s aspects such as humour and symbolism were also present. This finely detailed silver brooch by Martin Page demonstrates wit and mild eroticism. \n\nPage\u2019s sculptural figures are very natural, and his attention to detail shows in his use of varying silver surfaces, textures and oxidisation. He is fascinated by female legs, which frequently feature in his jewellery in an imaginative way, and with differing interpretations. \n\nMartin Page was trained at the Central School of Art and Design and at the Royal College of Art, both in London. In 1977 he opened his own workshop.",
