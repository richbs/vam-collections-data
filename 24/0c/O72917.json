It was made in 1851 by Henry Weigall and cast by Elkington &amp; Company and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1852. Henry Weigall exhibited another bronze bust of Wellington at the Royal Academy in 1873. In 1849 Weigall had shown a bust of Wellington carved in marble at the Royal Academy; a similar, or the same, marble bust was exhibited at the British Institution in 1850. Wellington's fame was such that sculptors could cast and sell numerous versions of the same work. At least six examples of this one are known. Weigall (1800? - 1883) was initially a gem-engraver and medallist, who later turned to sculpture.\n\nBorn in Dublin, 1st May 1769, died at Walmer Castle, Kent, 14th September 1852, Arthur Wellesley, later the 1st Duke of Wellington, was Britain's greatest military commander. His brilliant tactics and leadership brought about major victories over the French in the Peninsular War of 1808-1814 and, most famously, at Waterloo on 18 June 1815. The Duke then became a politician (Prime Minister from 1828-1830) and distinguished elder statesman. In gratitude for his defeat of Napoleon, European sovereigns showered the Duke with spectacular gifts, notably paintings, porcelain and silver. These form the core of the art collection still at his London home, Apsley House on Hyde Park Corner. The house was originally designed by Robert Adam but was enlarged for the Duke by Benjamin Dean Wyatt. It was presented to the Nation with its contents in 1947, the family retaining apartments.",
