            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 210, 213\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\u201cBeckett (<i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. CXXXIV, 1954, pp. 81-3) has shown that Constable embarked in 1833 upon a series of designs for illustrations to Gray's <i>Elegy</i> at the request of John Martin, the bibliographer. Three of them were engraved on wood for the first edition of the book, published in 1834; and a vignette of the exterior of the church was added to the title-page of the second edition of 1839. No. 354 [174-1888] does not correspond with any of the engraved designs, though it bears some resemblance to the vignette added in 1839. The design chosen to illustrate the lines from Stanza V which Constable has copied on to the back of No. 354 [174-1888] was based on a drawing now in the British Museum (L.B. 35a); the latter is derived from a similar composition, also in the British Museum (L.B. 35b), which appears to have been sketched on the spot. \nConstable exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1834 two water-colours illustrating the <i>Elegy</i>, one apparently of the exterior of the church, with the churchyard, the other showing the interior in the manner chosen to illustrate Stanza XI: \"Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust:\" Leslie records that these two drawings were bought by Samuel Rogers (L. ed. S., p. 313). Only one, however, appeared in the sale of Rogers's collection by Messrs. Christie's in April-May 1856, as Lot 1242 \"Stoke Church-water-colour\", bought by Mr. Matthew Uzielli for 13 guineas. Holmes, p. 251, suggests that Constable visited Stoke Poges to make drawings of the church on his way back from his visit to Englefield House and Theal in 1832 (see Nos. 340-344 [345-188, 255-1888, 1258-1888, 1258a-1888, 1258b-1888]). Beckett, <i>loc. cit.</i>, doubts this, on the ground that the rendering of Stoke Poges Church in No. 352 [1631-1888] is not topographically exact. Many details, however, show that Constable was re-arranging the known features of the church when he generalized it for his designs, for example, the <i>fleche</i> on the tower, and, in the vignette, the shape of Gray's tomb. Holmes's hypothesis is supported by the circumstance that the drawing of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, L.B. 35b in the British Museum, from which the engraved design for Stanza V was derived, appears, as stated above, to have been drawn from nature.\u201d",
