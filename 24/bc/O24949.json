Judging from inscriptions, the cult of Ganesa appears to have been widespread in early Cambodia, though images of the deity are very rare.  In his early forms in India, Ganesa was associated with fertility, especially agriculture, and his popularity in Cambodia may be reflected in this aspect of the cult.",
