Official wares, called guan yao in Chinese, were produced in strictly controlled workshops supervised by imperial officers, and were destined to the court in Beijing. \n\nThis vase is an exquisite example of official ware; the paintings in the four medallions depict four landscapes, each associated to a season and with a short poem, a common and auspicious theme.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nUnlike other, more recently formed museum collections of Chinese pottery, the V&A\u2019s Chinese ceramics contain an unusually high proportion of eighteenth-century imperial porcelain. This vase, made at the imperial porcelain factory at Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province, central southern China, is characteristic of the highest quality of Chinese porcelain produced in the eighteenth century. Its finely painted scenes depict landscapes of the four seasons with appropriate short poems, a common and auspicious theme.\nThe vase was among 1,405 pieces of Chinese and Japanese porcelain bequeathed by George Salting in 1910. The bulk of the Salting collection comprised items made in China for export to the West during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This piece, however, was made for the highest echelons of the Chinese home market, a fact indicated by its form and decorative style, which closely resemble the form and style of pieces from the former Chinese court now held in the Palace Museum, Beijing, and the National Palace Museum, Taipei.\n\nLit.
