He may also have travelled to Naples, Venice and Bologna. Around 1731 Boucher returned to Paris where he rapidly gained the royal favour and interest from the private collectors. He was a very prolific artist and produced a wide range of artworks from pastoral paintings, porcelain and tapestry designs as well as stage designs influencing deeply the new Rococo movement.\n\nThis painting is a copy after a composition currently in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. It represents amorini teasing each other in a wheat field and is intended as an allegory of Summer. The original painting was in fact part of a cycle representing allegories of the four seasons. This work is a fine example of the early career of Boucher, who already pervaded his oeuvre with mischievous pastoral scenes which would become the hallmark of his art and eventually of the whole Rococo period.",

In 1725 he was commissioned by Jean de Julienne to undertake engravings after Watteau for the <i>Figures de diff\u00e9rents caract\u00e8res de paysages et d'\u00e9tudes</i>. In 1727 he was in Italy with Carle van Loo and on his return in 1731 he became an <i>agr\u00e9e</i> of the Acad\u00e9mie. Three years later he was called to Beauvais to design tapestries and ultimately became Inspector of the Paris Gobelins factory after Oudry's death in 1755. He was a profilic and popular painter, working for Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. In 1765 he was appointed Director of the Acad\u00e9mie, and <i>Premier Peintre du Roi</i> in succession to Van Loo. \n     Boucher was the most important figure among the second generation of French rococo painters and he exerted considerable influence both in painting and in the decorative arts. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> A Michel, <i>Boucher</i>, 1906; P. de Nolhac, <i>Boucher</i>, 1907. \n\n\nAfter Fran\u00e7ois BOUCHER \n\n41 \nL'AMOUR MOISSONNEUR (CUPID AS A REAPER) \n<i>Canvas</i> \n25\u00bd x 21 (74.9 x 53) \nJones Bequest\n494-1882\n\n494-1882 and 495-1882 (no. 42) are copies of engravings after Boucher.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a copy after a composition by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher formerly in the Rothschild collection, Paris and currently in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (BF.1988.5). \nThe painting depicts naked <i>amorini</i> or cherubs teasing each other in a wheat field, one of them is shown asleep on a bundle, his quiver lying on the floor while other two are trying to wake him up. The composition appears in reverse, which suggests that 494-1882 was not made after the original painting but after the engraving made by Bernard Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9pici\u00e9 in 1734 (Cabinet des dessins, Louvre, Paris, Inv. 18855L.R). Although the Houston painting is square, the present copy was painted in an oval. However another version of <i>The Cherub Harvesters</i> square in format, signed and dated 1731, is also known and was formerly in the Contini-Bonacossi in Florence.\nThe original painting was originally part of a set of four large paintings made by Boucher for the lawyer Fran\u00e7ois Derbais (<i>Boucher</i>, 1986) upon his return from Rome. Among these were the Houston painting, <i>The Cherub Fowlers</i> (formerly in private collection, Switzerland), <i>The Cherub Swimmers</i> (a version of which is known at Weddeston Manor, England) and <i>The Cherub Grape-Pickers</i> (Private collection, Switzerland). They formed altogether representations of the four seasons: <i>The Cherub Harvesters</i> is clearly a representation of summer, whose traditional attribute is wheat. As such they may have been made as decorative panels to be inserted in the ceiling or over doors.\n594-1882 forms a pendant with 595-1882 which is a copy after <i>The Cherub Fowlers</i>. Boucher\u2019s <i>The Cherub Harvesters</i> and <i>The Cherub Fowlers</i> were indeed engraved by Bernard Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9pici\u00e9 in 1734 and these engravings, interpreted as a set, most likely served as models for the V&A paintings. The other two paintings of the cycle were also engraved however by different artists: <i>The Cherub Grape-Pickers</i> by Fessart in 1741 and <i>The Cherub Swimmers</i> by Sornique and Aveline in 1741.\nA tapestry derived from <i>The Cherub Harvesters</i> also appeared on the art market at the sale of the C. Lelong collection, Paris, 27 Apr.-1 May 1903.\nThese paintings from Boucher\u2019s early career anticipates somehow the pastoral imagery pervaded with putti, mythological figures, shepherds and shepherdesses in idyllic landscapes that would contribute to characterised the Rococo movement, of which Boucher became one of the greatest exponents.\nThese clearly late copies may have been done during the Rococo revival in the first half of the 19th century.",

            "historical_context_note": "Pastoral is a genre of painting whose subject is the idealized life of shepherds and shepherdesses set in an ideally beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century in fact, the Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had became an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.",
