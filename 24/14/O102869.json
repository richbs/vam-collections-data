It was awarded to Francis Fowke, the Royal Engineer responsible for designing many of the early buidings of the V&A as well as those for the Great Exhibition held in London in 1862. He had died in December 1865, so this medal was awarded to him posthumously.\n\nThe original owner of these medals, Captain Fowke of the Royal Engineers, became a distinguished official architect in the middle of the Victorian era, and published a number of related papers. In 1857 he became an inspector in the Science and Art Department in London; in 1860 was added the office of architect and engineer; while in 1862 he was appointed Superintendent of the construction of the South Kensington (now Victoria and Albert) Museum. He designed the new Museum of Science and Art (now the Royal Scottish Museum) Edinburgh, as well as extensions at the National Gallery, Dublin. He planned the buildings for the International Exhibition of 1862. Shortly before his death he designed the Royal Albert Hall.",
