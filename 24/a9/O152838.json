The central medallion has a dark blue ground chequered with small red and white squares; a band with yellow ground across the top of the widest part is chequered red and blue.\n\nThe middle hexagon is heavily decorated with red stems extending in each half from three vertical lines, the central one bearing a lozenge - white with a multi-coloured chequered centre in the lower half and bue with a yellow and red chequered centre in the upper half.\n\nIn the outer hexagon, the white ground in the patterned area becomes a series of narrow vertical lines with complementary horizontal zigzags forming vertical, split, dark blue hexagons in the lower half, with a change to dark brown at the top of the upper half.  Each small hexagon contains two pairs of small squares in a variety of colours.  This decoration continues into the niches which each have a pair of ear-like protuberances.\n\nThe outer field is strewn with stylised flowrs filled with the coloured squares seen elsewhere and with two small floral sprigs above the lower borders.\n\nBorders: inner border: a white ground with a dark blue meander, occasionally dark brown, within which are small coloured squares in groups of three.\n\nOuter border: a diamond=headed reciprocal pattern in dark yellow and green, outlined in blue; in the upper border it becomes a red and blue reciprocal merging into a final white band.\n\nCatalogue date: 14.6.95",
