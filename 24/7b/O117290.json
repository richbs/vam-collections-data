Several different figurines of Liston as Pry were produced, based on contemporary engravings, after his huge success in John Poole's play Paul Pry at London's Haymarket Theatre where it opened on 13 September 1825. The play was enormously popular throughout the 19th century; Paul Pry's catch-phrases 'I hope I don't intrude', 'Just dropped in' and 'It's nothing to me' were quoted everywhere, and the name Paul Pry became a well-known term for a busybody.\n\nListon achieved his greatest successes in farce, particularly as Paul Pry, but was also well known for several other r\u00f4les which were also seen in drawings, painting, engravings and figurines. An expert dancer, Liston became the highest-paid comedian on the stage, earning  between sixty and a hundred pounds a week at the Olympic Theatre, a huge salary for his day. He retired in 1837 after a career that spanned over thirty years.",
