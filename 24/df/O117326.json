Birdman 1 & 11 also known as Burnt Faces' was suggested to me by a piece of driftwood I found washed up in Quebec, Canada. I brough this home and created the model for what was to become the first Birdman panel. In 'Birdman 1' I used wood and glass together, inspired by pyrography, a method of branding wood, I then made references to the life and death giving properties of Australian bush fires, to Roman funery practices and the Egyptian practice of mummification. The head of Birdman 1 bears little resemblance to a real bird: it combines a helmut structure with the bird head of an Egyption god and is transformed into a faceless warrior behind a cage-like visor. Birdman 11, retained the same imagery but instead of using wood and pyrography, I sandblasted black flashed glass. The result is deeply etched three- dimentional effect which resembles stone carving and gives the impression of a negative photograph.\nThe original inspiration for 'Birdman 111' was a 14th century German Haggadah (book used to accompany the Seder, the Passover meal), where bird's heads were substituted for the heads of the Jewish characters. This was not uncommon in Jewish ritual art, since the depiction of the human face contravenes the 2nd commandment. The original illustrations for this Haggadah were very tiny and richly coloured with extraordinary attention to detail (an original copy can be found in the British Museum). By creating a monumental version of one of these images, the Birdman is transfomed and becomes both enigmatic and potent.",
