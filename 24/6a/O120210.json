            "public_access_description": "The work of white South African artist William Kentridge is rooted in his opposition to apartheid. In 2002 he made a series of prints based on the novel Confessions of Zeno (1923), by Italo Svevo. One of the earliest novels to be written as if from the psychiatrist\u2019s couch, Confessions of Zeno manifests the guilt-ridden soul that Kentridge explores in earlier works addressing the apartheid regime. The novel centres on a middle-class businessman in Trieste in the years immediately before the First World War, reduced to bankruptcy when he goes into business with his feckless brother-in-law. This impending disaster echoes the wider political one, although much of the narrative revolves around the households of Zeno and his wife\u2019s family. \n\nIn Kentridge\u2019s series the \u2018confessions\u2019, which take the form of abstract but calligraphic lines, trail over the surface of the things described: bowler-hatted puppets (businessmen perhaps?) and weird megaphone-like instruments confront one another in empty landscapes; a lion stalks the bars of its cage. In this scene the furniture itself seems to have come alive, suggesting the powerful position that our homes and our domestic possessions hold in our lives.",
