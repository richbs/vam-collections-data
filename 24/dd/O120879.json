This non-violent protest challanged the authorities who responded brutally. It initiated the events which culminated in the 'Velvet Revolution' in Czechoslovakia and the overthrow of the communist regime.\n\nThe student demonstration began with a meeting in the Albertov district of Prague on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Nazi persecution of Czechoslovak students who had held mass protests during the burial of Jan Opletal (a Czech student from the medical faculty of the Charles University who was shot during demonstrations against theGerman occupation of Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1939). The Albertov student meeting continued with a \u2018march for democracy\u2019 to the centre of Prague.  On the way towards National Street the student demonstration was joined by other, mainly young, people demanding freedom and democracy. \n\nThis arial view shows the beginning of the confrontation between \u2018White Helmets\u2019 (as the special troops of the Ministry of Interior Affairs were known) and protestors as they approached a road blockade preventing access to Wenceslas Square.  \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
