The standard of carving on both is of poor quality and probably dates from the nadir of Chinese craftsmanship in the 1850s and 1860s. Therefore they were fairly new when they first entered the museum, as indeed is suggested by the original register entries which describe them simply as 'Chinese' without claiming any age for them.",
