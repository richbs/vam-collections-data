Smaller images of her sons, Ganesha ( Ganesha or Puleyar), holding in his four hands the elephant goad, the noose, the tusk and the sweet pudding Modak.  On her left knee sits the god of war as a child Karttikeya (Kumara or Subramanya),  in front of her, holding in his four hands the Thunderbolt, the Tanka (chisel), the Shankti-spear and the  Vara mudra. The added backpiece has an arch of two peacocks.   They appear to have been separately cast and fairly crudely soldered in place..  A repousse arch soldered to the back of the base is presumably a replacement.\nBrassy colour, light to moderate wear.",
