Tooling marks remaining on the surface of the metal are evidence of the creative process. Forms resulting from the instinctive blows of the hammer are simple and honest. These specifically hand-wrought jewels reflect the natural qualities of the materials from which they are made. \n\nEven though these artists were inspired by ancient cultures, their jewels are thoroughly individual and modern in style.\n\nWally Gilbert is a versatile artist working in various media, such as silver, printmaking, sculpture and architectural ironwork. In the seventies and eighties he was, however, known for his jewellery designs. Gilbert had his first solo exhibition in Electrum Gallery in 1978, and a 2 person exhibition in the V&A in 1987.",
