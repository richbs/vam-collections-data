While she produced portraits and cityscapes she mainly worked as a landscape artist.\n\nThis facsimile of a drawing shows the statue of King William III (1650-1702) in front of the Chapel of St. Peter and Paul of the Hospital at Greenwich, now part of the Royal Naval College. The viewpoint of the drawing looks up at the statue of the King, who is shown in roman armour. Behind is the domed chapel of the hospital, which was completed following the design of Thomas Ripley (1683-1758) in 1752. The architectural elements and the statue combine motifs from ancient antiquity which is an interest that recurs throughout Wilczynski's work.",
