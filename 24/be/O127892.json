Entered RA Schools 1816, and again 1828. Exhibited 131 works at the RA between 1819 and 1864, and 16 at the BI 1832--44. Miniatures up to 1830, then full-size portraits (including Paganini 1833), subject pictures of various kinds, historical, mythological and biblical, sometimes on a large scale. Elected ARA 1837. Visited Rome, Venice and Parma 1837, Germany 1840. Appointed Portrait Painter in Ordinary to Prince Albert. Moved to Ross, Herefordshire, about 1859, returned to London about 1864. Died Winchmore Hill 11 March 1865; his studio sale was at Christie's 19 January 1867 and included many exhibited pictures, presumably previously unsold. The Art Journal thought he 'evidently aimed at Etty's manner, and though his flesh-painting was fairly good, it cannot for an instant be brought into comparison ... His designs are not without considerable grace and spirit'. Two miniatures are in the V&A collections. \nLIT: Athenaeum 18 March 1865, p391; Art Journal 1865, p139 \n\nA Woman Clasping a Crucifix to her Breast \n1031-1886 Neg HE4758 \nCanvas, 52.1 X 42.1 cm (20 \u00bd X 16 5/8 ins) Signed and dated 1860 \nDixon Bequest 1886 \nNot identifiable with any exhibited work or any lot in the studio sale.
