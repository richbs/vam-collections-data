            "physical_description": "'American Indian Chief' was one of Norah Wellings's national costume dolls. It is made using a tan brown velvet for the face and hands.  The facial features are moulded in buckram and covered with the velvet to show a frown, long straight nose and eyes glancing to the right and full top lip. The velvet of the face is worn but that of the hands is very good. The thumb is separate and fingers indicated by stitching. The torso, arms and legs are of yellow felt stuffed with kapok and represent buckskins with red, brown and orange felt decoration and fringing. The feet/shoes are orange felt with tan and light green felt decoration. The black wool hair, sewn to the head, and styled is largely covered by a headdress of red, yellow, brown, green and white felt, cut and sewn to resemble feathers. There is a beige label attached to the base of the left foot.",
