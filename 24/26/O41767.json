Directed by Simon McBurney; designed by Rae Smith; lighting by Paule Constable; sound by Christopher Shutt; movement by Marcello Magni and music by Gerard McBurney.  The Company comprised Annabel Arden, Bronagh Gallagher, Antonio Gil Martinez, Eric Mallett, Clive Mendus, Stefan Metz, Cesar Sarachu, Asta Sighvats, and Matthew Scurfield. The poster was designed by Sightlines for Guy Chapman Associates, featuring a photograph by Joan Marcus.\n\nHistorical significance: The Street of Crocodiles was a workshop production originally created by Theatre de Complicite with the National Theatre's Studio and shown to an invited audience in April 1991. After a process of devising, adapting, writing and rehearsal, the production opened at the RNT's Cottesloe auditorium on 13 August 1992.  It is based on the stories of the Polish writer and artist Bruno Schulz who was born in Drohobycz in 1892 and who became an art teacher there in 1924.  He exhibited his paintings but by the 1930s he concentrated on writing, setting all his stories in Drohobycz.  His vision was an immensely theatrical one in which human beings, objects and spaces take on temporary unstable shapes and forms before metomorphosing into new ones. Bruno Schulz was regarded as one of the three great talents of Polish literature between the wars.  He was killed by the Gestapo in 1942.\n\nThe production of A Street of Crododiles toured the world between 1992 and 1994, visiting Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain and Switzerland.  In 1998 Complicite revived the show following an invitation to perform at the Lincoln Center Festival, New York.  This revival went on to Toronto, Minneapolis and Tokyo before returning for a final London season at the Queen's Theatre in January 1999, nearly eight years after its original production.",
