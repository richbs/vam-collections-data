Yolanda Sonnabend's designs had to reflect his concept, which was a Westerner's distillation of Japanese martial arts, a Bunraku puppet episode and a scene of childbirth.  The designs had to suggest Japan without being a slavish depiction.  In this design for one of the women, the Japanese features are hinted at in the make-up, but the dress is less specifically of time or place.  \nThe designer has used collage technique, overlaying two different pieces of wallpaper and then tearing away the top layer, but being very clear about the blue panel and the red shoulder strap and red edging to the skirt panel.  \nThe interpretation of the costume, how slavishly the patterns have to be followed and the way in which the outer lines are realised (they may just be an indication of how the costume looks in movement) would be determined by the maker and the designer in consultation.",
