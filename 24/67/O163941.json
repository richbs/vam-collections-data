As well as theatrical subjects, Binns drew cartoons of political figures, and was associated with two predominant caricaturists of this period, Sir Francis Carruthers Gould and Harry Furniss.\n\nThis depicts Henry Irving (1838-1905), the actor-manager of the Lyceum theatre and the first actor to receive a Knighthood.  He is shown with a paper marked Actors Benevolent fund because Irving invited Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole and Squire Bancroft, together with other prominent members of the theatrical profession, to dine with him one evening in 1882 in the Beefsteak Room at the Lyceum Theatre, and it was on their collective initiative that a decision was made to found the Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund. The first committee meeting of the charity took place on the 4th May 1882. To raise money, special all-star matinees were staged, with Irving and Ellen Terry often appearing in scenes from their theatrical successes. The first of these matinees was given at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1883.",
