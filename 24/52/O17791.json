Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \nThe Sonnet \nFA146 Neg 5889 \nPanel, 35.3 \u00d7 30.2 cm (14 \u00d7 12 ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nHeleniak (151), who dates the work to 1839, lists a chalk cartoon in the National Gallery of Ireland. \nThe Art Union (1838, p68) wrote: 'A bit of true character that will tell with all who have been lovers. The youth is fiddling with his shoe tye, but casting upwards a sly look, to ascertain what effect his lines produce upon the merry maid who reads them. His face is hidden, but we can guess his feelings, when he finds her placing her hand before her lips to suppress her laughter. It is admirably painted, but we venture to object to the lavish use of light green to which the artist has, of late, resorted.' Another critic in the same number of the Art Union, p81, commented perceptively: ' ... were it permitted to talk of living British artists, I might tell of a little picture called 'The Sonnet', of a spans breadth, which reminds the spectator of the magnificent genius of Michel Angelo in the Sistine Chapel.' \nEXH: \tRA 1839 (129); Society of Arts 1848 (LI); 1864 (80); Guildhall 1904 (89); Whitechapel 1905 (68); RA 1934 (559); Louvre 1938 (97); 1964 (18); Philadelphia Museum of Art 1968 (148); Sheffield, Mappin Art Gallery, Victorian Paintings (10); Cork 1971 (83); La Peinture Romantique Anglais Paris 1972 (200); V&A 1986 (160) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.132\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"William Mulready RA 1786-1863\n<i>British School</i>  \nTHE SONNET \nExhibited RA 1839 \nOil on panel, 35 x 30 cm \nFA.146. <i>Sheepshanks Gift.</i> \n\nMulready was born at Ennis in County Clare, but was brought up in Soho in London, and attended the Royal Academy schools. After unsuccessful attempts at painting works in the grand manner, he at first turned to landscape, augmenting his income by painting scenery for the theatre. Such drudgery must have been a distasteful experience for an artist whose work is always distinguished by its extreme perfection of finish. He was a slow painter, producing only two or three pictures a year, but gradually he began to gain a reputation for his small scale works dealing with his central preoccupations as an artist, youth and age, childhood, and young love, subject matter which though dismissed by John Ruskin as 'entirely uninteresting' was to gain him considerable contemporary acclaim. His works were greatly admired by the young PreRaphaelite artists whom he taught at the Royal Academy. They were to be deeply influenced by his advocacy of the technique of using a white ground over which rich colours were very thinly applied producing a glowing effect. \n\nThis technique can be seen to particular advantage in <i>The Sonnet</i>. This small panel with its sonorous, jewel-like colour, is very thinly painted, allowing us to perceive the powerful quality of the life drawing in the figures of the shy young poet and the girl who reads his sonnet. Their clothes, the trunks of the trees and the rocky foreground have a luminosity achieved by the thinly applied opaque colour over the light initial priming. Yet this brilliant technique is controlled and unobtrusive, perfectly conveying the artist's simple yet moving theme.\n\nLionel Lambourne\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
