            "public_access_description": "Early European visitors to Ghana, West Africa, described dazzling displays of court regalia at the court of the Asantehene, the ruler of Asante state. The region\u2019s natural gold resources had made the Asante wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill and technology.\n\nThis cast gold pectoral disc was worn around the neck by those responsible for the ritual purification of the Asantehene\u2019s soul. The Asante call the discs akrafokonmu, usually translated as \u2018soul discs\u2019 or \u2018soul washers\u2019 badges\u2019. The distinctive multi-petalled shape of this disc represents the bud of the fofoo plant before it opens to reveal yellow florets.\n\nFollowing Asante efforts to protect a coastal trading outlet, British forces invaded the state capital Kumasi on 4 February 1874. The Asantehene, Kofi Karikari, fled leaving behind much precious regalia which was captured and later sold at auction at Garrard\u2019s, the London crown jewellers. The Museum\u2019s accession registers record the purchase of this and twelve other items of Asante gold and silverware from Garrard\u2019s on 5 June 1874.",

Following Major-General Sir Garnet Wolseley's invasion of Kumasi (capital of the then independent state of Asante, Ghana) on 4 February 1874, the palace of the Asantehene was ransacked and the Asante forced to pay a war indemnity of 50,000 ounces of gold. On return to the UK, some of this gold was auctioned by Garrard's, the London's Crown jewellers, which is almost certainly how the V&A acquired these pieces. Records of the auction were lost during the Second World War.",
