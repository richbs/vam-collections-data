The coat of arms, surmounted by a bishop's mitre that appear twice on the short section are those of Paolo Zabarella (1471-1525). He was a member of the monastery of the Eremitani at Padua and became titular Bishop of Argos and titular Archbishop of Parium.  Zabarella was responsible in 1520 for building the second cloister of the Eremitani monastery in Padua and was buried in the Ovetari Chapel in a free-standing tomb decorated with inlaid marble.",
