Men and women both spent their evening hours in playing card games and the equipment for this entertainment gave scope for spending on small luxury items, such as counter boxes or gaming purses. Both of these served to hold the counters or jetons which served in place of money on the card tables. The counters were often of ivory or mother-of-pearl and the boxes decorated, though not necessarily in a highly valuable fashion.  This box is decorated with cut-out, hand-coloured engravings, in a technique known as arte povera or 'poor art'.  Counter boxes usually came in sets of four.  This box was acquired with a set of four others, all decorated in the same way, but this box is slightly smaller than the others and has a painted red line around the outside of the lid.",
