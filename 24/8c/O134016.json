Studied at Birmingham Society of Arts with Samuel Lines, and sometime around 1843 with William Muller. Accompanied Muller to the Levant 1843-4 (he had also travelled in Lycia in 1840, according to Boase), and worked with him at the Clipstone Street Studio. Friend of David Cox: sketched with him in Wales. Exhibited 26 landscapes at the RA between 1845 and 1880, 39 at the BI 1846--67, and six (including a watercolour) at the SBA 184&-71. Many landscapes were views of Italy or Greece. Elected ARI 1868, RI 1870. Died St John's Wood, London, 31 December 1884. His studio sale was at Christie's 5 March 1885. \n\nLIT: TSR Boase <i>English Art</i> 1800-1870 1959 \n\n<b>Rhodes</b> \nP9-1919 Neg 47779 \nPanel, 22.1 x 37.6 cm (8 11/16 x 14\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'H J Johnson 45. Rhodes.' bl \nPresented by Sidney Vac her 1919 \n\nFrom the inscription, evidently painted during a visit to Rhodes in 1845. The artist exhibited a view of Rhodes harbour at the RA in 1847. The painting has hitherto been titled 'Memento of the Knights Templar, Rhodes', which seems inaccurate; the strongly fortified walls of the city of Rhodes were actually built in the 14th century by the Knights Hospitallers, a religious military order. \n\nPROV: Sidney Vacher; Sotheby's 26 February 1919 (258), bought in by Vacher; presented by him to the museum 1919 'as a gift of a member of the Walpole Society in memory of the glorious Battle of Jutland'.\"",
