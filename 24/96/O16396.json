ANGELO, AND, IN THE BACKGROUND, ST. PETER'S \nInscribed on the back with title and date <i>May 1758</i> \nWater-colour, 37 X 53 cm \nP.11-1925\n\nAlthough Skelton was one of the first English artists to visit Rome, the English taste for Italian views was already strong and landscapes by Claude Lorraine, Gaspar Poussin and their followers had begun to feature prominently in many British collections. The Grand Tour, including a visit to Italy, played an essential part in the upbringing of many young Englishman of rank and fortune, and this led to a demand for topographical views of the monuments and more prominent buildings of Rome. Skelton, one of the earliest English artists to work exclusively in the water-colour medium, hoped to gain commissions for such views, of which this is an outstanding example. But his hopes were dashed by ill health, and the calumny that he had Jacobite sympathies damaged his opportunities to show his works to visiting English aristocrats. \n\nLittle is known of Skelton's life in England, not even the place or date of his birth, but from 1754 to 1757, according to inscriptions on drawings he was working mostly in South London and Kent. In 1757 he left for Italy, and his letters from Rome, which he reached in January, 1758, have an immediacy which brings before the reader the crowded artist's cafes of the city, the difficulties he faced through being suspected of being a Jacobite spy, and the problems of living on the allowance made by his patron, to whom he wrote; 'The purse you lent me that looked so round and plump when it left Croydon was reduced the beginning of this week to a mere Skeleton, it often made my Heart ake to see it.' The letters are printed in Volume XXXVI of the Walpole Society, 1956-8. \n\nLionel Lambourne\"",
