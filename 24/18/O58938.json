There is no bass-bar. The neck carries a thick and flat, rising fingerboard which extends a little way over the belly. The tailpiece is flat and shaped obliquely. The obliquely placed bridge has a short leg resting on the belly and a long leg which passes  through the right-hand (bass side) soundhole to rest against the back; there is also a short central projection which does not reach the belly. The strings pass through holes above the nut to the rear of the crosspiece where they are tuned by six iron wrest pins turned from the front by a separate key. Of the six strings, two run clear of the neck on the bass side.' - Anthony Baines: Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-keyboard instruments.

It continued to be played in Wales as late as the 19th century, featuring in eisteddfods, where it was either plucked or played with a bow. This instrument is a copy of a crwth made by Richard Evans in 1742. Evans's crwth was restored in 1871 by Georges Chanot (1831\u20131895), a London violin maker and dealer of French origins. So it was most likely Chanot who made this copy, probably soon after 1871.",
