The subjects are not named dancers, nor probably even drawn from life - they are simply 'ballet dancers'.  The image of the dancer crystallised in the 1840s - creating an image that would transcend time and fashion, was created in the1840s - sleeked-down hair, pointed, low-necked bodice, or a laced bodice over a small blouse, and knee or calf-length bell-shaped skirt formed of tiers of tarlatan, with a diaphanous top layer.  So strong was the image that, even today, people who have never see a ballet would recognize these prints as 'ballet dancers.'   In this print, the castanets and rose in the hair indicate a Spanish dance.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
