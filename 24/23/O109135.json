This harp was made in 1787 for a certain Mme de Binet (n\u00e9e Honteloup) of Dieppe, possibly as a wedding present, and was fitted with a series of holes and shutters in the back of the sound box. These were part of a short-lived device, invented in 1785 by the harpist Jean-Baptiste Krumpholtz (1740\u20131790) so as to vary the volume of the harp. Not only was this harp fitted with the latest mechanical gadget, it was also highly progressive in its decoration. The figure with an Egyptian headdress was carved on it more than twenty  years before the vogue for all things Egyptian became widely fashionable at the time of Napoleon\u2019s military campaigns in Egypt.",
