Martin, who is unknown.\nJoseph Moore was a British engraver and medallist who - already at ten years of age - convinced his parents to let him earn his own living and entered the office of a then well-known silversmith. While there he learned drawing under Henry Follet Osler. When starting business for himself he started off with dies for button making, which at the time was the greatest industry of the town. A 'Brummagem button' was something more than a necessary item for fastening clothes together. Buttons were made in all sorts of fanciful and really artistic designs, approaching works of art. At the Great Exhibition 1851 he was arwarded the pize for excellent workmanship in the manufacture of buttons. He then switched to coins and medals and did many and very successful coins. One for example was a penny piece for the Mint.",
