Before moving to Blackpool he lived in Hanley, Staffordshire, where he drew performers at the Grand Theatre. By 1917 he had moved to London, where he established Cooke\u2019s Publicity Agency at 453 The Strand.",

At one time he had a commission to produce groups for the Blackpool Illuminations.'  These caricatures appear to have been done for George Cooke's own amusement, since it was he who collected them, and got the subjects to autograph them for him.",
