It includes cartouches of calligraphy in praise of Sayf al-Din Jurji, who served the Mamluk Sultan Hasan of Egypt in the mid 14th century.\n\nA conspicuous motif with two dots and two stripes appears several times in the upper register of the body. This is a stylised penbox and indicates Sayf al-Din Jurji\u2019s high rank in the Sultan\u2019s household.",
