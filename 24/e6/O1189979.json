            "history_note": "Historical Significance:\n\nEnglish painter and diarist. In 1763 he moved from his native Lancashire to London where he studied under the landscape painter Richard Wilson. Through his time with Wilson Farington learnt to always paint from nature but to refine his impressions through looking at the work of Claude Lorrain. In 1765 he joined the newly formed Society of Artists, where he continued to exhibit until 1773. He enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools on there inception in 1769. Elected ARA in 1783 and RA in 1784, he was to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1813. Between 1776 and 1781 he lived in the Lake District, where he produced numerous topographical sketches. His interest in topography and antiquities was strengthened by the growing appreciation of British landscape. He made numerous sketching tours of Britain and also visited Flanders in 1793. However it is through his diaries that Farington made his most significant contribution to the history of art. The entries in these diaries, spanning from 1793-1821, record the day-to-day affairs of the Royal Academy. \n\nCaernarfon is situated on the coast in Gwynedd, Nort West Wales. The castle was built by Edward I between 1283 and 1330. The castle was used as Edward I\u2019s administrative centre for North Wales. This resulted in the walls being much thicker than usual. Held by Royalists, the castle was besieged during the English Civil War. It then remained neglected until the nineteenth-century. \n\nThis watercolour is signed and dated 1791. Farington uses short, broken, pen strokes to carefully observe the different textures of the ancient site of Caernarfon Castle. These vary from the large cut stones of the castle walls that frame this narrow view, to the thinner rough stones of the cottage and leaves that grow over the left hand wall. Red ink is used in the foreground for outlines whilst black ink in the background draws our eye into the view. The drawing is almost monochrome, with thin washes in India ink delicately applied. Blue tones are added on the hills and sky.",
