The top surface moves back and, at the same time, the top drawer slides forward, to provide a writing surface. It is a smaller version of another piece in the Museum's collection (Museum no. 1088-1882). The trellis marquetry is similar to designs found on pieces made in the 1780s in Paris by the Swedish-born cabinet-maker Pierre-Harry Mewesen. Both the pieces in the Museum's collection belonged to John Jones, a succesful supplier of military uniforms to the British army, who used his fortune to buy French decorative arts of the 18th century. At the time that he was buying, in the 1870s, there was a brisk trade in both reproduction and fake French furniture, while some genuine 18th-century pieces were embellished with grander marquetry or richer gilt-bronze mounts.  Although this kind of commode-secr\u00e9taire had been made in the 1780s, the small scale of this one, and the great richness of its decoration, have led us to debate whether it might have been made nearly one hundred years later.",
