The carving includes the arms (Quaterly, 1st and 4th, or, three torteaux, for Courtenay; 2nd and 3rd, or, a lion rampant, az., for Redvers, the old Earls of Devon) and mottto ('UBI LAPSUS QUID FECI') said to be of the Courtenay family of Devon (although the modern motto is 'FIT VIA VI').  The bed has been fitted in the 19th century with two footboards (one resting on the bed rail, the other standing in front of the bed-stock.  The top of the lower board is carved with the date '1593'.  The design of the bed incorporates grotesque figures, masks and fanciful beasts, with flowers and formal motifs, with small areas of inlay. The hangings of the bed are a recent addition for display purposes, by the current borrowers.   \nThe bed is constructed with a full-height panelled and carved headboard and with free-standing show-posts at the foot end, the plinths of which conceal cupboards, opening each with a single door. Together the headboard and show-posts support the coffered and carved wooden tester and the wooden frieze, cornice and cresting carvings. The panels of the headboard do not come lower than approximately 69 cm from the floor and below this the posts are joined by a separate bed-rail (H: 12 cm, W: 7.3 cm, visible length: 117 cm).\n\nThe side rails of the bed-stock are replacements, but probably of the late 18th or early 19th century. They are cut to take splats which would run across the bed but also show a recess cut on the inner edge of the top surface, to which a sacking bottom was at one time attached (fragments of this survive). The foot-rail and the footposts of the bedstock were missing from the time the bed went to its current loan location and have been replaced in stained pine. \n\nThe footboard above the bedstock is set within iron brackets screwed to the top of the side rails and is clearly a 19th-century addition, with some areas in walnut.  The footboard covering the space below the bedstock is carved in a different fashion.  It is placed outside the foot-rail of the bed, set between the functional foot-posts and lying just behind the show posts.",

This bed, which bears the arms of the Courtenay family of Devon, may have been made in the west country.  Several of the carved ornamental motifs are found on other furniture, particularly chests that have been in churches in Somerset for several centuries.  The date on the lower footboard is, however, misleading. Although the bed was probably made at some time between 1590 and 1630, the date of 1593 was carved when this panel was added to the bed, probably just before it went to Turton Tower, possibly in 1840.\n\nJames Kay, the owner of Turton from 1835, was a keen antiquarian, who restored the medieval tower and added new wings.  He furnished his house with a great selection of 'ancient' oak furniture (mainly dating from the 16th and 17th centuries) and with tapestries and paintings.  This bed would have appealed greatly to him with its long history, and its association with such a distinguished aristocratic family.",

XI, no. 129, 2 March 1891, pp. 225- 231 [copy in departmental records].\nAccount of a visit to the sale of Turton Tower by Messrs Lomax & Sons & Mills, Norfolk Street, Manchester. \np. 227: 'There were a large number of dealers and connoisseurs present, and the prices realised during the day were high, the competition being keen and sometimes exciting. The two celebrated bedsteads in the 'Queen Anne' and the 'Tapestry' room [this 404-1890] realised phenomenal prices, the former going for seventy guineas, the latter for three hundred and forty guineas, and there was no little satisfaction when it was known that the more costly of the two had been purchased by the South Kensington Museum. To this remarkable four-poster, which is illustrated in Fig.5, I may first direct special attention, seeing that it is now the property of the nation. So far as I know, this is the first sketch which has ever been published of it, and although not showing every detail it will give a fair idea of the stately contour and the character of the carving. It stood, as I have said, in the famous Tapestry Room (which derives its names from the fact that the walls were hung with well-preserved tapestry), but it was formerly called the Humphrey Chetham room.  It was known locally as the Cromwell bed, but apart from any historic associations it is, perhaps, the finest work of art of the kind in the country. It has panelled head, footboard and canopy top, the latter being supported by elegant pillars on square bases. It is very massive throughout, and the carving - of conventional floral designs and birds - is masterly, while the coat-of-arms, the motto \"Ubi lapsus qui feci\" (Where there is a mistake I have made it), the date \"1593\" and the grotesque heads at the corners give additional interest and value.  The late Mr J.C. Scholes, in his \"Notes on Turton Tower\", says that this piece of furniture, which was purchased by the first Mr Kay, of Turton, \"is said to have been used by Queen Anne, one of the wives of King Henry VIII, and also by Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, when it stood in one of the French Ambassador's chambers in London, prior to its removal to Turton Tower. Whether these assertions are true or not, it is certain that the valuable relic is some hundreds of years old, and that an offer of a large sum was made for it to Mr. Kay. A quotation in the \"Notes\" to which I have just referred, from a rare work published nearly half-a-century ago, points out that on the cornice are the arms of the Earl of Devon, to one of whom the bed is said to have been presented by the King of France (assumed to have been Henry IV). The bedstead is six feet long, five feet six wide, and eight feet three high. It is not so big as Shakespeare's \"Great Bed of Ware\", but, as I have said, it is certainly one of the most ornate of its class extant. \n\nSuch an apartment would be incomplete without its ghost. Fortunately, history does not deny us that luxury. We are told \"on the best authority\" that \" a lady in rustling silk passed through the room on stated occasions, and that then the bed uplifted itself\".  I wonder whether the ghost and the silk dress are included in the price which was paid for this treasure. One would have thought so to have heard the competition. The bidding started at thirty guineas, and was then taken up to two hundred. The bidding then became slow, and then amid considerable excitement it was slowly taken on to three hundred and forty guineas, at which price it was knocked down to POllen, of London, who was commissioned to buy it for South Kensington.'\nScholes, J.C., 'Notes on Turton Tower and its successive owners'.

This example, dated 1593, and carved with the arms of the Courtenays of Devon, is now deposited in the Bethnal Green Museum.

It remained there until it was sold in September 1890 by Messrs Lomax & Sons & Mills, Norfolk Street, Manchester, who conducted an auction sale on the premisses . It was purchased by the V&A for \u00a3357 (340 guineas).  A letter from J. Hungerford Pollen to the Secretary of the Science and Art Department, from Turton at the time of the sale (Nominal File MA/1/L1851), recorded 'It is the most untouched of all the old pieces. I had passed my hand over the original standards at the back to ascertain whether they had been cut or pieced, also I closely looked into the showy posts at the bed foot. But all the work there, I feel satisfied is old, &amp; of its own time.  One, I dare say both of the dado bases of the footposts have a side maek to open so as to form a bedside closet, nor could I find that the door so made is modern.  That is not, however, a detail of any real importance.'\n\nIn 1909, a letter from the then Earl of Devon, suggested that the most likely time for the bed to have left Powderham would have been about 1823, when the 9th Earl went to live in France and the house was left almost dismantled.  He pointed out that the 11th Earl, who succeeded in 1859, was a collector of old oak, so unlikely to have sold the bed. \n\nThe bed was returned to Turton Tower on loan in 1978.",
