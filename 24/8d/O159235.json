Many were solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. Gloves were popular as gifts and were exchanged as a gesture of engagement or wedding present. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.\n\nDecorative gloves were popular with England\u2019s working class. In 1618 Horatio Busini, chaplain to the Venetian ambassador to England, wrote disapprovingly in a report on English customs:  \u201call wear very costly gloves.  This fashion of gloves is so universal that even the porters wear them very ostentatiously.\u201d\n\nThe decoration of this pair is characteristic of the period 1615 to 1625 with couched embroidery in a stylised pattern and edging of silver-gilt bobbin lace.",
