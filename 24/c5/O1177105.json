His grandmother, who holds him around the shoulders, leaning her face towards him, is looking at the camera and smiling. She wears a diamond crown and jewellery. Over her gown, she wears a dark coloured sash which is decorated with ribbons and two miniature portraits. These miniature portraits are framed with jewels and appear to depict the new Queen (Elizabeth II) and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The scene is framed by a draped curtain; which reveals a painted backdrop depicting the exterior of Westminster Abbey (where the Coronation ceremony had taken place shortly before this sitting).",
