            "public_access_description": "Queensberry Hunt are the leading UK ceramic design practice of the post-war period. Formed in 1966 by david Queensberry, then Professor of Ceramics at the RCA, and his former student Martin hunt. the partnership have designed ceramics for major producers and retailers around the globe. these include Wedgewood, Hornsea, Rosenthal, Habitat, Crate and Barrel, John Lewis and Jamie Oliver. Their practice spans a period of immense change in the industry, brought about by the adoption of new technologies, and the shift in production towards East Asia. Working in an essentially modernist aesthetic, Queensberry Hunt have been responsible for some of the most familiar and best-selling tableware of recent decades.\nThis 'Concept' series was designed by Martin Hunt for Hornsea in 1977. In its crisp but subtle surface relief, 'Concept' exploited the design possibilities afforded by 'vibrating polishing' (vibrating the piece in a container loaded with ceamic pellets). This created smooth unglazed surfaces. Another critical and commercial success, 'Concept' won a Design Council Award in 1977.",
