Fine arts and scientific inventions and discoveries remained central display themes but each exhibition presented different aspects of manufacture. In 1872 one emphasis was on jewellery, including \u2018peasant jewellery\u2019. The Exhibition Commissioners arranged with the South Kensington Museum (later V&A) to make a collection of peasant jewellery from \u2018all parts of the world, which should become public property, for exhibition in the Museum after the close of the Exhibition\u2019. A letter was sent by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to British representatives overseas asking for their help in securing pieces of jewellery, particularly examples with \u2018a direct connection with the native instinctive art, which has been handed down by a long tradition\u2019. The outcome was considered to be \u2018most satisfactory \u2026 a collection of characteristic ornaments never before equalled was obtained\u2019. \n\nThis anklet, originally one of a pair, is part of this collection. Described as \u2018Moorish\u2019 at the time, it is from North Africa, probably Algeria or Morocco. Called khalkhal (khul khal), such anklets were worn by women in urban areas.",
