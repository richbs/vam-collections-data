Also, they were often built into an interior and destroyed when the room was altered or redecorated. The frame of this mirror was probably supplied when it was removed from its earlier setting.\n\nPeople\nAntoine Monnoyer was born in 1672. He was  the son of the French artist Jean Baptiste Monnoyer, who worked for Louis XIV and then came to England in 1678. The Monnoyers, father and son, painted flowers from all seasons of the year, achieving a decorative effect that could not be realised with cut fresh flowers. Jean Baptiste did a mirror closet at Kensington Palace for Mary II. Apparently she was so fascinated by his skill that she watched him while he worked.\n\nDesign and Designing\nThe painting is in a style associated with the Huguenot designer Daniel Marot. The light framework of gilded ornament, with garlands and baskets of flowers supported by putti, is similar to the only dated example of painted mirror glass to survive. This was painted in 1701 by Jakob Bogd\u00a0ny (born around 1660, died 1724), another Protestant \u00e9migr\u00e9 from the Continent, and is preserved in the closet at Dalkeith Palace, Scotland.",

Mrs Blezard\n\nNotes from R.P. 34/3275\n\n18/7/34 Minute paper of H Clifford Smith\nChristopher Hussey (Country Life) phoned to report the offer of a large mirror the glass border of which is painted with flowers in the style of Baptiste.  The mirror is from Mrs Blezard's house \"Stocks\", Albury, Tring and was said to have been given to a former owner of the house by James II.\n\n23/7/34 Ralph Edwards Minute paper\nEdwards inspected the mirror at Stocks.  He describes the mirror contained within an (ovals) moulding of Charles II period.  The oil painting on the glass is \"considerably damaged\" but \"very accomplished and an important example of a rare form of decoration\".  Edwards suggests that the painting is French (in the style of Jean Baptiste), \"but it is quite possible that one of the many French craftsmen domicled in England at that period was responsible\".  Edwards was reminded of mirrors of the same style as Boughton; elsewhere in England such decoration is scarce.  Mrs Blezard reported that tradition holds that the mirror was given to the former owner of Stocks, a brewer to the Crown, by the Duke of York (later James II) in recognition of his services in entertaining (cr---illegible) who sought refuge there during the Plague.\n\n24/7/34 H Clifford Smith Minute paper\nSmith finds it difficult to say whether the mirror which he dates 2nd half of 17th Century is English or was perhaps decorated by a Frenchman living in England.  The mirror is a great rarity of accomplished workmanship and a very important example of its kind.  He suggests it might be \"improved\" by judicious restoration and recommends Prof. Tristram (a margin notation suggests Tristram \"advise\" unless fees can be found to restore).",
