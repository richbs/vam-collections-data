London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Thomas GAINSBOROUGH (1727-1788)\nLandscape, a bridge with cattle passing over, and two figures seated on the parapet, in the background is a ruin.\n(Hayes 11)\nLettered <i>Designed and Engraved by Thos Gainsborough.  Pubd as the Act directs, Aug. 1. 1797, by J. &amp; J. Boydell, No 90, Cheapside, &amp; at the Shakspeare Gallery, Pall-Mall.\n</i>Soft ground etching coloured by hand.\n32.1 X 39.5cm\nE.603-1916\nGiven by Henry J. Pfungst, F.S.A.\nHayes = John Hayes, <i>Gainsborough As Printmaker</i>, London 1971.\n\nGainsborough made fewer than twenty prints, none of which appear to have been issued to the public in the artist's lifetime.  This print, thought to date from 1779-1780, was republished by the enterprising print publisher John Boydell in 1797, as number one in as set of twelve Gainsborough landscape prints.\nThe colouring on it is an enigma.  Examination by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy failed to reveal any information about the pigments used, either because they are organic dyestuffs, which cannot be recognised by this method of analysis or the quantities of pigment used are so negligible that the equipment cannot register them.\nHenry J. Pfungst formed an important collection of Gainsborough's drawings.<sup>1</sup>  According to M. Goodall, <sup>2</sup> he was also the owner of the fifteen Gainsborough prints, referred to in George William Fulcher as being in the possession of Mr Constable of Arundel.  In 1913, fourteen of Pfungst's Gainsborough prints, one of which is heightened with white, entered the collection which is now the Kupferstichkabinett, West Berlin.  As the V&amp;A was later the recipient of two Gainsborough prints from Pfungst's collection, it is impossible to say whether this print was part of that set of fifteen.<sup>4</sup>\nHayes records sixty-four impressions of the twelve landscape subjects Boydell republished, now in public collections, and of these, four are hand coloured.  They are this print and impressions of Boydell numbers one, two and three in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.  The three prints in New York were acquired in London in 1942.  The general colour scheme used in the hand-colouring is the same in both the New York and London impressions of Boydell number one.\nThere are also a pair of prints in Boydell numbers two and three<sup>5</sup> with provenances stretching back to Gainsborough Dupont which it has been suggested were coloured by him.  As they are coloured with some sort of chalks or crayon, they cannot readily be compared with this print, which has been coloured in what appears to be watercolour applied with the point of a brush.  It is impossible from such slight evidence to draw any firm conclusions as to when the hand-colouring on this print might have been added.  The matter will have to be left open until such times as further evidence concerning the date of the colouring becomes available. \n\n1. Christies 15th June 1917.\n2. <i>Gainsborough's Landscape Drawings </i>London 1939 p.94.\n3.<i> Life of Thomas Gainsborough</i>, 1856 p.27.\n4. The typewritten catalogue of Pfungst's collection in the library of the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, sheds no light on the question. \n5.
