These were the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism. The image takes the form of a simple and direct question mark.  \n\nThe colour orange and the form of the orange fruit were fundamental elements of the party's graphic identity.  Orange recalls the expression  'Hungarian orange' from Peter Bacso's film 'A tan\u00fa' (The Witness, 1969) that criticised the anomalies of the communist regime in the nineteen fifties.  One of the lines from this extremely popular tragi-comedy rapidly became a catchphrase in Hungary: 'it is little bit yellow and a little bit sour, but it's ours'. In this phrase, people saw the essence of life under communism aptly formulated. Magyar Narancs (Hungarian Orange) was the title of a newspaper, founded 1989 by young publicists, several of whom became active members of FIDESZ.  Another point of reference was the Polish opposition movement 'Orange Alternative'.\n\nAnother important element of the party's identity is the the graffitti-like lettering of the name FIDESZ (an abbreviation of Fiatal Demokrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge/Alliance of Young Democrats). FIDESZ sounds like the Latin word 'fides' (trust) and the campaign played on this.",
