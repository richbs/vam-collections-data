Salmina-Haskell (London, 1972; p. 8), this drawing belongs to the same hands as the drawings in the collection of John Carr Doughty which were shown at the Diaghilev  exhibitions in Edinburgh (Nos.101-5)  and Strasbourg (Nos. 182-4, 187).The latter and attribution of this work to the Bakst imitator were discussed by L. Salmina-Haskell in 'Diaghilev at Strasbourg' (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, October 1969, 632-5). This drawing has a slightly differently drawn signature: 'Bakst', and never 'L\u00e9on Bakst'. In the catalogue of the Victoria and Albert Museum they have been listed as 'copies after Bakst', but according to L. Salmina-Haskell it is more correct to attribute them to an 'imitator', as they are done in the manner of Bakst rather than copied from any work by him. All these drawings are usually said to be costumes for Potiphar's wife in <i>La L\u00e9gende de Joseph</i>, a ballet with music by Richard Strauss, first performed at the Paris Opera on 17 May 1914. The style of the drawings, however, is clearly of later date, probably the late 1920s.",
