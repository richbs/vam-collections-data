Chains like this, with a hook at one end and a corresponding loop at the other, were used to fasten the front of the dress, the cape and even the hood in some places.  The lion attached to one end may have been worn with this chain, or may be part of a separate clasp.\n\nSardinian traditional jewellery is quite different from the traditional jewellery worn elsewhere in Italy.  It is mostly made of heavy silver, rather than gold, and often looks like mediaeval work from northern Europe.  This chain was described as Scandinavian when it was given to the V&A in 1937, although it was bought in Rome.  Although it is now unique to Sardinia, silver jewellery of this kind was probably worn more widely in southern Italy before the 19th century.  There are traces of an earlier tradition of heavy cast silver jewellery in places like Scanno, in Abruzzi.",
