            "public_access_description": "Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867) was born in Paris where he trained with his cousin, the landscape painter Alexandre Pau de Saint-Martin (1782-1850), and subsequently with Joseph R\u00e9mond (1795-1875). In spite of progressively emerging as the leader of the Barbizon school, Rousseau was systematically excluded from the Paris Salon between 1836 and 1841. Between the revolution of 1848 and the early 1860s, Rousseau enjoyed a short period of prosperity with official commissions and was eventually made Officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1867, a few month before he died.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Rousseau's portrayal of trees, one of his favourite subject matters. Originally executed on paper and later laid on canvas, this painting was probably made en plein-air, directly after the motif in the forest of Fontainebleau. This artistic practice was characteristic of the painters of the School of Barbizon, of which Rousseau is considered one of the most authoritative exponents.",

From about 1837 he went to Barbizon nearly every year and became the central figure of the group of painters associated with that place, but public recognition came only with the Revolution of 1848 and the first class medal awarded by the free jury of the 1849 Salon. \n\nLit.

They are buried side by side in Fontainebleau forest. Rousseau's landscapes, unlike those of Millet, are unpeopled, and at first sight can seem unremarkable and prosaic. But closer study reveals their mysterious power, and his remarkable ability to capture the sombre beauty of the trees in the forest of Fontainebleau. Rousseau's trees, more than those of any other artist, with the exception of John Constable, are individual portraits rather than generalized studies, as in this example, an oak tree which for years bore the name of Le Rageur, a famous oak in the Chaos d'Apremont. \n\nA character in the powerful short story <i>The Man Whom the Trees Loved</i> by Algernon Blackwood is an artist whose attitude to trees closely resembles Rousseau's. 'He painted trees as by some special divining instinct of their essential qualities. He understood them. He knew why, in an oak forest, for instance, each individual was utterly distinct from its fellows, and why no two beeches in the whole world were alike ... he caught the individuality of a tree as some catch the individuality of a horse ... it was quite arresting, this way he had of making a tree look almost like a being-alive. It approaches the uncanny.' \n\nLionel Lambourne\"\nEvans, M., with N. Costaras and C. Richardson, <u>John Constable.

Ionides' personal inventory of his collection, private collection), probably from the firm Goupil and Co.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Rousseau's portrayal of trees, a recurrent subject matter within his production of landscape paintings. This imposing oak tree dominates the landscape in the forest of Fontainebleau and was probably depicted after the motif <i>en plein air</i>. The earthen and cool palette enlivened with touches of burnt ochre suggests that the picture was captured during an autumnal afternoon.\nRousseau lived in the nearby village of Barbizon, which gave its name to the realist movement developed there by artists attracted by the atmospheric effects and the beautiful nature of the forest of Fontainebleau. Their art is reminiscent of  John Constable and 17th-century Dutch landscape painters, whose depiction of the natural world had a strong influence on their technical approach. Constable's strongest impact in France, from 1824 when <i>The Haywain</i> (1821, The National Gallery, London) was shown at the Salon, up to the late 1830s coincided with the beginning of the movement later called Barbizon school.\nAn inscription on the back stretcher reads: 'Th. Rousseau vers 1840. Etude du Dormoir', which places the painting around 1840 but as Kauffmann suggested, this painting may have been executed at a later date. A painting is the Louvre showing a group of oak trees in Apremont (Inv. RF 1447), executed c. 1850-52 and exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1855, shows many similarities with the present painting. It is not unlikely that the Louvre painting, representative of Rousseau's studio-reworked paintings, was inspired by the present composition. \nRousseau particularly favoured depicting lone trees, demonstrating a remarkable ability to capture their individuality. The present tree even had name: it was called Le Rageur (i.e. the furious one) and this painting shows Rousseau's transitional position between Romanticism and Naturalism as he oscillates between the humanisation of nature and the truthful rendering of the countryside.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
