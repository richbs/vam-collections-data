The examples were all of wares either made by Indian craftsmen working in the traditional centres of Delhi, Rampur, Khurja, Halla and Multan or of items made by  the Bombay School of Art, whose ceramic output was heavily influenced by the products of these indigenous potters.  The collection was formed to give a good representation of  which shapes, colours and pottery techniques were employed.",
