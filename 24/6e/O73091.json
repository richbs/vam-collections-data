The imposing figure is carved from a single piece of ivory, and the elegant sway of the Virgin's pose follows the slight curve of the elephant's tusk.\n\nHistorical significance: In the second half of the thirteenth century, the emphasis in production shifted towards private sculptural commissions, more particularly portable devotional objects, and numerous ivory Madonnas and diptychs survive from the thirteenth and fourteenth century. The models for such portable pieces are found in monumental sculpture, but small ivories allowed a refinement of detail which would usually have been out of place in larger works. The love of elegance for its own sake dominated art at the end of this period.",
