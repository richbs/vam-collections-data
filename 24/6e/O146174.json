In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nThis portrait is composed as a diagonal pattern between light and dark. The deeptones of the interior of the building contrasts with the sculptural form of the sunlit figure. The folds of drapery, the surface textures of the corderoy and leather and the shadow of leaves against the doorpost set off the well defined fingers and strong profile of the man. Jones' pencil and wash figure studies also drew attention to shadow and drapery.",
