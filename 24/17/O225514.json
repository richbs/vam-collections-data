I have endeavoured to follow your inclinations as well as I could, still attempting to imitate the style of building, most in favour among the antients except in the ornaments of the inside which you limited to as few as possible, avoiding too great an expense.  I did not think needfull to express more than the small room on one side with its conveniencys the other for the baths being much the same the walls of both will butt against the great room and add so great a security that if you please you may arch with brick instead of wood as here expressed, the same of the Lobby or neck which joyns to the farm house.  I have not designed the upright of the outside because you allways proposed that should be rude and hid from the eye by two espaliers planted at right angles to the building and some what behind the portico,  Which portico is Tetrastyle, the intercol: of the sides Systylos and that of the midle Diastylos both as directed by Vitruvius, whom I have also followed in the proportions of the room, which is broad 2 parts of 3 its length and high 2\u00bd of the same length, so speak the truth it does not answer my expectation.  Perhaps I may proceed from the strong desire I have to please you - you will excuse the drawing not being done as I could wish but I was in haste and forced to leave it to a servant.  if you like the intention we can better that at any time.  Yours.'\n Signed and dated 'EP  [.?..] 28 1725'",
