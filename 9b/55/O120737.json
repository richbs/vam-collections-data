Made from red sandstone and decorated with grey sandstone, the tower is 21 metres high. Protruding from it are many rows of elephant tusks. These are made of stone but could originally have been ivory tusks from elephants that died in battle. There are many theories as to the function of the tower. One is that it was used as a type of lighthouse that marked the way to the city.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised.\nThis window mount is similar to others in the collection. It has a label with red edging with the title of the photograph. This type of label and mount suggests inclusion in an exhibition, possibly the Paris exhibition of 1867 or the subsequent South Kensington exhibition for which no catalogue has been found.",
