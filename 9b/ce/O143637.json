Talbot's photographic discoveries of the 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produce a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\n\nIn 1853, Jones moved to Belgium and it is likely that he photographed in Boulogne at the time of a chanel crossing from Newhaven. Like his photographs in Bristol, he chose to record the harbour and the old maritime area of the town. This photograph captures a street of steps leading steeply up from the Napoleon Basin between a row of fisherman's cottages.   .",
