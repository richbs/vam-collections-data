            "public_access_description": "This object was donated to the Museum from part of the Michael Buhler collection of tin toys. Tin toys cover a vast array of subject matters ranging from the space age to domestic objects. This car was made in England, possibly in the 1950s. Small friction drive cars are often produced in sets with different artworks. The most usual set, as shown here, is Police, Fire and Ambulance. \n\nThe first tin toys appeared in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. The tin toy industry soon spread to Europe, particularly Germany, where many tin toys were made around Nuremberg. The three main manufacturers of tin toys based in the UK were Wells Brimtoy, Chad Valley and Mettoy. Many tin toys produced in the UK were considered crude or naive by the standards of those produced in Germany or Japan. This particular tin toy was made by a company called Dibro, who today are a privately owned business, specialising in vacuum coated products, injection moulded plastic decorations for the bakery and greeting card industries. Dibro Ltd was initially set up by three brothers in Liverpool in 1933, printing stationery. However, after the war and due to the lack of materials available, the company decided to make a future in manufacturing. In 1953 the company became a limited company employing over 200 people in three factories.",
