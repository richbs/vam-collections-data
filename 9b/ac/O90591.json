It did not need a tripod as the exposure times were between on-tenth and one-quarter of a second. This combination of features allowed Martin to produce candid images of people relaxing, his camera and activity unnoticed. During the summer of that year, he went to the seaside at Yarmouth and produced images of holidaymakers at the resort. Paul Martin was one of the first photographers to use these new developments in camera technology and produced some of the most memorable holiday photographs.\n\nThis image grid is linked to museum number 255-1978. However, as well as containing the image of this object, three separate others are also illustrated:\n\n239-1978 top right\n255-1978 top left\n251-1978 bottom left\n263-1978 bottom right",
