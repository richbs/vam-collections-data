Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \nThe Pool \n1389-1869 Neg GX57 \nCanvas, 50.4 \u00d7 60.5 cm (20 \u00d7 24 ins) Townshend Bequest 1869 \nHeleniak places this work in her section devoted to paintings attributed to Mulreadv, noting that this painting does not resemble Mulready's early (pre-1814) landscapes nor his one late landscape Blackheath Park (FA137, p198). If it had not been firmly ascribed to Mulready by Waagen as early as 1857 its attribution would be in jeopardy. Although remaining doubtful about its authenticity, Heleniak suggests that if it is by Mulready it may date from the early 1850s and show Blackheath pond from another angle to that shown in Blackheath Park (FA137). Pointon did not include the painting in her exhibition. \nEXH: \tIrish Art in the Nineteenth Century Crawford Municipal School of Art, Cork 1971 (85) \nLIT: \tG F Waagen Galleries and Cabinets of Art in Great Britain, 1857, p178; Heleniak 205 p227 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nWaagen, <u>Galleries and Cabinets of Art in Great Britain: Being an account of more than forty collections of Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Mss, etc</u>, London, 1857, p.178.\nThe following is the full text of the catalogue entry:\n\n\"Mulready.- A richly wooded landscape, with a piece of still and transparent water; on the shore an angler; to the right is a view over a sunny discance. This picture, about 1 ft. 6 in. high, by 1 ft. 11 in. wide, has a singular charm. The whole is imbued with the most refined feeling for nature, and notwithstanding the close individuality of detail, vis. In the trees, the keeping is admirably preserved, and the colour equally powerful, true, and transparent.  \n\nGustav Waagen\"",
