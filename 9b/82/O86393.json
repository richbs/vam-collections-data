He was billed as the \u2018Phenomenal Animal and Instrumental Imitator\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Also on the bill that week were Joe Peterman\u2019s company in The Belle of New York and Cliff Ryland. They were also drawn by Cooke. Gilbert Girard performed in the halls in the early 1900s billed as an \u2018Animal and Instrumental Mimic\u2019, and at London's Canterbury Music Hall in 1906 as \u2018The Human Harp\u2019. This image shows that his animal impressions included a dogfight and a cat courtship. In February 1910 he was still advertising himself in Great Britain in The Performer magazine as an animal and instrumental mimic. But by 1919 he was on Broadway in America, in Penny Wise (1919) and later in Twelve Miles Out (1925).",

Little appears to be known about his career, although by 1919 he had returned to America, and was appearing in the Broadway stage in 'Penny Wise' and in 1925 in 'Twelve Miles Out'.  The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
