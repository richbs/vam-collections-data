There is a Mosan-Rhenish tradition of such decoration, which flanks the major figures of a shrine with supporting allegorical subject matter (eg the St Albinus shrine, in the Treasury of St. Pantaleon, Cologne (c. 1186), which has spandrel angels, with Virtues and with the doves of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit).",

E79).  This shrine is catalogued in <font -u>Ornamenta Ecclesiae</font -u> as being made in Cologne, in about 1170.\nThe closely comparable plaques in the British Museum are described in Stratford 1993 as Mosan, about 1160-70.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The half-length figure of an angel holds a text from the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount: 'Blessed are the pure in heart' (Matthew 5:8).  The same subject occurs in various other enamels (eg on the Alexander head reliquary from Stavelot (now in Brussels), dated 1145, and on the Mosan-influenced candelabrum at Aachen cathedral.\n\nThere are plaques of similar shape and scale (though with a flattened base, rather than a point), showing personifications of Religion and Faith, in the British Museum (M&LA 78, 11-1, 15-16).  They also differ in the detail of their beaded upper border.  They are catalogued in Stratford 1993 as being Mosan, c. 1160-70.  Falke 1904 also refers to a similar angel plaque in the Berlin Kunstgewerbemuseum, but gives no further details.\n\nThe plaque (with 6816-1860) was probably originally placed between the arcades on the sides of a shrine.  There is a Mosan-Rhenish tradition of such decoration, which flanks the major figures of a shrine with supporting allegorical subject matter.  There are two main types of spandrel plaques on the surviving shrines.  Either they act as a subordinate background between separately-cast half-length figures (eg St Anno shrine, at Siegburg (c.1183).  Or they can be figured enamels of this type (eg the St Albinus shrine, in the Treasury of St. Pantaleon, Cologne (perhaps dating to c. 1186) (<font -u>Ornamenta Ecclesia</font -u> 1972, cat. no. E80).  This shrine has spandrel angels, with Virtues and with the doves of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.  The plaques with doves illustrated in this catalogue have similar upper borders, with inscriptions, and go down to points at the bottom in the same way as the V&A plaques.",
