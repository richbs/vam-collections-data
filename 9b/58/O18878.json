Trains were popluar motifs in both embroidered and woven fabrics in Bengal in the 19th century. This type of fine white-on-white embroidery is known as chikan work, a term of unknown origin, and it was done mainly in Dhaka (today the capital of Bangladesh) and Calcutta in eastern India, and then in Lucknow.",

ISBN 0 85488 047 X\nHandkerchief\nCalcutta/ mid-19th century\nWhite muslin, white cotton and pink silk embroidery in a variety of stitches, scalloped edges (uncut). Approx. 42cm square. Shown at the Paris Exhibition of 1867.\n\nDelightfully naive border patern of palm trees (with pendant mosque lamps), flowers, foliage, male figures in a type of Muslim dress, parrots, and early steam locomotives. (The first stretch of the East Indian Railway - one of the three original Indian railway companies - opened between (Howra) and Pandua in 1854.) This tour-de-force of 'chikan' embroidery includes incredibly fine lattice work ('jali'), made not by drawing out threads as practised in Europe - and in inferior examples of 'chikan' work - but by pushing apart with the needle the spaces between individual sets of warp and weft threads, and securing the edges with a minute buttonhole technique.",
