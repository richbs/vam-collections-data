Some of their production was for the peasant market and most probably was exported as far as Central Asia.\n\nThe donor's family were Lazarus & Co of Calcutta who mace furniture from about 1870 to the end of the century. It seems probable that this coat was acquired by the brother of the donor's Grandmother - either from another merchant or during his travels. Because of strictly enforced sumptuary laws, the better known silk ikat and ikat velvet coats could only be worn by members of the local nobility and their entourage. The use of Russian printed wool for this coat would suggest the wearer was wealthy, even though forbidden to wear ikat. It has two pockets, which are not a traditional feature and suggest that the wearer (the Lazarus family were English Jews) had the coat made specially for him and requested the inclusion of pockets.",
