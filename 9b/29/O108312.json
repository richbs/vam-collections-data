Traditionally it is said to have belonged to the English king Charles II (1630-1685) when he was a child, but there is no evidence for this.  \n\nThe construction is very similar to adult jackets worn domestically during the same period. The jacket is knitted in stocking stitch with bands of geometric motifs in plain and purl. The front edges are in garter stitch, rolled over and sewn to keep them flat. False seam lines were knitted into the interior to mimic those found in sewn jackets. In fact, the only seams are along the shoulders, which are joined by casting the front and back stitches off together.",
