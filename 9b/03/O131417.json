According to a manuscript label on the back, the work shows him at the age of 15, on the occasion of his entry to the Royal Mint (where he studied under William Wyon RA), dating the portrait to 1836/7. Adams entered the RA Schools 1840 and studied with John Gibson RA in Rome 1846-7. He designed prize medals for the Great Exhibition of 1851, and was selected to take the death mask of the Duke of Wellington 1852. Adams became a \nhighly successful medallist and sculptor, exhibiting 119 works at the RA between 1841 and 1885 and producing several public sculptures in London and elsewhere. However, R Gunnis, in his <i>Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851,</i>1953 describes them as of 'unequal merit' (his statue of General Napier in Trafalgar Square was described by the <i>Art Journal</i>(1862, p98) as 'perhaps the worst piece of sculpture in England'). \nHe is shown in this portrait wearing a sculptor's cap and holding a modelling tool; on the plinth is a (barely visible) sculptured bust. He died at Chiswick, Middlesex, 4 March 1898. For another portrait, by J B Burgess, see P44-1982, p15).\"",
