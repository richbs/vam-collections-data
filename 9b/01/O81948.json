This probably refers to Henri Touting (1614-about 1683), an enameller of Blois and Paris. It used to be thought that Samuel Cooper painted the miniature, but the signature, 'S. C.', was added at a later date. The miniature derives from Anthony Van Dyck's well-known portrait of the 10th Earl of Northumberland at Alnwick Castle.",

Long noted in the department file that the retouching had been done since the miniature was reproduced in Gower 1882.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Falsely signed lower left in black: <i>SC</i> \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century enamelled gold locket, the back of shallow convex section, the edges rounded to the rebate of the (now missing) front cover; the flat glass held by a bezel formed from the upstand of the rebate; the cover hinged at the bottom and fitted with a clasp at the top; the hanger a solid cast loop of cosse de pois type, with two side projections and a small finial, channelled to take enamel, dark blue beneath the projections, and light blue above.   \n \nThe subject of the enamel on the back is <i>Cleopatra holding the Asp</i>; it is signed <i>H.T.</i> in monogram. HT is understood to be the enameller of Blois and Paris, Henri Toutin (1614-c.1683), whose <i>oeuvre</i>, together with that of the rest of the family, was described by Henri Clouzot. (1) The present enamel was implicitly added to the oeuvre when it was illustrated, but not discussed, by Philippe Verdier. (2) \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> George Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle, at Castle Howard, Yorkshire; acquired by George Salting by 1898; (3) by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> NPG 1974 (included in the catalogue between nos 16 and 17, but not actually shown in the exhibition).  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Gower 1882, vol. HI, pl. 24 (as at Castle Howard and 'evidently copied from the head in Lord Salisbury's picture');Williamson 1904, vol. Il, pp. 137-8 ('many of the best works [from Castle Howard] have been dispersed during the last few years'); Foster 1914-1 6, vol. n. p. 56, no. 35 I ('probably formerly at Castle Howard '): Long 1930, p. 13 (,attributed to Cooper'); Foskett 1974, pp. 81, 126 (as autograph); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9; Reynolds 1988, pp. 48-9.  \n \nAlthough Long acquiesced publicly in the attribution of this miniature to Cooper, he expressed his doubts in a MS note in the department file: 'very likely by Hoskins with a spurious Cooper sig.' He would probably have been influenced in this view by a consciousness of some or all of the Hoskins interpretations of the basic Van Dyck types mentioned below. And he was right about the signature, which is obviously an addition. But he may have been misled into associating the style with the elder Hoskins' bright sanguine, yellow and blue stipple of the late 1630s (see entries following Hoskins, Cat. No. 27) by the polychromatic efforts of the restorer.  \n \nThere are also technical differences from Cooper's mature works of which Long could not have been aware. Under X-ray, the carnation ground visibly follows the exact silhouette of the sitter's head and hair, instead of being brushed on in a series of confident horizontal strokes; under ultraviolet, it has none of the characteristic striation visible for example in the Samuel Morland (Cat. No. 83 [481-1903]). But since the miniature, if it is by Cooper, would be very early, and since it is a copy or a close variant of another's work, such differences are not conclusive.  \n \nMicroscopic examination of what remains visible of the original face-painting does seem to show the long wiry hatches in sanguine and brown that we know to have been Cooper's in the 1640s and find also in the putative work of the 163 Os represented here. The miniature that would anchor the group to Cooper would be the Margaret Lemon\" of c.1635, which is signed. To these may be added, in the same iconographical idiom, the portrait of Algernon Percy's second wife Elisabeth Howard, whom he married in 1642 s and the Frances Stuart, Countess of Portland at Windsor. In vigour of draughtsmanship in the face, and also in the characteristically broad, almost violent treatment of the landscape background, these portraits are easily differentiated from the Hoskins images after, or alluding to, Van Dyck of the same period.  \n \nIconographically, the miniature is a derivation from Van Dyck's well-known portrait of the 10th Earl of Northumberland at Alnwick, probably mediated through at least one variant type. The latter is probably the group portrait with the Earl's first wife and child (good studio versions at Hatfield House, Hertfordshire and Petworth House, West Sussex), in which the head and shoulders of the Earl differ from the Alnwick type primarily in the striking detail of the lace-edged collar. From this portrait evidently come the following miniatures (photographs of 1, 2 and 3 are in the NPG files) : \n\n1  By Hoskins, Christie's 10 April 1962, lot 99; catalogued as genuinely signed with the IH monogram, but in bad condition and judging by a photograph not indubitably by Hoskins.This is evidently the miniature formerly in Lord Aldenham's collection; (6) bt Manning. \n2  'After Van Dyke' at Windsor. \n3  'By John Hoskins', whereabouts unknown. \n4  'Attributed to Hoskins', collection of the Duke of Northumberland. (7) \n\nThe V&A miniature differs from these derivations from the family group portrait in preserving in its background an explicit reference to Northumberland's naval career, which culminated in his appointment as Lord High Admiral (1637-42); he also wears his Garter ribbon, having become KG in 1632. A possibly direct source, more immediate than the Alnwick type, may be the painting (reproduced in Connoisseur, April 1912, p. 214) which shows the Earl's head, with the lace collar, against a sky and stormy sea; the ship bears a strong resemblance to that in this miniature.  \n \nAlthough the family group versions have frequently been dated to 1640-1, they must, as Malcolm Rogers points out,\" be before the end of 1637, because Northumberland's first wife Lady Anne Cecil, who is included in the image, died on 6 December 1637. Furthermore: Jeremy Wood has actually found a mention of the Family Group in an account for the year ending 15 January 1635/6 ... possibly the date when the Earl actually sat.' Robin Gibson, discussing the version of the Alnwick picture in the Clarendon Collection, also dates the composition c.1636-7. (9)  \n \nDating the miniatures to c. 1636-7 is much more comfortable in relation to Cooper's career than the traditional dating of the early 1640s. In handling, the miniature relates rationally to the Margaret Lemon of c.1635, and leads on to the familiar stream of Cooper's tidier and more austere work after 1642. Cooper is documented as having benefited from observing Van Dyck at work: this miniature may have emerged from just such a privileged access to the master's studio.\n\n1 In <i>Revue de L'Art</i>, XXIV~XXV (1908~9); see also H P Mitchell, describing two watch cases in the V&A, 'Two French Enamelled Watches', <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, XXXV (December 1919), pp. 245-6. \n2 'An Unknown Masterpiece by Henri Toutin', <i>Connoisseur</i>, 162 (May 1966), pp. 2-7, fig. 11. \n3 According to notes by Long in the departmental records, from information contained in the Salting \nnotebooks which are now lost. \n4 Lugt Collection Foundation Custodia, Institut N\u00e9erlandais, Paris. \n5 BurghleyHouse; NPG 1974,no.34. \n6 Repro.
