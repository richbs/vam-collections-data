The incense is placed on a hot coal in the bowl of the censer, and as the censer is swung gently to and fro by its chains, the coal burns and smoke billows outwards and upwards to perfume the church.  These working liturgical objects were highly prized during the Middle Ages and were often made of gold and silver and enriched with numerous details of the most elaborate ornamentation. In the archives or inventories of many Continental and English cathedrals (such as St. John Lateran, Trier, Louvain, Lincoln, and York Minster) minute descriptions are given of some ancient specimens in the possession of these churches.",

            "historical_context_note": "Medieval Treasuries\n\nChurches and Cathedrals owned collections of valuable objects called Treasuries. Medieval Treasuries contained two types of object; functional items used during the liturgy such as chalices and symbolic items to be revered and admired, namely reliquaries. These objects were made from rich materials such as gold, silver, enamel and gems. Such materials were considered to be the best way to honour God. The development of a treasury relied upon gifts. People donated precious objects as a sign of their wealth and status and to ensure remembrance after death. Some churchmen also sought to obtain treasures for their Church stores. Abbot Suger for example worked hard to improve the treasury at St Denis.\n\nTreasuries signified the wealth and power of their Church. Important relics attracted pilgrims, bringing wealth and status to the area. Many church treasures were kept on public display and used in public processions and festivals, which encouraged a sense of community. Other treasuries however were more closely guarded. The Basel Cathedral Treasury was kept locked in cabinets in the sacristy, only to be used on special feast days. This exclusivity only served to increase the objects' status as important and sacred objects.\n\nA censer is used to burn incense, a mixture of gum arabic (resin from an acacia tree) and fragrance. Incense has been used since ancient times to symbolise the prayers of the faithful rising to God. It is placed on hot charcoal in the bowl of the censer, and as the censer is swung to and fro, the smoke billows outwards and upwards to perfume the whole church. \n\nRitual cleansing and anointing play a crucial part in Christian worship, as they do in other religions. Water, salt, incense and oils are used in ceremonies such as baptism and confirmation, and in the blessing of individuals and of sacred objects like altars and bells.\n(SSSG Label text)",
