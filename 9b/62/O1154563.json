            "public_access_description": "The first Olympic mascot 'Waldi' a Daschund dog appeared at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nJingjing the panda is one of five 'Fuwa' mascots produced for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. Fuwa carries a message of friendship, peace and good wishes from China. Jingjing is one of the four mascots that embody the natural characteristics of China's most popular animals, the other three are the swallow 'Nini', the Tibetan antelope 'Yingying' and the fish 'Beibei'. The fifth mascot 'Huanhaun' represents the Olympic flame. Each of the Fuwa has a rhyming two-syllable name and when their names are put together \"Bei Jing Huan Ying Ni\" they say \"Welcome to Beijing\".\n\nAccording the Official website for the Beijing Olympics 2008 Jingjng makes children smile, he brings the blessing of happiness where ever he goes. As a national treasure and a protected species pandas are adored by people everywhere. The lotus designs in Jingjing's headdress are inspired by the porcelain paintings of the Song Dynasty (A.D. 960-1234) and symbolise the lush forest and the harmonious relationship between man and nature. Jingjing is an athlete noted for strength who represents the black Olympic ring.",
