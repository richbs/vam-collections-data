            "public_access_description": "This is one of many panels in the Victoria & Albert Museum's collection of stained glass from the Abbey of Steinfeld in Germany. It was originally in the second window in the abbey cloister.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Steinfeld was closed down in 1802 but prior to that in 1785 the stained glass windows of the cloister had been taken down. It is believed that they were purchased, probably at the time of the closure in 1802, by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Steinfeld panels to various churches and to private collections. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow, who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nThe scheme of cloister glazing at the Praemonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld was commissioned by its abbot, Johann von Ahrweiler (1517-1538).\n\nWe know the layout of the windows of the cloister glazing at Steinfeld from an illustrated manuscript that was made in 1632 and was housed at Trier. \nAnother manuscript showing the arrangement of the windows is in the state archives in Dusseldorf. This dates from 1719.\n\nThe kneeling figure here represents Dietrich von Hochsteden, Count of Are who is credited with instituting the establishment of the Premonstratensian Order at Steinfeld in the 12th century. The Order of Premonstratensian Canons had been established in 1120 by St Norbert. St Norbert had received a vision of St Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in North Africa and one of the Four Fathers of the Western Church, who had died in 430. In this vision, Augustine advised Norbert to adopt a rule for monastic living which he had outlined. This 'rule' emphasised an active life of preaching the gospel to the people but the canons lived and prayed together in a monastic environment. Hence, Canons are quasi-monastic. St Norbert stressed that his canons should be well-educated so that they would be better fit to teach the writings of the Gospel.\n\nDietrich von Hochsteden kneels before a shrine containing the relics of SS Potentinus, Felix and Simplicius. These were martyrs during the early centuries of Christianity under Roman imperial authority. At various times, Roman officials would impose death sentences on those who refused to sacrifice to the official gods and so were seen as enemies of the state. Many Christians met their deaths in coliseums, arenas and forums for refusing to sacrifice. The names of most of them are unkown but their burial sites were recorded and remembered over the centuries. When the bodies of these early martyrs were removed and re-housed in shrines in religious institutions, names were given to them. The names of the martyr saints here are in Latin and mean 'Power', 'Happy (in faith)', 'Humility'.",

The work was carried out consecutively, window by window, starting at the north-west and running around the cloister, taking in twenty-seven windows in all.

Reinartz visited Ashridge and described the glass as of the Cologne School and connected with Steinfeld.\n(1928) Ashridge sold and the glass put up for auction at Sotheby\u2019s.\nBought by anonymous and then given to V&A, with exception of three panels kept in his personal possession\n\nResearch since\n(1913) Schmitz refers to a MS in the city library of Trier (Treves)\n\tdescribes the windows in the Steinfeld cloisters\n\tcopy in C&G\n(1929) Reinartz says the Ashridge glass is not all from Steinfeld (as M.R. James thought) after discussions with the abbot at Mariawald\n\tthinks that Steinfeld and Mariawald glass was all painted by Gerard Remisch\n(1929) Sydney Harrison, Bowes Museum recognised that two Ashridge panels closely corresponded to a painting from an altarpiece at Bowes by the \u2018Master of St. Severin\u2019, of Cologne\n-\tRaising of Lazarus (just shows Christ), Mariawald\n-\tRaising of Lazarus (shows Lazarus), Mariawald\nRackham: altarpiece and glass from same drawing and probably painted by same person\n(1944) Rackham: \n1) Reinartz didn\u2019t recognise that the Ashridge windows come from more than one other souce and have no relation to the two series, from Steinfeld and Mariawald.\n2) Remisch didn\u2019t paint all of the Steinfeld and Mariawald windows\n-\tconfusion over mongrams\n1)\tChrist and his Disciples Crossing the Brook at Cedron, Window XIII, Steinfeld cloisters \u2013 monogram of Gerhard Remsich\n2)\tJacob and Esau (kept by anonymous buyer at this time) \u2013 monogram of someone else\n3)\tMany of the windows painted by Remsich bear dates, ranging from 1527 to 1542. From the style of the architecture, they are Renaissance. [Seems to be saying that Remsich only worked at Steinfeld.]\n4)\tDeduce that Mariawald panels also came from a cloister setting because their size and design are like that of Steinfeld which we know to have come from the cloisters (Trier MS).\n5)\tThe Ashridge Mariawald panels fall into two series \u2013 early and late depending on the style of the architectural surrounds\n-\t(earlier, 1510-20) flanking columns with Gothic capitals and bases; slender shafts decorated either with lozenge pattern or with spiral or boken fluting; sometimes have cusped Gothic spandrels\n-\t(later, 1520-30) show fully developed Renaissance ornament\n6)\tSubjects:\n-\t(Mariawald) Old and New Testaments \n\u2013\tcome from the Biblia Pauperum\nmostly copied from the woodcuts in the blockbook printed by Albrecht Pfister, Bamberg, in 1462/1463\nnot copied in order, the Gothic style panels are copies from later in the story woodcuts\n-\t(Steinfeld) Story of man\u2019s Redemption \u2013 incidents in the Life and Passion of Christ\n\n7)\tMariawald panels (windows of two lights each)\n1)\tearly ones, in order\nElijah and the Widow\u2019s Son (BP)\nThe Raising of Lazarus (St.Severin)- two panels, occupying two lights\nThe Transfiguration (BP)/ The Triumph of David (BP)\nElisha and the Sons of the Prophets (BP) (James thought it was an incident in the life of St. Norbert)\n2)\tlater ones\nGideon and the Fleece (BP)\nThe Nativity\nMoses and the Burning Bush\nsimilar to a woodcut in the Netherlandish edition of the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, printed about 1475-9\nThe Circumcision of Isaac\nThe Presentation in the Temple\nThe Repose on the Way to Egypt (subject not found in BP)\nThe Worship of the Golden Calf\nThe Massacre of the Sons of Ahaziah by order of Queen Athalia\nThe Massacre of the Innocents\n\tsome elements of copied from engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi, after Raphael\nChrist with his Parents on the way to the Passover\nThe Cleansing of Naaman / The Baptism\n\tcoupling of these two events derives from Speculum rather than from Biblia\nThe Temptation in the Wilderness\nJoab murdered by Amasa\nHeinrich von Binsfeld, Abbot of the Imperial Abbey of Cornelimunster (near Aachen) (1491-1532) and his patron St. Cornelius (two separate panels, occupying 2 lights of one window)\t\n\n8)\tSteinfeld panels (windows mostly of 3 lights each)\nMassacre of the Innocents, dated 1528\n\tthe central pair are also after the Marcantonio Raimondi engraving\n9)\tOther Ashridge panels\nLord Mayor\u2019s Chapel, Bristol (Steinfeld)\nMarston Bigot Church, Somerset \u2013 The Return of Jacob to his Country (Mariawald)\n\n\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Steinfeld was closed down in 1802 but prior to that in 1785 the stained glass windows of the cloister had been taken down. It is believed that they were purchased, probably at the time of the closure in 1802, by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Steinfeld panels to various churches and to private collections. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow, who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\n\nAbbot Johann von Ahrweiler (1517-1538) commissioned windows for the cloiser of the Praemonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld in the Eifel.\n\n\nWe know the layout of the windows of the cloister glazing at Steinfeld from an illustrated manuscript that was made in 1632 and was housed at Trier. \nAnother manuscript showing the arrangement of the windows is in the state archives in Dusseldorf. This dates from 1719.\n\nThe majority of the windows appear to be from the workshop of the glass painter Gerhard Remisch.\nThe panel here depicts Dietrich von Hochsteden, Lord of Aare, kneeling in front of a procession of Praemonstratension monks of the abbey of Steinfeld. Dietrich was responsible for the restoration of the monastery of Steinfeld in. Major events int eh history of an instituion, such as this restoration, were sometimes commemorated in stained glass windows. \n\nAccording to documents held at Steinfeld, the relics of SS Potentinus, Felix and Simplicius were translated by Sibido, Count of Are, from his family's church to the abbey of Steinfeld which he founded in 920. In the 12th century, the remains of these martyrs were rehoused in a golden shrine.",
