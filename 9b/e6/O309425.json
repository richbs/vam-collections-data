It was excavated from the site of Suffolk Place, in Southwark, the palace of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk (d.1545), brother-in-law to Henry VIII.\n\nSuffolk Place was a vast house built by Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, between 1518 and 1522. It  is the earliest example of a Tudor courtyard house known to have carried this type of extensive terracotta decoration. This use of terracotta quickly became fashionable and appeared on other buildings commissioned by Henry VIII's courtiers, including Cardinal Wolsey's York Place (later Whitehall) and Hampton Court Palace.\n\nCharles Brandon was an orphan raised at the court of Henry VII and became a life-long friend of Henry VIII, who made him 1st Duke of Suffolk in 1514.  The Duke was one of Henry VIII's most powerful courtiers, marrying Henry's sister, Mary, in 1518.",
