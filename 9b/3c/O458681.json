            "public_access_description": "A writing box such as this would have been fitted with various implements utilised for writing from an ink stick, water dropper, ink stone and brushes. To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took a while and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. \nThis writing box represents the figures Kanzan, Jittoku, Bukan and Bukan\u2019s tiger. Kanzan was a Daoist recluse or hermit famed for his intellectual capacities and often depicted carrying a scroll, as illustrated upon this writing box. Jittoku, famed for his compassion, was a novice of a Buddhist monastery and is illustrated by the presence of a broom whilst Bukan, a Zen eccentric, is signified by the sleeping tiger, his pet. Together these four figures are known as the \u2018Four Sleepers\u2019 and are often illustrated asleep due to their ability to attain Enlightenment through absolute tranquillity in nature and personality. In this depiction only the tiger is asleep. \nThe seemingly unrelated interior of autumn leaves perhaps reflects the journeys undertaken by Kanzan, Jittoku, Bukan and Bukan\u2019s tiger and their search for Enlightenment within nature.",
