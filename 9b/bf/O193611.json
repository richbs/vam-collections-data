This poster advertises a documentary film from the B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs Studio which was famous for its bold artistic experiments. The film was directed in 1988 but could only be released in 1989. The subject of the film was Gyula Krist\u00e1ly, a desperate old man who sent letters through the post criticizing the political regime in Hungary and was sentenced to prison for inflammatory propaganda. His case was an example of the spontaneous revolt of an individual against the political system. \n\nKrzysztof Ducki has chosen a simple, effective solution for the design of this poster. Using slightly uncertain black and white forms he creates a hazy alegorical figure of Justice holding the hammer and sickle (familiar symbols of communism) in her hands. She appears  truly blind and unable to balance.",
