Philip Oliver Goldsmith, a salesman for a small optical firm, founded the company in London in 1926. In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company\u2019s offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nA. Oliver Goldsmith's design for this frame was inspired by the French fashion designer Andr\u00e9s Courreg\u00e8s, who staged a fashion show around this time featuring models wearing white sunglasses with moon-shaped slits. Goldsmith modified the design for this somewhat impractical but distinctive style.",
