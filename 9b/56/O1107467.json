The publication contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.",

            "historical_context_note": "Des Cowley and Brian Hubber (2000) have described the initial publications of illustrations and descriptions of the platypus in Europe, including that by Bewick: \n\n'George Shaw, who had described the zoological specimens in a number of first settlement accounts, treated the platypus in detail in vol. 10 of his The Naturalist's Miscellany (1799), naming it Platypus anatinus. This was the first published illustration of the platypus, an animal which Shaw at first viewed sceptically \n[\u2026 ]\nShaw repeated the description and illustrations in his General Zoology of 1800 (vol. 1, pp. 228-32), although by then he was far more confident that the animal was what it seemed \n[\u2026] \nShaw's account and illustration of the platypus [Fig. 8] began to circulate throughout Europe, and so they also appear in C.R.W. Wiedemann's Archiv f\u00fcr Zoologie und Zootomie (1800, vol.1, pp. 175-80).\nWhen Governor Hunter sent a wombat specimen to the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Institute (described above), he also sent a platypus specimen. This specimen was the basis for the illustration and description in an appendix to Thomas Bewick's General History of Quadrupeds (4th edn, 1800). Bewick described the animal merely as \u2018An Amphibious Animal\u2019 but was clearly curious about the apparently eclectic nature of the platypus:\nThe other animal [i.e. the platypus] seems to be an animal sui generis; it appears to possess a threefold nature, that of a fish, a bird, and a quadruped, and is related to nothing we have hitherto seen.' \n\nTaken from: Cowley, Des and Hubber, Brian.
