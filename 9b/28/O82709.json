Because this was Madonna's West End stage debut, and because it was only on for a limited season, he realised that the poster would not have to sell the production and that the production would sell out as soon as it was announced in the press. Therefore he was in a position to go against all the usual unwritten rules of contemporary poster design.  He chose not to feature an obvious photograph of Madonna but instead used a photograph of a woman which had the right sophisticated feeling, cutting off the image at the shoulders, deliberately to make people ask if it was Madonna.  He also featured the names of all the actors in the same sized typeface, in alphabetical order.",
