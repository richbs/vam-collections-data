These images are based closely on selected works representative of his total \u0153uvre. Although they are close to the  originals, they are not identical in every particular. As the preface explains \"The concept of  this publication is the realisation rather than the reproduction of the essential ideas in Josef Albers' works...to show the artist's methods of formulating his ideas and thus demonstrate the manifold potentials in his unique concern for colour and formal relations, rather than to reproduce selected painting from special collections...\"",
