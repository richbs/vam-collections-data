Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland Advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis drawing in pen and ink shows two women in a bedroom wearing underwear. The figure on the right is seated on a bed with a cigarette in her right hand while the woman on the left stands in front of her talking. The figure types of these two women, with their thin high eyebrows, defined lips, long faces and long willowy bodies follow the style of fashion illustration in the 1940s. Illustrations such as this would probably have been used to advertise lingerie.",
