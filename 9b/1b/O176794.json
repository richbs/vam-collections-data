            "public_access_description": "The following information is taken from the published work of Errol Manners.\n\nThis eighteenth-century porcelain model was made at Bow in east London and depicts a famous war hero, John Manners, Marquis of Granby.  He rose to fame during the Seven Years War, particularly after his decisive role in the Battle of Warburg on 1st August, 1760.  He was Colonel of the Blues regiment and was immensely brave, breaking through the French lines three times, once famously losing his hat so he is nearly always shown hatless with a prominent bald head.  His courage and generosity towards his men meant that he became a popular figure in England, and a good number of pubs and street names were named after him, many of which have survived to this day.\n\nThis version of the model, set on a high-scroll base, is typical of Bow figures of the early 1760s.",

English Ceramics Circle Transactions, Volume 18, part 3, 2004, pp 398-407. Illustrated fig. 7, p. 402. The Marquis of Granby seal illustrated fig. 10 was probably made after the Marquis's victory at the Battle of Warburg, 31st July 1760, thus extending the factory's period of production to that year or the following one.\nIn this article Errol Manners argues convincingly that the Marquess of Granby's fame in England dates from the period after his victory at the Battle of Warburg on 31st July 1760, rather than after the Battle of Minden on 1st  August 1759.  His role in the latter was less significant as he was under the command of Lord Sackville who commanded the British forces and was himself under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Prussia.  At Warburg however, he played a decisive role in the victory, breaking through the French lines three times, once famously losing his hat revealing his bald head.\nRedstone, Dr. David. <u>Finds and Excavations on </u><u>The Bow Factory Site 1867-1968, Part 1</u>.
