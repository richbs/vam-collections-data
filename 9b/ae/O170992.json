Part of their appeal was in their portability (most children's tops were relatively small in size) and availability, since a basic version could be produced quite cheaply and easily by hand, although it was clearly a skilled job to produce a well-balanced one.  But the important requirement for playing with a top is a clean, dry flat surface, and the boys depicted by Paye have found an ideal site in the paved cloisters.  The area was evidently frequently used by the boys of the school for recreation, according to 'The Annals of Westminster School' by John Sergeaunt (London: Methuen, 1898).",
