Commissions for ecclesiastical stained glass had declined drastically during England's Reformation in the 16th century. Protestants objected to these religious images on the grounds that they encouraged 'Papist' idolatry. The appointment of William Laud (1573-1645) as Archbishop of Canterbury  in 1633 gave encouragement to the revival of traditional devotional practices and church decoration. The inscription on this panel seeks to defend it against criticism from Protestants, asserting 'The truth here of is historicall genuine and not superstitious'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis panel is characteristic of the stained-glass making techniques of the early 17th century. Good coloured glass was scarce owing to the destruction by French forces of glasshouses in Lorraine - the chief source of supply. In its place, white glass was cut into panes and painted with enamels in the manner of a translucent canvas. The lead strips formerly used to hold the mosaic of glass together and to accentuate the design were reduced to a simple grid holding the picture together. Both stained and painted glass have been used in this panel.\n\nPeople\nNearly all the large-scale windows undertaken in England during this period seem to have been the work of foreign artists. The van Linge brothers came to England from Emden in Germany at this time. Examples of their work dating from about 1620-1640 survive in many Oxford colleges and in London. This window can be attributed to the younger brother, Abraham (active in England from about 1625 to 1641). His initials are painted on the top rung of the ladder leaning against Christ's cross.",
