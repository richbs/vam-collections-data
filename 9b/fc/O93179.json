On a background of gule (red) porphyry, the shield and the swords are in argent, the tincture of metals in heraldry, frequently depicted as white. Between the hilts of two swords on the left is the emblem of a papal tiara and crossed keys. The ribbons of the white shield are enamelled in yellow.",

Their coat of arms or stemma, with three swords in a pile fanwise, are still visible on their palazzo in Florence. The same coat of arms also occurs on the tombs of the Minerbetti family in the renowned church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence. This stemma features the papal keys and tiara, a right that the Pope granted only as an exceptional honour. However, other members of the family could inherit this right and it is therefore uncertain who commissioned this relief.",

Robinson, \u00a32\n\nHistorical significance: The Minerbetti family played a key role in the political framework of Florence between 1300 and 1700. Despite being of British origin, they filled key functions and positions in the political and administrative areas of the city. A key family member was Andrea Minerbetti, who as Gonfaloniere of Justice in 1434, (when Cosimo the Elder returned from exile in Venice) was recorded for his declaration that that whoever generated conflict with the Medici should be removed. This brought the Minerbetti family great favour with the Medici, highlighted by Giovanni Minerbetti being appointed as Ambassador to the court of Spain in 1560 under Cosimo I de' Medici. Throughout the Medici's de facto rulership and into that of the Princes of Lorraine, they produced a total of 33 priors and 12 gonfaloniers, highlighting their exceptional political longevity.\n\nThe Minerbetti family existed until 1771 but had no male heirs to their dynasty. Their palazzo on the via de' Tornabuoni maintained its simple characteristics during the century but was well-known for its solid construction and powerful aspect, with eight windows for each of its three stories. The austere elegance of the fa\u00e7ade and the private atmosphere of the interior arguably reflect the family's wealth and social standing.\n\nThe Minerbetti coat of arms or <i>stemma</i>, with three swords in a pile fanwise, are still visibile on their palazzo in Florence. The same coat of arms also occurs on the tombs of the Minerbetti family in the renowned church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence. This stemma features the papal keys and tiara, a right that the Pope granted only as an exceptional honor. However, other members of the family could inherit this right and it is therefore uncertain who commissioned this relief. \n\nThe stemma is displayed in a frame which, although not original to it, is of the same type as those used by the della Robbia workshop to surround coats of arms.",

            "historical_context_note": "On account of the presence of the papal keys in the left-hand corner, Marquand (<u>Robbia Heraldry</u>) indentified the arms as those of Francesco di Tomasco Minerbetti, Bishop of Arezzo, a friend of Pope Leo X and Councillor of State under Alessandro de' Medici and Cosimo I. \n\nLonghurst and Maclagan note that tombs of other members of the Minerbetti family in Santa Maria Novella also have shields charged with crossed keys, such as Tommaso Minerbetti (d.1499)\n\nFrom a passage in Vincenzo Borghini ('Dell'arme delle famiglie fiorentine) it appears that the initial grant of the right to bear the papl keys and tiara was usually associated with Papal knighthood or with an embassy of congratulation to a newly elected Pope. Borghini also states that the descendents of the original recipient retainged the charge on their arms, and cites those of the Canigiani and Soderini families as examples of this practice. A note by Manni confirms these statements.",
