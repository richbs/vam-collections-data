Des: The Designers Republic. Offset lithography with spot varnish. Fon Records 1987. E.746-1990. \nIn the late 1980s, the widespread appropriation of 'designer labels' like Gucci for use on imitation goods and as fashion statements for the young extended to include the logos of car manufacturers. The rap duo The Beastie Boys and their fans took to wearing 'VW' badges as pendants, taken from parked Volkswagen cars. The use here of the Mercedes Benz symbol was in part inspired by a shirt print of the logo and is a deliberate ploy to take Krush one degree higher in the exclusivity stakes.'",

Many were used as motifs in clothing patterns and in costume jewellery. In conversation with Kevin Edge in 1990, Ian Anderson (of the Designers Republic) stated that the appearance of the Mercedes Benz three-pointed star on E.746-1990 was inspired by a shirt which used the symbol repeatedly to create a pattern. In this context it is used by the Designers Republic to parallel the appropriation of actual Volkswagen car radiator badges worn as pendants by the American rap music duo The Beastie Boys and their followers.",
