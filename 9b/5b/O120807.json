She was voted 'Best Dressed Woman' in the world by Time magazine in 1962, second only to Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nGloria Guinness kept a full wardrobe in each of her seven homes, so that she would never have to pack.  She saw haute couture as an art form and patronised many couture houses. \n\nShe gave dozens of items to the V&A, including pieces by Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), Christian Dior (1905-57), and Hubert de Givenchy (b.1927).  Amongst these famous names were several lesser known labels, such as Marcelle Chaumont (b.1892; house closed in 1953), showing that she cast her net wide in her pursuit of fashion. The gown is made of hand-painted organza, in the yellow and gold tones that Gloria Guinness favoured.",

Born in Mexico as Gloria Rubio, her first husband was a Count Furstenberg, to whom she was married at the behest of the German art collector, Freddy Horstmann.  Her second husband was an Egyptian by the name of Fakhry, and her third husband, the banker Loel Guinness.  In many ways she was unhappy as his wife, as she loved to party and he did not.  She gave an enormous number of items from Balenciaga, Dior, Courreges, Lanvin Castillo, Givenchy, Hellstern and Jeanne Lafaurie, proving that she spread her commissions amongst many different couturiers.  Among the 17 outfits, 12 hats and pairs of shoes that she donated were a 1948 Balenciaga evening gown (T.16-1974) of organdie with flack flowers, a 1949 hand-painted evening gown by Marcelle Chaumont (T.92-1974), and a 1950s evening gown by Jeanne Lafaurie (T.281-1974), the only dress by that designer in the V&A's collection.",
