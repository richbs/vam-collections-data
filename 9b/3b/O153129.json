The design was not designed by him because it dates from after his death to about 1899 to 1900.  There is a design for an ironwork bracket in the album which is dated '11th of October, 1899'. Like this design, it is in the Art Nouveau style which is an international style of art, architecture and design that peaked in popularity at the turn of the 20th century (from about 1890 to1905) and is characterized by highly-stylized, flowing, curvilinear designs often incorporating floral and other plant-inspired motifs.",
