He stands looking right, holding a typical medieval spade in his right hand. A scroll rises vertically from his left hand. The diminutive figure of Mary Magdalene, wearing a gown and a cloak over her shoulders, kneels at his feet on the right of the panel looking up at him, holding a tress of her long hair in her left hand. Her usual symbol, the pot of ointment, is omitted. The eyes of both figures are finely carved. The top left corner of the panel and Christ's left hand are missing. The usual daisy pattern remains on the ground, where there are traces of green paint. The edges of the robes and hair of the two figures are gilded. There is a ridge down the back of the panel from top to bottom indicating where two saw cuts have met. There are two lead-plugged holes, one with a latten wire attached. The bottom has been cut away.",

It probably formed the terminal panel of an altarpiece. Jesus is shown holding a spade while a scroll, which probably originally bore an inscription rises from his right hand. \n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
