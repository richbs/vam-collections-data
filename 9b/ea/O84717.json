St Michael, a symbol of justice, divine power and protection against evil, was one of the most popular saints of the Middle Ages. \n\nHere he is shown feathered and trampling on a many-headed dragon with the Virgin standing behind him. In his left hand he is shown holding a pair of scales (the arms of which are now broken). On the right, a devil's head sits in the weighing pan, attempting to tip the balance, while to the left the Virgin lays her rosary on the arm of the scale to tilt them in favour of the soul which would have been held in the now-missing weighing pan on the left.\n\nThe size of this figure suggests its importance. It was probably intended as a single devotional image, set within a winged tabernacle.",

It was probably intended as a single devotional image, set within a winged tabernacle.\n\nHistorical significance: Large carved and painted alabasters of this sort would have been a familiar sight in churches both in England and on the Continent. Saints like Michael, Christopher and the Virgin were often the subject of independent devotional images, which could act as the focus for prayers. These saints were believed to aid the supplicant, either in this life or the next.",

He was also one of the most popular saints of the medieval period, being called upon to aid the passage of the soul after death. The presence of the Virgin Mary, with her rosary, emphasises that this image was about the role of prayers to the Virgin and St Michael, which were believed to speed the soul's passage through purgatory.",
