Made of nylon, it wasn't made to be worn, but rather to be held up outstretched in the audience so that the band could see your adoration. This fashion came from the British phenomenon of having a scarf in your supported team's colours, and holding it up on the football terraces.\n\nDavid Bowie is one of the most influential musicians of the last five decades. He is an innovator, with a distinctive voice and intellectual depth. His major breakthrough came with the single Space Oddity in 1969, but this merchandise is from his glam period as  Ziggy Stardust. The image on the scarf is from the cover of his 1973 album Aladdin Sane and the lightning flash make-up on his face is synonymous with the singer.",
