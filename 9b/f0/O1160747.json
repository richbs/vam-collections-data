To left and right tiers indicating seating at ground floor levels with two upper levels fronted by gold painted railings, each with tiered seating and stairs, the seating areas painted in dark oxblood red with the edges of the stairs painted gold. At centre of auditorium a rectangular stage with walkways extending from the corners, all covered in rectangular metal panels, distressed to suggest rust.  At rear a curving wall covered in similar panels with long ladders to left and right and a wide doorway at centre. Above the doorway an open platform on which are three stands holding gongs and percussion instruments, all painted grey. Running above and across the stage are black plastic girders. Five wires hang from the girders, each holding a stage light. Two mesh bags hang above the stage, one to each side, each containing green beads. The back wall is covered with thin panels of balsa wood painted brown with black plastic correx panels to left and right, indicating doors.\n[set model] Backdrop of brown card, cut to form ridges, painted and distressed, the upper part covered by distressed grey tissue paper to which are stuck thin horizontal and vertical lines of balsa wood forming a pattern of squares.\n[set model] Circular tower designed to stand at rear of stage in front of doorway. The ground level covered with metal plates distressed to suggest rust, with an open doorway to rear and curved double doors at centre front. A line of light fittings is set round the tower above the doors. The metal plates form a parapet at first floor level, with a section of railings set into the parapet to right. At the centre of the first floor a metal cylindrical structure with divided double doors standing open to reveal a modelled and painted carcass of beef hanging centre. The upper part of the tower is open, the sides formed by five vertical bars with a second floor and two circular beams at upper levels. From the first floor a spiral staircase with mesh treads rises clockwise up the height of the tower.\n[set model] 'Walkway', the sides and floor supports of silver metal rod soldered together and distressed with silver paint, the floor of mesh. Designed to hang from a gantry above the stage.\n[set model] Square balsa wood 'cabin' with large rectangular doorway, the exterior walls painted dark brown, the top of black card, the interior covered in black card with a floor of black art board. The art board floor extends 2.3cm beyond the door. Beneath the model, and extending for 5cm beyond the cabin front and back, is a strip of clear plastic with, at front, an adhesive pad to hold another element of the model (missing). Attached to all four lower edges are black plastic 'gilders'. The cabin is supported at each corner by a wire, the lower end of each wire attached to a base made from four plastic rails distressed with bronze paint and fixed together to form a square.\n[set model] Plastic 'railings', painted brown with dull gold highlights, forming a rectangular shape with a curve to one of the shorter ends. With attached wires to hang the railings from the girders above the stage, the curved section to rear.\n[set model] 'Cage' made of horizontal and vertical wires painted bronze. No base or top. Designed to fit above the stage. From the lower corners wires extend front and back.\n[set model] Painted figure of a man, dressed in a deep red jacket, white shirt, grey trousers and black ankle boots, standing on a swing made from a short metal bar which hangs from long copper wires. The figure's arms are raised, with the hands moulded round the wires. The top of wires are bent at right hand angles to allow the swing to be attached to the gantry.\n[set model] Model of a stage spotlight with 'barndoor' panels, all made from card painted black. At rear a wire support. The light is designed to hook on to the lighting grid of the model by means of a wire attached to the top barndoor panel and the support.\n[set model] Model of a stage spotlight with 'barndoor' panels, all made from card painted black.

It became the Royal Shakespeare Company's temporary home while the main house, the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, was closed for redevelopment and was intended as a prototype for the new building. It was designed to accommodate 1000 people on three levels, with no seat further than 15m from the thrust stage. The opening productions were Shakespeare's three Henry VI plays, directed by the Company's Artistic Director Michael Boyd. Boyd and his designer Tom Piper had staged the plays in the Swan Theatre in 2000, and Piper, who advised on the design of the Courtyard, reworked his sets for the new, larger space. The steel cladding echoed the 'rusted box' effect which architect Ian Ritchie had created for the outer shell of the building, and suggested the harsh, armoured world of the Wars of the Roses. Boyd used his space vertically - battles were fought on swinging ladders and ropes, and characters descended from the flies in cages and on platforms, or emerged through trapdoors in the stage.",
