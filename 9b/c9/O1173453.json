Associated production: Children's Corner. Choreographer: John Cranko. Designer: Jan le Witt. Dancer: Jane Shore. Performing company: Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet. Sadler's Wells, London, 6.4.1948. Performance category: Ballet. Jane Shore danced the role of The Wooden Doll in this production. This design is particularly important as it is the only example so far found which relates to MacMillan's early dancing career.John Cranko came to England to study at the Sadler's Wells School in 1946 and went on to join the Sadler's Wells Ballet Company as choreographer rather than dancer. As there were few opportunities for producing ballets with the company, Cranko had been working for the Royal Academy of Dancing Production Club. Here, Ninette de Valois saw Morceaux Enfantins, set to Debussy's suite of the same name, and brought it into the Theatre Ballet repertory. Renamed Children's Corner, and given new designs by the well-known children's book illustrator, Jan le Witt, the ballet joined the repertory in 1948.",
