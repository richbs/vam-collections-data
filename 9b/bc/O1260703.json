            "public_access_description": "Grenadian born photographer Raphael Albert (1935-2009) was committed to celebrating the growing black population in Britain. Whilst living in Hammersmith, West London he began to organise and photograph a host of black beauty pageants from the 1960s to the 1980s, mostly targeted at women from the British Caribbean community. \n\nAlbert also promoted black models as a freelance fashion photographer. This photograph was taken during a test shoot at his home. The extravagantly bejewelled woman features in a number of his photographs modelling different hairstyles. \n\nThe V&A acquired seven of Albert\u2019s photographs documenting beauty pageants and the British Caribbean community in London as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
