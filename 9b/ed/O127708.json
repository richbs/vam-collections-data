Such receivers are commonly used in cars to guide the driver for the best route to their destination. Wood, in effect, spies on himself, tracking down his own movements in order to produce a comprehensive map of his journeys, thus creating a map narrative of his life. He then prints the resulting digital maps as archival inkjet prints. He effectively uses himself as a drawing tool, mapping his life with his body. \n\nThis print, \u2018All London Tracks\u2019, is a record of all the artist\u2019s tracks captured in London over the past five years, ending in August 2005. The dense black lines reveal the most travelled routes, and the red lines across the map are patterns made while flying above London on commercial airline flights. He describes his works as \u201cvisual journals of his travels\u201d.  His work is a discourse between fine art and new technology, balancing between printmaking, drawing and storytelling.",
