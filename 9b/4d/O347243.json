Mr. Pyke had devoted most of his life to the study of waxes, and was the recognised authority in the field. His 'Biographical Dictionary of Wax Modellers', published in 1973, has become the standard reference book for students of the subject. Mr Pyke's own collection was wide-ranging, and included British, German, French and Italian portraits and figure subjects from the sixteenth century up to the present day. His generous bequest augmented and complemented the then existing holdings of waxes in the Museum, many of which are on display nearby in Room 63. The Fitzwilliam Museum also received waxes from Mr. Pyke's bequest.",
