This exposure to the street life of Glasgow, combined with time spent in the army and as a bounder, provided him with a cast of characters - brooding men, boxers, dossers, derelicts, drinkers, squaddies - which he has incorporated time and again in his work.  <i>The Heroic Dosser</i> is a subject that Peter Howson has produced in a variety of different media, first as an oil painting, then as a charcoal drawing, a screenprint and a woodcut.  He utilizes the different media as a means of developing and discussing the themes that interest him. \nThis version is on of three large woodcuts (the others being <i>The Lonely Hero</i> and <i>The Noble Dosser</i>) made at and published by the Glasgow Print Studio.  As well as a development of a favourite theme, these prints were an attempt to produce woodcuts on a scale not normally found in this medium.  Here Howson uses the form to create a dark and brooding image of the dosser silhouetted against the night sky.  The man rests on a rail, apparently supporting a building that rises above him - the symbolic representation of a heroic figure carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, a tower of strength despite his downtrodden situation.  The size of the woodcut allows Howson to use large, almost brutal incisions that add to the emotional atmosphere of his subject.  Peter Howson's work of the late 1980s was representative of a trend towards figurative art with a social and political content.  It led to his being commissioned to record the war in Bosnia in 1992.\"\nAllegra Presenti, <u>Gouge: The Modern Woodcut from 1870 to Now</u> Los Angeles: Hammer Museum, 2008.\nExhibition catalogue",
