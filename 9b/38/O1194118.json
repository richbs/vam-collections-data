Furniture rests seem to have been made in sets and were used during the late 18th and 19th centuries, to raise and protect wooden furniture from damp and damage in a domestic environment. These rests are often referred to incorrectly as 'window rests'. They were thought to have been used to hold open sash windows, however the shapes and wear on these rests clearly indicate use under furniture legs.\nThis furniture rest was possibly made in memory of Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of the Prince Regent (later George IV), Princess Charlotte was second in line to the throne. After the disreputable behaviour of her father, many saw her as a symbol of hope. Her death in childbirth at the age of 21 in 1817 instigated a period of national mourning.",
