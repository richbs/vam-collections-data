Born in Hackney, he built the first purpose built tavern Music hall, the Canterbury Music Hall, and \n\nTheir success at the Canterbury allowed Morton to build The Oxford, in Holborn, as a competitor to the nearby Weston's Music Hall, in partnership with his brother in law Frederick Stanley and this opened on the 26th of March 1861. During a long and varied career Morton also managed the Alhambra Theatre, in Leicester Square and transformed the failed Royal English Opera House in 1892 into the successful \"Palace Theatre of Varieties\", a venue he continued to manage until his death in 1904.",
