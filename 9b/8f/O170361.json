Square, with symmetrical scrolling floral pattern around central motif of a chalice with the Host and IHS, and wheat ear and grapes, inside a 16 point star (alternating straight and wavy points). It is similar in technique to the other parts of the set, but not identical, and there is less sign of 19th century intervention. It is likely that the lace was mounted onto the red silk ground shortly before its purchase by the Museum in 1870. The narrow outer edging matches that on the other pieces of the set, and is likely to be 19th century.",

From the main centres of production in Italy and Flanders it was traded widely across Europe, and the industry responded quickly to changes in fashionable dress, as different styles came in and out of favour. In the 1660s, Venetian needle lace became the most fashionable lace, dominating the upper end of the market for both men\u2019s and women\u2019s dress. The industry also expanded rapidly through the patronage of the Catholic Church.
