The text is based on that in 'Masterpieces in Japanese Prints, The European Collections: Ukiyo-e from the Victoria and Albert Museum' (London: V&A. 1991), pp.140-1. I am unsure about copyright issues. Catherine David, 14 May 2004.\n\nTorii Kiyonaga (1752-1815) was a great print designer and painter of the Torii school whose own Kiyonaga style came to dominate the world of ukiyo-e, or 'pictures of the Floating World'. His special province was the portrayal of beautiful women. Prints depicting the daily lives of women and children with wit and parody were popular with the urban middles classes at this time, and many were based on the well-known series of Chinese paintings 'Eight Famous Views of Xiao Xiang'. This print was part of such a series by Kiyonaga, entitled 'The Eight Famous Interior Scenes'. It is a mitate-e, or 'allusion print': the cotton on the lacquered pail alludes to the evening snow of the Chinese painting. As is shown here, stretching the cotton wadding over a lacquered pail before it was made into something was one of the many jobs that women did by hand.",
