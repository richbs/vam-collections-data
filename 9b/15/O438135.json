Research by Maria Fabrizi \u2013 Feb. 1988: This object has a 15th century reign mark, and has a shape rather like a small cauldron with three legs. It is circular, and the body has an almost flat bottom. There are two small loop handles, with rings cast as decoration, and so forming part of the sides of the vessel. There is a small gap at one point where the body meets the rim, and there is some porosity in the areas of the rings and handles.\nThis object has been drilled for a metal sample, as it was one of those analysed by spectrographic methods, in Oxford, in about 1960. the drill-hole can be seen in the underside of one of the feet. It has been filled with a black resinous material, which fluoresces under UV light. This analysis showed that the metal was a copper-zinc alloy, with small amounts of tin and lead present.\nAbraded metal on the underside of the feet is quite yellow in colour, which is consistent with the composition. The rest of the body us orange-brown on the exterior, with some lighter patches, the overall visual effect is of the structure of the metal exposed by something like etching, and then coloured by a lacquer or similar material. The interior of the vessel has parallel striations, which are suggestive of turning, perhaps used for finishing the surface. There are some green areas, but mostly the surface is brown and dirty. On the side of the interior is a small reddish label, with Chinese characters written on it.",
