He was a member of the Paris \"art-glass\" fraternity and a pupil (later partner) of Eugene Rousseau, one of the movement's founders and this piece was probably made around 1885 when Leveille took over Rousseau's workshop. The glass was made, possibly, by either Appert Freres or at Clichy and decorated in Paris. Leveille's glass ranges from pieces like this one in the style of Japanese lacquer to works in mottled and splashed glass imitating agates.  \n\nGift of Mr. Julius C.
