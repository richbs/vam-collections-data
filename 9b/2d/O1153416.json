He worked on furniture, product, interior and exhibition designs and developed his 'No sign of design' and 'Table upon table' concepts (W.21-2009). He is one of the most successful contemporary Dutch designers and a key exponent of Droog, a design company he has been affiliated with since it's inception in 1993.\nWith the design of the Berlage chair Hutten returned from a rather conceptual approach to a more traditional timber chair-making. He designed the chair for the restaurant of the Gemeente Museum in The Hague. The renowned architect of the museum, Hendrik Petrus Berlage, provided the name for the chair. The form of the Berlage chair is relatively simple, with interest arising from the random lines of the strapped u pholstery and the angled construction of the rear legs and stretchers. The prototype is in several ways different from the final version (W.24-2009).",
