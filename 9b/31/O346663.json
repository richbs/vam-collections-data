Glazed tile friezes were popular in the warmer regions of central and south Iran. The design imitates popular textiles known as Ikats, which may have furnished the same interiors.  \n\nIn weaving, Ikat refers to a universal dyeing technique used to pattern textiles by means of applying bindings, which resist dye penetration, into the threads before the cloth is woven, a very labour intensive process. In Iran, Ikat textiles were imported from Central Asia as luxury goods, but also produced locally (C.P.A.1886). \n\nSimilar tiles appear in the paving under the arcades enclosing the garden of Qavam house or Narenjestan e Ghavam, in Shiraz, an ornate building constructed between 1879 and 1886, now a museum. Evidence of the fashion in Iran for Ikat patterns on the floor is found in the details of various mid-nineteenth century portraits and paintings.\n\n1)  A portrait of Muhammad Quli Khan, the Ilkhani of Shiraz, ca. 1853 (illustrated in Layla S. Diba and M. Exhtiar (ed.), Royal Persian Paintings: the Qajar Epoch 1785-1925, Brooklyn Museum, pl.48).\n2) A portrait of Prince Ardashir Mirza, poet and Prince-Governor, signed by Abu'l Hasan Ghaffari, Tehran, dated 1269 AH/1852-3AD.\n3) A painting of Hazrat Yusuf appearing before Zulaikha (Potiphar's wife), mid-19th century, Negarestan collection.\n\nFor other tiles with this pattern see: Lost Ok 89 (4); and 1531:148-1876",
