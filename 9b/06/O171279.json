De Maar rarely photographs the inhabitants of these spaces but the rooms nevertheless are seen by the artist as portraits of those who live in them.  Personal belongings, and the evidence of  habits and daily necessities,  give shape to the character of the room and the person. \n\nIn most cases, De Maar gains admittance by going unannounced from door to door and showing a letter of introduction in the appropriate language.  With this method, she is able to catch authentic states of domestic interiors and not one that is a censured or a version presented for visitors.  Her images are made predominantly with available natural light and require long exposures. They share a sensibility with historic Dutch 'Golden Age' paintings of domestic interiors, but combine this with distinctly modern subjects and concerns. \n\nAcross cultural boundaries, desire for personal space seems to be universal. By dealing with the notion of home de Maar's images touch a common personal interest to which all viewers can relate.  The photographs  not only open the door to the private lives  of others but  also offer a possibility for reflecting on our own.",

It is the first house behind the church. Valentina protests when Sanne and I want to go. No you cannot go to Palaga, she is too old. You cannot disturb here.\" \"No, don't go to Palaga\" says Anni.\"She will not be there. She has to go to the shop\". It is very clear that the other women do not want me to take pictures at Palaga's. So Sanne and I get more and more  determined to visit her. \nWe meet Palaga on the dusty village road on her slippers. She is about 86 and goes slowly. \"My dear Lord still hasnot found a place for me\", she says, \"so I have to walk the street for some more time.\" When she sees the coffee and the biscuits in our hands, she is only to happy to return with us to the house. \nPalaga has lived a very difficult life. Her several husbands were great drinkers and she herself did not abstain either. Now she lives in the old farmhouse with her son, who also drinks more then he works. So Palaga has to take care of the wood for the stove and heating in the winter. She also fetches the water from the river, which is not very close to her house.\nShe has worked in the forest all her life. Now she is retired but her house is in no state to take in Finnish tourist. So she virtually has no income. Pensions in Karelia are just as low as everywhere in Russia. When she is lucky she gets some fish from the neigbours. Perhaps her son will take care of the potatoes in the garden. Otherwise again she has to call on the neigbours. But most of them are just as old as she is.\nSummer 2005 I meet Palaga again. Her son has stopped drinking and has started to renovate the house. Although he threw away her bed and she has to sleep on a mattras on the floor, you can see that she is very proud. When he mannages to finnish the job, the house will be very pretty.\nMarch 2006 Asko mails me that Palaga's Lord finally found a place for her. Next time there will  only be her grave behind the church to visit.\n- Marrigje de Maar",
