The small hand on the outside of the alarm disc shows the time. The back plate is signed 'Eduardus East Londini'.\n\nPeople\nEdward East (born 1602, died around 1697) was apprenticed to Richard Rogers of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1618. He became a Freeman in 1627. In 1632, against his will, he was made one of the first Assistants of the Clockmakers' Company, which had been founded in 1631. He was Master of the Company in 1645 and 1653. In 1660 he was appointed Chief Clockmaker to the King, Charles II (ruled 1660-1685). His business appears to have been on a large scale, and to have had Royalist and Roman Catholic connections. Edward East's will suggests that he was resident in Hampton, Middlesex, in 1688, but his business continued in London. His will was proved (its validity established) in February 1697.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nThe finely engraved naturalistic flowers are in the style of the prints published for the use of engravers and enamellers by Jacques Vauquer (1621-1686) in Paris and Blois (Loir-et-Cher) in France  and Johann Paul Hauer (born 1629) in Germany.",
