The photograph is thus a record of the work done and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm. Skidmore was a leading Victorian metalworker in the Gothic Revival style, which was an architectural movement the nineteenth-century practitioners of which sought to revive medieval forms.  The object in this photograph has a sphere on top which is similar to the spheres on the roof of the Hereford Screen in the V&A. These features derive from medieval reliquaries and shrines such as the The Kings shrine in Cologne, Germany and that of  St. Elizabeth, Elisabeth-kirche, Marburg made in the thirteenth century.",
