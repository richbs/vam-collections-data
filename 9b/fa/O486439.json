Traditionally the maniple was an essential item used by clergy from the subdeacon to the bishop, and only during the rite of the mass. It functions as a handkerchief for the celebrant of the mass to wipe away perspiration or to keep hands clean for the celebration of the Eucharist. The cream based silk indicates that this maniple was intended for use on the feast day of a Saint who was not martyred.\n\nAlthough the Christian religion was not native to China, by the eighteenth century there was some missionary presence there. Embroidered silk vestments and liturgical textiles were made in China, not only to supply the requirements of the churches in China, but also frequently exported to Europe and other new mission posts such as the Philippines.",
