Stylised Chinese figures and landscapes were very popular design motifs from the late 19th century to the first half of the twentieth century, and were used in such export shawls and blouses. This jacket, produced for the London department store Woolland Brothers and thought to date to 1930s - 1960, has a very similar embroidered design, reflecting the continued trendiness of such embroidered products. \n\nAlthough the figure and landscape genre was fairly generic, individual elements were sometimes customised either according to the taste of the target market, or to make the design 'contemporary' to the times. The details of this jacket demonstrate a move towards the 'contemporary': the figures are wearing cheongsam and jackets in the fashion of the 1930s - 40s, and the embroidered cars are definitely a modern novelty in this genre of Chinese embroidery made for the export market.",
