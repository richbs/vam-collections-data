            "physical_description": "The shaped top is fitted with two superposed flaps which, when open, rest on a hinged leg fitting into the framework. The arrangement of the flaps is as follows: one, resting on a moveable peg, forms half a plain mahogany top, while the other flap forms half of the top of a card table covered with green cloth; a space is reserved at each corner for a candle or counters. In front of the table are two drawers with brass drop handles. The square legs are carved with fretwork, and have openwork brackets in the front angles.\n\nThe spandrels on the front of the table are of mahogany but those at the sides are of stained pine and are probably later replacements. The ogee incision on the centre of the front and sides of the table reflects the scalloped form in plan view of the table top. The inner surface of the top is lined with baize. The carcase of the table is pine, but the gateleg section is of beech, because it was stronger and less likely to split down the grain. The drawer bottoms are of oak.\nThe flat top is attached with a triple hinge, the fingers of which have been disguised with mahogany veneer. The peg of elm which supports the upper flap is lined with baize to prevent it scratching the upper surface of the wood. The peg is attached with its original hand made screw.\nTwo adjoining outer sides of each leg are carved with blind fretwork of an unusual pattern. The legs end in small cushion feet in the Chinese manner- an unusual feature commonly found on Chinese furniture and not on European furniture. The feet and the blind fret make this an unusually important object implying familiarity with China.",
