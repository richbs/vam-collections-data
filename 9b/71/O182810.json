For the headquarters of an American manufacturer of cleaning products Wright designed a range of metal and wood desks and matching chairs of which this is one.  Although first designed in heavy sheet aluminium, then in tubular aluminium, these proposals were abandoned in favour of cheaper tubular steel. Wright\u2019s use of tubular steel was very different from that of European Modernists but was indebted to aluminium furniture designed by his contemporary, the American Warren MacArthur.  At Johnson Wax, different coloured upholstery was used for different office departments.",
