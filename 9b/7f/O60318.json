In the years around 1900 a large number of young European designers sought to use materials commonly thought of as rigid \u2013 wood, glass and metals \u2013 in innovative ways. They imaginatively blended and adapted historical styles such as 18th-century French Rococo, with its shell and flower motifs, with Far Eastern and folk influences. The style became known as l\u2019Art Nouveau, or \u2018New Art\u2019. It was seen at its highest state of development at the Paris International Exhibition in 1900.\n\nThis table is one of the items exhibited at the Paris exhibition. The artist Louis Bigaux designed it for the well-known manufacturer and retailer Maison Bagu\u00e9s. Bigaux\u2019s work was unusual in comparison with that of other designers working in the Art Nouveau style, because he both understood and harnessed the production possibilities of machines. Many artists designed for hand manufacture, but Bigaux\u2019s designs were often mass-produced and therefore cheaper. They were well adapted to a bourgeois clientele searching for elegant yet affordable furniture.\n\nThis writing table formed part of a suite of furniture, which otherwise comprised an armchair, a chair and a stool. They are all now in the V&A\u2019s collection (1994-1900 to 1996-1900).",
