London: Sotheby Publications, in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1982.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>1</b> \nReconstruction of a piece of a conventional pomegranate design; incorporated within the design, the letter <i>H</i> and a goose (a rebus of Hugo Goes)\n<i>Circa</i> 1509\nMachine print\n76.4 x 53.3 cm\nPROVENANCE The Master's Lodge, Christ's College, Cambridge\nGiven by Sir Charles Allom\nE.1783-1914 neg 49088\n\nSee SE pls 1-3; Greysmith, pl 10. A lithographed facsimile was given by Professor W. R. Lethaby (E.539-1912). The pattern relates to Italian textile designs imported into this country in the 15th century; it also bears comparison with a leather hanging, possibly Spanish, on the walls of a house, which is now part of the Plantin-Moretus Museum, Antwerp (J. W. Waterer, <i>Spanish Leather</i> (1971), pl 8).\nHugo Goes was a maker of woodcuts and a printer who, after leaving Beverley, settled at York, where he was in 1509. He may subsequently have come to London.\nThe pattern was printed on the back of sheets of paper with letterpress and contains certain references to the first year of Henry VIII's reign (1509). This was the year in which the Lodge is known to have been built. The reconstruction was the work of Horace Warner (q.v.) of Jeffrey & Co. See C. Sayle, 'Cambridge Fragments', <i>The Library</i> (1911-12), 3rd series, vol II, p 340; A. E. Shipley, 'The Master's Lodgings, Christ's College, Cambridge', <i>Country Life</i> (1916), vol 40, 406-12.'\n\nNB: 'SE' refers to; Sugden, A. V., and Edmondson, J.
