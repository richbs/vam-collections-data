The sides have been turned under and stitched in place.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The Museum Number is in the top left hand corner.  There is a section added down the right hand side - to widen the panel; the colours are very different. It was originally 49.5 cm wide. There is a narrow border along the bottom: white ground with a large pink blossom facing to the lower left alternating with a group of 3 small blue flowers facing to the lower right.  There is a narrow white border beginning at the top of this band and continuing part way up the sides.  It contains small outward facing pink buds on a green stem.  On the right hand side the additional piece has been attached to the outer edge of this.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and dark blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a blossom with petals outlined in black facing either top right or bottom left alternating with a mauve and pink flower facing either down or to the right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] 3 diamond-shaped designs: angled striped stem with mauve diamond-shaped flower edged with dark green with 5 white flowers along the upper edges, pointing down; blue outlined vase with 2 small black outlined leaves and a spray of small white, light blue and pink flowers facing to the right; angled striped stem with large pink and yellow and light blue flower facing right.\n[b] 3 diamond-shaped designs, less distinct: main motifs of each are a group of 3 white flowers above a small blue cone-like flower and a mauve flower with petals outlined in black; group of 3 white flowers below a yellow flower with petals outlined in light blue to the left of which is a flower with 4 petals in shades of blue and 4 small white petals; the latter flower in the centre below a bunch of white 'grapes'.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; mauve, light mauve, dark green, light green, yellow, pink, white, red, black, orange, dark blue, blue.",
