Richard Riemerschmid designed it for a Music Room exhibited by the Munich Vereinigte Wekst\u00e4tten (United Workshops). A similar chair was shown the following year at the International Exhibition in Paris.\n\nThe department store, Liberty's, bought a number of these elegant but strongly designed chairs at about that time, including this one. They remained in use in the shop in London until at least the 1950s. Liberty's own workshops produced a version of the chair, but it was stockier than the original.\n\nThe extreme simplicity and strength of this chair illustrate Riemerschmid's interest in functionalism. This led him later to become an influential figure in the development of modernism.",
