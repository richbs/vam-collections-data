Not many examples are  left as they were regularly replaced as they become worn or dirty with in a nursery setting.  It was also common for these wallpapers to be varnished etc to help protect them and make them washable.  Some of the better examples of these wallpapers are found in the Museum's dolls house collection within their nurseries, in miniature form.\nThe earlier designs of wallpaper often were not only decorative but also have moral or educational elements that were deemed appropriate for the nursery.
