These medals are best appreciated when held and turned in the hand. Only this will reveal the intimate relationship of one side to other as intended by the artist. Fortunately contemporary medals are one of the most affordable art forms. The medal is thematically related to a large-scale sculpture of the same name showing full-length male and female figures. It was executed at the same time and is Chadwick\u2019s only medallic work. His monumental approach to composition is captured even within the small-scale format of the medal. This medal was cast by the Pobjoy Mint for the British Art Medal Society.",
