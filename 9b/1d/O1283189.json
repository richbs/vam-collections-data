He performed in Russia for 7 years, spoke several languages fluently and had 13 children. When they were mature enough the oldest two children were trained in foot juggling to become part of the family act, The Moxon Trio. One of his daughters Eileen later formed her own foot-juggling act, first with her brother, and in the late 1940s as Levanda and Van with her daughter Judy who went on to perform the act independently in the 1960s.\n\nEdwin Moxon performed in a costume of white tie, waistcoat, black breeches and tights such as he is wearing in this photograph, as well as in the more traditional Victorian acrobat's costume of leotard, trunks and matching collar. This photograph was given by Edwin Moxon's grand-daughter Judy, along with posters showing her grandfather's act, a pair of his acrobatic trunks, a programme for London Rhapsody at the Palladium Theatre in September 1937 illustrated with an image of her mother performing the act, as well as her juggling clubs made by her grandfather.",
