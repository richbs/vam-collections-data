He developed great skill and originality in hi techniques. He lived a dramatic but vibrant life which is documented in his aitobiography (unfinished, but published in 1728). This book was translated by many writers, one of them Goethe and was the basis for Berlioz\u2019 opera \u2018Benvenuto Cellini\u2019 (1837).
