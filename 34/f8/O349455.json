            "public_access_description": "This relief representing Christ and the woman of Samaria was made by Gottfried Wolffram, in Denmark or Germany in ca. 1683-1716. J\u00f8rgen Hein expressed that the work could have been brought over to England by Prince George, of Denmark, who married Queen Anne in 1683. The composition is highly likely to depend from an engraved source, although this has not yet been traced. The landscape with its receding stages is  reminiscent of French sources. The relief may originally have been attached to a piece of furniture.\nThe sculptor Gottfried Wolffram was active 1677-1707. His date of birth is unknown. He is recorded as working in Danzig with the sculptor and amber carver Nicolaus Turow, perhaps as his apprentice, in 1677. He entered the service of Charlotte Amelie, Queen of Denmark and consort of King Christian V in 1699. He was subsequently employed in Prussia, and produced the Amber Room for Friedrich I at Berlin, which was presented to Peter the Great of Prussia, and then removed to Koenigsberg during the Second World War; It is now lost, probably destroyed.",
