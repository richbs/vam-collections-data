These paintings were not meant to be used as designs for prints, as these were generally based on much freer sketches. Instead, they were individual works, purchased by a wealthier clientele.\n\nThis is the third of three paintings held by the V&A depicting scenes from a popular story called 'An Unfortunate Tale'. Ky\u00f4sai, one of Japan's most prolific artists, follows the sad plight of a woman. \n\nThe first work in this series shows a woman being kicked out by a man with pipe (museum no. D.1385-1897). In the second, she is shown weeping on a mound (museum no. D.1386-1897). In this, the third image in the series, the woman suffers merciless bullying from a group of children. They in turn are scolded by an old man, while a bypasser looks on.",
