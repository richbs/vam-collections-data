Despite employing Islamic design motifs it has a distinctly English appearance. It is also evidence of the continuing influence of the print trade on ceramic design, depicting the scene of 'Feramoz introduced as a poet' on one side and 'Zelica and Mokanna' on the other. These scenes are taken from illustrations by Hablot Knight Browne [pseudonym 'Phiz'] and G. H. Thomas to 'The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan', one of four tales, in the Routledge 1868 edition of Thomas Moore's poem Lalla-Rookh. Lalla-Rookh, although first published in 1817, remained popular throughout the nineteenth century as a Romantic portrayal of 'the orient'. In 1874, the date of this vase's production, the subject matter and design would have appealed to the growing taste for interiors decorated in the 'oriental' style.",
