Monique Hagemann in their documentation department is recording the prints and may well be in touch with you.'\n\n\nText from 'Van Gogh and Britain' by Martin Bailey:-\n\nPORTRAIT OF DR GACHET\nGIVEN BY PAUL GACHET TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM IN 1923\n\nEtched in Auvers in 1890\nEtching, 18 x 15 cm\nThe British Museum, London\nF1664/JH2028\n\nPROVENANCE\nPaul Gachet Jr, Auvers; British\nMuseum, London, 1923\n\nREFERENCES\n'The Graphic Work of Vincent van Gogh', \nVan Gogh Museum, 1995, no.10-40.\n\nVan Gogh produced only one etching, a portrait of Dr Paul Ferdinand Gachet (1828-1909), the homeopathic doctor he knew in Auvers. He also painted two celebrated portraits of Gachet which he executed a week or so before the print. As well as a medical specialist, Gachet was an amateur artist and an enthusiastic collector of modern art. He also owned a printing press, and this gave Van Gogh his only opportunity to experiment with the etching process. The etching depicts Gachet, aged forty-two, smartly dressed and smoking his pipe. He is deep in tought, with a furrowed brow, and has a melancholic air. The setting is almost certainly his garden, on the outskirts of Auvers, where Van Gogh loved to paint. The date on the etching, 15 May, is incorrect and was most likely added to the plate retrospectively by Gachet. Van Gogh had Sunday lunch with the Gachet household on 15 June 1890, probably the date on which the print was made. Six weeks later he shot himself and it was Gachet who treated him for the two days before he died. Gachet named the print 'L'Homme \u00e0 la pipe' (Man with a Pipe). Sixty-one impressions have been recorded, and this particular one was printed by Gachet's son, Paul (or possibly by his printer Eug\u00e8ne Del\u00e2tre). It was donated by Paul Gachet Jr to the British Museum in July 1923, making it the first work by Van Gogh to enter a British public collection. There are two of the Gachets' collectors' marks at the bottom of the print: on the left, the intertwined initials (P.F.G.), and in the centre, a cat's head. A second copy of the etched 'Portrait of Dr Gachet' came to Britain four years later, purchased by Henry Wellcome from Paul Gachet Jr for 700 francs (\u00a36). Wellcome, who owned a successful pharmaceutical company, had an enormous collection of medical material from around the world. His primary interest in the Van Gogh etching was that it ws the portrait of a medical specialist. His print was transferred to the library of the Wellcome Institute in 1936. A third copy of the etching (present location unknown) was once owned by Martha Edwards of Gloucester and was exhibited there in 1936.'\n\nHistorical significance: This impression is of the only etching made by Vincent van Gogh.",
