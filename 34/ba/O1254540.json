According to Reilly 'The principal sources used by Wedgwood and Bentley were the work of Bernard de Montfaucon and the Count de Caylus, neither of whom had visited Egypt but whose illustrations were genuine attempts to reproduce their subject in authentic detail.  The number of different shapes copied from illustrations of Egyptian originals produced during the lifetime of the first Josiah is surprisingly large in comparison with the work of any other pottery or porcelain manufacturer off his time.'  There were also architectural examples of the use of Egyptian ornament in England: an undated design for a gateway with sphinxes at Sherborne Castle of about 1770 (not executed) and Robert Adam's entrance screen for Syon House which included sphinxes in the design, built in 1773.",
