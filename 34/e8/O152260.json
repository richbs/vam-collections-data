In the centre is a gold and silver roundel edged with 8 three-petalled flowers in alternating shades of pink or mauve. This is set within an 8-pointed frame.  The four corner points have two curved leaves with green and pink details with a pink flower between them from which emerges a pair of gold and a pair of pink feathery leaves.  These reach out towards the  corner motif: one and 2 half ogival sections each containing a star-like flower with 2 triangular sections below, each with a pink flower with dark blue details above a solid gold metal quarter circle.  From the alternate points of the frame, mid-way along each side is an elegant arrangement of leaves forming an inverted tear-drop with a pair of feathery leaves.  Tendrils with pink leaves and gold leaves come from the point of the drop. \nThe border, pieced before being embroidered, is red satin.  In the middle of each side is a carnation fan from which a meandering stem travels bearing 2 gold blossoms and a blue carnation; there is an iris like flower in each corner.  A narrow band with a meander and leaves has been embroidered on the red satin either side of the main border design.  These are delineated by 2 black silk cords edged with metal thread and couched with metal thread to form a pattern of blocks.\nEmbroidery threads 2S silk: pink, light pink, dark blue, light blue, dark green, green, light green, very light grey and light mauve.\nMetal thread: silver-gilt strip close S-wound on a yellow silk core couched with pink silk; silver strip close S-wound on white silk couched with light grey silk.\nFacing: striped silk: white and dark blue stripes both containing the same 2 isolated floral sprigs.  In the blue stripe the colours are pink, light blue, green, orange.  In the white stripe the colours are the same plus dark brown; yellow dye on the white silk warp is associated with the sprigs. Was this resist-dyed or printed?  There are narrow lines of red and green between the stripes.\nBacking: red with a very fine yellow stripe.",
