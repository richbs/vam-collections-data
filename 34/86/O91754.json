This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread. According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass.  The bowls of silver chalices are usually gilded, to emphasize the precious nature of their contents and to protect the metal.\n\nThe form of this chalice follows late medieval types in the Gothic style, with the distinctive lobed foot common to chalices of the 15th and early 16th centuries. The decoration hammered into relief, however, includes elements of the Renaissance style inspired by classical, secular ornament. Where angels would have decorated a medieval chalice, here are cherub heads. The classical antique vase and candelabra motifs are simply decorative without symbolic meaning. The only reference to the chalice's religious function is the depiction on the foot of the crucified Christ.",
