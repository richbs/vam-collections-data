During the Gothic revival, and encouraged by the designer A.W.N Pugin, Herbert Minton developed techniques for producing inlaid tiles in the medieval style, which went into production at Minton and Co. from the 1830s. \n\nThe tiles were created by pressing malleable 'plastic' clay into a mould. The mould left impressions on the surface of the tile, which were then filled with coloured liquid clay before the tile was dried and fired at high temperature.\n\nHeraldic patterns were popular designs, and they were sometimes produced on commission. Minton tiles were also used extensively in the nineteenth-century renovation of medieval churches.\n\nThis three lion pattern was designed by Pugin for the fireplace of the prince's chamber, the Palace of Westminster. This example is from the House of Commons, laid in 1850.",
