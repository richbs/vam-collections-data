Around the neck is a necklace of metallic beads.  To the right hand is attached a strip of long red, white and green artificial flowers and leaves (probably paper).  To the left hand is attached a bunch of yellow and green artificial flowers (probably wood shavings).\nDoll is standing in an 'arbor' of decorated paper.  The back and sides are covered with cream paper with multi coloured paper flowers, snowflakes and circles glued to it.  The doll may be seated on a plain card bench in front of which is a rectangle of glass (sand) paper with pinked outer edges and inner edges lined with gold paper.  The surface is decorated with multi coloured heart, circle and star shapes of paper all glued on.  On each upper corner is attached egg shaped balls in black, pink and white stripes and circles.  Suspended from the back wall on each side of the rectangle on wires are multicoloured paper flowers and leaves.\nThe whole setting rests on a bracken covered platform edged wqith bunches of artificial flowers.  The front edge is covered with dark blue paper trimmed with a paper triangular pattern, stars and circles.\nEncased in a wooden box fronted by a glass panel surrounded by a polished wooden frame.
