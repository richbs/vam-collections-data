This was high in carbohydrates and low in fresh fruit and meat, and sometimes caused constipation, which was promptly treated with a laxative. Popular naturally occurring laxatives for children and adults were castor oil, prunes, senna and rhubarb. Chemical potions included brimstone (sulphur) mixed with treacle, and calomel, a compound of mercury and chloride.\n\nThis child\u2019s tub-shaped commode armchair is in a rustic style. The back has two pierced circular holes so that the chair can be easily hung up or carried.
