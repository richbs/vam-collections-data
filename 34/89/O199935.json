Illustrated p. 151, text p. 242.\nText reads: '...The artist who painted the pictures in the baptismal baths of most of the Pentecostal Protestant Churches is Pastor Snyman. The theme is based on the Jordan River where Jesus was baptised when He was on earth. Baptism takes place in the 'bath' in front of the painting. We baptise by total immersion, as John the Baptist baptised Jesus, and, of course, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The text, 'Maar ek, ek weet, my Verlosser leef', 'But I know my Saviour lives', was specially chosen for our church ... by the former pastor, church council, and members of the congregation. This text is to be found in Job 19:25, where Job professes that he has the assurance that come what may, his Saviour, Jesus Christ lives and will always be in control of all circumstances. The projector is used to project transparencies on which our songs and choruses are written. As the Pinkster Protestante Kerk our belief is only in the Three-in-One God ... and we believe that the Whole Bible, as given out in the 1933 translation, is the Word of God. We administer only two sacraments and these are baptism by immersion and Holy Communion...'\nTranslated from a letter by M. A. de Beer, pastor of this church, in response to my questions, 26 June 1994.",
