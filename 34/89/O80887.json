            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nA wine cooler or ice pail for a single bottle was a French refinement for more informal dining in smaller numbers. Introduced into England in the early 18th century, it was filled with ice to chill the wine before serving. By the early 19th century, these individual wine coolers were beginning to be left on the table as part of the dressing of very grand dinners.\n\nDesign\nThe form of the wine cooler is based upon that of the ancient Greek calyx-krater, which was a pottery vase used for holding and mixing wine and water. This has been adapted with the addition of lion's-head handles that turn outwards rather than inwards as on the original  Greek design. The broad band of  ornament uses alternating palmette (a fan-shaped motif resembling a palm leaf)  and lotus, which are  typical Neo-classical motifs.\n\nTrading\nThe Royal Goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, made this wine cooler in 1810. It would have been one of the most expensive silver items purchased for the dining room. (In 1804, for example, Viscount Lowther, later 2nd Earl  Lonsdale, had paid Rundells \u00a3125 1s 9d  for two wine coolers.) The royal arms and the coronation medals of William IV (ruled 1830-1837) and Queen Adelaide (1792-1849) were added to the wine cooler around 1830 to celebrate their coronation. These additions show that Rundells were updating a second-hand piece of silver, perhaps as a royal gift.",
