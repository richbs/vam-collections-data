Ludovico Berretta was the architect and designer of the fa\u00e7ade, but the sculptors of the ornaments are unknown. \n\nThe panel depicts an eagle with Adam and Eve on either side. Adam kneels to the left, displaying a skull. Eve sits on the right, holding an apple. The apple is a symbol of original sin, and man's fall. The skull is a symbol of death as mankind's punishment for original sin. The eagle represents Christ's resurrection and mankind's redemption through his death.\n\nThis cast was part of the collection of 487 fragments purchased in 1851 from the Government Schools of Design, and was one of 62 taken from the fa\u00e7ade of the Church of Santa Maria de' Miracoli in Brescia. These casts served as models of design for the schools' students.",

These casts served as models of design for the schools' students.\n\nThe first Government School of Design was established in London in 1837 at Somerset House.  From 1837 to 1851, eighteen more schools were founded in provincial cities such as Manchester and Birmingham.  The schools were set up by a government Committee on Arts and Manufactures 'for the purpose of affording Instruction to those engaged in the practice of ornamental Art, and the preparation of Designs for the various Manufactures of this country' (Wainwright 2002, p. 5).  The Committee immediately began acquiring a collection of plaster casts for the schools, so that their students could copy and sketch from the best examples of ancient and modern ornamental art.  After his substantial contribution to organising the 1851 Great Exhibition of modern British manufactures, Henry Cole was appointed the Head of the Schools of Design in 1852.  He expanded the school's collection to include not only casts, but also electrotypes, modern drawings, and decorative art for a new museum that could be visited by the public.  This museum, the progenitor of the Victoria and Albert Museum, first opened at Marlborough House in 1852.",
