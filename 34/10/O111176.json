The ivory handle formed of three putti playing is in the style of Francois Du Quesnoy (1597-1643), a Netherlandish sculptor who worked in Rome. His sculpture was enormously influential, especially in the Netherlands. \nKnives have been used since prehistoric times, but the history of knives, forks and spoons for eating in Europe probably commenced in the fourteenth century, and their use became accepted by the sixteenth century. Until the late seventeenth century it seems to have been common practice for people to carry their own cutlery, often in a leather case. Ebony, ivory, fish skin, tortoiseshell, amber, bone, horn and shell were all popular for decorating cutlery. Around 1730 ceramic handles were introduced to Europe from China. Although cutlers were required by their guilds to be able to make a complete knife, handles of carved ivory, silver, bronze and glass were usually imported or made by specialist craftsmen.",

On acquisition they were thought to be Italian, but the style of carving suggests that they could be Netherlandish. \nBought from J. Lowe, London, in 1911.\nFound through excavation, this knife blade has been badly damaged. It is possible that the combination of pure gold (from the gilding) and the base metal has increased the level of corrosion. The staining on the ivory is caused by the rusting of the tang (the part onto which the handle is fixed).",
