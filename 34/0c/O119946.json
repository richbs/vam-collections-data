Print sources for the panel have not yet been identified, but the two winged angel figures reaching over the central scene derive in style from stone relief carvings by Jean Goujon from the 1540s onwards, most famously for the Fontaine des Innocents in Paris, inaugurated in 1549 for the triumphal entry of Henri II.\n\nWe know that this walnut panel was the door to a cabinet because it retains evidence of two hinges. As walnut is prone to wood-worm damage, much early furniture has fallen apart leaving only elements (usually the more decorated parts) to survive. From the 19th century some of these fragments were incorporated into new pieces of furniture made in a 16th century style.",
