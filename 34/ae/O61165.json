The painting shows the Firebird in the Bakst-designed costume against the set designed by Alexander Golovine.  Bakst later redesigned the costumes for the principals, but the set and remaining costumes were in use until 1926, when the production was redesigned by Natalia Goncharova.  \nThe painting came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: The painting shows the original Firebird costume designed by Bakst against the Golovine-designed set.  This is a rare example of a painting of the Diaghilev Ballet which shows the dancer on stage in the setting and is an important record of how the ballet looked on stage.",
