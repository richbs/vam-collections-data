It was soon discovered that copper was easier and more pleasant to work and therefore only the very early work is in brass.  The men worked once a week in the evening from 7pm until 9.30 or 10, the older teaching the younger.  The design were almost all made by Mrs Waterhouse using garden plants and foliage for inspiration.  All the materials were provided by her and the workmen received payment for each piece as it was sold.\n\nThe classwork was exhibited at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition at the Royal Albert hall and sold through a shop in the village run by Mrs Wyatt in a house called \"Pargeters\".  As the work of  the class became known some special commisiions were executed - among them some ecclesiastical works such as font covers.  Some of the copper work was sold at Liberty's.  The class was disbanded in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War.",
