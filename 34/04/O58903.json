This example was subsequently altered so that it could be played like a 'cello. By the 1780s, the bass viol had become the preserve of musical eccentrics like Carl Friedrich Abel (1723\u201387) or amateurs like the painter Thomas Gainsborough (1727\u201388). \n\nThis one is signed by Paul Hiltz of Nuremberg, whose surviving instruments date from 1639 to 1656. Its body has a serpentine outline, a characteristic of viols made in Austria and Southern Germany during the 17th century.",
