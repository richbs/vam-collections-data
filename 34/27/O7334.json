They are painted in black/brown pigment with an interconnecting pattern of stylised oak leaves on long stems. This type of simple decoration is known as \u2018grisaille\u2019. Each quarry has a thin border painted with a silver compound that, once fired in the kiln, produces a yellow/orange colour that sinks into the clear glass. This technique is known as \u2018silver stain\u2019 and is where the term \u2018stained glass\u2019 comes from.\n\nThe interconnecting leaves and stems, together with the yellow borders that join the quarries in a lattice-like structure, show that the glazier conceived of the window as a unified whole. This type of construction shows much sophistication. It indicates that this window, which survives only in part, was planned for a specific location, probably in a church. \n\nLater in the medieval period, and especially after the Reformation in the 16th century, grisaille windows are often composed of quarries painted with single images that are not connected to one another. Such quarries were probably mass-produced and came from stocks in the glaziers\u2019 workshops.\n\nThis panel has borders composed of \u2018flashed\u2019 red glass with insertions of clear glass painted with black/brown pigment and yellow stain. Medieval glass that is coloured all the way through when it is in a liquid state is known as \u2018pot metal\u2019. However, red pot metal glass is very dense, and not much light can pass through it. A technique known as \u2018flashing\u2019 developed at an early date in the glass industry. It involved coating clear glass with thin layers of coloured glass. This was very popular for producing a translucent red.\n\nA great deal more light can pass through a window containing grisaille and flashed glass, which means that dark interiors can be illuminated much more efficiently.",
