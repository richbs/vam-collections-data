He worked in the Karraya suburb of Calcutta. From about the 1780s, British residents began to move out of the city centre to the pleasant new suburbs of Chowringhee and Garden Reach. It was here that local artists found plenty of work. Shaikh Muhammad Amir specialised in paintings of the houses and domestic staff of British suburbanites.",
