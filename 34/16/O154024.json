The design is very simply illustrated, and uses only three colours of ink, making it easier and cheaper to produce. This particular pantomime featured Charles Hawtrey, who had recurring roles in the classic British Carry On series of films, and Bryan Johnson, who had come second in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1960. Unlike early 20th century pantomime spectaculars, this production reflects the modern trend towards employing stars of television, film and pop music.",
