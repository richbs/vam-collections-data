            "public_access_description": "In 1982 when this poster was issued, Solidarity was an underground organization following the proclamation of Martial Law in Poland in 1981. It could not publish officially and had to rely on the underground production of printed materials. In addition, Solidarity was supported by a number of offices in foreign countries which took charge of designing, printing and distributing Solidarity materials outside of Poland. This particular poster was issued in France. It calls for financial support for the families of imprisoned Solidarity activists. Its strong imagery refers to the appearance of tanks on the streets of Polish towns when Martial Law was proclaimed. The message of the poster is that while Solidarity is persecuted and repressed by the communist authorities, it is reborn stronger and bigger.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
