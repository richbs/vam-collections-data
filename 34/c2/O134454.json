As well as this corset and measuring tape, the \u2018Objects of Beauty\u2019 series includes a hairpin, a comb, false eyelashes, curlers, jewellery, stockings and lace knickers. Each object is photographed on its own and printed as a calotype, a photographic process which was popular in the nineteenth century and which is characterised by subtle tonal differences. These formal qualities give the individual objects an iconic status and ironically, they themselves become beautiful in their still-life guises. Furthermore, the aged feel of the calotype print suggests that the tyranny of feminine beauty has existed for far too long.",
