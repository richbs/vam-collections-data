            "history_note": "The way in which the skirt of Poll's dress is looped up over her contrasting petticoat is interesting as a very late example of the style of dressing <i>a la polonaise</i>, which had its heyday between 1775 and 1790. By 1805, fashion-conscious women were more usually to be seen in 'round gowns' - dresses with closed fronts which were not open over a contrasting or matching petticoat, although it would take a while before this style filtered down to the masses. Poll's dress is not strictly a <i>robe a la polonaise </i>(which refers to a distinctively cut dress rather than solely the draped skirt) but represents a style that was fashionable in the late eighteenth century with the skirt worn hanging straight down. The depiction of the skirt being looped up here polonaise-style is interesting, and this styling, at such a late date, was probably for practical rather than fashionable reasons.\n\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam, May 2012",
