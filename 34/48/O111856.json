The first Iznik tiles were produced, and a bright red was added to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, tiles of high quality were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds. \n\nIn the most celebrated Iznik production, the sage green was replaced by a bright emerald colour, and the mauves and purples by red slip. Black was mostly used for outlines. An enormous range of designs was employed.",
