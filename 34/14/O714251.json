The following is the full text of the entry: MANOCCHI, GIUSEPPE (c.1731-82) 1042/1047 Drawings (6) of painted stucco work ceilings in the antique grotesque style, both ancient Roman and of the 16th century. Inscrived by the artist as follows: 1042: \u2018Sofitto Anticho. Io Giuseppe Manocchi Romano 1771\u2019:1046: \u2018Sofitto Anticho che si vede a Pola fuora di Napoli. Io Giuseppe Manocchi Romano 1771\u2019: 1044: \u2018Sofitto che si conserva a Caprarola\u2019; the others inscribed with scale only Nos. 1042, 1045 and 1046 in pen and ink and water-colour: Nos. 1041 [1047?] and 1044 in pen and ink and wash E.1407, 1432, 1435, 1436, 1439, and 1440-1914 PROVENANCE Richard Norris (d. 1792); bought 1914 The drawings are mounted in one of two albums (vol. 1) containing the book-plate of the architect Richard Norris. The albums are lettered on the back <i>Sketches taken in Italy</i> 1769. The other drawings in them are measured drawings and sketches of buildings, architectural ornament, sculpture etc by various unknown artists, with some by Norris himself. The four drawings ascribed to Manocchi that are not signed are attributed to him, because they are clearly by the same hand as the signed drawings.",
