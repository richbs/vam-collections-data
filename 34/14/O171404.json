            "public_access_description": "This is a print of a wall monument to William Pitt the Elder (1708-1778), the 1st Earl of Chatham. He was a British stateman who became War Minister and was the father of William Pitt the Younger, (1759-1806) who became Prime Minister.  The wall monument was made by the sculptor, John Bacon the Elder (1740-1799). It was erected in Westminster Abbey and is one of his best known works. The print is after a drawing by Thomas Stothard (1755-1834) of the wall monument and it was engraved by Walker and published on 1st May, 1784.\n\nBacon began his career as a modeller in a porcelain factory, going on to design for the ceramic and metalwork industries. His career as a sculptor, however, took off when the Archbishop of York commissioned a bust of George III. His other best known works are the monuments to Thomas Guy in Guy's Hospital and Dr. Johnson at St. Paul's Cathedral.",
