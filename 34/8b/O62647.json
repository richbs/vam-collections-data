The oval cut low neck is edged in yellow and is a smaller version of an oval thin panel in pale beige streaked with black, that hangs from the waist down the front of the skirt.  The neck is twined with yellow strips and they outline the skirt opening, ending at the sides in black ermine tails.  The hair is dressed in mauve sausage curls topped with a black bow over a drooping curl fringe.   Annotated with fabric notes and painted colour samples.  Pencil,   watercolour and wash. Costume design inscribed \"E. Schooling.  Ugly Sister Ball dress\" and fabric notes.  \nOn the reverse, a pencil sketch of a similar costume.",

The whole costume, with the drooping hair and unflattering colours indicates the downtrodden Sister, danced by Elisabeth Schooling.  \nTwo additional designs, for the Prince (S.204-2000) and Cinderella (S.203-2000) in the ballroom scene are in the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of ballet design from the 1930s for the significant company Ballet Rambert.
