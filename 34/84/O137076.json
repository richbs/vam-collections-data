The head is deeply textured and oxidised and has two features:  a bony structure that carries two eyes made of epoxy in which are embedded tiny beads of blue and gold and a large gilded mouth having a large protruding tongue.  The mouth is inset with bony lower canines and upper ivory teeth.  The head attaches to a two part, scratch-brushed body-handle with a large fluked tail and down curving stand.  The server is made up of thirteen separate parts, held by tiny 4-40 stainless, miniature machine bolts.  The tongue is secured with three 2-36 bolts.  Gold plating is 24 carat and is triple plate and scratch-brush burnished between each layer.  The teeth are bezel, tab set.  The whole server is demountable.",

            "public_access_description": "The exuberant monstrous fish handle revels in colour and texture. The head is deeply textured and oxidised beautifully offsetting the smooth reflective gilded mouth and protruding gilt tongue. The eye of blue epoxy is embedded with tiny beads of gold and the teeth are of ivory. The fine detail and intricacy of the menacing fish head contrasts the smooth, clean lines of the blade and fish tail. The blade is pierced with bubbles and lifts in fluted points as it joins the handle creating a wave crest that the fish rides upon. The tail end of the handle is scratch-brushed with a fluked tail and down-curving stand. This daring mix of materials combined in Schremmer's imaginative design has created an exciting, delightfully bizarre piece.",

Intricate workmanship and inventive imagination, given freedom, have produced a modern \"grotesque\" defined by Peacham in 1612 as \"an unnatural or unorderly compostion for delight's sake, of men, beast, birds, fishes, flowers\".  It combines elements of the Baroque and Arts and Crafts, as well as being undeniably contemporary.\n\nHistorical significance: The grotesque shape of the fish head of this server was inspired by a fossil found in a German slate quarry. Combining the 13 separate parts was a difficult task, it is held together with stainless steel miniature bolts. Many models and test pieces were needed to create this server. The final piece is at once functional, (the entire piece is demountable for cleaning) and a vibrant expression of the artist's imagination.",
