            "public_access_description": "George Sheringham (1884-1937) was a decorative painter, theatrical designer and book illustrator. He studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London (1899-1901) and then at the Sorbonne in Paris. He exhibited with the International Society from 1922 and received a Grand Prix at the Paris Salon in 1925 for mural and theatrical design. During his career Sheringham worked as a set and costume designer for a number of plays and operas, including new productions of Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s HMS Pinafore, Pirates of Penzance and Patience for the D\u2019Oyly Carte Opera Company\u2019s 1929 season. Other productions included Arne\u2019s Love in the Village, Sheridan\u2019s The Duenna, John Galsworthy\u2019s The Skin Game and the Stratford Memorial Theatre\u2019s opening production of Twelfth Night. Sheringham also illustrated several books including Edmond Rostand\u2019s La Princesse Lointaine and Max Beerbohm\u2019s The Happy Hypocrite, published in 1915. An author himself, he published Drawing in Pen and Pencil in 1922, followed by Design in the Theatre in 1927. Sheringham was a prolific fan, poster and mural artist with his murals including panels for the ballroom at Claridge\u2019s Hotel and the music room at 40 Devonshire House. Although primarily a designer, Sheringham produced occasional still-life and landscape compositions. An invalid from 1932, he continued to paint flowers until his death on 11 November 1937.\n\nThis work is a design for the stage setting of the light opera Midsummer Madness by Clifford Bax, with music composed by Armstrong Gibbs. It was first produced by Sir Nigel Playfair at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 3 July 1924. Upon release, The Musical Times called it \u201ccapital tuneful stuff that well deserves the success it has achieved\u201d. The design is typical example of Sheringham\u2019s work of the 1920s and was given to the museum by Sir Nigel\u2019s son, C.A.L. Playfair. Other works by George Sheringham in the V&A\u2019s collections include costume designs for productions of Sheridan\u2019s The Duenna (1924) and Dumas\u2019 The Lady of Camellias (1930) as well HMS Pinafore (1929). \n\nSources:\n\nThe Musical Times, Vol. 65, No. 980 (Oct. 1, 1924), p.912\n\nMary Chamot, Dennis Farr & Martin Butlin (eds.), The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, Vol. 2, (London: Oldbourne Press, 1964), p.618.",
