The cabinet is architecturally inspired and is typical of Kimbel & Cabus's 'modern Gothic' style of furniture, also known in America as 'Eastlake' after the English design pundit Charles Eastlake (1836-1906). \n\nThe incised linear decoration and geometric patterns can be found on almost every one of their cabinets, and the incised and coppered brass hinges are also very typical of their work. This cabinet features an inset painted and gilded panel of two cupids, but set-in tiles made by the Minton-Hollins company of England and marquetry panels were often used on such cabinets instead. Embellishments, such as tiles or painted panels, were frequently added to British furniture of the time but were rarely used on American pieces.",
