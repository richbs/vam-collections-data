It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nMorney Cash and The New Macs, also drawn by Cooke, provided a lot of the comic elements in Cinderella, Cash appearing as the page and The New Macs as the broker\u2019s men. Cash performed jokes, comical dances and songs including \u2018Who Killed Cock Robin?\u2019.\n\nBorn in Manchester in 1872, Morney Cash started as an engineer, making amateur appearances in a comedy duo. His first professional engagement at Blackpool was followed by engagements in small Manchester halls where he established a reputation as a pub comedian. After appearing in Liverpool he was booked for a tour of the south, billed as 'The Lancashire Lad', and became one of the most popular of the northern dialect comedians, singing songs including 'All of a Do-Da' and 'I Live in Trafalgar Square'. By 1903 he was high on the bill at the New Brighton Palace and soon after topped the bill at the Blackpool Hippodrome. He toured in America and South Africa. He died in 1938.",
