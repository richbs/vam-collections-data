The evening appears to have been organized by the local garrison - the majority of the participants are soldiers serving in the 66th Regiment. The programme details the full evening's entertainment which includes songs sung by Captain W.H. Brabazon Connor and the Band of H.M.'s 66th Regiment, as well as the two plays.  The programme itself has the added interest of being printed on coloured silk: most silks are either cream or white. Associated production: A Husband to Order. Playwright: J. Maddison Morton. Theatre Royal, Jersey, 9.8.1867. Performance category: Drama.",
