The movement for Civic Freedom was number 4 on the list of political parties taking part in the June 1990 election that followed the \u2018Velvet Revolution\u2019 \u2013 the first democratic election in Czechoslovakia since 1946.\n\nThe Movement for Civic Freedom (Hnut\u00ed za obcanskou svobodu) was founded by Czech and Slovak followers of Charter 77 as an independent citizens\u00b4 initiative on October 15, 1988 when they published the manifesto \u2018Democracy for Everyone\u2019 (Demokracie pro v\u0161echny). The main representatives were: Rudolf Battek, V\u00e1clav Benda, J\u00e1n Carnogursk\u00fd, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hrad\u00edlek, Jir\u00ed Kanturek, Ladislav Lis, Anna Marvanov\u00e1, Jaroslav \u0160abata, and Alexandr Vondra among others. Their demands were: a return to democratic tradition, political plurality, a new democratic constitution, a return to a fair legal system, protection of the environment, economic reforms without an oppressive communist bureaucracy as a means to economic prosperity, freedom of speech, religious freedom, liberty of the press and mass media, the abolition of censorship, free trade unions, the shortening of military service, respect for national minorities in Czechoslovakia, a democratic and equal relationship with the Soviet Union, overcoming Stalinist political residues and integration with democratic Europe.\n\nMari\u00e1n Vanek is awell known Slovak cartoonist, who published his political satirical cartoons during a short period between 1967 - 1968 as title page illustrations in the Slovak daily newspaper \u2018Smena\u2019 and in the magazine \u2018Kult\u00farny \u017eivot\u2019. He worked together with cartoonist Du\u0161an Junek. Their cartoons were banned in the process of \u2018normalisation\u2019 that followed the suppression of the \u2018Prague Spring\u2019 reforms in Czechoslovakia. \n\nIn this HOS election poster Mari\u00e1n Vanek makes a satirical joke on the old Leninist ideology, hidden as a genie (ghost) in a bottle of Russian vodka.\n \nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
