Filled with cold water such 'rinfrascatoi' [cooling vessels] kept the fruit fresh and cool. This glass example was made in Venice by the famous glass-blowers on the island of Murano. The decoration in gold leaf and painted enamels was applied after the bowl had been shaped and gradually cooled. After decorating, the bowl went back into the mouth of the furnace, where the enamels would melt and fuse with the glass surface. The enamels would fuse at such a high temperature, that the glass became melleable again and the object would be given its final shape at this stage too. It is possible to see from the dots below the rim of the bowl, that they have stretched during firing, where the glass has expanded beyond its original (pre-firing) shape. Once fired, the enamels cannot be rubbed off the surface.",
