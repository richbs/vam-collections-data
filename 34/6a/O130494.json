It was composed of a curved panel, the cap back, to which two long streamers were attached, called lappets. The whole ensemble was finished with a lace frill. The lappets might be pinned up on top of the head in pleats, but more usually were left to hang loose, fluttering with the slightest movement. \n\nThe curved shape of this cap back sets off the formal elegance of its design, mirrored to either side of a central line, as if looking through an archway to a garden. The shape and design of lace heads changed during the 1720s, '30s and '40s, corresponding to fashionable textile design. Here the central urn or fountain, the intricate leafy swags, the outsize flower blooms, all echo the popular patterns in dress silks woven in Lyon and London around 1730.\n\nThe cap back is made of high quality Brussels bobbin lace. Its narrow frilled border is a simpler bobbin lace, made in the Valenciennes style.",
