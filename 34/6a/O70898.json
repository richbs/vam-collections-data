His head is inclined to the left, his hands bound in front of the column with a cord (broken) held in the left hand of the torturer on the right. Only one of Christ's legs is shown on the carving. Each torturer wears a close-fitting cap, a doublet, long pointed shoes and a low-slung belt from which a sword hangs; they hold scourges above their heads, the figure on the left holding his scourge in both hands. The 14th-century date of the panel is evident from its carefully chamfered edges, the round faces of the figures and the simple design.\n\nThe upper parts of the figures are marked with deep scratches in 'X' formations which do not appear to be original to the carving. The right-hand bottom corner of the panel is missing; the left-hand bottom corner is damaged. The panel is cracked and greatly weathered, which is particularly evident on the faces of the three figues. The alabaster at the bottom of the panel shows some iron staining. No paint remains on the panel.\n\nThere are four holes in the back of the panel, three lead-filled to secure latten strips for attachment. There is a thick layer of mortar over the surviving lower corner extending in a narrow strip near the edge almost to the top of the panel.",

It is one of several in the collection which appear to come from the same workshop, including A.61-1926, The Resurrection.\n\nThe panel shows Christ, in full face in the centre of the panel standing behind a column, between two torturers. His head is inclined to the left and his hands andre bound in front of the column by a cord (broken) held in the hand of the torturer to the right. The upper part of the figures are marked with deep scratches in X formations which do not appear to be original to the carving.",
