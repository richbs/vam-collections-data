            "public_access_description": "Oliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRichard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos, with libretto by Hugo von Hofsmannsthal, was originally a one-act opera, written to follow performances of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s 1670 comic play Le Bourgeois gentilhomme and first staged in 1912. The difficulties of presenting such a lengthy evening\u2019s entertainment, which required both an acting company and an opera company, led Strauss to revise the work in 1916 so that it could be staged without the play. Glyndebourne Festival Opera presented the original 1912 opera preceded by a shortened version of Le Bourgeoise gentilhomme at the 1950 Edinburgh Festival, with sets and costumes by Oliver Messel. In 1953 the 1916 version was staged at Glyndebourne with new designs by Messel and these designs were used in revivals throughout the 1950s. In 1962 Glyndebourne restaged its Edinburgh Festival production with an acting company from the Old Vic and reverted to Messel\u2019s 1950 designs.\n\nThe opera concerns a wealthy businessman who hosts an entertainment consisting of a serious opera based on the Greek myth of Ariadne and Bacchus, combined with a comic harlequinade.",

In 1916 Strauss revised the work so that it could be staged without Moli\u00e8re\u2019s drama.\n\nGlyndebourne Festival Opera presented Strauss\u2019s original opera with a shortened version of <i>Le Bourgeoise gentilhomme</i> at the 1950 Edinburgh Festival. Oliver Messel designed the settings and costumes. In 1953 the 1916 version of <i>Ariadne auf Naxos</i> was given at Glyndebourne with new designs by Messel, and these designs were used in revivals throughout the 1950s. In 1962 Glyndebourne restaged its Edinburgh Festival production with an acting company from the Old Vic and reverted to Messel\u2019s 1950 designs.\n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His Glyndebourne designs are regarded as some of his best work.",
