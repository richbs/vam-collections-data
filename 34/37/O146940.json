They were widely worn between 1800 and 1850, after which time they gradually fell out of fashion. They were not made to stand up to much wear, with their delicate fabric and thin leather soles. Shoes such as this would usually have been reserved for indoor wear, evening dress or special occasions. This cream silk satin pair has survived in pristine condition, and appears to have been barely worn, if at all. They are associated with the 1854 marriage of Elizabeth Wroughton Richards to the Reverend Andrew Nug\u00e9e. The bride's wedding wreath also survives (see T.6-2008).\n\nThese shoes were made in Paris by a shoemaker called Chapelle. They would have been imported for sale in shops across Europe. This style of shoe, without left or right foot shaping, is called 'straights'.  To assist the wearer, there are two small paper labels inside reading 'Gauche' (French for left) and 'Droite' (right).",

Edward Tew Richards, Rector of Farlington (the next door parish to Wymering). The Richards were Rectors from 1782 to 1925. Following her husband's death, she went on to marry a Dr. Field in 1867, and died 10 years later.\n\nAndrew Nug\u00e9e (b.31/10/1813 - d.25/12/1858) was the 2nd son of Francis James Nug\u00e9e who came from a family of Huguenot tailors who emigrated from Bordeaux to Cork between 1748-1752. They made a name for themselves with \"Nugee's waistcoats\" in the early 19th century. He was at Brasenose College, and became a curate in Lambeth prior to becoming Vicar of Wymering in 1851. The living was purchased by his father in the 1840s with a view to presenting his son as Vicar when the next vacancy should occur.",
