The date, on the clear evidence of the hair (or wig), is c. 1685, when this short, full and rounded form became fashionable. (1) \n\nIn terms of style and technique, the miniature fulfils all criteria but one for Richard Gibson, and is close to Cat. No. III both in style and date. The use of a tablebook leaf support for the vellum is the abnormality, but it does crop up occasionally in the post-Restoration work, as on Cat. Nos 103 [P.23-1954] and 110 [P.5-1942]. \n\n1 Avril Hart, personal communication, 1993.\u201d",
