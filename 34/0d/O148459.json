His work later became much more figurative. This drawing, a study for a print, relates quite closely to pieces in wood he was making in the early 1970s which took the form of crates and similar constructions. In some of these pieces Williams seems to be working with a cross-over from two to three dimensions, using the idea of a shadow or reflection as a solid part of the sculpture which at the same time remains flat. In this drawing he plays on ideas around real and reflected space and irresolutions regarding the dimensions of mirror images.",
