Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nIn this brooch shaped like a flaming torch, Linda Threadgill has used photo-etching to transfer intricate Gothic architectural detailing onto the surface of the metal. These fine etched patterns, which she has referred to as 'fictions of ornament', are distinctive of her work.\n\nLinda Threadgill has had an influential teaching career in the United States. She is currently Emeritus Professor of Art at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater where for twenty-five years she led the Metalwork course.",
