They formed a frieze that was particularly suitable for embroidery with figure subjects, often featuring a narrative to provide interest and entertainment. Sets of bed hangings also created a draught-free and private sleeping compartment. \n\nThe style and workmanship of this valance suggests that it was made in a professional workshop either in France itself or under strong French influence. \n\nThe setting is an ornamental garden with a mountainous skyline, a popular type of background for such scenes. and most of the figures wear rich contemporary court fashions. The main subject is a pair of seated lovers. They are attended by two women, one holding a mirror and possibly intended to represent Prudence, the other holding a small dog, possibly intended to represent Fidelity. One woman reads a partially legible French inscription, and a small black boy holds up a music score for the musicians on the right of the scene.",
