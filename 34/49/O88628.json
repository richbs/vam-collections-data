Poynter (1836-1919)\nWood painted with gilding and metal leaf\nCirc.216,217 & 218-1961\nCommissioned by H.G. Yatman, an early patron of Burges, who gave him the chance to create his first pieces of painted furniture.  The form of the larger cabinet was inspired by the celebrated mediaeval painted cabinet then in Noyon Cathedral.  The technique used upon the roof is to cover the wood with a metal leaf, either tin or zinc and to paint transparently over it.  This is a mediaeval technique which Burges gleaned from the manuscript of the eleventh century monk Theophilus.  The painted decoration depicts Dante and Caxton and other subjects which relate to writing and printing.  The inside of the doors are painted with portraits of Burges and Poynter.  The larger cabinet was borrowed back from Yatman by Burges and shown in the London International Exhibition of 1862.  The two smaller display cabinets were designed to fit into alcoves in a room in Yatman's house."

Yatman. These, together with a third, larger, cabinet also in the V&A collection (Museum number Circ.217-1961), demonstrate the highly individual Gothic Revival style that Burges developed. He based his designs for the cabinets on the medieval cupboards \u2013 architectural in form \u2013 that he had seen in the cathedrals of northern France. The top of this cabinet suggests a sloping roof with battlements. The interior is also painted and gilded; the ceiling has stars against a blue background, above painted arcading.\n\nBurges was one of the most distinguished British architects of the 19th century. He also designed furniture, metalwork and interior decoration, and drew inspiration from the construction and decoration of surviving medieval furniture. The Reverend John A. Yatman, H. G. Yatman\u2019s brother, also had a taste for Gothic Revival furniture, and employed Burges to design his house at Winscombe Hill near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.\n\nOn loan to National Trust Knightshayes Court.",
