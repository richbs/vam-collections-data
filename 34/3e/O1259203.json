The engraving, printed on paper, has been painted and varnished, and cut out around the shape of the figure. The figure was originally glued onto front of the net stocking.\n[Booklet] Two sheets of rough paper, folded with one staple at centre. The front, third, sixth and back pages are printed in green and red, the other pages with only black ink. The picture on the front shows three chidren with balloons and a doll. Each page features an illustration of children playing with a four-line verse underneath. The back cover shows five children playing 'oranges and lemons'. The booklet was folded twice horizontally and placed into the stocking.\n[Stocking] Two pieces of white open net, cut into the shape of a stocking and sewn together. Dark green wool has been used decoratively along most of the seams. \n[Picture puzzle] Six pieces of paper, printed with sections of a man and woman's faces. The cards are divided into sections so the player can assemble a female, male, or mixture of pieces.\n[Croquet set] Two small mallets, one slightly larger, with two balls and the lid of a box. The box features an illustration of a well-dressed group playing croquet on a lawn, in front of a large house.",

            "public_access_description": "This is one of a large group of childhood objects donated by Eileen Brock. Eileen was born in 1915 to a middle-class family living in North London. Her mother, Amy Piercy, was the youngest of a close family of six sisters so Eileen's early life was busy with visits and entertainments with aunts and cousins. In 1921, when Eileen was six, her father William died in Basra, Iraq, where he was serving in the army.\nEileen and Amy were very close and shared a love of music, dancing and theatre. Eileen also inherited her mother's enthusiasm for collecting; they both held on to birthday and christmas cards, presents, school books, theatrical ephmera and clothing. These ordinary but personally significant objects span the decades when education, cinema, fashion and women's lives were transformed in Britain. \nThe Museum of Childhood now holds this wonderul collection which offers rich insight into the everyday life of a young girl growing up after the First World War.",
