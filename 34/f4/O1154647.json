As the text below this miniature states it was originally painted by Louise Lane and completed a few months before his decease. This artist was reknowned for working the real hair of her sitters in to their portraits and it was for this reason that Garrick sent a sample of his hair to the artist. An action which Garrick refers to in a note sent to the artist, a fascimile of which is also reproduced on the print.\nThe hair was never worked in to this image however and was instead passed on to the artist's brother and on his death became a family heirloom.\nJohn Bannister, declaring himself to be Garrick's last pupil, has added a handwritten addition to the print in which he confirms the portrait is 'very like Garrick'.",
