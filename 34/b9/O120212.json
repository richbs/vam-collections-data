The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria herself, who was crowned in 1837. Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were issued after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been made after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of noted celebrities and actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThis represents the Scottish hero and patriot Sir William Wallace (1272-1305) who won the great battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297 but was defeated by Edward I at Falkirk.  Wallace was arrested by the English in 1305, tried at Westminster Hall and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered.  The story of Wallace was dramatised several times during the 19th century, including two different productions based on his exploits at Covent Garden and at Astley's Circus in 1820.  There is no evidence however of this figurine being based on any particular actor or performance.",
