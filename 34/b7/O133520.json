His wife designed textiles and their company became incorporated in 1942 (Ascher Ltd). Ascher developed a range of different fabrics for use at the top end of the market. Like other manufacturers, he used samples such as this one as a method of showing prospective clients his wares, and as a record of his output.\n\nThis particular design is typical of those made smart summer dresses in the 1950s. Christian Dior made this fabric into a dressy afternoon dress and coat (model no. 94) for his Spring/Summer collection of 1953. Its success was recorded by Alison Settle in an article in The Observer on February 8th 1953 in which she noted 'The French felt they could use no birds as they brought ill-luck but now by their sales, they realise that those painted ones fly with fortune in their beaks'.",

Its success was recorded by Alison Settle in an article in <i>The Observer</i> on February 8th 1953.\n\nAttribution note: Ascher initially targeted haute couture designers, but his textiles were not made purely for their use.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This screen printed silk was called 'Blue Bird' and was adapted from a Chinese watercolour. It was bought and used by Christian Dior for a formal afternoon dress and coat in Spring/Summer 1953 (in the collection this was model number 94). It received extensive press coverage. Alison Settle, the fashion journalist, for example, wrote in the <i>Observer</i> (February 8 1953): 'And among the realistic roses and outsized tulips on silks the London-designed Ascher silk prints of orchard boughs and singing birds are used by Dior, Schiaparelli and many other leading designers. The French felt they could use no birds as they brought ill-luck but now by their sales, they realise that those painted ones fly with fortune in their beaks.' (cited in Mendes on p. 164).",
