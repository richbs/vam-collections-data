The rug was made for a flat in Wells Coates's modernist Embassy Court apartments in Brighton. It is also similar to the carpet that Dorn designed for Syrie Maugham's famous 'all-white living room'.\n\nMarion Dorn came to England from San Francisco in the early 1920s. By the mid 1930s she was acclaimed as a leading freelance textile designer. She carried out commissions for the London hotels Claridge's and the Savoy, and for the ships Orion and the Queen Mary. In 1934 Dorn established her own firm in Bond Street. Her career was less successful after she returned to America in 1940.\n\nThe Wilton Royal Carpet Factory was established in the early 18th century. In the 19th century it worked under contract for Morris and Company. During the 1930s the firm commissioned designs for carpets and rugs from a number of leading artists.",
