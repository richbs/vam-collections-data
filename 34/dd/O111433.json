Carmen opened in February 1940, one of several operas that were performed in repertory at Sadler's Wells during 1939 and 1940. It was a struggle to continue productions during wartime; staff all accepted salary cuts as high as 50%, and to celebrate the achievement of mounting opera there during wartime, a 'jubilee performance' celebrating the 50th performance of opera since the war began took place at Sadler's Wells on 31st January 1940. \n\nMorris Kestelman (1905-1998) is best known as a painter, but made a significant contribution as a stage designer during the 1940s when he also designed Tabbaro and Gianni Schicchi for Sadler's Wells, and Richard III, The Alchemist and Doctor Faustus for the Old Vic.",
