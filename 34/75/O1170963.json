The doll does not have any kind of company mark on the head which was fairly usual of these poupees, but she is thought to be made by Jumeau.\n\nJumeau began manufacturing bisque dolls in the 1840s, firstly in Paris and then in Montreuil-sous-Bois just outside Paris and reached the height of their popularity around the 1880s. Their dolls are commonly thought to be some of the finest bisque dolls of the 19th century because of a high level of craftsmanship and a level of detail given to dressing the dolls in beautiful clothing and accessories. She has been dressed in a beautiful pale blue and beige silk corseted top and full length skirt with highly detailed turquoise drop earrings, a floral garland and a muff with its own box. \n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Jumeau faced increased competition from a wealth of more affordable manufactured dolls, particularly in Germany, but Jumeau dolls, particularly early examples are still highly sought after by collectors.\n\nThe company later followed on from their popular adult fashion dolls by producing the hugely popular Jumeau Bebes from 1877. These dolls were made in the image of children but still continued to have fashionable costumes and accessories.",
