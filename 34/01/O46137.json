These alcoves, the supper boxes, extended along the north side of the Grove, the east and the south, from which a further short row ran southward.

New-river-head, at Islington with a family going awalking, a cow milking, and the horns archly fixed over the husband's head'. Nichols recorded that Hayman copied Hogarth's <i>Four Times a Day</i> for Vauxhall; <i>Evening</i> and <i>Night</i> were still there when <u>The Genuine Works</u> was published in 1808. A copy of <i>Evening</i> was at the Lowther Castle sale, April 29, 1947, lot 1855, 54 x 50 in. The copy is a coarse one, much simplified. If, as is probable, it is the Vauxhall picture, the vertical measurement was approximately that of the decorations in the other boxes; the series would thus have retained some uniformity in spite of the upright shape of the <i>Times of Day</i>. No picture of these dimensions, nor indeed of this shape, figured in the Vauxhall sales, if the printed measurements are to be trusted, and it would not be easy to identify <i>Evening</i> with any of the subjects whose disposal is recorded.\"",

They each formed the back of  one 'arbour' or supper box. The arbours were ornate wooden shelters formed of two side walls and a roof,  framing picturesque views through the Gardens. At a certain moment in the evening's entertainment, the paintings were 'let fall' [by an as yet unexplained mechanism] to enclose the diners at the back. The front was left permanently open for the fashionable occupants to view and be viewed.  \n\nLike many of the surviving paintings, this one has been cut down and retouched at various times. The original dimensions were about 54 x 95 inches. It is painted very thinly in the manner of scene painting. <u>Evening</u> is a version of Hogarth's 1736 painting of the same title, and Hayman's studio also did versions of the other three paintings in Hogarth's series of <u>The Times of the Day</u>.  The alternative popular title of Hayman's picture,  <u>New River, at Islington With a Family Going Awalking, a Cow Milking, and the Horns Archly Fixed Over the Husband's Head</u>, is taken from a list in <i>The Ambulator; or the Stranger's Companion in a Tour Round London...</i>, London (Bew)  p.180 ff., published in 1774.\n\nHogarth's satires on his fellow citizens of London were very popular and his prints were frequently copied or pirated. The New River Head (a circular reservoir) and Sadler's Wells (next door) were favourite places of resort for the City dwellers, as they were then situated in the fields at the northern edge of the built-up area. There were many farms there supplying milk (hence the presence of the cow) and pasture for the graziers who sold cattle at Smithfield nearby.",
