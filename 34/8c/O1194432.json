The daughters lived into their nineties, but Pakenham died in 1944.\n\nThe poems in this book are credited to Oona, Kathleen and Leslie McCorkell. The poems included in the book are entitled 'Mermaids', 'Tales of the Round Table', 'Memories of a Happy Holiday', 'Waiting at the Mayor's Parlour', 'An Unsucessful Luncheon', 'A Summer Evening', 'The Sea', 'What is it?'
