Made up of three large and two small panels bordered and joined together by strips of brocade of dark blue silk and gold thread with a pattern of dragon roundels and symbols, bound with black silk. Backed by dark-blue linen.\n\nThe top panel depicts bell- shaped flowers growing from rocks, with two bees above, against a buff- coloured background. There is an inscription written in red at the right-hand-side. The small panel below has clouds on a red background. \n\nThe central panel depicts a general with two soldiers riding by a lake-side. One of the soldiers is pointing to an island on which tents and posts may be seen. This panel has an orange-red background. The small panel below has part of a pine tree on a red ground. \n\nThe bottom panel shows a white vase containing a branch from a peach-tree, with a stag lying beside it trying to catch a bat. This panel has a blue background.",
