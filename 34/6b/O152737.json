It was intended as an overview of current video activity, but was very varied in its remit, including work that had been created using computers and synthesizers.  Cranford Academy of Art also hosted a weekend symposium on the subject of the 'Computer in the Arts', which examined the impact of computer technology on literature, music and the visual arts.\n\nThis poster was designed by Michael McCoy, who, with his wife Katherine McCoy, was co-chairman of the design department at Cranbrook Academy of Art.  They rose to prominence in the design world for the experimental attitude they encouraged towards design work, and the Academy went on to produce many major designers.",
