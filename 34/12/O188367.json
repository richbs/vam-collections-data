In order to prevent the floor cloths from blowing in the wind, heavy weights were placed at each of the four corners. These weights, known as &lt;i&gt;Mir-i-Farsh&lt;/i&gt;( slaves of the floor) were made of various materials, stone, metal and glass, usually in sets of four, and were common from the early 17th century. Ceramic examples are rare, and this Iranian model was perhaps made for export to the Mughal courts or for local use, part of the indigenous fashion for the Mughal court style adopted in Iran under Shah Abbas.",
