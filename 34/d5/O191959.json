This print has been laid onto cotton or linen which has then been nailed to a strainer (a rigid wooden rectangle without corner wedges). Strainers were used before and after the invention of stretchers, with corner wedges to allow adjustments in size, in the period 1751-72. The treatment this print has received shows that it was used as a decorative object rather than being kept in a portfolio. An intaglio print of this painting by Samuel Cousins was published by F.G. Moon, Her Majesty's Publisher in Ordinary on 20th March 1850. A proof impression presented by the engraver is in the British Museum, Department of Prints and Drawings, 1872-1-13-1271.",
