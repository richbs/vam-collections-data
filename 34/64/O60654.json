He is depicted as a boy, standing in the thrice-bent or tribhanga pose in the act of singing, the pointed index finger of the right hand serving to articulate the hymn.  He is naked but for a belt garland (channavira-type harness), a broad necklace,bracelets, and padasaras on the feet.  The hair lies close to the crown and is neatly dressed in delicate curls.  The earlobes are extended but without ornaments.  The figure stands on a circular lotus pedestal with holes for processional carrying.\nSambandar makes his characteristic gesture of the raised index finger with which, as an infant, he first pointed to Shiva and Parvati.   The veneration of saints  had become a feature of popular Hindu worship in South India by the Chola period (850-1279), when this image was cast.  Sculptures of the saints were regularly installed for veneration alongside those of the divinities and retain this place of honor today.",

It stands on a circular lotus pedestal with holes that allowed it to be secured during processional use.\n \nSambandar was born at Sirkali, near Chidambaram, in the late 7th century. As a child he devoted himself to the worship of his lord Shiva. Here he is depicted as a child, standing in a relaxed pose singing hymns in praise of Shiva. Characteristically, the index finger of his raised hand is pointing heavenward , a gesture of devotion he first made as an infant. \n\nHe is naked but for a waist belt (\u2018channavira\u2019), a broad necklace, bracelets and anklets (\u2018padasaras\u2019) on his feet. His hair lies close to the crown and is neatly dressed in delicate curls. His earlobes are extended but without ornaments.\n \nThe veneration of saints had become a feature of popular Hindu worship in South India in the Pallava (about 300 - 888 AD) and Chola  (about 850-1267 AD) periods. Sculptures of the saints were installed for veneration and regularly accompanied those of the divinities in temple processions. They retain this place of honour to this day. \n\nThis sculpture was reportedly excavated in Tirunelveli (Tinnevelly) District. It entered the collection of Lord Ampthill, Governor of Madras (Chennai) from 1900 to 1906.",
