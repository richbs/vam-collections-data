Her torso is bare. She wears a beaded harness (channavira), breastband (kucha-bandha), keyura armlets, elbow barcelets with projecting ornaments, patra-kundala ear pendants, anklets, and  padasaras on the feet. A marriage symbol (tali) is worn above the necklaces. Her position is to the right of the god either as Lakshmi to Vishnu or as Valli to Subrahmanya. Her head is crowned by a coronet (karanda-makuta). The raised left hand holds a lotus-bud in kataka mudra, whilst the right arm hangs at her side \"in the manner of a cow's tail\" or lola hasta. The figure is fixed to a circular lotus pedestal, which is cast in one piece with a rectangular base, the latter with upright prongs for the support of an arched-surround or torana (now missing) and projecting rings for processional carrying.",

When displayed in a shrine, these images would be grouped. Sri Devi would be on Vishnu\u2019s right and Bhu Devi on his left. When taken out for processional use, however, each would travel alone in a dedicated palanquin or temple car, thus asserting their independent identities.\n\nHere the goddess stands in the slightly flexed \u2018abhanga\u2019 pose, with her left hand raised in \u2018kataka-mudra\u2019 as if to hold a lotus. Her breastband distinguishes her from her  Bhu Devi, who is depicted bare-breasted. She is adorned with jewellery, notably a marriage ornament (\u2018tali\u2019) worn above the necklaces, and a conical crown (\u2018karanda-makuta\u2019).\n\nThe figure stands on a circular lotus pedestal, cast in one piece with a rectangular base. The base has upright tenons to support an arched-surround (\u2018prabha\u2019, now missing) and projecting rings for securing with cord during processional use. \n\nThe patination of the bronze confirms that this is an excavated icon. It formed part of a cache of bronze images discovered at Coimbatore and presented to Lord Curzon of Kedleston during his term as Viceroy of India, between 1898 and 1905.",

Sri  Devi\nCopper Alloy; 54 cm high\nIndia, South, from Coimbatore, 11th century CE\nVictoria and Albert Museum IM.149-1927, bequeathed by Lord Curzon of Kedleston\n\n2: 25. Bhu Devi\nCopper alloy; 50.5 cm high\nIndia, South, from Coimbatore, 11th century\nVictoria and Albert Museum IM.137-1927, bequeathed by Lord Curzon of Kedleston\n\n\nThese standing figures of Sri Devi and Bhu Devi were both designed to accompany an image of ViSnu. When displayed in a shrine, such figures were usually arranged with Sri Devi on ViSnu\u2019s right and Bhu Devi on his left, although curiously Bhu Devi\u2019s posture in this example is in the manner commonly used for a goddess standing on his right, so it is possible she originates from a slightly different iconic grouping. The images would also have been used as utsava-murtis, festival images taken out in procession from the shrine, and the projecting hoops on each base would then have been used to secure the figures to a temple chariot or a palanquin.  The two upright prongs on the base on which each goddess stands would have been used to support an arched surround or prabha.\nBoth Sri Devi and Bhu Devi stand in a flexed pose, showing the idealised female form. The goddesses stand with their left hands raised and holding a lotus, in the kataka mudra. They are adorned with jewellery and the small ornament on a chain above their necklaces is a thali, which is given to women in South India on marriage. The goddesses also wear conical crowns, the karandamukuTa, commonly seen on consort images. \nThe two goddesses are, however, distinguishable by the difference in size. Sri Devi is depicted slightly taller than Bhu Devi, though with a more slender build. Sri Devi also wears a breast band, whilst Bhu Devi is shown bare breasted, a common feature on images of the goddess. \nWhilst the two goddesses appear very similar they have differing, although complementary, roles. Bhu Devi is often connected with the Vedic goddess Prithivi, frequently mentioned in Vedic hymns as a stable and fertile presence, and seen as the embodiment of the earth. Rarely worshipped in her own right, Bhu Devi is normally shown either, as in this example, alongside Vishnu and his other consorts, or as the earth goddess rescued by ViSnu\u2019s boar incarnation, Varaha. Most sculptures of Varaha have a small female figure, either being held or holding on to his tusk, as the god rises out of the waters (see cat no. 2: 12). \nSri Devi is strongly connected to Vishnu\u2019s other consort LakSmi. Sri Devi is, like LakSmi, believed to bring prosperity and good luck and is widely worshipped across India. Sri Devi is also considered to act as a mediator, listening to the prayers of devotees and passing them on to the distant and transcendent Vishnu.\nThe two goddesses bring together those qualities needed to aid ViSnu\u2019s role as a stabiliser and maintainer of the universe: fertility, prosperity and good luck. \nThese figures were created during the CoLa dynasty, which ruled much of South India during the 9th - 13th centuries CE. Having been buried at some point, perhaps in a time of danger, and later excavated, they were among a hoard of bronzes found at Coimbatore and presented to Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India from 1898 to 1905.\n\nCam Sharp Jones and Nick Barnard",
