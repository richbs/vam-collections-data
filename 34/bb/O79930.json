The legs were fixed to the top, rather than dismantled and removed when not in use. Such a table would usually have been placed on a dais at the end of the hall, for the master of the house and his more important guests. An alternative location was in the chamber, a highly important room where the master or mistress not only slept but also received guests for dinner.\n\nTime\nThis table dates from about 1540 or earlier. The brackets and the octagonal balusters with their sharp edges are in the Gothic style, with no classical motifs.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe table is made of oak and joined with pegs. The slats of wood are set at right angles to each other, which is a sign of early joinery; later examples usually had mitred (diagonally cut) joints.",

Possibly it is one of the earliest framed-up tables to have been made in that century. In design it is not wholly domestic, but reflects the ecclesiastical influence noticeable in most English woodwork prior to the Reformation; in fact, the early character of the legs, reminiscent as they are of timber buttresses which one sees on screens and pew ends, and the shaped ogee arcading below the frieze at either end, are at least mildly ecclesiastical, and it would not be rash to assume that this table was made by some artisan (possibly a lay-brother) connected with the production of church woodwork. In its construction some interesting points occur. The top is carried on plain timbers tenoned and pinned into the legs at each angle, as well as into the central leg, which on the wall side is straight. (In later tables the carved frieze cut on one rail passed ove the top of the central leg.) The top oversails the ends as in the case of the early side-tables of the same period, and in height the table exceeds by a few inches what was usual for similar tables later in the century of its birth. Throughout, the wood used is pit-sawn English oak, quartered and planed.\"",
