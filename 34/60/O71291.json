The mitred saint, wearing a gown and cloak fastened by a brooch, rides on horseback in the lower right-hand corner of the panel. He holds in his left hand a decorated rein, carved in a similar pattern to the crupper under the horse's tail and across its haunches. His right hand is raised in blessing. A scroll curves down from his right hand. In front of him, on the left-hand side of the panel, is an upturned tree, jagged roots at the top of the panel, with demons' heads among the foliage. A figure wearing a flat cap and a coat, with a sword strapped at his right side, rides on a horse beside the saint. Five similar riders are grouped across the back of the panel, the two left-hand figures raising their right hands. Three of the horses they are riding are visible.\n\nThe top right-hand corner of the panel is missing, and there is a small chip from the top left-hand corner. The saint's right hand is damaged and there is a small hole right through the panel just above it. The top of the scroll is missing. The whole of the bottom of the panel is a restoration in plaster. Traces of colour remain. There is black on the faces of the demons and red on their mouths. The saint's horse and two of the horses behind him have traces of brown, the two remaining horses being black with the reins picked out in red. There is some gilding at the top background of the panel and on the saint's mitre. The inscription on the scroll is missing. The back of the panel is marked 'V' and 'IV.' There are three lead-plugged holes.",

            "public_access_description": "Saints are the heroes and heroines of Christian faith. In the 14th and 15th centuries, they were a popular subject for alabaster carvings. Religious themes penetrated private life, so devotional images of saints were sculpted not only for church interiors, but also for individuals to contemplate within the privacy of their homes. The subject of this panel has not been clearly identified, but it may show the story of St Boniface (died 754), a Devon-born monk who became a German archbishop. He cut down a sacred tree worshipped by pagans. On the left, demons cluster about an upturned tree, enraged but powerless.\n\nThe mitred saint, wearing a gown and cloak fastened by a brooch, rides on horseback in the lower right-hand corner of the panel. He holds in his left hand a decorated rein, carved in a similar pattern to the crupper under the horse's tail and across its haunches. His right hand is raised in blessing. A scroll curves down from his right hand. In front of him, on the left-hand side of the panel, is an upturned tree, jagged roots at the top of the panel, with demons' heads among the foliage. A figure wearing a flat cap and a coat, with a sword strapped at his right side, rides on a horse beside the saint. Five similar riders are grouped across the back of the panel, the two left-hand figures raising their right hands. Three of the horses they are riding are visible.\n\nThe top right-hand corner of the panel is missing, and there is a small chip from the top left-hand corner. The saint's right hand is damaged and there is a small hole right through the panel just above it. The top of the scroll is missing. The whole of the bottom of the panel is a restoration in plaster. Traces of colour remain. There is black on the faces of the demons and red on their mouths. The saint's horse and two of the horses behind him have traces of brown, the two remaining horses being black with the reins picked out in red. There is some gilding at the top background of the panel and on the saint's mitre. The inscription on the scroll is missing. The back of the panel is marked 'V' and 'IV.' There are three lead-plugged holes.\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
