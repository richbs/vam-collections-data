The mount could have been attached in different places on a piece of furniture, such as a cabinet or chest.\n\nPeople\nThe firm of Cope & Timmins was formed by the amalgamation of two earlier firms, Cope & Collinson and Clarke & Timmins, in 1800. Both firms were brass-founders, meaning that they specialised in brass products, and had factories in Birmingham, the renowned centre of brass manufacturing, as well as premises in London. Brass-founders produced a wide range of goods, including castors, hinges, handles, lock plates and curtain fittings, as well as decorative furniture mounts.\n\nTime\nThe enormous popularity of historic revivals in the period 1800-1840 resulted in a corresponding demand for a range of designs for decorative brass mounts. Manufacturers borrowed freely from one other, and many of the same patterns remained popular, being reproduced over many years. Wooden moulds, like this example, could be used as a record of a particular design.",
