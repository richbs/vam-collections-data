He was often billed as \u2018The Immobile One\u2019 because of his trick  of standing still on stage with a lugubrious expression while singing comic songs. Later he  toured his own revues and was popular in pantomime. \n\nMayo went on to tour with his own revues, and appear in variety and pantomime  a review of his act heading the variety bill at the Theatre Royal Aldershot in June  1931 the reviewer called him: 'The inimitable Sam Mayo, one of England's best- known comedians and humorists' [sic] adding: 'Part of Sam's charm is his pained  expression while he sings the most funny songs, playing his own  accompaniments on a grand piano.'",
