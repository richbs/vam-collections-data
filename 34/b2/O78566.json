It would have been used to fix the foundation loop of the net firmly over the hook, or as here, the knob at one end. Such clamps were made for use in the home to produce small items such as caps and purses from netting.\n\nOwnership & Use\nUntil the mid-19th century, sewing with the aid of a clamp was a common practice in Britain. Sheets and household linens were hemmed in the home, and a clamp could increase the speed and efficiency of the work. Sewing or netting clamps were often given as presents, and sometimes as love tokens. By the end of the 18th century  they existed in considerable numbers.\n\nPlace of Manufacture\nA steel work holder or clamp could have been made in any one of the main metalwork production areas of  London, Birmingham or Sheffield, but this example has been attributed to Woodstock, Oxfordshire, on the basis of the hollow faceting and the design of the pierced work on the object's handle.",
