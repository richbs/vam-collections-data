She was fortunate enough to share the physique of Fath\u2019s models and was given some dresses originally shown at the collections.  One such was this day-dress in shades of grey, which she wore to the unveiling of a statue in honour of her father, Field Marshal Earl Haig, in Montreuil-sur-Mer in 1950.

The dress was only altered by Fath in order to fit Lady Alexandra during one of her pregnancies.\nLady Alexandra Trevor-Roper, <i>Memoirs<i> (Unpublished, Private Collection)\nJohnny and I took a short holiday at Villars. It was while I was there that I got a letter from my doctor in Paris telling me that I was pregnant... When I returned to Paris I chose my summer clothes at Fath and told them that I needed skirts and dresses that could be let out as I as pregnant.  Mdme Dufy was very helpful and I chose models that could be adapted.\nCecil Beaton gift Registered Papers F/5, November 13 1971:\nI can date the grey day dress and the white taffeta evening dress with black spots exactly because I had them when I was expecting my youngest child.  He is now exactly 21.  The dresses were not altered in any way except that they could be let out.  Afterwards (my son was born at the end of Sept 1950) they were altered by Fath to fit my normal size and without charge.\nCecil Beaton gift Registered Papers F/5, October 10 1971:\nI also have a Jacques Fath day dress, Spring 1950, in different shades of grey - and I even have the hat that went with it.  The scarf round the hat needs cleaning but the dress is in very good condition.  The scarf round the hat could easily be cleaned.",

In the Beaton Registered Files (part F/5), Lady Alexandra writes (Nov 13 1971) that Fath altered the dress during her pregnancy and then again after the birth of her son.  It is possible that this dress was an an original 'model' dress, as Lady Alexandra was exactly the same size as some of Fath's house models, she would sometimes purchase these original versions to wear, and she writes:\n\"the dresses were not altered in any way except that they could be let out\".",
