Following his conversion to  Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and  writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned  classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best  remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster, in which he was responsible for much of the interior decoration. The Palace, commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, was reconstructed in the Gothic style from 1840 following a devastating fire.\n\nExotic fruits such as pineapples and pomegranites have a long history as popular artistic motifs, symbolising opulence, power and hospitality.",
