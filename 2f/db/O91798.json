Although the cowrie shell is inexpensive now, it was rare and exotic in the 16th century; a worthy addition to a princely cabinet and a splendid banquet. The silver mount added monetary value to that accorded by the marvellous nature of the shell. Unusual cutlery often functioned as conversation pieces at banquets, as the diners discussed the materials, value and make of the objects they handled. The owner's coat of arms on the spoon ensured that he was accorded the kudos due to him for the possession of such an artefact, and more prosaically prevented controversy over ownership, as it was passed around the table to be admired.",

The Couverts de l\u2019art gothique exhibition also says that mother of pearl spoons were sometimes used for special purposes, for example for taking medicine or as poison detectors, which indicates that spoons made of exotic materials were actively used. Giuliano Boggiali says that cowrie shell spoons were used for eating caviar and seafood, because of the lack of oxidisation. As with coral spoons, there are indications that cowrie-shell spoons were used on special occasions and sometimes left the display cabinet. The fact that another cowrie-shell spoon in the V&A collections has a fork attachment at the back of the spoon adds credence to the idea that cowrie-shell spoons were used on occasion, as spoons with fork attachments.  This can be seen in paintings of banquets, such as that of \u2018Lazarus and the rich man\u2019s table\u2019, 1618, by Gasper van der Hoeke (front cover of Pleasures of the Table, York 1997).\n\nOther examples of cowrie shell spoons are not numerous, however the inventory of Charlotte de Savoie, Queen of France, made in 1483, does contain a \"<font -i>cuilleur de porcelayne garnye d\u2019argent dor\u00e9</font>\", where \"<font -i>porcelayne</font>\" has been variously interpreted as either mother-of-pearl or cowrie.\n\nCowrie (in this case it is the Cypraea Tigris) comes from the coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region.",
