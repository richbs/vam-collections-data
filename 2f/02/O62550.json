The pattern mimics the compartmentalized areas filled with small-scale decoration found in Indonesian batik designs. \n\nThe craft of batik came to Europe from Indonesia via the Netherlands. It was popularised during the 1920s by practitioners such as Mme Pangon in Paris and Jessie M. King of the Glasgow School of Art. The technique involves applying wax to the textile to protect the patterned areas before placing it in a dye bath. The process can then be repeated by removing areas of wax and dyeing the exposed parts with further colours.\n\nThe firm of William Foxton Ltd., founded in 1903, produced some of the most innovative artist-designed textiles of the 1920s. It commissioned artists such as Claude Lovat Fraser, F. Gregory Brown and Minnie McLeish. In 1915 William Foxton helped to found the Design and Industries Association. The aim was to improve the standard of British industrial design by exhibiting new designs and communicating information about them to those working in the field.",
