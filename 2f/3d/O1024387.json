Drawings and inscriptions in a sketchbook he began in the summer of 1824 at the age of 19 document his intense, visionary approach to nature as he walked in the fields and woods of south east London, near to where he was born. This sketch of tree trunks exemplifies Palmer\u2019s idiosyncratic experimentation with different forms of outline as he tried out ways of drawing natural forms. He has used a range of techniques and pressures with the flexible nib of a quill pen, creating fine vertical strokes, fat circular loops and tiny dots to represent the various textures of bark.",
