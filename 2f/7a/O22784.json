Heating appliances exploiting the new form of energy had few precedents: in some cases they imitated glowing coals in a fireplace while others had the heating element in full view and could be moved around the room.\n\nConvector heaters gave greater opportunities for modern treatments: this one would appear to be designed purely functionally, with four tiers deflecting the warm air down and out. Its decorative effect is dependent not upon applied ornament but its shiny, reflective surfaces and curvilinear, streamlined form. The heater, which was produced by a phonographic equipment manufacturer, also came in cream enamel finish.\n\nChristian Barman was an influential propaganist for the Modern Movement.
