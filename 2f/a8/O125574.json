Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868\n\nHistorical significance: In the 19th century, there was a revived interest in the 17th-century Dutch imagery, which combines a direct observation of nature and such subject matter as landscapes and genre scenes particularly favoured by the 19th-century artists after the emergence of the Realist and the Romantic movements. Here the composition is strongly reminiscent of such marine painter as Ludolf Backhuysen (1630-1708) who exclusively produced marine paintings. The detailed and refined brushwork is however typical of the 19th-century artists influence by the Biedermeier imagery and high degree of finish.\nThis painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape paintings. It is not unlikely that Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist.",
