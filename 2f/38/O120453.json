He was a skilled amateur photographer and contributed to exhibitions organised by the Bengal Photographic Society.\n\nHe published his photographs in a book.

The spandrils here and in the gateways, and the angles and other important details, are laid with agates, bloodstones, jaspers, and other precious stones, combined in wreaths, scrolls, and frets which are equally beautiful in colour and exquisite in design.'",
